# Air India plane made 'mayday' call before crash: Report
**Fox News - World News:** [June 12, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gefwwVIPhiM)
*  And straight to this Fox News alert an Air India plane bound for London [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gefwwVIPhiM&t=0.0s)]
*  Crashing shortly after takeoff the Boeing 787 Dreamliner carrying at least 240 people going down in a residential area [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gefwwVIPhiM&t=5.44s)]
*  Let's give right to Greg Palcott live in London with the plane was heading Greg. What do you know? [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gefwwVIPhiM&t=12.76s)]
*  Yeah, folks. We're getting a little bit more information than since we last talked to you about 20 minutes ago [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gefwwVIPhiM&t=17.2s)]
*  From the Indian Health Ministry. They are now confirming that there are many I repeat many [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gefwwVIPhiM&t=23.080000000000002s)]
*  Killed from this incident also breakdown of the passengers [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gefwwVIPhiM&t=30.16s)]
*  They include 11 children and report on the ground that some 30 [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gefwwVIPhiM&t=34.68s)]
*  bodies [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gefwwVIPhiM&t=40.88s)]
*  30 killed were pulled from a building that was hit by the plane remains to be seen whether the [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gefwwVIPhiM&t=42.120000000000005s)]
*  Individuals are actually killed inside the building or they were extracted from the plane again a recap [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gefwwVIPhiM&t=49.0s)]
*  This is a fine perfect safe airliner. It's a Boeing 787 a Dreamliner [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gefwwVIPhiM&t=54.36s)]
*  It has never never had an accident since its inception in service in 2009 [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gefwwVIPhiM&t=61.68s)]
*  I understand the pilot the Air India pilot of the plane also has a very good record about 11,000 [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gefwwVIPhiM&t=68.0s)]
*  hour [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gefwwVIPhiM&t=76.56s)]
*  11,000 hours in the sky so on both points that's clear [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gefwwVIPhiM&t=77.72000000000001s)]
*  What is not clear is what happened shortly after he was taken off from the runway at the [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gefwwVIPhiM&t=82.68s)]
*  Ahmedabad [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gefwwVIPhiM&t=89.04s)]
*  City that's in the western part of India bound for London bound for the second biggest airport [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gefwwVIPhiM&t=90.2s)]
*  Here in the capital city the Gatwick Airport with 53 Brits on board as well as seven [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gefwwVIPhiM&t=97.84s)]
*  Portuguese and one Canadian something happened they the landing gear was still down [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gefwwVIPhiM&t=105.24s)]
*  Apparently the pilot the pilots the crew were desperately trying to fix something else [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gefwwVIPhiM&t=111.52s)]
*  There was we understand a mayday call so they knew that something was wrong [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gefwwVIPhiM&t=116.8s)]
*  And then from the amateur video that we've been seeing it's up in the air [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gefwwVIPhiM&t=122.2s)]
*  And then it just floats down and there is a large fireball where that occurs [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gefwwVIPhiM&t=126.2s)]
*  Crashing right into buildings we understand according to one report crashed into a hostel for doctors [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gefwwVIPhiM&t=133.48s)]
*  Which is an interesting situation that whole city about five million people so when you go down into a residential area [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gefwwVIPhiM&t=140.04s)]
*  That is trouble, but that's what we have now. We do have confirmation of killed. We have seen visual [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gefwwVIPhiM&t=147.2s)]
*  Confirmation that there appears to be injured being pulled from the plane as well [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gefwwVIPhiM&t=155.32s)]
*  We'll come back to you with more information back to you. Okay. Thank you so much Greg [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gefwwVIPhiM&t=159.56s)]
*  Let's bring in former NTSB investigator and aviation consultant Mike Cofield Mike. Thank you for joining us [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gefwwVIPhiM&t=164.36s)]
*  Thank you. It's a pleasure to be with you this morning under these bad circles. I know I know Mike [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gefwwVIPhiM&t=171.36s)]
*  We're showing the video that that we have been approved to show but there is some video on social media [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gefwwVIPhiM&t=176.08s)]
*  We're just getting it cleared to make sure it's actual footage from the plane crash. I'm sure you've seen some of that [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gefwwVIPhiM&t=180.48000000000002s)]
*  What do you think when you look at the video? What do you think happen? [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gefwwVIPhiM&t=185.8s)]
*  well [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gefwwVIPhiM&t=189.84s)]
*  Again, I've looked I've seen the other video and if that is factual [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gefwwVIPhiM&t=191.4s)]
*  And I know that there's concern about that, but if that's factual [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gefwwVIPhiM&t=196.6s)]
*  You're right. The gear was down. It appears that the flaps were already up which which is very [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gefwwVIPhiM&t=200.72s)]
*  Strange it would not that would not be occurring with the gear still being down and then the airplane appears to just [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gefwwVIPhiM&t=208.92000000000002s)]
*  What we call it is behind the power curve so it starts to just kind of sink [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gefwwVIPhiM&t=215.29999999999998s)]
*  We're gonna look at the black boxes at this point [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gefwwVIPhiM&t=221.1s)]
*  We're gonna see make sure that the power throttle the throttles were at full throttle [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gefwwVIPhiM&t=224.06s)]
*  We're gonna make sure too that that the engines themselves didn't shut down [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gefwwVIPhiM&t=228.29999999999998s)]
*  That also looked interesting [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gefwwVIPhiM&t=233.45999999999998s)]
*  So that's that's the initial look it's tragic in terms of the airplane was full of fuel [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gefwwVIPhiM&t=236.54s)]
*  The likelihood of [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gefwwVIPhiM&t=242.54s)]
*  survivors is pretty limited and it makes a global concern because of [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gefwwVIPhiM&t=244.38s)]
*  one where it was going and two is member of the Star Alliance and [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gefwwVIPhiM&t=249.82s)]
*  There's a couple other things too that we want to look at also, but quick question [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gefwwVIPhiM&t=255.66s)]
*  When it comes to planes, we always focus on the pilot and the aircraft. What about the airports? [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gefwwVIPhiM&t=260.62s)]
*  I mean, what about the airports with their maintenance crew and their ability to detect any potential problems? [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gefwwVIPhiM&t=266.58s)]
*  Do we look at reputations there? [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gefwwVIPhiM&t=272.26s)]
*  Absolutely, that's a great. That's it Brian. That's a great question [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gefwwVIPhiM&t=275.5s)]
*  They will we will they'll start looking this morning at [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gefwwVIPhiM&t=279.38s)]
*  Where the airplane has been who touched it and who was around it and who had access to it? [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gefwwVIPhiM&t=282.78s)]
*  So that's maintenance flight crews [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gefwwVIPhiM&t=288.65999999999997s)]
*  caterers [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gefwwVIPhiM&t=291.34s)]
*  And anyone else that might have been around the aircraft as we as we all know [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gefwwVIPhiM&t=292.53999999999996s)]
*  The tension between India and Pakistan has been high [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gefwwVIPhiM&t=298.46s)]
*  They'll look at that though the president's briefing. He would not have gotten it this morning yet [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gefwwVIPhiM&t=302.7s)]
*  Tulsi would have already received an update from the State Department [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gefwwVIPhiM&t=309.09999999999997s)]
*  Ops Center and also over at the Pentagon and Central Command the president has probably now been briefed [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gefwwVIPhiM&t=313.86s)]
*  I do know for a fact that Sean Duffy's been briefed this morning already [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gefwwVIPhiM&t=320.26s)]
*  These are things that and that the Star Alliance deal is that United would have been involved in terms of their Ops Center has received [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gefwwVIPhiM&t=324.38s)]
*  Information they're sending out notices to the all the crews internationally this morning check configuration [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gefwwVIPhiM&t=332.06s)]
*  Check safety and check security and that's reassuring for the American public [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gefwwVIPhiM&t=338.65999999999997s)]
*  So Mike we hear this all the time for those of us that travel that they're doing a safety check before they take off [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gefwwVIPhiM&t=344.1s)]
*  To complete a safety check and then a minute in have the Mayday call. Does that concern you? [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gefwwVIPhiM&t=350.53999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gefwwVIPhiM&t=358.66s)]
*  I've got about 22,000 hours with United and so one of the things you do is [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gefwwVIPhiM&t=360.5s)]
*  Here's a checklist right you're and the reason you use checklists is you want to make sure that you break any chains in [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gefwwVIPhiM&t=366.46000000000004s)]
*  the in the decision process that could lead to an accident and so [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gefwwVIPhiM&t=372.54s)]
*  The checklist for taxi the checklist for before takeoff one of the items on the before takeoff checklist on this on all the Boeing products is [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gefwwVIPhiM&t=377.3s)]
*  Flat configuration right? So you're looking at that [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gefwwVIPhiM&t=386.58s)]
*  You're looking at all the engine instruments as you get on the runway and going down the road [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gefwwVIPhiM&t=389.5s)]
*  You're the first officer and then captain and in this case probably an international relief officer [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gefwwVIPhiM&t=394.41999999999996s)]
*  They are looking at all the engine instruments a Mayday right after takeoff [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gefwwVIPhiM&t=401.7s)]
*  is [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gefwwVIPhiM&t=407.26s)]
*  Very concerning and so on all those levels maintenance [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gefwwVIPhiM&t=408.65999999999997s)]
*  Mechanics who had access to the plane and [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gefwwVIPhiM&t=413.34s)]
*  Of course, they're gonna look at the black box, which I believe they found one of them already [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gefwwVIPhiM&t=416.65999999999997s)]
*  They'll request the Indian government and the British government will request because it's a Boeing product and because of [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gefwwVIPhiM&t=421.65999999999997s)]
*  The nature of the alliance between carriers airlines [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gefwwVIPhiM&t=431.26s)]
*  They'll ask the NTSB and Boeing to participate [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gefwwVIPhiM&t=434.85999999999996s)]
*  so Mike so many of us fly often and [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gefwwVIPhiM&t=437.73999999999995s)]
*  We're concerned we've seen all these crashes lately [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gefwwVIPhiM&t=441.7s)]
*  What can you tell us about the planes that we're getting on? [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gefwwVIPhiM&t=444.58s)]
*  How old is the average plane and how often do they have maintenance where they completely take it all apart and rebuild it? [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gefwwVIPhiM&t=447.46s)]
*  Well, that's um, so let me try to unpackage it [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gefwwVIPhiM&t=455.26s)]
*  So every time I got every time the captain gets on the airplane, he does a walk around in the airplane [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gefwwVIPhiM&t=458.62s)]
*  He's looking at everything on the outside and then they get inside the cockpit and they're looking and doing testing of all of the internal [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gefwwVIPhiM&t=464.62s)]
*  Process and they run a diagnostic before the airplane even moves [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gefwwVIPhiM&t=472.22s)]
*  every night there's what's called a [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gefwwVIPhiM&t=477.02000000000004s)]
*  Check and then every so many hours or landings or what they call cycles [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gefwwVIPhiM&t=479.82000000000005s)]
*  The airplanes brought out of service and it's either completely gone over [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gefwwVIPhiM&t=485.70000000000005s)]
*  Where they actually go through the engines take the engines off all sorts of different diagnostics [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gefwwVIPhiM&t=490.94s)]
*  So in the united states and with airlines that are part of Ikea, which is the international [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gefwwVIPhiM&t=497.90000000000003s)]
*  aviation [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gefwwVIPhiM&t=504.2s)]
*  commercial organization [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gefwwVIPhiM&t=505.58000000000004s)]
*  Uh that the you and that we all participate in [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gefwwVIPhiM&t=507.1s)]
*  They're looking at all these things this morning. And again, I [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gefwwVIPhiM&t=510.54s)]
*  The good news for us in here in the united states is that they're going to send out a notice to crews [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gefwwVIPhiM&t=514.62s)]
*  Um globally on the us carriers this morning. They'll say check configurations check [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gefwwVIPhiM&t=520.0600000000001s)]
*  Do security and safety checks again? [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gefwwVIPhiM&t=527.1800000000001s)]
*  And and that'll be really important. And of course the u.s government at state pentagon and tulsi at national security council [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gefwwVIPhiM&t=530.14s)]
*  Where I also work they're gonna they're gonna make sure that that's that they're talking with their counterparts globally [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gefwwVIPhiM&t=538.94s)]
*  Got it. All right. Thanks so much. Appreciate it. We'll watch this on phone. My thanks mike [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gefwwVIPhiM&t=545.42s)]
