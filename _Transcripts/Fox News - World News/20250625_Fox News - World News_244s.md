# Trump confronts 'fake news CNN' at NATO summit
**Fox News - World News:** [June 25, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddMHvdfOVCQ)
*  Yes, please go ahead. Go ahead. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddMHvdfOVCQ&t=0.0s)]
*  Oh, fake news, CNN? [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddMHvdfOVCQ&t=7.6000000000000005s)]
*  Oh, yeah, yeah, here we go. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddMHvdfOVCQ&t=9.200000000000001s)]
*  When did you hear this question? [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddMHvdfOVCQ&t=11.24s)]
*  You should really say how great our soldiers and our warriors are. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddMHvdfOVCQ&t=13.24s)]
*  I think everyone appreciates our soldiers and our warriors. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddMHvdfOVCQ&t=17.72s)]
*  I do have two questions for you, Mr. President. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddMHvdfOVCQ&t=19.88s)]
*  You just cited Israeli intelligence on these attacks. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddMHvdfOVCQ&t=22.080000000000002s)]
*  Earlier you said U.S. intelligence was inconclusive. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddMHvdfOVCQ&t=26.080000000000002s)]
*  Are you relying on Israeli intelligence for your assessment of the impact of the strikes? [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddMHvdfOVCQ&t=29.28s)]
*  No, this is also, Iran made the statement, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddMHvdfOVCQ&t=34.08s)]
*  and it's also, if you read the document that was given, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddMHvdfOVCQ&t=36.68s)]
*  that Pete can talk about if you'd like, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddMHvdfOVCQ&t=39.88s)]
*  the document said it could be very severe damage, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddMHvdfOVCQ&t=42.08s)]
*  but they didn't take that. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddMHvdfOVCQ&t=46.0s)]
*  They said it could be limited or it could be very severe. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddMHvdfOVCQ&t=47.32s)]
*  They really didn't know other than to say it could be limited or it could be very, very severe. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddMHvdfOVCQ&t=49.84s)]
*  And you didn't choose to put that because it was very early after. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddMHvdfOVCQ&t=55.480000000000004s)]
*  Since then, we've collected additional intelligence. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddMHvdfOVCQ&t=59.08s)]
*  We've also spoken to people who have seen the site, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddMHvdfOVCQ&t=62.0s)]
*  and the site is obliterated. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddMHvdfOVCQ&t=64.8s)]
*  And we think everything nuclear is down there. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddMHvdfOVCQ&t=67.72s)]
*  They didn't take it out. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddMHvdfOVCQ&t=70.16s)]
*  Okay, question? [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddMHvdfOVCQ&t=71.72s)]
*  Please, go ahead. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddMHvdfOVCQ&t=72.92s)]
*  Go ahead. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddMHvdfOVCQ&t=75.16s)]
*  Yeah, blue dress. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddMHvdfOVCQ&t=75.96000000000001s)]
*  Thank you so much, Mr. President. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddMHvdfOVCQ&t=77.72s)]
*  Yesterday, you said China can now continue to purchase oil from Iran. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddMHvdfOVCQ&t=79.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddMHvdfOVCQ&t=84.28s)]
*  Are you giving up on your maximum pressure campaign? [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddMHvdfOVCQ&t=84.64s)]
*  Because there are sanctions right now. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddMHvdfOVCQ&t=88.28s)]
*  With who? [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddMHvdfOVCQ&t=89.88s)]
*  On Iran. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddMHvdfOVCQ&t=90.44s)]
*  No, look, they just had a war. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddMHvdfOVCQ&t=91.52s)]
*  The war was fought. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddMHvdfOVCQ&t=94.32s)]
*  They fought it bravely. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddMHvdfOVCQ&t=95.36s)]
*  I'm not giving up. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddMHvdfOVCQ&t=97.03999999999999s)]
*  They're in the oil business. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddMHvdfOVCQ&t=98.28s)]
*  I mean, I could stop it if I wanted. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddMHvdfOVCQ&t=99.52s)]
*  I could sell China the oil myself. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddMHvdfOVCQ&t=102.08s)]
*  I don't want to do that. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddMHvdfOVCQ&t=103.67999999999999s)]
*  They're going to need money to put that country back into shape. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddMHvdfOVCQ&t=105.08s)]
*  We want to see that happen. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddMHvdfOVCQ&t=107.8s)]
*  Would it? [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddMHvdfOVCQ&t=110.0s)]
*  No, if they're going to sell oil, they're going to sell oil. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddMHvdfOVCQ&t=110.64s)]
*  We're not taking over the oil. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddMHvdfOVCQ&t=113.19999999999999s)]
*  We could have, you know. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddMHvdfOVCQ&t=114.36s)]
*  I used to say with Iraq, keep the oil. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddMHvdfOVCQ&t=115.39999999999999s)]
*  I could say it here, too. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddMHvdfOVCQ&t=117.16s)]
*  We could have kept the oil. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddMHvdfOVCQ&t=118.16s)]
*  Now, China is going to want to buy oil. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddMHvdfOVCQ&t=120.36s)]
*  They can buy it from us. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddMHvdfOVCQ&t=123.08s)]
*  They can buy it from other people. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddMHvdfOVCQ&t=124.16s)]
*  But you're going to have to put that country back into shape. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddMHvdfOVCQ&t=126.28s)]
*  Desperately needs money. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddMHvdfOVCQ&t=129.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddMHvdfOVCQ&t=130.76s)]
*  Mr. President. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddMHvdfOVCQ&t=131.28s)]
*  Yeah, please. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddMHvdfOVCQ&t=132.24s)]
*  Here we go. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddMHvdfOVCQ&t=136.35999999999999s)]
*  I'm picking the beauties today. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddMHvdfOVCQ&t=138.0s)]
*  Go ahead. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddMHvdfOVCQ&t=140.2s)]
*  Mr. President, Secretary General Ruta [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddMHvdfOVCQ&t=141.16s)]
*  has described President Putin as an adversary, a threat, an enemy. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddMHvdfOVCQ&t=143.8s)]
*  Do you view him the same way? [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddMHvdfOVCQ&t=149.64000000000001s)]
*  And in addition to that, you mentioned General [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddMHvdfOVCQ&t=151.64000000000001s)]
*  Kaine, your Chief of Staff, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddMHvdfOVCQ&t=153.56s)]
*  of Staff. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddMHvdfOVCQ&t=158.76000000000002s)]
*  General Kaine. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddMHvdfOVCQ&t=159.28s)]
*  Yes. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddMHvdfOVCQ&t=160.08s)]
*  He has said that Mr. Putin has territorial ambitions [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddMHvdfOVCQ&t=160.60000000000002s)]
*  beyond Ukraine. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddMHvdfOVCQ&t=165.60000000000002s)]
*  Do you view that in the same way? [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddMHvdfOVCQ&t=167.0s)]
*  It's possible. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddMHvdfOVCQ&t=168.4s)]
*  I mean, it's possible. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddMHvdfOVCQ&t=168.88000000000002s)]
*  I know one thing. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddMHvdfOVCQ&t=170.20000000000002s)]
*  He'd like to settle. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddMHvdfOVCQ&t=170.96s)]
*  He'd like to get out of this thing. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddMHvdfOVCQ&t=171.88000000000002s)]
*  It's a mess for him. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddMHvdfOVCQ&t=173.2s)]
*  He called the other day. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddMHvdfOVCQ&t=175.32s)]
*  He said, can I help you with Iran? [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddMHvdfOVCQ&t=176.48s)]
*  I said, no, you can help me with Russia. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddMHvdfOVCQ&t=178.83999999999997s)]
*  Because in the last few weeks, we took care of India and Pakistan, Kosovo, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddMHvdfOVCQ&t=181.64s)]
*  Serbia. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddMHvdfOVCQ&t=187.83999999999997s)]
*  I think on Friday we have coming in, the Congo is coming in, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddMHvdfOVCQ&t=189.44s)]
*  and Rwanda is coming in. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddMHvdfOVCQ&t=194.23999999999998s)]
*  That was a vicious war that went on, a machete war. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddMHvdfOVCQ&t=195.6s)]
*  Heads chopped off all over Africa. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddMHvdfOVCQ&t=198.83999999999997s)]
*  They're coming in. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddMHvdfOVCQ&t=201.83999999999997s)]
*  We did two others. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddMHvdfOVCQ&t=203.16s)]
*  In addition to that, nobody's ever done anything like this. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddMHvdfOVCQ&t=206.0s)]
*  No, I consider him a person that's, I think, been misguided. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddMHvdfOVCQ&t=210.07999999999998s)]
*  I'm very surprised, actually. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddMHvdfOVCQ&t=215.96s)]
*  I thought we would have had that settled easier. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddMHvdfOVCQ&t=217.88s)]
*  I've settled four of them in the meantime. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddMHvdfOVCQ&t=220.4s)]
*  But he did call up. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddMHvdfOVCQ&t=222.2s)]
*  But he said, he's close to Iran. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddMHvdfOVCQ&t=223.07999999999998s)]
*  He'd like to help us get a settlement. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddMHvdfOVCQ&t=226.07999999999998s)]
*  I said, no, no. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddMHvdfOVCQ&t=227.96s)]
*  You help me get a settlement with you, with Russia. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddMHvdfOVCQ&t=229.07999999999998s)]
*  And I think we're going to be doing that, too. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddMHvdfOVCQ&t=231.96s)]
*  I'm Steve Ducey. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddMHvdfOVCQ&t=234.04000000000002s)]
