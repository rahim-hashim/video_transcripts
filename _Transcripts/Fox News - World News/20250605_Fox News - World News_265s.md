# This was a biological weapons attack against us: Gordon Chang
**Fox News - World News:** [June 05, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6fj5nD5b7Y)
*  Today, a bail hearing set for one of the Chinese nationals suspected of smuggling a dangerous [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6fj5nD5b7Y&t=0.0s)]
*  biological pathogen into the U.S. considered a potential agro-terrorism weapon. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6fj5nD5b7Y&t=7.92s)]
*  Her partner is believed to still be in China, as the couple has been charged with conspiracy, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6fj5nD5b7Y&t=14.16s)]
*  smuggling and fraud. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6fj5nD5b7Y&t=18.44s)]
*  Yates Stone Institute senior fellow Gordon Chang joins me now. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6fj5nD5b7Y&t=19.72s)]
*  Gordon, the suspect is described as a, quote, communist party loyalist and researcher at [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6fj5nD5b7Y&t=23.400000000000002s)]
*  the University of Michigan. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6fj5nD5b7Y&t=28.94s)]
*  To me, those words should never be in the same sentence. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6fj5nD5b7Y&t=30.740000000000002s)]
*  Why are American universities harboring the enemy, often throughout our nation, in the [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6fj5nD5b7Y&t=34.46s)]
*  name of research? [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6fj5nD5b7Y&t=40.660000000000004s)]
*  Because the universities make a lot of money from China, you know, through students, through [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6fj5nD5b7Y&t=44.06s)]
*  other ways, contributions. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6fj5nD5b7Y&t=48.260000000000005s)]
*  And that's why we have these very disturbing ties between American institutions of higher [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6fj5nD5b7Y&t=51.02s)]
*  learning and China. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6fj5nD5b7Y&t=56.84s)]
*  And we need to break that, because obviously the dangers are becoming, they are there, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6fj5nD5b7Y&t=58.6s)]
*  as we see with this fungus case. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6fj5nD5b7Y&t=63.660000000000004s)]
*  For every one of these foreign agents that we catch, Gordon, how many more are roaming [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6fj5nD5b7Y&t=66.24000000000001s)]
*  among us and, quite frankly, clearly trying to destroy us from within? [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6fj5nD5b7Y&t=70.94s)]
*  There are so many. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6fj5nD5b7Y&t=77.76s)]
*  And it's not just the researchers. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6fj5nD5b7Y&t=78.76s)]
*  Remember, there are Chinese consular officials and Ministry of State Security agents on our [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6fj5nD5b7Y&t=81.12s)]
*  soil, and they've been operating in ways that violate our laws and that are inconsistent [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6fj5nD5b7Y&t=87.2s)]
*  with the Vienna Convention. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6fj5nD5b7Y&t=91.88000000000001s)]
*  But the story here is that this has been going on for a very long time, Todd. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6fj5nD5b7Y&t=93.60000000000001s)]
*  We know what's going on. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6fj5nD5b7Y&t=97.84s)]
*  We have the means to stop it. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6fj5nD5b7Y&t=99.2s)]
*  So it's on us. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6fj5nD5b7Y&t=100.64s)]
*  And that's why it's important to break these connections now, to show China that we will [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6fj5nD5b7Y&t=102.56s)]
*  no longer tolerate this behavior. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6fj5nD5b7Y&t=106.28s)]
*  I mean, so much of this, yes, can be blamed on President Biden and his open border policies. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6fj5nD5b7Y&t=108.72s)]
*  But to your point, this was happening well before that, well before Joe Biden opened [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6fj5nD5b7Y&t=114.44s)]
*  up our borders to every nation. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6fj5nD5b7Y&t=121.0s)]
*  And so the fact of the matter is we haven't stopped it still. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6fj5nD5b7Y&t=123.0s)]
*  And that makes no sense because we know what's happening. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6fj5nD5b7Y&t=126.32s)]
*  We've heard the warnings from you over years, decades even. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6fj5nD5b7Y&t=128.8s)]
*  It's disturbing that it hasn't been stopped. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6fj5nD5b7Y&t=132.64s)]
*  Meantime, I want to get your thoughts on this. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6fj5nD5b7Y&t=134.4s)]
*  President Trump and Xi Jinping, the phone call between them is expected this week. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6fj5nD5b7Y&t=136.44s)]
*  But a fundamental question to you, Gordon, should we even be having talks with the country [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6fj5nD5b7Y&t=140.64s)]
*  that is actively trying to attack us like we just discussed? [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6fj5nD5b7Y&t=144.92s)]
*  Clearly not. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6fj5nD5b7Y&t=149.88s)]
*  You know, this case in University of Michigan, this was a biological weapons attack on the [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6fj5nD5b7Y&t=150.88s)]
*  United States and attempt to blight our agriculture, specifically barley, grain, rice, all the [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6fj5nD5b7Y&t=155.51999999999998s)]
*  rest of it. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6fj5nD5b7Y&t=162.72s)]
*  And this has been going on for at least a half decade because in 2020, Americans in [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6fj5nD5b7Y&t=163.83999999999997s)]
*  all 50 states received from China unsolicited seeds. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6fj5nD5b7Y&t=168.44s)]
*  And that's an attempt to plant these invasive species. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6fj5nD5b7Y&t=172.68s)]
*  So first of all, this woman shouldn't get bail at all. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6fj5nD5b7Y&t=176.0s)]
*  She should be sent to Guantanamo. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6fj5nD5b7Y&t=178.6s)]
*  But the point here is that we shouldn't be talking to a regime that is actively taking [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6fj5nD5b7Y&t=180.44s)]
*  our country down. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6fj5nD5b7Y&t=185.24s)]
*  And this is not just the fungus. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6fj5nD5b7Y&t=186.8s)]
*  This is fentanyl. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6fj5nD5b7Y&t=188.76s)]
*  This is covid. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6fj5nD5b7Y&t=189.88s)]
*  This is all the rest of it. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6fj5nD5b7Y&t=190.96s)]
*  This has to stop. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6fj5nD5b7Y&t=192.92000000000002s)]
*  I think you make an important point. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6fj5nD5b7Y&t=194.6s)]
*  But that said, it does appear that there will be trade talks. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6fj5nD5b7Y&t=196.48s)]
*  My question for you is, will they lead to an agreement? [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6fj5nD5b7Y&t=200.38s)]
*  And if they do lead to an agreement, will Xi Jinping and China honor that agreement? [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6fj5nD5b7Y&t=203.24s)]
*  Yeah, the Chinese are stalling. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6fj5nD5b7Y&t=207.68s)]
*  They want more time beyond the 90 day clause that was declared on May 12th. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6fj5nD5b7Y&t=210.68s)]
*  China always does this. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6fj5nD5b7Y&t=216.68s)]
*  Yeah, there might be agreement eventually if we cave in. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6fj5nD5b7Y&t=218.28s)]
*  But no, there shouldn't be an agreement. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6fj5nD5b7Y&t=222.12s)]
*  And I don't think Xi Jinping is going to honor it. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6fj5nD5b7Y&t=224.07999999999998s)]
*  Xi's lost a lot of influence and control recently. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6fj5nD5b7Y&t=226.36s)]
*  He may not have the authority to deal because there are even rumors that he might be deposed [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6fj5nD5b7Y&t=229.64000000000001s)]
*  this summer. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6fj5nD5b7Y&t=234.28s)]
*  I actually don't think that's the case. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6fj5nD5b7Y&t=235.28s)]
*  But nonetheless, we know that there are a lot of civilian and military officials at [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6fj5nD5b7Y&t=237.32000000000002s)]
*  the top of the Communist Party that don't want him exercising any sort of power. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6fj5nD5b7Y&t=241.84s)]
*  Gordon Chang, a clear minded and important analysis for us this morning. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6fj5nD5b7Y&t=247.16000000000003s)]
