# Israel’s fight against Iran going ‘incredibly well’: Former Israeli PM
**Fox News - World News:** [June 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVUmRjN-9FA)
*  President Trump says you'll make a decision on whether or not the U.S. will join the fight [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVUmRjN-9FA&t=0.0s)]
*  alongside Israel targeting Iranian nuclear sites. Joining me now from Israel, former [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVUmRjN-9FA&t=5.5200000000000005s)]
*  Prime Minister of Israel Naftali Bennett. Mr. Bennett, welcome. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVUmRjN-9FA&t=10.56s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVUmRjN-9FA&t=15.6s)]
*  What is your assessment of how the Israeli military has performed in this conflict with [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVUmRjN-9FA&t=16.6s)]
*  the Iranian regime? [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVUmRjN-9FA&t=20.8s)]
*  It's going incredibly well. We have been constantly peeling off more and more military, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVUmRjN-9FA&t=23.64s)]
*  nuclear, and terror assets of Iran on Iranian soil. We've totally taken out the air defenses [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVUmRjN-9FA&t=31.48s)]
*  of Iran, so Iran right now is vulnerable and we're roaming the skies. We're focused only [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVUmRjN-9FA&t=39.6s)]
*  on military and regime-related assets, of course not on civilians in any way possible. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVUmRjN-9FA&t=45.72s)]
*  It's going very well. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVUmRjN-9FA&t=52.52s)]
*  President Trump, sounds like he wants to give diplomacy one last chance. Let's play him [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVUmRjN-9FA&t=53.720000000000006s)]
*  and I'll get you to response her. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVUmRjN-9FA&t=58.440000000000005s)]
*  We're ready, willing, and able, and we've been speaking to Iran and we'll see what happens. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVUmRjN-9FA&t=61.36s)]
*  Mr. President, what was the thought process behind two week time table? [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVUmRjN-9FA&t=65.80000000000001s)]
*  Just time to see whether or not people come to their senses. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVUmRjN-9FA&t=71.80000000000001s)]
*  Do you have any sense the Iranian regime wants a diplomatic solution? [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVUmRjN-9FA&t=76.0s)]
*  It doesn't seem so, but I think President Trump's approach is absolutely correct from [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVUmRjN-9FA&t=81.36s)]
*  his perspective. He's exhausting the negotiation approach and Iran would have to give up its [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVUmRjN-9FA&t=86.48s)]
*  nuclear ambitions, its ballistic missiles ambitions, and stop fomenting terror in the [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVUmRjN-9FA&t=93.88s)]
*  area and just go and become a regular country that doesn't look to terrorize the world. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVUmRjN-9FA&t=99.32s)]
*  That in essence would be a fundamental change of the Islamic Republic of Iran, whose very [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVUmRjN-9FA&t=106.12s)]
*  modus operandi, or I would say raison d'etre, is to turn the world into a big Islamic Republic. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVUmRjN-9FA&t=113.48s)]
*  So it's very tough for them to give up on that. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVUmRjN-9FA&t=120.48s)]
*  We know the US B-2 stealth bombers are on the move from Missouri to Guam. We also know [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVUmRjN-9FA&t=122.96000000000001s)]
*  President Trump is coming back to the White House for a meeting with his national security [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVUmRjN-9FA&t=128.56s)]
*  team later today. Your reaction to the latest developments on that front? [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVUmRjN-9FA&t=132.6s)]
*  Well I think Iran has been a very fierce terror enemy to the United States. It kidnapped and [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVUmRjN-9FA&t=138.96s)]
*  hijacked the embassy in 79. It killed many marines in 1982. It killed Americans across [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVUmRjN-9FA&t=147.51999999999998s)]
*  the world throughout the decades. And of course it killed hundreds of American soldiers in [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVUmRjN-9FA&t=154.68s)]
*  Iraq using Iranian technology, those roadside bombs. And it tried to kill Trump. So this [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVUmRjN-9FA&t=161.68s)]
*  is a huge enemy. Right now, as you know, Israel is not calling on America to do anything. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVUmRjN-9FA&t=169.68s)]
*  We're not telling America to act other than its own national security interests. And I [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVUmRjN-9FA&t=175.68s)]
*  can tell you one more thing. This is a battle of wills between the Iranian regime and the [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVUmRjN-9FA&t=183.20000000000002s)]
*  Israeli people. Our strength is ongoing. We've been in this country for about 3,700 years. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVUmRjN-9FA&t=188.52s)]
*  So we're patient. If it takes another day, another week, another several weeks, we've [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVUmRjN-9FA&t=197.32s)]
*  got all the patience in the world. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVUmRjN-9FA&t=202.44s)]
*  If the president decides to stay out for now, is there an option to take out the Fordo facility [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVUmRjN-9FA&t=204.96s)]
*  using Israeli commandos? [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVUmRjN-9FA&t=211.48s)]
*  I don't want to get into operational plans. I will say that as the war progresses, new [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVUmRjN-9FA&t=215.24s)]
*  opportunities present themselves. And certainly I'm not going to give any detail on that. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVUmRjN-9FA&t=222.32s)]
*  Fair enough. Okay, your Prime Minister Netanyahu has said the fall of the Iranian regime is [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVUmRjN-9FA&t=226.6s)]
*  not the goal, but could be a result. Can there be peace with Ayatollah Khamenei still in [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVUmRjN-9FA&t=231.48s)]
*  charge? [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVUmRjN-9FA&t=237.76s)]
*  I don't think there can be peace with a guy whose very fundamental goal is to kill you [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVUmRjN-9FA&t=240.36s)]
*  and me, your nation, the big Satan, America, and my nation, the small Satan, in his words, [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVUmRjN-9FA&t=246.64000000000001s)]
*  Israel. So there's not going to be peace with him. But as you correctly stated, this is [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVUmRjN-9FA&t=252.16000000000003s)]
*  not one of our goals, the regime change. If it would happen, we'd all be thrilled. It [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVUmRjN-9FA&t=260.44s)]
*  would be a wonderful thing, but it's not an explicit goal of this operation. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVUmRjN-9FA&t=265.36s)]
*  Israel's Iron Dome defense system has been tested in this conflict. Do you worry about [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVUmRjN-9FA&t=269.68s)]
*  running low on interceptors? [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVUmRjN-9FA&t=275.15999999999997s)]
*  We have many layers of defense. We have the Iron Dome, we have David's Sling, we have [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVUmRjN-9FA&t=279.2s)]
*  the Arrow, we have laser technology, and we have good behavior of the citizens who stay [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVUmRjN-9FA&t=284.56s)]
*  in shelters during attacks. And therefore, compared to the barrage of missiles that have [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVUmRjN-9FA&t=291.14s)]
*  been hurled towards us, the relative amount of deaths is low, relatively. It's high, absolutely. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVUmRjN-9FA&t=296.64s)]
*  We're talking about roughly 30 Israelis that have been killed in every life, as a whole [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVUmRjN-9FA&t=304.15999999999997s)]
*  life. But we're performing well here. And as I said, we have more resolve than the Iranian, [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVUmRjN-9FA&t=308.91999999999996s)]
*  the regime of the Islamic Republic, being a nation that's been here for 3,800 years. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVUmRjN-9FA&t=316.88s)]
*  For Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett, sir, thank you very much for your time. I [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVUmRjN-9FA&t=323.24s)]
*  can imagine you're extremely busy. My best to you and your people. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVUmRjN-9FA&t=327.72s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVUmRjN-9FA&t=332.48s)]
