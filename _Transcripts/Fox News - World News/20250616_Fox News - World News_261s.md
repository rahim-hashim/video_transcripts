# Israel could have more ‘tricks up its sleeve,’ GOP senator warns
**Fox News - World News:** [June 16, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UgYo2Dzc2v0)
*  All right, this is a Fox News alert. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UgYo2Dzc2v0&t=0.0s)]
*  Back to our top story of the night, President Donald Trump calling on Iranian civilians [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UgYo2Dzc2v0&t=3.0s)]
*  to, quote, immediately evacuate Tehran. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UgYo2Dzc2v0&t=7.36s)]
*  Aron Lawrence-Jones reporting that the president has requested that the NSC be prepared in [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UgYo2Dzc2v0&t=10.0s)]
*  the Situation Room when he returns to Washington sometime early this morning. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UgYo2Dzc2v0&t=16.32s)]
*  Here with more is Arkansas Senator Tom Cotton. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UgYo2Dzc2v0&t=20.48s)]
*  When he says they should evacuate Tehran now, how do you interpret that, Senator? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UgYo2Dzc2v0&t=24.38s)]
*  I know how I interpret it. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UgYo2Dzc2v0&t=30.619999999999997s)]
*  Well, Sean, I think it, one, reflects President Trump's concern for innocent civilian life. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UgYo2Dzc2v0&t=32.66s)]
*  Iran has terrorized the United States and Israel and the civilized world since 1979. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UgYo2Dzc2v0&t=39.34s)]
*  That's the real forever war. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UgYo2Dzc2v0&t=44.980000000000004s)]
*  But they've also terrorized their own people. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UgYo2Dzc2v0&t=46.980000000000004s)]
*  The Iranian people have been the victims of the Iranian revolution for 46 years, and [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UgYo2Dzc2v0&t=48.62s)]
*  their government has placed key military sites throughout the capital. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UgYo2Dzc2v0&t=55.059999999999995s)]
*  President Trump, just like Prime Minister Netanyahu, does not want to see innocent Iranian [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UgYo2Dzc2v0&t=59.26s)]
*  civilians harmed. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UgYo2Dzc2v0&t=62.98s)]
*  That's why the Israeli Defense Forces give them advance notice before they strike. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UgYo2Dzc2v0&t=64.34s)]
*  That's the difference between Israel and the United States on the one hand and Iran, which [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UgYo2Dzc2v0&t=68.62s)]
*  intentionally targets residential neighborhoods to slaughter women and children, just like [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UgYo2Dzc2v0&t=73.1s)]
*  it's intentionally targeted Americans to include American soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UgYo2Dzc2v0&t=77.96s)]
*  to kill them and to terrorize them. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UgYo2Dzc2v0&t=83.72s)]
*  It seems like we're on the precipice of eliminating the nuclear capability and nuclear program [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UgYo2Dzc2v0&t=87.36s)]
*  forever and them being, of course, the number one state sponsor of terror. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UgYo2Dzc2v0&t=92.44s)]
*  They may need a joint operation to do so. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UgYo2Dzc2v0&t=97.52s)]
*  What are your thoughts on that? [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UgYo2Dzc2v0&t=99.89999999999999s)]
*  Well, I think President Trump is right not to rule out any option and to maintain flexibility [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UgYo2Dzc2v0&t=101.39999999999999s)]
*  while we back Israel to the hilt. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UgYo2Dzc2v0&t=107.75999999999999s)]
*  Your right, Sean, that the key objective here is to eliminate Iran's nuclear weapons program [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UgYo2Dzc2v0&t=110.32s)]
*  and their ability to enrich uranium. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UgYo2Dzc2v0&t=115.75999999999999s)]
*  Secondary objective, of course, is to eliminate their ballistic missile threat to Israel and [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UgYo2Dzc2v0&t=118.28s)]
*  to our troops in the region. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UgYo2Dzc2v0&t=122.0s)]
*  And ultimately, within just a few short years, the United States on the trajectory they were [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UgYo2Dzc2v0&t=123.19999999999999s)]
*  on. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UgYo2Dzc2v0&t=128.04s)]
*  I don't know exactly how we're going to close those uranium enrichment sites, but I know [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UgYo2Dzc2v0&t=129.56s)]
*  they're going to have to be closed one way or the other. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UgYo2Dzc2v0&t=135.56s)]
*  And anything less would be a disappointing and inconclusive outcome. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UgYo2Dzc2v0&t=138.36s)]
*  My understanding is that two of them are pretty much taken out. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UgYo2Dzc2v0&t=142.24s)]
*  I'm sure there's probably got to be work to be done to contain maybe some fallout in terms [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UgYo2Dzc2v0&t=146.84s)]
*  of radiation. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UgYo2Dzc2v0&t=152.4s)]
*  They do have the one facility, what, three miles underground that would probably need [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UgYo2Dzc2v0&t=154.22s)]
*  either bunker buster bombs or be a tactical nuke to take it out. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UgYo2Dzc2v0&t=157.92000000000002s)]
*  I would not put it past the Israelis to do that. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UgYo2Dzc2v0&t=164.4s)]
*  Your thoughts on that? [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UgYo2Dzc2v0&t=167.24s)]
*  Well, I certainly don't think they would want to. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UgYo2Dzc2v0&t=168.24s)]
*  I wouldn't think that's their plan A, B or C. I would also say, though, that the United [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UgYo2Dzc2v0&t=172.44s)]
*  States was not aware of Israel seeding beepers and radios into Lebanon, Lebanese Hezbollah's [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UgYo2Dzc2v0&t=179.0s)]
*  leadership and killing many of them last year or the drone operations that Assad launched [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UgYo2Dzc2v0&t=186.16s)]
*  from inside of Iran. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UgYo2Dzc2v0&t=191.70000000000002s)]
*  So if the ayatollahs think that Israel doesn't have any more tricks up its sleeve or any [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UgYo2Dzc2v0&t=193.76s)]
*  more cards to play when it comes to these deep underground sites, I think they might [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UgYo2Dzc2v0&t=199.04s)]
*  want to think again, given the ingenuity, bravery and audacity we've seen from the [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UgYo2Dzc2v0&t=203.79999999999998s)]
*  Israeli Defense Forces and the Mossad over the last few months. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UgYo2Dzc2v0&t=208.6s)]
*  Well, there are other options, too. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UgYo2Dzc2v0&t=212.07999999999998s)]
*  As of now, the Israelis have not taken out their power grid, which would be very easy [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UgYo2Dzc2v0&t=214.32s)]
*  to do. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UgYo2Dzc2v0&t=218.76s)]
*  They own the skies. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UgYo2Dzc2v0&t=219.76s)]
*  They've not taken out their ability to make money. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UgYo2Dzc2v0&t=220.76s)]
*  That could obviously be leverage or not. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UgYo2Dzc2v0&t=223.24s)]
*  We have about 20 seconds. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UgYo2Dzc2v0&t=225.60000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, that's right, Sean. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UgYo2Dzc2v0&t=226.60000000000002s)]
*  Any of those key infrastructure. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UgYo2Dzc2v0&t=229.8s)]
*  But Israel doesn't want to do that. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UgYo2Dzc2v0&t=231.56s)]
*  Israel wants to eliminate their nuclear weapons program and their ballistic missiles. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UgYo2Dzc2v0&t=233.56s)]
*  It wants to cause as little civilian harm as possible. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UgYo2Dzc2v0&t=236.72s)]
*  That's the exact opposite of the terror regime in Iran. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UgYo2Dzc2v0&t=239.32000000000002s)]
*  And the world would be better off and safer. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UgYo2Dzc2v0&t=243.4s)]
*  And we won't have to worry about a modern day Holocaust. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UgYo2Dzc2v0&t=245.20000000000002s)]
