# IRAN'S LAST CHANCE?: Trump tells team to 'be ready' as speculation grows over US involvement
**Fox News - World News:** [June 17, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris)
*  So far Israel has launched hundreds of ballistic missiles into Iran striking 35 critical sites [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=0.0s)]
*  During operation rising lion now new reports out today indicate there is damage to the infamous underground nuclear [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=6.9s)]
*  facility in Natanz the former Israeli ambassador to the United States Michael [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=14.64s)]
*  Orin joins us shortly from Tel Aviv and Fox team coverage is ready Mark Meredith will have live reaction from the White House [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=19.28s)]
*  We start though with our senior correspondent Mike Tobin. He is live in Tel Aviv [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=26.04s)]
*  Our Iranians fleeing Tehran amid this fighting. We know what's going on there in Israel. What's happening in Iran? [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=30.28s)]
*  Well as far as the missile attacks that are coming out of Iran their size and intensity have decreased dramatically [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=37.64s)]
*  We've had a couple of missile attacks today [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=44.32s)]
*  One of them just about an hour or two ago [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=47.28s)]
*  It could have involved as few as two missiles the IDF says one of them was intercepted earlier this morning [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=50.24s)]
*  There was a missile attack involving some 20 ballistic missiles out of Iran four of those got through the damage was minimal it [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=56.04s)]
*  Resulted in a bus that caught fire a structure that caught fire in several craters that were formed in the ground [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=63.160000000000004s)]
*  But no injuries reported from that now Israel's defense minister has taken to the airways with a warning for ayatollah [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=69.4s)]
*  Haman a II saying if he continues to fire missiles at Israel, he could meet the same fate as Saddam Hussein [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=76.42s)]
*  In my view I warned the Iranian dictator from continuing to commit war crimes [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=84.4s)]
*  firing missiles at Israeli citizens [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=91.4s)]
*  He should remember what happened to the dictator in the country neighboring Iran who took this path [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=94.88000000000001s)]
*  against the state of Israel [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=102.96000000000001s)]
*  And that is in line with the true social post we've just seen from President Trump saying we know exactly where the so-called [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=107.0s)]
*  Supreme Leader is hiding. He's an easy target, but is safe there [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=112.8s)]
*  We're not going to take him out kill at least not for now [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=116.24s)]
*  But we don't want missile shot at civilians or American soldiers or patience is wearing thin now [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=120.16s)]
*  Israeli fighter jets meantime have been busy in the skies over Western Iran [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=126.36s)]
*  Israel claims to have hit dozens of surface-to-surface missiles the IDF says they also hit air defenses like surface-to-air [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=130.16s)]
*  Missiles and radar backing up Israel's claim of air superiority over Iran [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=137.36s)]
*  The IAEA International Atomic Energy Agency has issued a new [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=141.76s)]
*  Assessment of that strike at the Natanz nuclear enrichment facility saying that facility took a direct hit from [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=147.0s)]
*  Israeli airstrikes [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=154.28s)]
*  Sustaining significant damage that new assessment was issued after they reviewed satellite imagery of the Natanz facility [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=155.92s)]
*  John back to you. All right, Mike Tubba with the latest from Tel Aviv Mike. Thank you, Julie [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=163.79999999999998s)]
*  All right. Well President Trump cut his g7 trip short as Israel and Iran broadened their attacks yesterday [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=168.16s)]
*  He's expected to spend the day at the White House today meeting with his National Security Council in the situation room [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=174.12s)]
*  Mark Meredith is at the White House for us this afternoon. Hey mark [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=179.64000000000001s)]
*  Chilean good afternoon to you the White House as the president Trump himself throwing cold water on the idea that the US is gonna be [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=183.96s)]
*  Brokering a ceasefire between Israel and Iran anytime soon [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=189.36s)]
*  Even though there is growing political pressure on the White House to limit any US military exposure to what's happening in the Middle East [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=192.56s)]
*  The president cut his trip to Canada short by a day given the developments the escalating violence between these two countries [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=199.08s)]
*  And as you and John were just talking about he's been quite active on truth social [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=205.72s)]
*  Mike Tobin read one of the posts but I wanted to read one of the other ones where he also said this and it was [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=209.84s)]
*  Interesting he said the word week because we now have [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=214.36s)]
*  Complete and total control of the skies over Iran Iran has good sky trackers and other defensive equipment [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=216.76s)]
*  But it doesn't compare to American made conceived to manufactured stuff. Nobody does it better than the good old USA [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=222.74s)]
*  While Trump has been active on social media, so is vice president Vance [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=228.8s)]
*  He issued a lengthy statement online making it clear all options remain on the table [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=232.12s)]
*  Very quickly a debate over what US involvement may or may not look like is engulfing Capitol Hill, especially among Democrats [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=237.68s)]
*  We're seeing two very different trains of thought play out [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=244.2s)]
*  They have to be held accountable for what they've done [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=247.79999999999998s)]
*  They are the ones that built and created the proxies like Hamas and Hezbollah and put our whole region in this kinds of chaos [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=250.24s)]
*  I happen to believe that the US being at war with Iran would be a colossal mistake [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=258.2s)]
*  There is no national security imperative that suggests that we should [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=262.92s)]
*  And it's not just Democrats who are speaking out against the possibility and the US involvement in Iran [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=267.76s)]
*  We know that today House Republican of Kentucky was also Thomas Massey was one of the ones who said he would try to limit [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=272.66s)]
*  The president's ability to use US military against Iran without Congress to say so [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=279.54s)]
*  Julian as the president himself has been saying today he might make a decision about how to engage here any moment [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=284.3s)]
*  We'll be tracking it all afternoon. Thanks mark John. All right, let's go live to Tel Aviv now bring in the former Israeli ambassador to the United States [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=290.92s)]
*  Michael or Michael it's good to be with you. I want I want to start you here [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=298.46000000000004s)]
*  This is the latest from President Trump a couple of big posts on truth social [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=301.74s)]
*  He said first of all, we know exactly where the so-called supreme leader is hiding. He is an easy target, but is safe there [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=306.06s)]
*  We are not going to take him out in brackets kill at least not for now [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=312.74s)]
*  But we don't want missile shot at civilians or American soldiers [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=317.46s)]
*  Our patience is wearing thin and then a few minutes later the president followed up with this [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=320.41999999999996s)]
*  said [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=325.58s)]
*  unconditional [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=326.82s)]
*  Surrender sounds like he's done talking to Iran. He just wants them to lay down their arms [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=328.1s)]
*  he wants them to agree to end their nuclear program or [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=332.98s)]
*  It may escalate from here. What are you thinking in this moment? I [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=337.26s)]
*  Think it's extraordinary. We're in a truly historic moment John Julian always good to be with you [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=342.14s)]
*  Who would have thought this is one of the world's most wicked regimes? [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=348.26s)]
*  It's not just that they have tried to destroy the state of Israel again and again for the last 46 years [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=351.3s)]
*  They are the world's largest state sponsor of terror. They're responsible for thousands of deaths deaths of Americans to around the world [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=356.54s)]
*  They are the major backers of his ball and Hamas that triggered this horrendous [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=363.34000000000003s)]
*  Middle-eastern war for the last year and a half. They supplied the drones and the rockets that kill Ukrainians [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=367.98s)]
*  I can go on and on this is a truly wicked wicked regime [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=373.76000000000005s)]
*  And when the president says total surrender unconditional surrender, we couldn't agree more and we hope it's not just about their nuclear program [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=377.42s)]
*  It's the end of Iran's support for terror. It's the end of Iran's attempt to assassinate American leaders, including President Trump himself [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=384.96s)]
*  I mean who lets a regime get away with that? It's not just about their ability to enrich uranium [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=391.47999999999996s)]
*  so it's it's an extraordinary moment and [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=396.0s)]
*  And we greatly appreciate the president's support for us to out this crisis. It's providing us with munitions even with jet fuel [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=398.64s)]
*  And and if the president decides that he in the United States wants to intervene [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=406.2s)]
*  Directly, we're the last people are gonna say no [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=410.91999999999996s)]
*  Well, let me ask you this question can Israel accomplish its goals of eliminating Iran's nuclear program without US help [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=413.6s)]
*  But about eliminating we certainly degraded extremely and [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=423.08s)]
*  If the Iranians do come back to the negotiating table, they're gonna negotiate about dismantling the program and not just capping [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=426.8s)]
*  And the great thing is they'll be discussing [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=434.12s)]
*  dismantling [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=436.6s)]
*  Nuclear facilities that are already dismantled to a certain extent and yes, we do not have strategic bombers [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=437.8s)]
*  We don't have B-52s or B ones B twos. We have these wonderful American-made jets F 15s F 16s and F 35s of just an extra [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=442.98s)]
*  Job and the president a praise American weaponry today and we couldn't agree more [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=452.82s)]
*  But again, we don't we don't have things that can carry these bunker busting bombs [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=457.38s)]
*  They weigh 30,000 pounds that can penetrate an underground facility like the facility at forgo [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=460.98s)]
*  We could take our time [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=466.54s)]
*  We could begin to sort of that peel off various layers of that mountain [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=467.72s)]
*  But that would take a very long time the United States can do it much more swiftly cleanly and effectively [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=471.22s)]
*  well, the issue though is is fordo and if Iran if there were to be a ceasefire declared and [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=476.14000000000004s)]
*  Fordo was intact. Do you have any belief that the ayatollah would actually [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=483.46000000000004s)]
*  agree to dismantle that or would it be left intact that eventually he has he's done so many times in the past [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=489.06s)]
*  Drag this out at the same time reconstituting and rebuilding his nuclear program so that in a couple or three years [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=496.1s)]
*  You'd be right back here where we are now [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=501.90000000000003s)]
*  Exactly, that's our feeling too that that the whole system the whole architecture of the Iranian nuclear program [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=505.18s)]
*  It has to be dismantled and has to be verified whether it's dismantled through an agreement or is mantled through a [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=511.38000000000005s)]
*  Kinetic measures as they say euphemistically by military measures [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=517.5s)]
*  That is okay, too, that's the goal though, but I would stress it shouldn't be just about the middle about the nuclear program [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=521.46s)]
*  It has to be what we used to call, you know [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=527.74s)]
*  So the euphemistically Iran's maligned behavior as if you know, Iran was sort of wrecking its room in some way [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=529.7800000000001s)]
*  Iran [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=535.82s)]
*  The word is sponsored just killed hundred of Americans [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=539.38s)]
*  In Beirut as you remember John attack assassinate American leaders everyone from John Bolton to Michael [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=544.0600000000001s)]
*  The president himself and by the way, they try to assassinate me when I was in Washington in Washington, DC [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=549.8199999999999s)]
*  They don't care. These people are terrorists and they should not get anywhere near a nuclear facility [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=554.7s)]
*  So, you know we talk we talk about the head of the snake and in president Trump has said we know where the Ayatollah is [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=560.06s)]
*  He's safe for now at least barely the there are reports that the president vetoed [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=565.22s)]
*  The idea that Israel would take him out senator John Fetterman was on Fox earlier today and said he thought that was a mistake [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=570.5s)]
*  Listen here, I [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=577.62s)]
*  Think they should have targeted him absolutely gone taking him out. I think the way Israel operates [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=579.26s)]
*  They just take out the leadership just like they did with Hezbollah and they've already done that with the Iranian leadership [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=585.58s)]
*  Just took them out even laying in their beds and they didn't take down the whole building [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=592.3000000000001s)]
*  They actually targeted where they lay in bed [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=596.1800000000001s)]
*  So what do you think about that Michael me you took out the head of the military and and and the new heads of the military [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=598.86s)]
*  They were just taken out this morning you took out Nasrallah you took out Haneeh [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=605.78s)]
*  You've taken out Hamas leadership time and time again on the ground there in Gaza [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=610.86s)]
*  Why not just get rid of the Ayatollah or are you concerned with what might follow in the power vacuum? [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=615.4s)]
*  Well, I think it's more than that. I don't think anybody in the state of Israel would shed a slightest tear if mr. I [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=622.7s)]
*  Just call me any would be would meet his maker. I think the man the maker would be very happy to see him [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=627.94s)]
*  No, it's I think what I really thought, you know is that my background is a military history when the president said unconditional surrender [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=634.72s)]
*  What does that evoke it meant when Roosevelt said that about Japan and World War two and when Japan surrendered [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=640.46s)]
*  Roosevelt and the Allies said well, we're gonna keep Emperor Hirohito [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=648.52s)]
*  Even though he bears a tremendous amount of responsibility for the attack on Pearl Harbor and the horrors that Japan [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=652.1600000000001s)]
*  Affected throughout the world during the war we're gonna keep him because we need his legitimacy to legitimize the surrender [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=657.8000000000001s)]
*  No [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=663.02s)]
*  That was the first thing that came to mind [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=664.58s)]
*  Preparing for the day that Iran does agree to total unconditional surrender [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=671.4200000000001s)]
*  All right, maybe you do need a prominent leader in order to make it legitimate Michael. I always get to talk to you [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=675.94s)]
*  Thank you so much. We hope that you and your love would stay safe through all of this [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=682.02s)]
*  Thank you for your support. Okay. Bye. Senator Lindsey Graham [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=686.86s)]
*  I want to put up the headline from the president on true social that he tweeted last hour. He said two words [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=689.76s)]
*  Unconditional surrender what senator does that mean to you in regards to the ayatollah in Iran? [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=696.4s)]
*  It suggests to me that the president believes that the nuclear program cannot be ended through diplomacy [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=704.08s)]
*  That unconditional surrender is a sign [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=711.4399999999999s)]
*  is a term often used for the war and [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=714.96s)]
*  I thought of the president last night. I just want to say this. I'm so glad he is where he is that [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=718.5600000000001s)]
*  He's the right guy at the right time. He's calm as it can be. He's resolved. He's steady [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=725.24s)]
*  I think he's done a marvelous job of handling this conflict and I believe the Sun is about to set on the Iran nuclear ambitions [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=731.0600000000001s)]
*  They need our help Israel does to take out for dough [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=740.5600000000001s)]
*  They need help from us [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=744.48s)]
*  I'm hoping the president will provide Israel the help they need to finish the job of the last nuclear site underground [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=745.76s)]
*  And if we accomplish destroying the Iranian nuclear program, it will be historic for the region and historic for the world [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=753.0400000000001s)]
*  This is a religious Nazi regime been on purifying Islam [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=761.4s)]
*  destroying the Jewish state and coming after us their religious Nazis and [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=766.96s)]
*  This regime [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=772.6800000000001s)]
*  Does not need nor can they ever have a nuclear weapon and Donald Trump is about to put a period on that statement [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=774.32s)]
*  so senator we don't know for sure but we believe that the meeting in the net in the [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=781.2s)]
*  Situation room with the National Security Council [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=786.16s)]
*  Maybe to decide whether or not the US does dispatch B2 bombers to take down the enrichment facility at for dough [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=788.64s)]
*  You believe firmly that the president should decide in the affirmative on that [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=796.28s)]
*  Well, I've said from the very beginning it is in our national security interests to make sure Ryan doesn't have a nuclear weapon [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=802.24s)]
*  They're an existential threat to our friends in Israel. They really do mean death to Israel, but they also mean death to America [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=808.6s)]
*  There's no doubt in my mind that if the ayatollah had a nuclear weapon [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=815.2s)]
*  He would use it to destroy Israel as part of his religious agenda [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=818.92s)]
*  His religious agenda includes purifying Islam going after Sunni Saudi Arabia [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=823.08s)]
*  Destroying the Jewish state and coming after us because for infidels. He is literally a religious Nazi [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=829.52s)]
*  So it is my belief that President Trump understands the threat [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=835.8s)]
*  The ayatollah presents to us not just Israel and that he will at the end of the day [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=840.16s)]
*  Help Israel finish the job and that will require I think [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=846.2s)]
*  Weapons that Israel doesn't possess and maybe joint military operations [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=850.32s)]
*  There's also a question about what to do about the ayatollah the president put this out on truth social shortly before [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=855.28s)]
*  We went on the air. He said quote. We know exactly where the so-called supreme leader is hiding [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=861.0s)]
*  He is an easy target, but it's safe there [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=866.52s)]
*  We are not going to take him out kill at least not for now [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=869.1999999999999s)]
*  But we don't want missile shot at civilians or American soldiers. Our patience is wearing thin [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=872.52s)]
*  You part ways with the president on that issue. You think you should be taken out? [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=877.56s)]
*  Well what and I'm gonna I trust president's judgment very much [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=881.9200000000001s)]
*  I trust his judgment [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=886.5600000000001s)]
*  I think for now is the term that I totally should understand in Trump world is ever changing [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=887.7600000000001s)]
*  So what is the president trying to do? He's letting the ayatollah know if you attack American interests [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=893.6400000000001s)]
*  That's the end of you and your regime. What am I trying to do? [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=898.96s)]
*  I'm trying to make the case that ending Iran's nuclear ambitions is not only good for Israel [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=902.6s)]
*  It's good for us, and we're they're the weakest they've been since [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=908.52s)]
*  1979 this region since [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=912.8000000000001s)]
*  1979 has been a press this regime has been repressing their people trying to destroy Israel and have American blood on their hands [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=915.6s)]
*  I hope it's eliminated [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=922.82s)]
*  I would like to see this regime fall [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=924.52s)]
*  But I'm gonna leave it up to the president as to what to do and when to do it [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=926.88s)]
*  But I do know this if we don't take out their nuclear program now. We'll all regret it. We're very close be all-in [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=930.6s)]
*  Mr. President and helping Israel finish the job and let's see where we're at after we neutralize our nuclear program [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=937.68s)]
*  And in terms of the ayatollah and whether or not he stays or he goes [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=944.68s)]
*  with force [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=950.16s)]
*  On either the part of the Israelis or or someone else we were talking to Michael or the former Israeli ambassador to the United States [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=952.1999999999999s)]
*  Last hour who thought that like hero, Hito at the end of World War two [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=958.68s)]
*  Israel and the president of the United States might want an authority figure in place to sign the necessary documents for capitulation [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=964.58s)]
*  Do you do you agree with that or not? [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=972.66s)]
*  Well, that's not a bad point to make and and I don't want to overly analyze this. I just know since [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=975.14s)]
*  1979 Iran has been the largest state sponsor of terrorism [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=982.86s)]
*  they have American blood on their hands and they want to wipe out our friends in Israel and eventually come after us as [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=986.94s)]
*  To what should happen and when should it happen? I think it's imperative [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=993.26s)]
*  We finished job regarding their nuclear capability as soon as possible as whether or not the ayatollah stays or goes [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=997.46s)]
*  I'll leave that up to the president [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=1004.34s)]
*  But I want to let the American people know Iran is incredibly wounded their commanding control is virtually destroyed [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=1006.1s)]
*  They're in disarray and they're very dangerous [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=1013.46s)]
*  I don't want to underestimate the danger of being involved in these operations [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=1016.0s)]
*  But the danger of Iran having a nuclear weapon or surviving as a state sponsor of terrorism [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=1020.62s)]
*  Is far greater than the danger of trying to end the threat [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=1026.74s)]
*  So that's the decision president Trump has to make and I think he's the right guy at the right time to make that decision [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=1030.74s)]
*  But I'm hoping the Sun is sitting not only on their nuclear program, but the regime itself [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=1037.42s)]
*  Sooner they leave the world stage the better the world will be we can have true peace in the Mideast only [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=1044.06s)]
*  If the regime falls in my view [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=1050.58s)]
*  Yeah [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=1053.02s)]
*  I mean [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=1053.54s)]
*  They they do upset the apple cart in so many ways in the Middle East and there are a lot of people there [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=1053.8999999999999s)]
*  Who believe that the reason why that regime that region is not more stable is because of Iran [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=1058.6599999999999s)]
*  Saudi Arabia would like to see the theocracy gone [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=1065.46s)]
*  I know the Emirates would and many other Arab states as well, but then there's the question of [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=1068.02s)]
*  What happens if there is a power vacuum there? We saw all too well what happened in Iraq? [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=1074.3s)]
*  We saw what happened in Afghanistan when the Taliban took over in literally a matter of hours [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=1079.46s)]
*  You've got competing factions as well who would vie to take over Iran on the one side [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=1084.42s)]
*  You've got the crown prince Reza Pahlavi [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=1089.78s)]
*  Who would like to go in as an interim leader the other side of that fence? [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=1092.0600000000002s)]
*  You've got the NCRI the National Council for Resistance in Iran, which used to be the MEK [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=1095.98s)]
*  Which a lot of people in Iran say would be worse than the ayatollah [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=1102.18s)]
*  So what steps into the vacuum if the regime falls? [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=1105.34s)]
*  Well, I think what will happen is the Iranian people will know freedom for the first time since 1979 [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=1110.3799999999999s)]
*  You know people probably asked that about Hitler in the 30s [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=1115.98s)]
*  What would happen in Germany if we took him out in the mid 30s? [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=1119.1s)]
*  Well, I wish we had because we know what happened when they let him stay in power [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=1122.62s)]
*  And here's what I can say taking the ayatollah's regime down is a good thing [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=1126.94s)]
*  Not a bad thing and I'm willing to risk what happens next because I know what's gonna happen if they stay in power [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=1132.78s)]
*  They're gonna keep trying to destroy Israel [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=1139.34s)]
*  They're gonna keep for many terrorism and they're gonna try to build a bomb and they will use it until they're gone [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=1141.82s)]
*  Their goal is a religious goal to destroy the Jews to destroy [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=1147.82s)]
*  Sunni Islam to destroy us. These are fanatical religious Nazis. I'm willing to risk them leaving [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=1153.98s)]
*  I think it will only get better. But if they stay I know exactly what's gonna happen. It will be all hell to pay [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=1161.42s)]
*  Senator we're just trying to stretch a little bit here for what we believe is the beginning of the State Department briefing [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=1168.54s)]
*  So let's bring in Julian here. Hi senator [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=1173.5s)]
*  Hello wanted to ask you about this interesting comment from Axios to build on what you were just talking about with John [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=1176.46s)]
*  They got some sourcing today on the president's thinking regarding his decision not to take out the ayatollah and a source very [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=1183.74s)]
*  Close to the president told them quote. It's the ayatollah, you know versus the ayatollah. You don't know that's kind of interesting [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=1191.42s)]
*  Yeah, I think the president has handled this very well taking out the ayatollah [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=1200.02s)]
*  I understand both sides of that equation, but I don't I do understand taking out the nuclear program is non-negotiable [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=1204.3400000000001s)]
*  That's non-negotiable for Israel. It's non-negotiable for us [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=1211.78s)]
*  And here's the question would the ayatollah use a nuclear weapon as part of his religious agenda if he had it [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=1215.48s)]
*  I think the answer is yes [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=1221.88s)]
*  I don't think rocket man is gonna attack America as much as I don't like Putin [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=1223.0s)]
*  I don't think he's gonna attack America, but I do believe the ayatollah is a religious [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=1227.0800000000002s)]
*  Figure who has a religious view that is very dangerous for the existence of Israel and us and he would actually use a nuclear [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=1232.3200000000002s)]
*  Weapon, so let's don't overthink this [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=1239.92s)]
*  Let's take the nuclear program off the table destroy it in perpetuity then decide what to do next [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=1241.52s)]
*  But I do believe if this regime fell it would be great for the Iranian people [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=1247.44s)]
*  It would be the best chance to have peace in the Mideast and it would be history being made [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=1252.6399999999999s)]
*  President Trump is a historical figure already [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=1257.8799999999999s)]
*  He's about to go to another level of history making four presidents have promised to make sure Iran doesn't have a nuclear weapon [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=1260.48s)]
*  It will be Donald J. Trump who delivers on that promise very soon. Well done. Mr. President [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=1268.48s)]
*  Well, so sir [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=1275.2s)]
*  pulling up Reagan Institute study survey from the summer they found that [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=1277.44s)]
*  84% of Americans [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=1283.6000000000001s)]
*  Want to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon the rub as you well know is [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=1286.3600000000001s)]
*  Probably like a hundred and ten percent of Americans don't want to have another twenty year long or even twenty months long [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=1292.66s)]
*  War in the Middle East [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=1300.78s)]
*  Yeah, we're not talking about 20 months [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=1303.22s)]
*  I'm not even sure we're down about 20 days now [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=1305.3s)]
*  Why do eighty four percent of the people don't want to run to have a nuclear weapon because they believe like I do they will use [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=1308.1399999999999s)]
*  It these people are religious fanatics. They're not normal [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=1313.7s)]
*  They take young girls off a bus and kill them in Iran itself because they're not covered these people are religious fanatics with a [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=1316.94s)]
*  Religious agenda that needs to be stopped now [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=1324.6200000000001s)]
*  So if they get a nuclear weapon, they'll use it and Israel's not gonna even play with that possibility nor should we but here's what? [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=1327.16s)]
*  I would say to the American people [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=1334.1000000000001s)]
*  You know endless war has been Iran since 1979 since 1979. They've been trying to come after us in Israel [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=1336.38s)]
*  I'd like to end that endless war but if you think radical Islam can be dealt with and ignored [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=1343.46s)]
*  Dealt with without being dealt with you're wrong. You've got to stand up to these people [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=1350.74s)]
*  They mean what they say when they chant death Israel. They mean it death America. They made it [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=1355.5800000000002s)]
*  So we live in a world where we have to defend ourselves [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=1359.98s)]
*  I don't think it's gonna be 20 months, but here's what I do believe if we don't get it right now [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=1362.6200000000001s)]
*  We're gonna pay later if they survive all of this God help us all but sir [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=1367.78s)]
*  Can you guarantee that can President Trump in any? [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=1372.42s)]
*  Can you make the commitment that this would not lead to a longer war? I? [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=1376.38s)]
*  Can guarantee you that if the ayatollah gets a nuclear weapon? He will use it [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=1381.18s)]
*  I believe that with all my heart and soul so the men and women who serve they're the ones going [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=1385.26s)]
*  Not people answering a poll and if you ask them [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=1390.26s)]
*  Would you be willing to risk your life to stop the ayatollah from having a nuclear weapon? [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=1393.24s)]
*  All of them would say yes because it makes their country our country safer [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=1397.7s)]
*  So we live in a world where you got to confront problems you want to avoid World War three [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=1402.1000000000001s)]
*  Learn the lessons from World War two people in World War two [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=1406.9s)]
*  appeased Hitler to the point that it got so much out of hand we had a world war and [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=1411.22s)]
*  60 million people got killed so we live in a world where you pay now or you pay later [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=1416.38s)]
*  Let's stop this threat before he gets a nuclear weapon. Let's end this reign of terror. Let's do it now [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=1420.92s)]
*  It's not going to take 20 months, but I can't guarantee your freedom and your safety [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=1426.78s)]

*  Iran war is not America first or MAGA [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=1478.74s)]
*  Wishing for murder of innocent people is disgusting [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=1481.46s)]

*  I don't know if you can see this graphic senator [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=1487.3400000000001s)]
*  But let me put this out there for the audience to see it's believed that left to their own devices [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=1488.8200000000002s)]
*  Without any kind of degradation within two to three days Iran could develop one weapon within a month [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=1494.14s)]
*  This is breeding like rabbits within a month. They have 11 weapons within five months [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=1499.46s)]
*  They have 22 weapons and a lot of people believe that a regime like the Iranian one the more weapons you have [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=1503.94s)]
*  The more likely you are to lose use them [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=1509.9s)]

*  She doesn't understand the threat in my view if you don't understand that Iran a religious theocracy [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=1515.54s)]
*  Religious Nazis would use a nuclear weapon to kill all the Jews. You don't listen to what they say [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=1522.74s)]
*  They're a threat to us. They're a threat to the state of Israel [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=1527.86s)]
*  It is not in the world's interest to give this religious fanatic a nuclear weapon [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=1530.74s)]
*  Somebody's got to deal with it. Donald Trump is the right man to deal with us. I think he's been very measured [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=1535.4599999999998s)]
*  He had 60 days Steve Witkoff went over there three or four times. They tried very hard to get a run to the table [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=1540.54s)]
*  I appreciate reaching out and trying to do this diplomatically. I appreciate Witkoff [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=1546.58s)]
*  I appreciate President Trump trying well, it's not working [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=1551.58s)]
*  You can't have peace unless both people want peace and what the Iranians want is to kill all the Jews and kill us [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=1555.1s)]
*  And the answer is no, we're not gonna let him do that [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=1561.1s)]
*  So the Sun is setting on this regime and that's a good thing [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=1563.62s)]
*  The Sun is setting on their nuclear program [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=1568.6200000000001s)]

*  We will find out more in the hours ahead about the u.s [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=1863.26s)]
*  Assets that are currently deployed across the region [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=1866.3s)]
*  I also spoke earlier today with an israeli pilot who has been striking iran [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=1869.1s)]
*  He says now the country has air superiority over the entirety of tehran the iranian capital [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=1873.74s)]
*  He also said that when they were flying initially over iran [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=1879.5s)]
*  They could see iranian pilots moving their fighter jets to the central part of the country trying to evade these israeli airstrikes [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=1882.9399999999998s)]
*  But tonight the israelis say they are even going after positions deeper into iranian territory martha trey. Thank you very much [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=1889.9799999999998s)]
*  President trump and his national security team has concluded [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=1898.06s)]
*  Chief washington correspondent michael manuel live at the white house. Hi mike [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=1901.74s)]
*  Good afternoon. Yeah, we have learned from several senior officials that the meeting with president trump's national security team [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=1906.3s)]
*  In the situation room wrapped at 3 46 pm eastern time. So after a couple of hours of meeting [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=1912.94s)]
*  Uh, we were told earlier today that the possibility of u.s intervention possibility of airstrikes [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=1919.5s)]
*  Is on the table and certainly president trump has been taking a much tougher stand [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=1926.64s)]
*  With the iranian regime basically saying that he wants unconditional surrender [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=1931.76s)]
*  And even throughout the idea that the ayatollah [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=1937.52s)]
*  Khamenei could be at risk saying i'm not going to take them out just yet [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=1941.28s)]
*  but basically left the possibility open that the united states could take out [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=1945.04s)]
*  Uh the leader of iran and potentially pursue regime change [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=1950.32s)]
*  And so we know the president wanted a peaceful resolution to this. He bristled when french president [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=1954.1599999999999s)]
*  Emmanuel macron suggested that he just wanted a ceasefire [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=1960.72s)]
*  The president said that macron tends to get things wrong [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=1965.04s)]
*  And so we are waiting a readout, but obviously a critical meeting that the president came home from canada overnight to [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=1968.48s)]
*  Oversee here at the white house has wrapped after about a couple of hours and we hope to get a readout [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=1977.04s)]
*  Shortly the president obviously has been active on social media today. We'll see if he puts out a statement martha [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=1983.36s)]
*  Yeah, that we will uh mike. Thank you very much. Obviously a very important meeting a lot at stake [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=1989.04s)]
*  So we'll bring you that when we get it. There is a furious debate online [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=1994.6399999999999s)]
*  on the right for republicans [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=1999.36s)]
*  Is it america first to militarily intervene in iran? [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=2002.66s)]
*  President trump answered that question to the atlantic [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=2008.18s)]
*  He said well considering that i am the one that developed america first and considering that the term wasn't used until I came along [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=2011.46s)]
*  I think i'm the one that decides that [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=2018.42s)]
*  It's an interesting perspective [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=2020.98s)]
*  It's an important perspective what dictates america first i'd love to lay out for you my understanding [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=2022.82s)]
*  Of america first i'd love to start with what I know america first not to be [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=2030.3600000000001s)]
*  I never understood america first to be isolationist. I don't think america first has ever been anti-war [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=2035.88s)]
*  I don't think it has ever been pacifist. I certainly don't think america first has been sympathetic to iran nor sympathetic to russia [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=2041.4s)]
*  No, I think america first has always asked an integral question [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=2048.6s)]
*  Is whatever we are doing serving the interests of americans on that note [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=2052.28s)]
*  I would suggest this is also not america first [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=2057.7999999999997s)]
*  Today it's tel aviv tomorrow. It's new york [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=2063.64s)]
*  I look I understand america first. I don't understand america dead [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=2066.36s)]
*  That's what these people want they chant death to america [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=2070.36s)]
*  So we're doing something that is in the service of mankind of humanity and it's a battle of good against evil [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=2073.4s)]
*  Yesterday tel aviv [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=2081.3199999999997s)]
*  Tomorrow new york says prime minister benjamin netanyahu of israel. It is my thing that plays to fear within america [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=2083.16s)]
*  And doesn't answer once again the strategic the rational question asked. I would hope by every single american [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=2090.3599999999997s)]
*  How does this serve americans? [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=2097.16s)]
*  But we're also not interested in the narrative that america is also the bad guy that we're always the bad actor on the world stage [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=2099.8799999999997s)]
*  This isn't ideological and it isn't philosophical [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=2106.92s)]
*  It's simply cold and rational that our elected representatives in our government are there to serve the interests of americans [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=2109.64s)]
*  So with that I would suggest to you in analyzing whether or not something is america first ask two questions [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=2117.64s)]
*  one [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=2123.8s)]
*  What is the interest of americans? [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=2124.76s)]
*  two [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=2127.32s)]
*  What does it cost? [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=2128.2000000000003s)]
*  Those two questions have never been answered when it came at least to not any adequate answer when it comes to afghanistan or iraq [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=2130.04s)]
*  And have never in my opinion been answered adequately when it comes to ukraine, but it's a different calculation [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=2136.76s)]
*  When it comes to iran for 40 years iran has been an avowed enemy of the united states [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=2143.16s)]
*  They have chanted death to america and by some estimates [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=2148.76s)]
*  It's not just been rhetorical but they've helped supply the weapons the bombs and sometimes the manpower to literally kill thousands of american soldiers [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=2151.32s)]
*  Taking out an avowed enemy you would think would serve american interest [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=2159.8s)]
*  What does it cost right now suggestions are that we're only playing a defensive effort in support of israel [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=2164.92s)]
*  What if the ask is that we play offense? [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=2171.4s)]
*  Well, if that's b2 bombers dropping bunker busters on a nuclear facility in israel [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=2173.96s)]
*  That's much different than dropping troops into iraq or nation building in afghanistan [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=2178.76s)]
*  Those are serious costs that you and I and anyone running the american government should today [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=2184.12s)]
*  Consider with a great amount of humility [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=2189.0s)]
*  But nothing donald trump says nothing president trump says is off the table [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=2192.46s)]
*  Is there any guarantee that if the u.s did get involved militarily that a u.s bomb could destroy iran's nuclear program and facilities [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=2199.1000000000004s)]
*  Look at you, right? There's no guarantee but you're saying a guarantee on what do you think if the u.s got involved militarily [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=2210.2200000000003s)]
*  It would actually wipe out iran's nuclear program or where's your assessment of that? [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=2217.66s)]
*  Look wars can spiral out of control alliances can be marshalled [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=2229.58s)]
*  War is unpredictable and we should always as I do I hope today here with you approach this with humility [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=2234.86s)]
*  But as of now the ask the demand and the cost is not high [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=2241.68s)]
*  In taking out the interest that americans might have of an avowed enemy in iran [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=2245.7599999999998s)]
*  But the good note is we have an elected president who does seem to define america first. He is not ideological [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=2250.56s)]
*  He is not philosophical about this. He is strategic in making deals that serve americans [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=2257.2s)]
*  And I thought vice president jd vance laid it out well today [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=2262.88s)]
*  He said look i'm seeing this from the inside and i'm admittedly biased towards our president and my friend [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=2266.16s)]
*  There's a lot of crazy stuff on social media [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=2271.2799999999997s)]
*  So I want to address some of these things directly on the iran issue first potus has been amazingly consistent over 10 years [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=2273.44s)]
*  That iran cannot have a nuclear weapon [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=2280.56s)]
*  The president has shown remarkable restraint in keeping our military focus on protecting troops and protecting our citizens [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=2282.64s)]
*  He may decide he needs to take further action to end iranian enrichment that decision ultimately belongs to the president [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=2288.88s)]
*  And of course people are right to be worried about foreign entanglements after the last 25 years of idiotic foreign policy [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=2295.04s)]
*  But I believe the president has earned some trust on this issue [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=2300.7999999999997s)]
*  I echo that sentiment this president of the united states does [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=2304.64s)]
*  Understand the analysis of what it takes to arrive at the conclusion of whether or not something serves [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=2308.7s)]
*  america first [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=2316.16s)]
*  Let's continue the conversation now with journalist and author batiya unger sargon and foundation for defensive democracies president cliff may [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=2317.4399999999996s)]
*  Thank you for being with us here today both of you batiya. I'd love to start with you [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=2324.72s)]
*  Do you think any military action in iran serves to answer the question of whether or not it serves america first? [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=2329.04s)]
*  So first of all, thank you for that very beautiful opening. Well, you really nailed it [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=2336.96s)]
*  I think secretary [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=2342.48s)]
*  marco rubio put it really well in his confirmation hearings when he said that every decision made by this administration [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=2344.16s)]
*  Would be in response to asking three questions [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=2351.2s)]
*  Does this make america safer does it make america stronger and does it make america more prosperous? [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=2354.2400000000002s)]
*  And the way that you laid that out will was exactly in response to those three questions [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=2360.0800000000004s)]
*  obviously supporting our ally defensively [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=2366.32s)]
*  Against a foe I think meets the standard of those three questions [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=2370.2400000000002s)]
*  Regime change I think obviously does not and the question is where is the line there? [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=2375.6800000000003s)]
*  And I just completely agree with the vice president president trump has earned the right and earned the credibility [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=2382.2400000000002s)]
*  To walk this fine line of being both pro israel, but always putting us and of course our troops first [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=2388.88s)]
*  You know the note on regime change needs to be explored cliff because if we're being completely honest [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=2397.92s)]
*  That is what every party is discussing that is what israel is discussing and that's what's being discussed by the united states [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=2403.76s)]
*  The question then becomes is that worth the cost for america any potential involvement for america? [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=2410.0800000000004s)]
*  And we should recognize that we have been particularly bad at regime change in nation building over the last quarter of a century [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=2415.84s)]
*  But we have to answer the question for americans is regime change in iran america first [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=2422.2400000000002s)]
*  Yeah, the all good points by you by bacha certainly by jd vance by the president [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=2429.6000000000004s)]
*  I think he the president is pursuing absolutely [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=2435.4399999999996s)]
*  An america first policy here. He's letting israel do what it can do as capably as it can and it's showing itself to be very capable [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=2438.48s)]
*  In terms of combating a common enemy if the president decides he wants to take out the four dough [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=2446.56s)]
*  And i'm not sure he will but at least when he's talking about it [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=2452.96s)]
*  Nobody can say he's simply bluffing. He will decide to do that because [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=2456.7999999999997s)]
*  This means no boots on the ground. This means no [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=2461.2s)]
*  Regime change necessarily it means what does it mean? [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=2464.08s)]
*  It probably means a pilot goes drops two bombs as you've described from a b2 very big bombs 30 000 pounds [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=2467.28s)]
*  And then he turns around and goes home to missouri and has breakfast with his family in the morning [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=2475.6s)]
*  And what does he do by that? [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=2481.12s)]
*  He stops this regime which for 46 years has been shouting and chanting death to america from getting the capability [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=2482.48s)]
*  To make good on those threats with nuclear weapons and intercontinental ballistic missiles, which it has regime [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=2490.5s)]
*  Change is for the people of iran to do not for us to do they may I hope they do and I certainly wish them [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=2498.02s)]
*  Well if they try [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=2504.42s)]
*  Well to that point, I don't want to be cavalier and I don't want to slow walk the american people into [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=2506.18s)]
*  A bluff that every party is trying to do something [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=2511.7000000000003s)]
*  They are not from the bank attacks to warning people to get out of toronto [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=2513.94s)]
*  There is hope in the west with the united states and with israel that the iranian people will effectuate a regime change [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=2517.38s)]
*  So we need to acknowledge that that is what is being worked on [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=2523.7000000000003s)]
*  inside these two governments bata you and I share a concern that from [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=2527.54s)]
*  Fentanyl crisis lack of purpose depression middle-class jobs being lost crisis at our border [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=2531.7000000000003s)]
*  There's tons of domestic issues that deserve the attention of our government that truly do serve the interests of americans first [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=2538.1000000000004s)]
*  Is it your fear at all? [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=2544.7400000000002s)]
*  That by focusing some of our attention all the way across the globe to iran [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=2546.34s)]
*  We take the eye off the ball of serving americans here at home in america [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=2550.6600000000003s)]
*  With any other president I would say yes, absolutely [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=2557.1400000000003s)]
*  By the way, i'm, not so sure president trump wants regime change [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=2560.34s)]
*  The mullahs are very very weak right now and often it is in your interest to have a very weak regime [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=2563.94s)]
*  As an enemy, um the president just went to the middle east where he met with the saudis a foe of iran [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=2571.06s)]
*  He went with qatar an ally of iran and the uae an ally of israel [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=2577.14s)]
*  He is reimagining what the middle east looks like both in form in terms of foreign policy [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=2581.94s)]
*  But also all of those countries together promised eight trillion dollars of investment here at home [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=2588.3399999999997s)]
*  So I think in this president's mind [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=2594.82s)]
*  Peace global peace peace in the middle east that only he can bring in his mind [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=2597.38s)]
*  And I think that there's an argument that he's right about that is very tied to domestic [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=2601.78s)]
*  infrastructure domestic investment and prosperity for the american people [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=2607.92s)]
*  But it's a very important question. Well, i'm so glad you asked that and we should all keep asking it [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=2612.34s)]
*  Well, I appreciate it. Can I try to answer that a little bit if I can will quickly and that I just say that [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=2617.94s)]
*  A crippled iran represents no threat to the u.s. By the way, it represents no threat to israel it represents a threat to its own people [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=2622.8199999999997s)]
*  What is the alternative to a crippled iran? [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=2630.98s)]
*  Think about it from an america first point of view if it's not [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=2633.14s)]
*  Defanged then this iran continues to make threats. It has nuclear weapons. It threatens to use them against the u.s [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=2636.56s)]
*  We have to try to contain it [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=2642.3399999999997s)]
*  It can at any time raise prices around the world as it does [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=2643.94s)]
*  By using proxies such as the houthis to shut down shipping to shut down shipping possibly in the straight of horn moose as well [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=2647.22s)]
*  By teaming up with the rut with other nuclear powers that it's very in an axis with moscow china north korea [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=2653.46s)]
*  The alternatives are not defanging china is not america first. It's quite the opposite [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=2659.94s)]
*  Well cliff batia, I thank you. I appreciate the conversation. I feel confident that in my lifetime [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=2665.54s)]
*  There's never been another president that might be asking those questions here today. They're not approaching this ideologically [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=2670.26s)]
*  Or trying to export democracy or build another nation up in our own image [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=2675.72s)]
*  But actually asking the questions about what serves americans. I appreciate the conversation [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=2679.2400000000002s)]
*  So president trump is now facing a big choice either help israel destroy iran's nuke facility or continue to negotiate [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=2684.2s)]
*  Axios reports that trump is seriously considering joining the war on iran [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=2690.84s)]
*  And launching a strike against its nuclear facilities. However, president trump is still open to a deal [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=2694.68s)]
*  But says it could depend on his mood [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=2700.12s)]
*  Where are you open to negotiating with the radios right now, or do you want to wait? I don't know [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=2702.68s)]
*  I've been negotiating. I told them to do the deal. They should have done the deal [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=2708.44s)]
*  The cities have been blown to pieces that lost a lot of people [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=2712.2s)]
*  They should have done the deal. I told them do the deal [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=2716.44s)]
*  So, I don't know i'm not too much in a mood to negotiate [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=2719.72s)]
*  So kaylee [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=2723.48s)]
*  On the right we have a big difference of opinion here, but unlike the left we're not afraid to show it [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=2725.0s)]
*  And you know all the players involved so I guess I gotta ask you I want to talk about that thing [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=2730.6s)]
*  Should it matter that the mood of america they voted for a guy who wanted to concentrate on america first [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=2735.96s)]
*  We got the guy in and now we're here almost participating in a war. How do you explain that say to your maga? [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=2742.4399999999996s)]
*  friends, you know [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=2749.7999999999997s)]
*  The tuckers and the bannons, you know, or then you have the other side the rubios and the mike waltz's. How do you [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=2751.7999999999997s)]
*  What do you say? So I observed america first up front and personal in term one [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=2759.32s)]
*  And what I learned about president trump, he's a man of action not words. He's not in a veld chamberlain [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=2764.6800000000003s)]
*  He is a church hill. He is not someone who sits in a beach chair and lets history happen to him [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=2769.56s)]
*  He makes history [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=2774.76s)]
*  He acts strategically he acts when it's in our interest when he took out solomani when he took out albic daddy when he [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=2775.88s)]
*  Acted in syria when they used chemical weapons on their own people every dictator in the world observed that [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=2782.36s)]
*  And you know what happened putin for the first time in four presidencies did not invade a sovereign country [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=2787.8s)]
*  The last and final year of his presidency not a single american troop died in afghanistan [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=2793.4s)]
*  You look isis dismantled [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=2799.96s)]
*  He's worried. He's not words [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=2801.96s)]
*  He is action [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=2803.48s)]
*  How is bannon and the folks that you mentioned and the people advocating for just sitting back and taking it easy [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=2804.68s)]
*  How are they any different than biden's foreign policy biden's foreign policy was I say don't and putin does [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=2810.76s)]
*  I say don't and the taliban takes over afghanistan [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=2817.56s)]
*  I say don't and two global wars start on my watch. That is the biden foreign policy [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=2820.68s)]
*  That is by no definition america first iran has had five decades five decades almost half a century to talk [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=2826.44s)]
*  And what they've done instead killed 609 american troops in iraq what they've done is put an assassination plot [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=2833.0s)]
*  On president trump's head what they've done is take american hostages and wreak havoc on the world [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=2839.88s)]
*  America first is not sitting in a beach chair and using words [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=2845.0800000000004s)]
*  It's taking decisive action when we can take out fordough the one swoop of an airplane [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=2848.2000000000003s)]
*  All right, jesse [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=2854.92s)]
*  We know from trump's words and deeds. He's pretty stingy with blood and treasure. He's not a guy who's into wars [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=2856.6000000000004s)]
*  So what do you think he's going to do? Is this going to be something highly specific if he gets involved? [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=2863.48s)]
*  Why isn't anybody asking what's next? [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=2868.1200000000003s)]
*  We are and some people on the right are asking that the left isn't asking anything they've just totally [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=2870.92s)]
*  Withdrawn themselves from this debate [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=2877.14s)]
*  so [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=2879.64s)]
*  Right now it's a maximum pressure campaign and we control the air and we have sanctions and espionage activities and they have no proxies [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=2880.6s)]
*  So donald trump is saying to the ayatollah [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=2888.28s)]
*  We know where you eat. We know where you sleep [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=2891.0s)]
*  I'm the one keeping you alive bibi bibi wants to knock you out [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=2893.48s)]
*  Uh and put you six feet under i'm keeping you alive [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=2898.2000000000003s)]
*  So here are your options option number one is you come right to the negotiating table you sign a deal and we take [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=2900.84s)]
*  your nuclear facilities [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=2908.2000000000003s)]
*  Offline and out of the country or we take them out with [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=2910.36s)]
*  Bunker busters we can do it the peaceful way or we could do it the violent way [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=2914.26s)]
*  It's actually a choice that comani has to make himself now there are risks [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=2918.2000000000003s)]
*  Associated with using the bunker busters [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=2924.7599999999998s)]
*  You're basically taking out the only card that they have left to play. That's all their leverage so they could lash out unpredictably [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=2928.12s)]
*  uh suicide bombers dirty bombs [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=2936.12s)]
*  Uh missile strikes against naval assets or bases in there [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=2939.16s)]
*  But it looks like this is moving so fast [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=2943.48s)]
*  Our intelligence said that bethanyahu decided he was going to strike iran [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=2946.2s)]
*  Alone or with the united states after october 7th [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=2951.32s)]
*  There was nothing we could say that would stop them even if we were negotiating over this deal [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=2953.88s)]
*  and so [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=2959.0s)]
*  Trump was like no and told him to chill twice [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=2960.2000000000003s)]
*  Bibi asked for bunker busters trump told him to back off didn't give him to him [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=2963.48s)]
*  But then felt the iranians were stringing him along during these negotiations and after the deadline eclipsed the day after he greenlit [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=2967.56s)]
*  The israelis to go in hard and now he likes what they've done. They've been effective with this air campaign [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=2975.4s)]
*  And now is the choice is he going to use these bunker busters to get the united states evolved offensively in the campaign [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=2981.1600000000003s)]
*  So far, he's been very deliberate [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=2988.52s)]
*  And he's keeping all options on the table and so far so good. We hope he makes the right call [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=2990.76s)]
*  Emily, how do you reconcile the the differences of opinion in the magga movement you have? [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=2996.6000000000004s)]
*  I mean i'm grappling with it. I was you know, part of the charm for me was that we weren't going to deal with foreign wars [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=3003.16s)]
*  But at the same time I understand the threat. I don't know where to and I don't want my opinion assigned to me from john bolton [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=3009.96s)]
*  You know or whoever? [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=3017.8799999999997s)]
*  to that point I think [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=3020.12s)]
*  We elected a certain individual to represent all of our interests and we know that his primary or final objective [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=3021.56s)]
*  Is peace through strength and to have no [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=3028.68s)]
*  Eternal worse and so it would be that candidate i.e. [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=3031.24s)]
*  The commander in chief president trump that would hold our faith that we know come hell or high water [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=3035.08s)]
*  He's going to get to that endpoint, but I agree with you [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=3040.68s)]
*  And that's why we see that kaleidoscope of opinions that people have right [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=3042.52s)]
*  Intervention how much is that right? There's different definitions essentially of intervention some consider even the use of one [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=3046.5s)]
*  B-22 that that is indeed intervening that that is potentially risking blood and treasure and there are others that say no [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=3052.8399999999997s)]
*  This is exactly you know, it's sort of a minimal step and anything short of intense [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=3059.72s)]
*  Investment is less than what we're talking about here [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=3065.22s)]
*  But I I think it your your question of what's next and asking that question [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=3067.9599999999996s)]
*  That's the right question because the reality is we inherited what we learned from this prior administration is that inaction? [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=3073.08s)]
*  furthers the interests of our enemies [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=3079.3199999999997s)]
*  Iran has been emboldened and equipped and was incentivized to terrorize [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=3081.64s)]
*  Israel and also american interests over and over and over again [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=3086.92s)]
*  So we inherit that situation and michael warren said this that the israeli former ambassador to the u.s [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=3090.04s)]
*  That with this scenario president trump has the opportunity to become the greatest peacemaker of the century because everyone else [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=3095.08s)]
*  Just tried to curb the nuclear threat, but here we're trying to potentially [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=3101.48s)]
*  Totally eradicate it and then what if the result is actually the annihilation the failure of the islamic regime [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=3105.96s)]
*  And then we ask what's next? [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=3111.8s)]
*  Well, what would be the positive look not irrespective of the the big charlie foxtrot that that could be [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=3113.24s)]
*  An enemy whose identity is based on the death and destruction of america the great satan and israel [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=3119.3999999999996s)]
*  extinguished sovereignty of the countries around it and the demilitarization potentially of yemen and gaza [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=3125.14s)]
*  Expanding the abraham accords the impact on our security and our global economy is truly direct [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=3131.14s)]
*  So for me, I think the other alternative is waiting around for them to blackmail us for iran to say oh guess what? [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=3137.72s)]
*  Oh, you don't you're not going to do this. Here's a nuke [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=3144.36s)]
*  So I think this the only option for peace is some type of intervention and I trust our commander in chief to represent that well [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=3146.6s)]
*  So jessica, this is a situation where you find yourself on the same side as president trump [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=3153.32s)]
*  They both both of you have an affinity towards israel, correct? [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=3159.56s)]
*  Definitely. So yeah, what is your take on? [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=3163.72s)]
*  What he's doing and uh what america should do and what's next? [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=3167.56s)]
*  So my take on what he's doing is that he's doing what bb wants to do [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=3173.56s)]
*  So he had made it clear over and over that he wanted a diplomatic path [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=3178.6s)]
*  And yes, it was day 61 and he had said you have 60 days [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=3182.68s)]
*  But he had been planning to have his team meet just two days later on the sunday [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=3186.36s)]
*  To try to go through the sixth round of talks and he he wanted a new [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=3191.0s)]
*  Nuke deal even though the parameters of it were basically just the old deal that he had ripped up [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=3194.76s)]
*  So bb decided this is my chance and trump had no choice but to go along with it [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=3199.5600000000004s)]
*  And the new york times is reporting today just to make everyone at the table feel a little bit more powerful that not only was [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=3204.44s)]
*  It that this is what israel decided to do but that donald trump liked fox's coverage of the [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=3210.1200000000003s)]
*  Operation rising lion and everyone was talking about what genius it was because it was a genius operation on the part of the israelis [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=3217.2200000000003s)]
*  And that he wanted to be able to claim some credit for himself of that and you know, america first [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=3223.88s)]
*  I get a trump doctrines. He's not someone that deals in a ton of specificity [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=3229.1600000000003s)]
*  Um, they can vary it really is I look at his world choices even in the situation room with him [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=3234.2000000000003s)]
*  I I can read I can see his posticity. Okay, so the one he took out solomani [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=3240.04s)]
*  He took out albacar. I heard you and I heard that he was winston churchill, but if he's saying on true social today [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=3244.76s)]
*  Biden we are [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=3250.2s)]
*  Did that work the beach chair foreign policy? Just let me finish. It's not that bad [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=3252.04s)]
*  It's just two minutes. I'll be done a minute and a half now probably just a minute. Just you're down to a minute 15. Okay [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=3256.2s)]
*  So he's a minute. Okay [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=3262.12s)]
*  He's posting using we [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=3264.84s)]
*  That that's the pronoun that he's using for this [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=3267.88s)]
*  So he's saying we know where you are and we're deciding not to kill you [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=3270.04s)]
*  We're in control of the iranian skies [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=3273.7200000000003s)]
*  We have the implication that we are now in this fight with them that it has happened already whether or not we give them [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=3275.9599999999996s)]
*  The b2 bombers and take out the nuclear site that's built into the mountain fordo. I think it's called [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=3282.8399999999997s)]
*  What's also interesting about what's going on is that it appears that tulsi gabbard has been iced out [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=3288.6s)]
*  So peter doocy was reporting earlier that there was a meeting last week at camp david all the intel chiefs tulsi [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=3293.7999999999997s)]
*  Not invited and donald trump yesterday when he was speaking on air force one [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=3300.68s)]
*  Someone said, you know tulsi testified just back in march [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=3305.8799999999997s)]
*  Uh that iran wasn't building a nuclear weapon and he goes I don't care what she said [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=3308.7599999999998s)]
*  And I have a lot of disagreements with tulsi and her policy, but she is a very clear [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=3312.8399999999997s)]
*  War dove right that was part of the reason I think he liked i think that that why didn't invite her [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=3319.16s)]
*  She's a dni. What i'm saying is trump's response was to the reporter meaning. I don't care [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=3324.52s)]
*  But then it was about the question not necessarily well, then why didn't she get to go to camp? [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=3329.72s)]
*  I mean you're talking about gossip jessica. We're talking about [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=3333.0s)]
*  And destruction and you're talking about gossips [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=3337.4s)]
*  We asked you or he asked you what you thought of this situation and it's all gossip and like it doesn't matter all that [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=3341.08s)]
*  I it's harder to do what you think we should do about iran. What do you think the commander in chief has done so far? [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=3348.52s)]
*  What do you think about our allies the balance of power in the middle east? [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=3354.6s)]
*  You don't have anything to say. Oh, you're just dead. It sounds like us weekly [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=3358.12s)]
*  It's harder to defend two global wars and jessica's defense in the losing of a country of the talibani [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=3362.68s)]
*  That's much harder totally capable of defending myself and I did express what I thought about it [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=3367.48s)]
*  I think that bb is in charge of what's going on and you think that's good or bad jessica [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=3371.7999999999997s)]
*  I think it is a lot easier to say that iran deserves to lose its nuclear program and to be wiped out [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=3376.9199999999996s)]
*  Than what's going on on the gaza side and he has a lot more support for that including from the republican base [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=3382.3599999999997s)]
*  There's interesting polling that the senate the gop senators are using which show actually that the maga base is supportive [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=3387.24s)]
*  Oh kaylee's nodding. So now I agree with you. I agree with you [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=3393.7999999999997s)]
*  Very highly detailed conversation. That is a good spread of the opinion out there. Let's bring in brad [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=3397.4799999999996s)]
*  Wenstrup member of the president's intelligence advisory board former ohio republican congressman retired army reservist who served [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=3402.4399999999996s)]
*  In iraq, um, very good to have you with us today, sir [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=3410.2799999999997s)]
*  You hear the mix on capitol hill ram paul very much against dick durbin very [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=3413.24s)]
*  Nervous very concerned about getting dragged into the war and john federman saying, you know, we should have taken out khomeini [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=3418.52s)]
*  So what do you think? [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=3425.8s)]
*  Well as someone who remembers very vividly [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=3429.16s)]
*  1979 when iran took americans hostage and someone who served in the war in iraq [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=3432.26s)]
*  and we were constantly being bombarded by [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=3438.04s)]
*  The iranian armaments that sullivan was providing [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=3441.24s)]
*  I have no love for this regime. You know, the world watches what donald trump says and they hear what donald trump's [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=3446.04s)]
*  Has to say as well [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=3453.56s)]
*  And he has always been seeking peace and he laments every time that there are lives lost [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=3455.3199999999997s)]
*  And this is who the president united states is but he is determined to protect americans in our interests [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=3461.08s)]
*  And I know we've moved some carriers into the region that's not uncommon but for the last 60 days we have had a negotiator [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=3466.92s)]
*  Trying to make peace with iran, but the key component is [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=3474.52s)]
*  No nukes for iran that is where the president I think has been very clear that they cannot have a nuclear weapon [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=3479.32s)]
*  And and for the president right now, he's frustrated [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=3487.7200000000003s)]
*  and with those negotiations [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=3491.08s)]
*  Uh netanyahu waited until that time period had elapsed and I don't think the president wants to ceasefire as much as he wants [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=3493.88s)]
*  Iranians to have no nuclear weapons, but we'll see what he comes out and says [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=3501.94s)]
*  But just keep in mind. This is a president when american lives were on the line [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=3508.44s)]
*  He was the one who made the call to take out sullimani. So he will protect americans at all costs [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=3512.44s)]
*  And uh, he's i'm sure [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=3519.16s)]
*  In close contact with netanyahu and what they are planning and what they have done and what they have done has been truly [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=3521.64s)]
*  Magnificent if you pointed out on your show how surgically they have been taking out the leadership [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=3528.42s)]
*  Of the iranians and I think if I was the ayatollah, I would be pretty concerned about myself as you see [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=3534.2799999999997s)]
*  They must have tremendous intelligence to be able to carry out what they've been carrying out. Absolutely [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=3540.92s)]
*  And you know in the past [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=3546.2s)]
*  There were all these proxies there was lebanon. There were the hutis there were [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=3548.6s)]
*  Uh, there was hamas. I mean none of these people are coming to [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=3553.4s)]
*  His aid to the ayatollah's aid even russia is is barely, you know, they've made a couple of little comments [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=3558.12s)]
*  Uh here and there about what's going on, but they are so isolated right now in iran and you hear our last guest [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=3564.2799999999997s)]
*  Uh congressman wens trip talking about basically the ayatollah 86 years old [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=3570.68s)]
*  His you know, people don't think his son is really the person to take up the reins if anything happens to him [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=3576.04s)]
*  Raese was taken down in a helicopter [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=3581.7799999999997s)]
*  Crash, so I mean this thing is very tenuous and an opportunity is is always an important moment to take advantage of [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=3584.8399999999997s)]
*  But you hear members of congress saying, you know, we're not getting dragged into another war [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=3592.7599999999998s)]
*  Is that the way you see this would if we helped right now would it lead to a long war? [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=3596.6000000000004s)]
*  And you know just in my best guess I would say it would not but let me tell you something else [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=3603.4s)]
*  I was in an uber the next day after that initial strike [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=3608.28s)]
*  Ironically the driver was a legal immigrant from iran [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=3613.46s)]
*  And all he had to say is all of iran is happy today [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=3618.1200000000003s)]
*  Yeah [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=3622.44s)]
*  That is what he said to me and I believe that and we've thought that for for many years in the united states that the iranian [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=3623.32s)]
*  People are not to blame it is this regime that is the problem [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=3629.88s)]
*  And people live with with the fear of death, obviously if they go against the regime [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=3633.8s)]
*  and uh, so I think that there's uh more to it when you look inside iran and you see these leaders being taken down [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=3638.92s)]
*  And and the people in in iran saying please spare us [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=3647.1600000000003s)]
*  Because we're probably with you on where you're what you're trying to accomplish here [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=3651.72s)]
*  Yeah, and that's no doubt why president trump called for people to evacuate teran [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=3656.12s)]
*  Um, because you know you want them the people of iran [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=3661.8s)]
*  Uh, so many of them to who want freedom they want to get out from underneath this oppressive regime that has been there since 1979 [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=3665.96s)]
*  Doesn't allow anyone any freedoms at all [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=3674.36s)]
*  Um, and this moment is very important just just put this up and we'll get a quick thought [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=3676.6s)]
*  This is from trump on truth social today. We know exactly where the so-called supreme leader is hiding [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=3680.2000000000003s)]
*  He is an easy target but is safe there [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=3686.52s)]
*  We are not going to take him out and then in parentheses kill with an exclamation point at least not for now [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=3689.7200000000003s)]
*  But we do we don't want missiles shot at civilians or american soldiers. Our patience is wearing thin [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=3696.2000000000003s)]
*  Thank you, he said for attention to your to this matter which he ends most of these kinds of posts with quick thought before we go, sir [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=3701.4799999999996s)]
*  Well, I think that's consistent with what I was saying in my feelings word with this president is that he respects life so much [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=3710.2799999999997s)]
*  He does not want innocent people with people to be taken out [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=3716.9199999999996s)]
*  And he has tried as best he can with frustration to try and deal with this regime [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=3720.4399999999996s)]
*  And the bottom line is no nukes and we want peace [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=3726.28s)]
*  And he'll try to work on that in any way that he possibly can in spare lives [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=3730.28s)]
*  Yeah, well, uh the ayatollah basically has one thing left and that is this nuclear program [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=3734.92s)]
*  Which is getting attacked pretty much every day and his chance of death to america. Everything else is pretty much falling out from under him [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=3739.8s)]
*  So we'll see where this goes brad wens trip. Thank you very much. Good to have you here [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=3745.8s)]
*  Do that thing [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=3750.76s)]

*  Yeah, jesse you can hear behind me there are sirens sounding as ballistic missiles are fired at this city [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=3763.88s)]
*  Air defense systems are currently active [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=3771.2400000000002s)]
*  Over tel aviv with hundreds of thousands of people into bomb shelters at this moment [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=3774.2799999999997s)]
*  Unhooked get off. All right, we got it. We're gonna move. Okay. Stay with us stay with us [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=3781.64s)]
*  Stay with us keep moving keep moving keep moving keep moving. Give me one second. Jesse. I'm with you. I gotta fix my ifb [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=3789.64s)]
*  Okay [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=3795.8s)]
*  One second jesse we're gonna give you a quick update [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=3801.96s)]
*  I'm with you [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=3809.32s)]
*  Jesse I got you back. There's a shelter in place order right now. We hear the sirens trea. Are you with me? [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=3819.0s)]
*  Jesse i'm with you. We got disconnected for a moment from my ifb there you could see a lot of those missiles coming off [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=3824.36s)]
*  As they were trying to intercept some of that incoming fire [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=3831.88s)]
*  We saw the first one go out to the sea and because they could track where it was going they let it get intercepted out at sea [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=3835.96s)]
*  This is an indication that the iranians still as the americans are deciding whether or not they want to get involved in this war [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=3843.88s)]
*  Are firing on major population centers [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=3850.2799999999997s)]
*  Again, we have to make the decisions very quickly to move. That's part of what you just saw there [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=3852.9199999999996s)]
*  We'll stay as long as we can and you can hear there's a massive explosion overhead [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=3857.48s)]
*  and [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=3861.8799999999997s)]
*  once we have [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=3862.9199999999996s)]
*  Another minute we're going to go out and see if anything was hit but you could just hear that explosion there jesse [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=3864.12s)]
*  And that's why we get off the balcony as the fire starts to get heavier [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=3869.64s)]
*  But again, this has been going on for the past four days as the iranians [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=3873.96s)]
*  respond to these [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=3878.12s)]
*  Strikes that are taking place across their territory and despite the fact that the israelis told us earlier today [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=3879.64s)]
*  That they were able to take out around 40 percent of the missile launchers [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=3886.52s)]
*  we understand that [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=3890.7599999999998s)]
*  They have not been able to take out all of them. And so we expect to see more of this type of fire [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=3893.0s)]
*  in the days ahead [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=3899.0s)]
*  Trey, what is your understanding from? [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=3901.64s)]
*  the intelligence community how much [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=3905.0s)]
*  Missiles have the iranians stockpiled are they able to go? [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=3908.52s)]
*  Tit for tat with israel and for how long? [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=3914.12s)]
*  Yeah, so they have around 2000 missiles according to a senior israeli intelligence official that I spoke with [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=3920.3599999999997s)]
*  Over the weekend the concern here is that they're not able to hit all of the stockpiles because the iranians have been preparing [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=3927.16s)]
*  For the war that is currently taking place [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=3933.96s)]
*  With israel for the past few decades and so they not only will stockpile [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=3936.6s)]
*  Missiles in the sides of mountains and deep underground [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=3941.88s)]
*  But they hide the launchers and so these are mobile launchers in many cases [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=3944.92s)]
*  Eventually, they will run out of missiles and that is part of the reason that israeli officials are encouraging the united states to get involved [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=3949.4s)]
*  at this very moment [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=3956.28s)]
*  Because they understand it's a window of opportunity they have weakened the iranians [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=3957.96s)]
*  Enough that they they've taken out many of the missile launching platforms [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=3963.0s)]
*  They have struck both the isfahan and the natanz nuclear facilities [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=3967.64s)]
*  And they have left just really a large facility called the four dot facility [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=3972.2s)]
*  Where the most advanced part of the iranian nuclear program is currently developing? [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=3977.24s)]
*  And so if we see the americans get involved [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=3983.16s)]
*  This is one of the likely targets because america has bunker buster bombs [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=3986.04s)]
*  They have the ability to strike even deeper underground than the israelis do [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=3989.88s)]
*  And according to that pilot that I spoke with earlier an israeli fighter jet pilot [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=3994.6800000000003s)]
*  He told me they've taken out much of the air defense around the iranian capital and this gives israel the ability [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=3999.56s)]
*  to start striking [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=4006.2000000000003s)]
*  In in deeper parts of tehran [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=4008.44s)]
*  And we're just going to walk back out here jesse because again we it's a very fluid situation when we're covering these moments and you will notice [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=4011.6400000000003s)]
*  Over the past four days whenever we have to make decisions we make them very quickly [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=4019.48s)]
*  We have a security team member with us and they address how much incoming fire we're getting what direction it's coming from [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=4023.16s)]
*  And when they make the call we move very quickly to get out of the way and get cover from what I can see here [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=4029.4s)]
*  There are no direct impacts [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=4036.12s)]
*  Uh in this area we'll get initial reports in [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=4038.52s)]
*  About other parts of central israel. We're very careful about the locations understanding [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=4041.96s)]
*  That is it's a volatile situation that is changing each and every minute jesse. All right tre [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axcseINnris&t=4046.6s)]
