# 'The Five’ reveals who has more ‘moral authority': US or CHINA?
**Fox News - World News:** [June 13, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvfsDeXnCq0)
*  Fox News alert. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvfsDeXnCq0&t=0.0s)]
*  Israel is under attack from Iran after taking out their new sites and top military leaders. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvfsDeXnCq0&t=2.02s)]
*  For what this means for the U.S. and our troops overseas in the Middle East, let's go right [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvfsDeXnCq0&t=6.48s)]
*  to Jennifer Griffin live from the Pentagon. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvfsDeXnCq0&t=10.1s)]
*  Hey, Jennifer. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvfsDeXnCq0&t=12.08s)]
*  Hi, Greg. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvfsDeXnCq0&t=13.08s)]
*  Well, U.S. officials who I've spoken to here at the Pentagon tell me that both U.S. Navy [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvfsDeXnCq0&t=14.08s)]
*  and U.S. Army assets were used to help track and shoot down incoming Iranian missiles. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvfsDeXnCq0&t=18.68s)]
*  However, the U.S. does not want to appear to be involved in this direct conflict between [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvfsDeXnCq0&t=24.28s)]
*  Israel and Iran. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvfsDeXnCq0&t=28.74s)]
*  The president would like for Iran to come back to the negotiating table. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvfsDeXnCq0&t=30.099999999999998s)]
*  As we speak, CENTCOM is moving more air and naval assets into the region. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvfsDeXnCq0&t=34.18s)]
*  U.S. Navy officials tell us U.S. Navy assets have been used to protect Israel and the hundreds [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvfsDeXnCq0&t=38.5s)]
*  of thousands of Americans living there. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvfsDeXnCq0&t=44.06s)]
*  The USS Thomas Hudner, a guided missile destroyer, is moving from the western Mediterranean to [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvfsDeXnCq0&t=46.42s)]
*  the eastern Med near Israel, joining the USS Sullivan's and the USS Arleigh Burke, which [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvfsDeXnCq0&t=51.739999999999995s)]
*  are already in position off the coast of Israel. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvfsDeXnCq0&t=57.82s)]
*  Fox's Lucas Tomlinson learned that the U.S. Army had employed the THAAD missile defense [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvfsDeXnCq0&t=60.620000000000005s)]
*  system, which can shoot down an incoming ballistic missile from 120 miles out, and the Patriot [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvfsDeXnCq0&t=65.86s)]
*  PAC-3 battery, which has about one, each of those has about 100 U.S. soldiers manning [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvfsDeXnCq0&t=72.86s)]
*  them inside Israel tonight. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvfsDeXnCq0&t=78.42s)]
*  The U.S. sent one THAAD battery in October of last year and another in April, two of [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvfsDeXnCq0&t=80.58s)]
*  the seven in the Army's arsenal. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvfsDeXnCq0&t=85.74s)]
*  The U.S. has one aircraft carrier strike group in the Middle East right now. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvfsDeXnCq0&t=88.14s)]
*  The USS Carl Vinson in the Arabian Sea off the coast of Oman, where those Iran nuclear [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvfsDeXnCq0&t=91.61999999999999s)]
*  talks were supposed to take place on Sunday. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvfsDeXnCq0&t=97.62s)]
*  Now many Iranian leaders who were supposed to participate in those talks are dead, killed [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvfsDeXnCq0&t=100.22s)]
*  in Israeli strikes. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvfsDeXnCq0&t=105.74s)]
*  A senior Israeli security source told me last night Iran had accumulated large amounts of [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvfsDeXnCq0&t=107.3s)]
*  highly enriched uranium sufficient for more than nine nuclear bombs. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvfsDeXnCq0&t=112.34s)]
*  One third of that was enriched and accumulated in the last three months alone while those [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvfsDeXnCq0&t=116.78s)]
*  negotiations were taking place. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvfsDeXnCq0&t=121.9s)]
*  That's why Israel decided to act. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvfsDeXnCq0&t=124.54s)]
*  The International Atomic Energy Agency said tonight that the above ground Natanz uranium [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvfsDeXnCq0&t=126.66s)]
*  enrichment facility was destroyed in the Israeli air strikes overnight. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvfsDeXnCq0&t=131.9s)]
*  Greg? [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvfsDeXnCq0&t=136.62s)]
*  Thanks, Jennifer. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvfsDeXnCq0&t=137.62s)]
*  In the meantime, CommaList failed VEEP Tim Walz now suggesting that Communist China might [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvfsDeXnCq0&t=138.94s)]
*  be the voice of moral authority following Israel's strikes on Iran. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvfsDeXnCq0&t=143.86s)]
*  Now who is the voice in the world that can negotiate some type of agreement in this? [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvfsDeXnCq0&t=149.06s)]
*  Who holds the moral authority? [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvfsDeXnCq0&t=154.66s)]
*  Who holds the ability to do that? [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvfsDeXnCq0&t=156.58s)]
*  Because we are not seen as a neutral actor. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvfsDeXnCq0&t=158.74s)]
*  Now I ask who that is. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvfsDeXnCq0&t=161.08s)]
*  And I mean consistently over and over again we're going to have to face the reality it [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvfsDeXnCq0&t=163.06s)]
*  might be the Chinese. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvfsDeXnCq0&t=168.98s)]
*  So Charlie if you wanted to do a deep fake to make Tim Walz look like a complete jackass [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvfsDeXnCq0&t=171.18s)]
*  you couldn't even be that. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvfsDeXnCq0&t=177.22s)]
*  No you really couldn't. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvfsDeXnCq0&t=178.9s)]
*  No he has a background with China. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvfsDeXnCq0&t=179.9s)]
*  So this is like I mean what's going on here? [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvfsDeXnCq0&t=182.82s)]
*  It's so funny you said that because when I first saw it on like Twitter and the first [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvfsDeXnCq0&t=186.34s)]
*  thing I did when I saw it was I went back and look I was like well obviously this is [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvfsDeXnCq0&t=190.92s)]
*  not real and then finally I got back to C-SPAN and I was like well C-SPAN is not shipping [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvfsDeXnCq0&t=193.67999999999998s)]
*  around deep fakes. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvfsDeXnCq0&t=199.0s)]
*  But it is. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvfsDeXnCq0&t=200.0s)]
*  No it's beyond absurdity. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvfsDeXnCq0&t=201.0s)]
*  And this is the standard bearer that Democrats just six months ago had picked out of nowhere. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvfsDeXnCq0&t=204.32s)]
*  You could have picked anybody but they picked this guy. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvfsDeXnCq0&t=210.11999999999998s)]
*  And I really do think that it's sort of you know it's a reminder of where we are big picture. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvfsDeXnCq0&t=213.32s)]
*  You have decades of you know Barack Obama won the Nobel Peace Prize before he even became [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvfsDeXnCq0&t=219.16s)]
*  president in 2008. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvfsDeXnCq0&t=226.16s)]
*  He wasn't even inaugurated yet and he was granted the Nobel Peace Prize in part because [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvfsDeXnCq0&t=227.9s)]
*  they thought he was going to solve the Middle East. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvfsDeXnCq0&t=232.07999999999998s)]
*  These problems are problems that we've been talking about forever. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvfsDeXnCq0&t=234.01999999999998s)]
*  They've been intractable forever and nobody has ever. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvfsDeXnCq0&t=236.51999999999998s)]
*  We've just sort of resigned ourselves to thinking that nothing will ever move over there. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvfsDeXnCq0&t=238.68s)]
*  And then you take Don from Queens who comes at it from a completely different perspective [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvfsDeXnCq0&t=243.04s)]
*  understanding human nature and applies all the parts and applies all the pressures and [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvfsDeXnCq0&t=249.11999999999998s)]
*  then suddenly things begin to break loose. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvfsDeXnCq0&t=253.35999999999999s)]
*  And it does make you kind of wonder if Trump had not had his interregnum his interrupt [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvfsDeXnCq0&t=256.15999999999997s)]
*  his interruptus. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvfsDeXnCq0&t=261.88s)]
*  Good word. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvfsDeXnCq0&t=262.88s)]
*  You know would would we not even be talking about this right now. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvfsDeXnCq0&t=263.88s)]
*  Would Saudi Arabia and Israel and all of its neighbors already be living in peace and like [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvfsDeXnCq0&t=267.38s)]
*  you know trading you know mercantile goods instead of missiles. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvfsDeXnCq0&t=273.28s)]
*  Good point Jessica. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvfsDeXnCq0&t=279.08000000000004s)]
*  May I operate an analogy. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvfsDeXnCq0&t=280.08000000000004s)]
*  I think so. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvfsDeXnCq0&t=282.8s)]
*  I'm a little afraid but imagine the Democrat Party is a face and Tim Walz is like a cold [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvfsDeXnCq0&t=283.8s)]
*  sore that goes away for a few weeks and it keeps coming back and every time it comes [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvfsDeXnCq0&t=290.6s)]
*  back it's more inflamed. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvfsDeXnCq0&t=295.56s)]
*  It's more inflamed. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvfsDeXnCq0&t=298.2s)]
*  What would you do to get rid of this cold sore that seems to be just. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvfsDeXnCq0&t=299.64s)]
*  The hand of the lot. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvfsDeXnCq0&t=303.96s)]
*  Yes. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvfsDeXnCq0&t=305.56s)]
*  You guys need some industrial political strength Valtrex. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvfsDeXnCq0&t=306.56s)]
*  I was going to say I didn't want to make it seem like I knew too much about this because [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvfsDeXnCq0&t=309.84s)]
*  I don't have her big simplex. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvfsDeXnCq0&t=314.47999999999996s)]
*  But now that you've said Valtrex that is the solution. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvfsDeXnCq0&t=317.08s)]
*  I too thought maybe I was being punked and I know Tim Walz doesn't care about me much [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvfsDeXnCq0&t=320.76s)]
*  but he should have known that I was going to have to show up at work today and talk [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvfsDeXnCq0&t=326.35999999999996s)]
*  about this clip. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvfsDeXnCq0&t=331.59999999999997s)]
*  There are so many good ways to talk about mistakes Donald Trump has made without saying [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvfsDeXnCq0&t=333.16s)]
*  that the Chinese are the arbiters of good principles or whatever the exact phrase theology [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvfsDeXnCq0&t=341.52000000000004s)]
*  was. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvfsDeXnCq0&t=349.72s)]
*  Donald Trump's proposed Iran nuclear deal part two is the same one that he ripped up. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvfsDeXnCq0&t=351.48s)]
*  If you want to say Iran's been enriching uranium at this fast pace. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvfsDeXnCq0&t=358.8s)]
*  Well go figure it's because we ripped up the nuclear deal. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvfsDeXnCq0&t=362.12s)]
*  Make that case if you want to. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvfsDeXnCq0&t=366.08s)]
*  You can talk about any number of things but you don't need to talk about that. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvfsDeXnCq0&t=368.04s)]
*  And it's a big point of frustration. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvfsDeXnCq0&t=372.96000000000004s)]
*  We don't have to be reflexively against everything. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvfsDeXnCq0&t=374.8s)]
*  You pick and choose your spots and you make a cogent case. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvfsDeXnCq0&t=378.0s)]
*  And I think that you can do that quite effectively. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvfsDeXnCq0&t=382.04s)]
*  But when you dismiss things like the Abraham Accords and I know that he's going for the [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvfsDeXnCq0&t=384.56s)]
*  Abraham Accords part two and thinks that he'll have extra nations that will sign on and that's [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvfsDeXnCq0&t=388.48s)]
*  what might be his best chance at getting the peace prize. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvfsDeXnCq0&t=392.88s)]
*  I think you need to say yay to this and nay to that. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvfsDeXnCq0&t=396.20000000000005s)]
*  So you seem like a normal human being and then people will consider us to be president [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvfsDeXnCq0&t=399.32s)]
*  again in twenty twenty eight. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvfsDeXnCq0&t=403.64000000000004s)]
*  That is a high bar to expect Tim Walz to be a normal human being. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvfsDeXnCq0&t=405.0s)]
*  Bartha what is the Chinese piece to this? [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvfsDeXnCq0&t=408.16s)]
*  Why did he bring it up? [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvfsDeXnCq0&t=412.12s)]
*  I don't understand this. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvfsDeXnCq0&t=413.12s)]
*  And we know he went to China many times and he was he's involved in some kind of. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvfsDeXnCq0&t=414.32s)]
*  Denim and Tim as Jesse would say. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvfsDeXnCq0&t=418.4s)]
*  Yes exactly. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvfsDeXnCq0&t=420.23999999999995s)]
*  So he knows it really well. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvfsDeXnCq0&t=421.23999999999995s)]
*  Greg it's obvious. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvfsDeXnCq0&t=422.59999999999997s)]
*  Yes. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvfsDeXnCq0&t=423.59999999999997s)]
*  China expert. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvfsDeXnCq0&t=424.59999999999997s)]
*  And that's why. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvfsDeXnCq0&t=425.59999999999997s)]
*  No but I kept thinking as all this was unfolding about the only two people who might be sitting [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvfsDeXnCq0&t=426.59999999999997s)]
*  around the globe going oh you know we're this kind of axis of evil of Russia and Iran and [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvfsDeXnCq0&t=431.84s)]
*  China and you see Russia reaching out. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvfsDeXnCq0&t=439.12s)]
*  Well I can come up with some sort of deal. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvfsDeXnCq0&t=441.67999999999995s)]
*  Just get me in there and I'll fix it just like I did with Ukraine and my own country. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvfsDeXnCq0&t=443.52s)]
*  But China's tea is very mum. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvfsDeXnCq0&t=447.64s)]
*  So I don't think China is going to be the moral authority because when they are in this [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvfsDeXnCq0&t=449.64s)]
*  situation they like to sit back and just sort of whistle a little bit because they're not [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvfsDeXnCq0&t=452.48s)]
*  going to get in the middle of this whole thing. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvfsDeXnCq0&t=457.2s)]
*  But what I find fascinating is that you know with regard to the Iran deal Jessica this [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvfsDeXnCq0&t=459.22s)]
*  I think this Iran deal was not the old Iran deal because this Iran deal had verifiable [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvfsDeXnCq0&t=463.92s)]
*  anytime anywhere inspections. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvfsDeXnCq0&t=470.16s)]
*  They don't want that. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvfsDeXnCq0&t=471.84000000000003s)]
*  This Iran deal had restrictions on ballistic ballistic missiles which we know they like [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvfsDeXnCq0&t=473.56s)]
*  very much. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvfsDeXnCq0&t=478.0s)]
*  We've seen them using them all day today. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvfsDeXnCq0&t=479.0s)]
*  So they they did not want this deal. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvfsDeXnCq0&t=480.36s)]
*  And Trump kept saying to them super simple. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvfsDeXnCq0&t=483.24s)]
*  All you have to do is sign on the dotted line. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvfsDeXnCq0&t=485.22s)]
*  I will never have a nuclear weapon and we'll know if you do because we're going to be in [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvfsDeXnCq0&t=487.36s)]
*  your facilities whenever we want to. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvfsDeXnCq0&t=490.64000000000004s)]
*  They could not be humiliations a huge factor in Iran right now. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvfsDeXnCq0&t=494.34000000000003s)]
*  They have as I said before zero economy. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvfsDeXnCq0&t=498.22s)]
*  Their currency has crashed. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvfsDeXnCq0&t=500.96000000000004s)]
*  They have about half the population living in poverty and they have a huge significant [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvfsDeXnCq0&t=502.76s)]
*  part of the population who wants the leadership gone. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvfsDeXnCq0&t=506.52s)]
*  They are desperate at this point. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvfsDeXnCq0&t=509.5s)]
*  So the only thing they have was the threat of nuclear weapons and chanting death to America [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvfsDeXnCq0&t=512.3199999999999s)]
*  every five minutes. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvfsDeXnCq0&t=517.92s)]
*  Everybody else in the neighborhood wants them wants them gone toppled. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvfsDeXnCq0&t=519.84s)]
*  And so this is a unique moment and Israel recognized and I think President Trump even [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvfsDeXnCq0&t=523.62s)]
*  does not like war and doesn't want this to turn into a war. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvfsDeXnCq0&t=528.56s)]
*  Understood the importance of the moment. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvfsDeXnCq0&t=533.8s)]
*  Last word Katie. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvfsDeXnCq0&t=536.16s)]
*  Do you know what's going on with with him in China? [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvfsDeXnCq0&t=537.16s)]
*  Well I would say that although the Iranians have been humiliated over the last 24 hours [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvfsDeXnCq0&t=541.92s)]
*  then you trot out Tim Walsh and have him talk about this serious situation and bring up [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvfsDeXnCq0&t=546.4399999999999s)]
*  something weird like China. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvfsDeXnCq0&t=550.56s)]
*  Tim Walsh wants to be president. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvfsDeXnCq0&t=553.52s)]
*  He wants to be the commander in chief. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvfsDeXnCq0&t=554.88s)]
*  Over the past 24 hours what this has actually highlighted is that we don't have really any [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvfsDeXnCq0&t=556.96s)]
*  kind of drone protection here in the United States and China has purchased a lot of farmland [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvfsDeXnCq0&t=562.08s)]
*  in this country. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvfsDeXnCq0&t=566.76s)]
*  China has tried to smuggle in agricultural bio weapons to disrupt the crops in this country. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvfsDeXnCq0&t=568.08s)]
*  There are spies all over our university system and you have Tim Walsh who instead of taking [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvfsDeXnCq0&t=573.76s)]
*  a step and saying why is that we lost the 2024 election because we were so insane and [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvfsDeXnCq0&t=578.84s)]
*  out of touch with reality and the threats that face the country. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvfsDeXnCq0&t=584.1s)]
*  He then throws the United States under the bus and says that China is the one who should [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvfsDeXnCq0&t=587.66s)]
*  begin negotiating these things even though they also have been enemies of the United [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvfsDeXnCq0&t=592.22s)]
*  States. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvfsDeXnCq0&t=596.02s)]
*  So he's not a serious person. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvfsDeXnCq0&t=597.02s)]
*  We have very serious issues with China and yet he thinks that they should be dealing [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvfsDeXnCq0&t=598.3000000000001s)]
*  with the situation and no one thinks that Tim Walsh and Kamala Harris could handle this [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvfsDeXnCq0&t=601.82s)]
*  better. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvfsDeXnCq0&t=605.38s)]
*  No one. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvfsDeXnCq0&t=606.38s)]
*  You all got the question wrong. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvfsDeXnCq0&t=607.38s)]
*  He's a communist. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvfsDeXnCq0&t=608.38s)]
*  Well that's true. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvfsDeXnCq0&t=609.38s)]
