# Trump's strike on Iran gives this to the US and to the world: Rebeccah Heinrichs
**Fox News - World News:** [June 25, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDSCG_F00wU)
*  Let's bring in Hudson Institute senior fellow Rebecca Heinrichs. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDSCG_F00wU&t=0.0s)]
*  And Rebecca, I'm sure you were listening to the president's press conference there last [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDSCG_F00wU&t=4.8s)]
*  hour. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDSCG_F00wU&t=7.94s)]
*  Lasted about 20 to about 30 minutes. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDSCG_F00wU&t=8.94s)]
*  A lot was covered. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDSCG_F00wU&t=10.86s)]
*  The number one takeaway I think a lot of us had was about what NATO is going to do going [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDSCG_F00wU&t=12.9s)]
*  forward, but we cannot look past his comments on what happened with regard to the bombing [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDSCG_F00wU&t=18.56s)]
*  in Iran over the weekend. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDSCG_F00wU&t=24.18s)]
*  Saying statements as to the future, phrases like they are not going to enrich, the last [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDSCG_F00wU&t=26.98s)]
*  thing they want to do is enrich, they are not going to do it again, and I think they've [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDSCG_F00wU&t=32.24s)]
*  had it. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDSCG_F00wU&t=37.9s)]
*  What do you make of the president's comments on Iran's willingness and capability to develop [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDSCG_F00wU&t=39.02s)]
*  a nuke in the future? [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDSCG_F00wU&t=44.0s)]
*  Well, look, I mean, you can only take care of the problems immediately in front of you. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDSCG_F00wU&t=46.0s)]
*  And so we took care of the Iranian nuclear program just a few days ago. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDSCG_F00wU&t=51.480000000000004s)]
*  If the Iranians are so foolish as to make more problems for us, I have no doubt that [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDSCG_F00wU&t=55.16s)]
*  President Trump will take care of that problem as well. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDSCG_F00wU&t=59.16s)]
*  Look, I think this is a big deal. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDSCG_F00wU&t=61.459999999999994s)]
*  I think that this is a really big deal that President Trump took decisive action, demonstrated [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDSCG_F00wU&t=63.099999999999994s)]
*  incredible military power and military capability to take out the Iranian nuclear program. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDSCG_F00wU&t=66.82s)]
*  And also it gives President Trump and the United States a lot of credibility that we [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDSCG_F00wU&t=73.28s)]
*  will do what we say we're going to do. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDSCG_F00wU&t=77.9s)]
*  You're talking about NATO. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDSCG_F00wU&t=80.16s)]
*  He's now at the NATO summit. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDSCG_F00wU&t=81.16s)]
*  NATO can be confident that the United States has the military capability and a president [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDSCG_F00wU&t=82.98s)]
*  who has the will to say what he means if, in fact, you have a country that crosses us [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDSCG_F00wU&t=87.78s)]
*  like the Iran regime did. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDSCG_F00wU&t=93.30000000000001s)]
*  And I think that that bolsters the credibility of NATO as well. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDSCG_F00wU&t=94.46000000000001s)]
*  Understood. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDSCG_F00wU&t=97.06s)]
*  Here's more of what the president had to say just moments ago. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDSCG_F00wU&t=98.06s)]
*  Very good. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDSCG_F00wU&t=100.02000000000001s)]
*  I think very good. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDSCG_F00wU&t=101.02000000000001s)]
*  Israel came back yesterday. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDSCG_F00wU&t=104.02000000000001s)]
*  I was so proud of them because they came back. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDSCG_F00wU&t=105.02000000000001s)]
*  You know, they went out because they felt it was a violation. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDSCG_F00wU&t=107.74000000000001s)]
*  And technically they were right, but it just wouldn't have worked out very well. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDSCG_F00wU&t=111.24s)]
*  And they brought the planes back. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDSCG_F00wU&t=116.46s)]
*  They had gone on to another journey because it was a little bit of a violation. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDSCG_F00wU&t=117.67999999999999s)]
*  And I said, you got to get them back. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDSCG_F00wU&t=121.32s)]
*  And they came back and it was a great thing. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDSCG_F00wU&t=124.24s)]
*  And it's going very well. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDSCG_F00wU&t=126.08s)]
*  So the president confirming that the Israel-Iran ceasefire is going well for now. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDSCG_F00wU&t=128.18s)]
*  And he made that phone call to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to call the planes back [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDSCG_F00wU&t=133.57999999999998s)]
*  from a potential Iranian attack. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDSCG_F00wU&t=138.2s)]
*  While he was on the plane going to this NATO summit, he also said, Rebecca, during these [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDSCG_F00wU&t=140.64s)]
*  remarks to the media, that he believes that the United States is going to have some form [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDSCG_F00wU&t=145.48s)]
*  of relationship with Iran in the years to come after this current conflict is over. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDSCG_F00wU&t=149.48s)]
*  What do you think about that? [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDSCG_F00wU&t=155.4s)]
*  It feels like the president is doing the carrot and stick method, where Iran certainly saw [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDSCG_F00wU&t=156.4s)]
*  the stick and now the president could be offering them the carrot. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDSCG_F00wU&t=160.76s)]
*  Well, I think it's interesting. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDSCG_F00wU&t=164.32s)]
*  President Trump made the remark a few days ago that the United States does not have any [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDSCG_F00wU&t=167.35999999999999s)]
*  permanent enemies. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDSCG_F00wU&t=170.28s)]
*  And so he's always looking for improvement between relations. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDSCG_F00wU&t=171.64000000000001s)]
*  I'm skeptical that the Iran regime is anywhere near the state of mind to move forward with [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDSCG_F00wU&t=174.32s)]
*  a more positive relationship. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDSCG_F00wU&t=178.88s)]
*  But look, the option is still open. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDSCG_F00wU&t=180.4s)]
*  I do think it's important to note that even as President Trump tries to get the Israelis [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDSCG_F00wU&t=181.96s)]
*  to stand down on some of the more aggressive air campaign against the Iranians, there still [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDSCG_F00wU&t=187.28s)]
*  needs to be this. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDSCG_F00wU&t=192.92000000000002s)]
*  You still need to have Israelis inside the country doing, you know, private campaigns [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDSCG_F00wU&t=195.16s)]
*  to make sure they get any of the other illicit nuclear material out of out of Iran. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDSCG_F00wU&t=199.98s)]
*  So there's still going to be some military options, I think, going on inside Iran on [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDSCG_F00wU&t=205.38s)]
*  the part of the Israelis. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDSCG_F00wU&t=209.7s)]
*  I think the United States would be extremely wise to support that. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDSCG_F00wU&t=210.7s)]
*  It's just that we're not we're almost certainly not going to see these much more aggressive [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDSCG_F00wU&t=213.85999999999999s)]
*  air campaigns that that the Israelis have been so successful at carrying out thus far. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDSCG_F00wU&t=217.9s)]
*  And on the left hand side of your screen, Rebecca, the president of the United States, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDSCG_F00wU&t=222.92s)]
*  once again, now posing for a picture with I believe if my eyesight serves me, all that [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDSCG_F00wU&t=226.22s)]
*  is not Manuel Macron. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDSCG_F00wU&t=231.7s)]
*  I just need better glasses. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDSCG_F00wU&t=232.82s)]
*  OK, the secretary general. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDSCG_F00wU&t=234.1s)]
*  OK, before we let you go, I want to ask your thoughts on this. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDSCG_F00wU&t=235.29999999999998s)]
*  Within the past few hours, the Iranian parliament voting to suspend cooperation with the IAEA. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDSCG_F00wU&t=239.22s)]
*  Is that significant or was Iran's cooperation with the IAEA always tenuous at best? [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDSCG_F00wU&t=245.26s)]
*  Well, look, there's a lot of criticism from the expert community of President Trump that [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDSCG_F00wU&t=252.58s)]
*  because the United he authorized and directed the United States to take out Iran's nuclear [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDSCG_F00wU&t=257.66s)]
*  program that the United States was in violation of international law. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDSCG_F00wU&t=262.62s)]
*  My response to that is we just enforced the nonproliferation treaty, which the Iranians [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDSCG_F00wU&t=265.94s)]
*  were in violation of. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDSCG_F00wU&t=270.5s)]
*  So if the Iranians now decide that they're not going to cooperate with the IAEA, you [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDSCG_F00wU&t=271.92s)]
*  know, I say, look, that that organization is there to conduct inspections of your nuclear [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDSCG_F00wU&t=275.82s)]
*  program. You were already in violation of the nonproliferation treaty. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDSCG_F00wU&t=280.70000000000005s)]
*  So we'll see how this goes. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDSCG_F00wU&t=283.90000000000003s)]
*  I mean, I think right now we're going to hear a lot of upset rhetoric from the Iran regime, [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDSCG_F00wU&t=285.38000000000005s)]
*  understandably. I would like to see them comply with the IAEA. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDSCG_F00wU&t=289.94s)]
*  But we need to get the Iranians complying with all sorts of international norms of which [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDSCG_F00wU&t=293.3s)]
*  they've been in violation to this point. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDSCG_F00wU&t=296.66s)]
*  And we're hearing that all the world leaders are going to be gathering, they're going to [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDSCG_F00wU&t=298.18s)]
*  be taking a family photo. I love that name. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDSCG_F00wU&t=300.98s)]
*  And we're going to be bringing those images when they come in. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDSCG_F00wU&t=303.02000000000004s)]
*  But, Rebecca, something else I wanted to ask you about is that Iranian media is reporting [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDSCG_F00wU&t=305.62s)]
*  this morning that they have executed three Mossad spies that they're describing them [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDSCG_F00wU&t=311.78s)]
*  as Mossad spies that were living in Iran. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDSCG_F00wU&t=318.65999999999997s)]
*  And Iran is also saying that more than 700 people who they say were aligned with Israel [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDSCG_F00wU&t=321.46s)]
*  have been arrested over the last 12 days. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDSCG_F00wU&t=328.46s)]
*  So two questions really come to mind when it comes to that. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDSCG_F00wU&t=331.7s)]
*  Could those actions by Iran impact the ceasefire that is very fragile and taking place right [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDSCG_F00wU&t=335.26s)]
*  now? And also, could that create an uprising in Iran against the regime itself? [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDSCG_F00wU&t=340.65999999999997s)]
*  Well, I hope so, to answer your latter question. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDSCG_F00wU&t=347.18s)]
*  I mean, I think President Trump was right when a couple of days ago he said that essentially [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDSCG_F00wU&t=351.41999999999996s)]
*  we would welcome a change in the regime in Iran. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDSCG_F00wU&t=354.94s)]
*  The Iranian people are the ones that are going to have to do it. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDSCG_F00wU&t=359.09999999999997s)]
*  You're not going to see, I think, pressure from the United States downward to try to [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDSCG_F00wU&t=361.26s)]
*  make that happen. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDSCG_F00wU&t=365.86s)]
*  But clearly, we would want a secular regime that granted security and freedom and blessed [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDSCG_F00wU&t=366.86s)]
*  the Iranian people, if not and did not oppress the Iranian people. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDSCG_F00wU&t=371.7s)]
*  That would be good for the United States. That would be good for them. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDSCG_F00wU&t=375.46s)]
*  They're the ones that have suffered more than any other person under this Iran regime that's [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDSCG_F00wU&t=377.38s)]
*  really a jihadist regime and has been the most aggressive and active state sponsor of [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDSCG_F00wU&t=382.09999999999997s)]
*  terrorism and instability throughout the Middle East. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDSCG_F00wU&t=386.9s)]
*  I think we're going to hear a lot of, again, bad things coming out of the Iran regime because [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDSCG_F00wU&t=389.86s)]
*  they're flailing at this point. There's only so much they can do. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDSCG_F00wU&t=393.26s)]
*  But I think we should expect to hear some pretty terrible things coming out saying that [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDSCG_F00wU&t=396.7s)]
*  they are doing horrible things to the Iranian people and alleged misadvice. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDSCG_F00wU&t=400.21999999999997s)]
