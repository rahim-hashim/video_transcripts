# Dem slams Trump for 'unconstitutional' Iran strikes: 'Offensive war of choice'
**Fox News - World News:** [June 22, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEaOgeqXX1U)
*  Joining me now, Virginia Senator Tim Kaine, who serves on both the Senate Armed Services [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEaOgeqXX1U&t=0.0s)]
*  Committee and Foreign Relations Committee. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEaOgeqXX1U&t=4.12s)]
*  Senator, welcome back to Fox News Sunday. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEaOgeqXX1U&t=5.84s)]
*  Thank you, Shannon. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEaOgeqXX1U&t=9.28s)]
*  So prior to the action yesterday, you had introduced a war powers resolution. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEaOgeqXX1U&t=10.28s)]
*  You want to put this to a vote in the Senate. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEaOgeqXX1U&t=14.02s)]
*  My colleague, former federal prosecutor Andy McCarthy, has written at length about this [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEaOgeqXX1U&t=16.240000000000002s)]
*  over the last few days. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEaOgeqXX1U&t=20.64s)]
*  He argues the current authorization of use of military force that's been in effect since [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEaOgeqXX1U&t=21.64s)]
*  by presidents of both parties gives this president authority to go after any entity that aided [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEaOgeqXX1U&t=27.32s)]
*  or abetted the attackers of 9-11. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEaOgeqXX1U&t=33.0s)]
*  He says that's where Iran gets drawn in. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEaOgeqXX1U&t=35.6s)]
*  He writes this, in terms of the AUMF, there's no doubt that Iran aided and abetted al-Qaeda [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEaOgeqXX1U&t=37.24s)]
*  as it planned and executed the 9-11 attacks and that Iran harbored al-Qaeda in the aftermath [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEaOgeqXX1U&t=43.480000000000004s)]
*  of those attacks, which led to future acts of international terrorism against the U.S. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEaOgeqXX1U&t=48.84s)]
*  The AUMF thus endows President Trump with legal authority. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEaOgeqXX1U&t=53.28s)]
*  Again, he talks about presidents of both parties using it. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEaOgeqXX1U&t=56.6s)]
*  Jonathan Turley, who will be on the show later, also writes that there are a lot of more recent [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEaOgeqXX1U&t=59.88s)]
*  direct attacks that Iran and its proxies have had on Americans. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEaOgeqXX1U&t=63.760000000000005s)]
*  So why does that AUMF not work? [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEaOgeqXX1U&t=67.36s)]
*  Is it time to get rid of it? [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEaOgeqXX1U&t=68.98s)]
*  Shannon, the Senate has already ruled that the 2001 AUMF does not cover action against [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEaOgeqXX1U&t=71.68s)]
*  Iran because I filed a similar resolution a few years ago and we had to battle this [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEaOgeqXX1U&t=78.28s)]
*  out before the parliamentarian. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEaOgeqXX1U&t=83.92s)]
*  It's clear that there is no congressional authorization for Trump's war against Iran. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEaOgeqXX1U&t=85.52s)]
*  And I have filed a resolution that I think will get a vote later this week. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEaOgeqXX1U&t=91.52s)]
*  I thank Senator Schumer for pushing that we have a vote on this as soon as possible and [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEaOgeqXX1U&t=94.68s)]
*  we will have all members of the Senate have to declare whether or not the U.S. should [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEaOgeqXX1U&t=100.44s)]
*  be at war with Iran. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEaOgeqXX1U&t=105.92s)]
*  It's unconstitutional for a president to initiate a war like this without Congress. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEaOgeqXX1U&t=107.36s)]
*  Every member of Congress needs to vote on this. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEaOgeqXX1U&t=112.84s)]
*  Okay, let me play something from one of your GOP colleagues last night. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEaOgeqXX1U&t=114.76s)]
*  This is Senator Markwayne Mullen to that argument. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEaOgeqXX1U&t=117.7s)]
*  Underneath Article 2, it has been debated and put into court multiple times on what [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEaOgeqXX1U&t=122.48s)]
*  exactly the length of war powers have with the president having to come to Congress before [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEaOgeqXX1U&t=128.6s)]
*  he committed troops. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEaOgeqXX1U&t=135.36s)]
*  Troops. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEaOgeqXX1U&t=136.6s)]
*  We didn't commit necessarily troops here, but it also goes on to say, according to court [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEaOgeqXX1U&t=137.6s)]
*  rulings, that if we are attacked, the commander in chief, not the president of the United [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEaOgeqXX1U&t=142.12s)]
*  States at the time, but now he becomes commander in chief, has the authority and the ability [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEaOgeqXX1U&t=146.6s)]
*  to protect Americans home and abroad if we feel threatened or attacked, including our [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEaOgeqXX1U&t=151.4s)]
*  assets. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEaOgeqXX1U&t=157.6s)]
*  There is no question Iran has threatened us and there is no question they have attacked [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEaOgeqXX1U&t=158.6s)]
*  us. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEaOgeqXX1U&t=163.2s)]
*  It is well within the president's authority to be able to do just exactly what he's doing. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEaOgeqXX1U&t=164.2s)]
*  So Senator, he'll be likely a no vote on your resolution. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEaOgeqXX1U&t=170.04s)]
*  Do you think any other Republicans though cross the aisle with you? [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEaOgeqXX1U&t=172.92s)]
*  Yes, we will have Republican votes. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEaOgeqXX1U&t=176.48s)]
*  How many? [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEaOgeqXX1U&t=179.2s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEaOgeqXX1U&t=180.2s)]
*  There's going to be a briefing on Tuesday. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEaOgeqXX1U&t=181.2s)]
*  Look, America was lied into a war in 2002 against Iraq with a Republican administration [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEaOgeqXX1U&t=182.2s)]
*  giving us false information about Iraq's weapons program. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEaOgeqXX1U&t=188.56s)]
*  I have grave concern that we're going down the same path. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEaOgeqXX1U&t=192.92s)]
*  Donald Trump's own national security officials have stated that Iran was not close to having [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEaOgeqXX1U&t=196.16s)]
*  a nuclear weapon. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEaOgeqXX1U&t=201.16s)]
*  And Shannon, just Friday night, the Israeli foreign minister said that its bombing campaign [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEaOgeqXX1U&t=202.6s)]
*  over the last nine days had set back the Iranian nuclear program by at least two or three years. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEaOgeqXX1U&t=208.56s)]
*  There was no imminent threat to the United States from this nuclear program. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEaOgeqXX1U&t=214.79999999999998s)]
*  It was an offensive war of choice by a president without consultation with Congress. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEaOgeqXX1U&t=220.12s)]
*  We're going to have the briefing this week. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEaOgeqXX1U&t=223.84s)]
*  We'll have a vote. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEaOgeqXX1U&t=225.24s)]
*  I know many Republicans will fall in line and say a president can do whatever he wants. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEaOgeqXX1U&t=226.24s)]
*  But I hope members of the Senate and the House will take their Article 1 responsibility seriously [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEaOgeqXX1U&t=230.72s)]
*  and say you didn't even notify us, much less get an authorization. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEaOgeqXX1U&t=235.56s)]
*  The U.S. should not be at war without a vote of Congress. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEaOgeqXX1U&t=240.6s)]
*  OK, to your point about Israel inflicting so much damage on Iran's nuclear program, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEaOgeqXX1U&t=244.4s)]
*  I want to read something from the Wall Street Journal's editorial board. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEaOgeqXX1U&t=249.2s)]
*  They say that what the president did help rid the world of a grave nuclear threat was [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEaOgeqXX1U&t=252.44s)]
*  a large step toward restoring U.S. deterrence. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEaOgeqXX1U&t=257.28s)]
*  It creates an opportunity, they said, for more peace in the Middle East. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEaOgeqXX1U&t=259.52s)]
*  But they note this. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEaOgeqXX1U&t=262.66s)]
*  Leaving Iran with a hardened nuclear enrichment facility after an Israeli military campaign [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEaOgeqXX1U&t=263.66s)]
*  would have been a recipe for maximum danger, all but asking Iran to sprint to the bomb. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEaOgeqXX1U&t=268.44s)]
*  Your reaction? [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEaOgeqXX1U&t=274.16s)]
*  That's an argument that you could make to Congress and have a debate in full view of [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEaOgeqXX1U&t=277.16s)]
*  the American people so they can decide whether they want to risk American lives for this, [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEaOgeqXX1U&t=281.16s)]
*  particularly with the Israeli foreign minister saying the program had been set back two or [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEaOgeqXX1U&t=286.12s)]
*  three years. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEaOgeqXX1U&t=290.48s)]
*  There was no need for President Trump to rush this on his own. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEaOgeqXX1U&t=291.72s)]
*  And again, we believe, as a member of the Armed Services and Foreign Relations Committee, [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEaOgeqXX1U&t=296.16s)]
*  I think some of what President Trump is saying about the Iranian nuclear program is directly [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEaOgeqXX1U&t=300.6s)]
*  contrary to what his own national security officials are saying and what Israeli officials [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEaOgeqXX1U&t=305.3s)]
*  are saying. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEaOgeqXX1U&t=310.56s)]
*  But if they believe this is something we should do, great, bring it to Congress in the way [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEaOgeqXX1U&t=311.56s)]
*  that the framers intended. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEaOgeqXX1U&t=316.42s)]
*  Our framers did not believe in the old way that a king could order a nation to war. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEaOgeqXX1U&t=318.28000000000003s)]
*  Instead, the framers gave the power to Congress so that we would have a debate in front of [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEaOgeqXX1U&t=323.72s)]
*  all the American public whose sons and daughters' lives could potentially be at risk. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEaOgeqXX1U&t=328.28000000000003s)]
*  And that's the biggest worry I have this morning. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEaOgeqXX1U&t=333.12s)]
*  The risk to American troops and citizens and diplomatic personnel in the region, the risk [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEaOgeqXX1U&t=335.84000000000003s)]
*  to regional stability. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEaOgeqXX1U&t=341.20000000000005s)]
*  We thought taking out the Iraqi government was going to make the region safer. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEaOgeqXX1U&t=342.48s)]
*  It made it worse. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEaOgeqXX1U&t=346.8s)]
*  This could lead to more nuclear escalation. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEaOgeqXX1U&t=348.06s)]
*  could hurt the global economy and at risk America's reputation that we are seen as the [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEaOgeqXX1U&t=350.16s)]
*  one that wants to tear up diplomacy and instead result to military power first. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEaOgeqXX1U&t=355.04s)]
*  Okay, so to the issue of whether or not there was a true impending threat with regard to [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEaOgeqXX1U&t=359.92s)]
*  the nuclear program, you know the IAEA just weeks ago, the UN security watchdog on matters [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEaOgeqXX1U&t=364.0s)]
*  of nuclear issues, they issued a scathing report. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEaOgeqXX1U&t=370.28000000000003s)]
*  They talked about the fact that there have been numerous violations by Iran dating back [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEaOgeqXX1U&t=373.44000000000005s)]
*  to 2019. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEaOgeqXX1U&t=376.76000000000005s)]
*  They said they couldn't explain traces of nuclear material that had been found at undeclared [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEaOgeqXX1U&t=378.0s)]
*  sites. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEaOgeqXX1U&t=381.8s)]
*  They were never given full access. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEaOgeqXX1U&t=382.8s)]
*  They said there was extensive sanitization and the provision of inaccurate explanations [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEaOgeqXX1U&t=384.24s)]
*  about what was going on. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEaOgeqXX1U&t=389.14s)]
*  That's not a conservative body. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEaOgeqXX1U&t=391.14s)]
*  That's not a pro-Trump body as you know, but they had grave concerns that Iran's program [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEaOgeqXX1U&t=392.28s)]
*  was potentially wildly far advanced beyond what they would ever be able to ascertain. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEaOgeqXX1U&t=396.88s)]
*  And Shannon, you mentioned the date correctly, 2019. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEaOgeqXX1U&t=403.68s)]
*  There have been challenges since 2019. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEaOgeqXX1U&t=407.40000000000003s)]
*  What happened before 2019? [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEaOgeqXX1U&t=410.32s)]
*  Donald Trump tore up the diplomatic deal that imposed limits on Iranian centrifuges, limits [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEaOgeqXX1U&t=412.44s)]
*  on Iranian enrichment activity and imposed significant inspections on Iranian facilities. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEaOgeqXX1U&t=419.72s)]
*  After Donald Trump chose to tear up a deal that was working, his own cabinet members [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEaOgeqXX1U&t=426.24s)]
*  said he should not tear up the deal. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEaOgeqXX1U&t=430.72s)]
*  Yes, we all predicted Iran would race ahead and do things that they shouldn't. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEaOgeqXX1U&t=432.72s)]
*  But the IAEA has never found that Iran was close to developing a nuclear weapon. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEaOgeqXX1U&t=438.08s)]
*  The Israeli foreign minister and U.S. security officials also have not suggested that Iran [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEaOgeqXX1U&t=443.72s)]
*  was close to developing a nuclear weapon. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEaOgeqXX1U&t=449.72s)]
*  Only President Trump and a few of his, you know, kind of acolytes are saying that. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEaOgeqXX1U&t=452.84000000000003s)]
*  We'll get into it more when we have an all senators briefing this week. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEaOgeqXX1U&t=458.32s)]
*  But I was very struck again on Friday night when the Israeli foreign minister said, we've [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEaOgeqXX1U&t=461.0s)]
