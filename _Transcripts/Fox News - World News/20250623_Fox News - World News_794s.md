# Trump hints at regime change in Iran as US braces for retaliation: 'MIGA!'
**Fox News - World News:** [June 23, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u7ODjZ-lAw)
*  We begin this morning with a Fox News alert. The U.S. now braces for retaliation from Iran [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u7ODjZ-lAw&t=0.0s)]
*  after carrying out Operation Midnight Hammer, which has severely damaged their key nuclear [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u7ODjZ-lAw&t=6.32s)]
*  facilities. U.S. bases across the Middle East are on high alert as Iran vows to respond. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u7ODjZ-lAw&t=11.76s)]
*  And anti-American protesters take over the streets of Tehran, but President Trump isn't [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u7ODjZ-lAw&t=18.16s)]
*  ruling out potential regime change in the nation. You are watching Fox and Friends First. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u7ODjZ-lAw&t=23.04s)]
*  On this Monday morning, I'm Carly Schimke. And I am Todd Pyro. We have live team coverage this morning. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u7ODjZ-lAw&t=28.96s)]
*  Madeleine Rivera in Washington with President Trump's plans for today. And former U.S. Marine [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u7ODjZ-lAw&t=32.96s)]
*  Mark Geist here to explain the tactics used by the U.S. to carry out this operation. But first, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u7ODjZ-lAw&t=38.64s)]
*  let's go to Mike Tobin live on the ground in Tel Aviv as sirens blare across Israel right now. Mike. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u7ODjZ-lAw&t=44.4s)]
*  And Todd and Carly, just moments ago we got the all clear as waves of missiles were inbound from [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u7ODjZ-lAw&t=52.08s)]
*  Iran to the north and really from the north to the south of Israel. We've got the reports of one [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u7ODjZ-lAw&t=58.56s)]
*  rocket that made impact about halfway between here in Tel Aviv and the Gaza Strip. We're waiting for [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u7ODjZ-lAw&t=65.04s)]
*  details on that. Meantime, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has been explaining about the timing of [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u7ODjZ-lAw&t=70.48s)]
*  the attack. The Prime Minister explained that Iran had enough uranium enriched just below weapons [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u7ODjZ-lAw&t=76.24000000000001s)]
*  grade to make about 10 bombs. And he says after Hezbollah Secretary General Hassan Nasrallah was [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u7ODjZ-lAw&t=82.72s)]
*  killed, Iran began a desperate rush to build that bomb. So Israel had to act. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u7ODjZ-lAw&t=89.12s)]
*  They had enough of that. Nine or 10 bombs worth of enriched uranium. But they needed to make the [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u7ODjZ-lAw&t=96.88s)]
*  bomb itself. And the bomb itself, they rushed to do in right after the collapse of the terror [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u7ODjZ-lAw&t=102.4s)]
*  axis and the removal of Nasrallah. Therefore we had to act. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u7ODjZ-lAw&t=111.52s)]
*  The director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency says the enriched uranium [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u7ODjZ-lAw&t=118.08s)]
*  was not destroyed in the U.S. strike. Iran had moved it ahead of time. Speaking to the U.N. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u7ODjZ-lAw&t=122.64s)]
*  Security Council, Rafael Grossi continues to push for negotiation as a means to stop Iran [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u7ODjZ-lAw&t=127.67999999999999s)]
*  from acquiring a nuclear bomb. We have a window of opportunity to return to dialogue and diplomacy. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u7ODjZ-lAw&t=133.84s)]
*  If that window closes, violence and destruction could reach unthinkable levels and the global [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u7ODjZ-lAw&t=142.08s)]
*  non-proliferation regime, as we know it, could crumble and fall. Now Grossi does not disagree [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u7ODjZ-lAw&t=151.84s)]
*  with President Trump's claim that substantial damage was done to Iran's nuclear sites. The [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u7ODjZ-lAw&t=160.32000000000002s)]
*  president posted on Truth Social, the biggest damage took place far below ground level. Bullseye. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u7ODjZ-lAw&t=165.76000000000002s)]
*  Grossi noted that the centrifuges are extremely fragile and they spin very fast. Something as [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u7ODjZ-lAw&t=173.04000000000002s)]
*  simple as a power outage can cause them to break. Todd and Carly? Yeah, Mike, yesterday Prime Minister [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u7ODjZ-lAw&t=178.88s)]
*  Benjamin Netanyahu said that Israel is very, very close to completing its goals in Iran. So from an [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u7ODjZ-lAw&t=184.16s)]
*  Israeli perspective, what does completing their mission look like and how much longer will it [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u7ODjZ-lAw&t=189.92000000000002s)]
*  take to get there? Well, they talk about three different prongs of notice, three different points [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u7ODjZ-lAw&t=194.4s)]
*  that Israel is trying to accomplish. First would be the prevention of ballistic missiles and the [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u7ODjZ-lAw&t=201.20000000000002s)]
*  firing on Israel. The second would be destruction of the nuclear program and then they say destruction [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u7ODjZ-lAw&t=206.08s)]
*  of Iran's ambitions to end the state of Israel. It really seems that that third one is based on [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u7ODjZ-lAw&t=211.84s)]
*  the first two and Israel does say substantial damage has been done to the nuclear program, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u7ODjZ-lAw&t=218.48000000000002s)]
*  certainly sent them back and they say upwards of 50 percent of the ballistic missile program has [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u7ODjZ-lAw&t=224.0s)]
*  been destroyed. Carly? Mike Tobin live for us in Tel Aviv. Mike, thank you. Thank you, Mike. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u7ODjZ-lAw&t=228.64s)]
*  President Trump expected to meet with his national security team at 1 p.m. eastern time today to [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u7ODjZ-lAw&t=232.8s)]
*  discuss the next steps in Iran. Madeline Rivera joins us live from Washington with all the details. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u7ODjZ-lAw&t=237.68s)]
*  Maddie, hello. Good morning Todd and Carly. Vice President JD Vance maintains the administration [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u7ODjZ-lAw&t=242.88s)]
*  has not closed the door to diplomacy. Vance says this is a moment to actually reset the relationship [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u7ODjZ-lAw&t=248.0s)]
*  with Iran because before the strikes Iran was stonewalling the president, which is why he [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u7ODjZ-lAw&t=253.6s)]
*  approved the strikes in the first place. If you back up a little bit we engage in this diplomatic [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u7ODjZ-lAw&t=258.15999999999997s)]
*  process. I think that he decided probably by mid-May that this process was not going anywhere and so [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u7ODjZ-lAw&t=263.84s)]
*  he decided to issue some private ultimatums to the Iranians and then eventually of course we decided [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u7ODjZ-lAw&t=271.28s)]
*  to destroy the Fordo nuclear facility and some of these other facilities ourselves. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u7ODjZ-lAw&t=276.4s)]
*  As for the end goal here, Vance says they don't want a regime change. Secretary of State Marco [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u7ODjZ-lAw&t=280.72s)]
*  Rubio said the same thing, that they're focusing simply on eliminating Iran's ability to have a [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u7ODjZ-lAw&t=287.20000000000005s)]
*  nuclear weapon. If what they want is a country that has a nuclear energy program, they can have [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u7ODjZ-lAw&t=292.16s)]
*  that. I mean we you know many countries around the world, I don't like the regime, but we're not into [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u7ODjZ-lAw&t=297.68s)]
*  the regime change business here. We're into the safety and security of the United States business. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u7ODjZ-lAw&t=301.6s)]
*  So that's a choice they'll have to make. I hope they're being rational in their decision making, [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u7ODjZ-lAw&t=306.24s)]
*  but I think the most important thing I hope they realize is the game is up. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u7ODjZ-lAw&t=310.16s)]
*  But in a turnaround the president did not rule out the possibility of a regime change, [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u7ODjZ-lAw&t=315.12s)]
*  saying at a Truth Social Post, it's not politically correct to use the term regime change, [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u7ODjZ-lAw&t=319.6s)]
*  but if the current Iranian regime is unable to make Iran great again, why wouldn't there be a [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u7ODjZ-lAw&t=324.72s)]
*  regime change? Niga. Iran says they're not interested in diplomacy at this point. The U.S. warning Iran [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u7ODjZ-lAw&t=329.6s)]
*  against retaliation, saying it has capabilities Iran has not yet seen. Carly and Todd. Madeline [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u7ODjZ-lAw&t=335.84s)]
*  Rivera live for us in Washington. Maddie, thank you. Let's bring in former United States Marine [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u7ODjZ-lAw&t=341.52s)]
*  and member of the Annex security team that fought the battle of Benghazi Mark Geiss. Mike, good [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u7ODjZ-lAw&t=346.08s)]
*  morning to you. So before this strike, analysts were talking about this mission in terms of one [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u7ODjZ-lAw&t=350.08s)]
*  B-2 flying over one nuclear site with two bunker busters on board. And in reality, this mission [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u7ODjZ-lAw&t=354.15999999999997s)]
*  included seven B-2s, 14 bunker busters, 30 Tomahawk missiles, and three nuclear sites. So the size [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u7ODjZ-lAw&t=360.24s)]
*  and scope of this is incredible. It's been dubbed Operation Midnight Hammer. So take us inside this. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u7ODjZ-lAw&t=366.56s)]
*  What goes into the planning of a mission like this and what stood out to you in terms of the mission [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u7ODjZ-lAw&t=372.88s)]
*  itself? You know, I think one of the biggest things is in Washington, you know, especially [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u7ODjZ-lAw&t=378.48s)]
*  with the time that we had leading up to this, that this, the security around this operation [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u7ODjZ-lAw&t=385.68s)]
*  did not get leaked whatsoever. That's commendable to the administration and to the planning phase [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u7ODjZ-lAw&t=392.24s)]
*  of this. Outside of that, the planning phase has probably been ongoing for the last 30 to 60 days [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u7ODjZ-lAw&t=398.32000000000005s)]
*  since President Trump started these negotiations and gave the diplomatic, I wouldn't say threats, [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u7ODjZ-lAw&t=404.8s)]
*  but you know, he put in the known KPIs in there to ensure that they understood what was going to [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u7ODjZ-lAw&t=412.48s)]
*  happen when he gave the number of days, about 60 days to respond on the diplomatic side. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u7ODjZ-lAw&t=420.56s)]
*  Yeah, look, you're right. There wasn't a lot of talk in Washington about this beforehand. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u7ODjZ-lAw&t=427.52000000000004s)]
*  But you know what else really stood out to me about this mission? There wasn't a lot of talk [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u7ODjZ-lAw&t=431.52000000000004s)]
*  while they were in the air. And to me, that is one of the most remarkable aspects of this Air Force [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u7ODjZ-lAw&t=436.0s)]
*  Congressman August Fluger, I think had the most colorful description of this mission and what [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u7ODjZ-lAw&t=442.24s)]
*  happened in the air that I think I've ever heard. Take a listen to the Congressman. Think about you [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u7ODjZ-lAw&t=448.32s)]
*  and your wife trying to meet up in Paris at a restaurant, 730 reservations, plus or minus a [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u7ODjZ-lAw&t=452.64s)]
*  minute. Don't be early, don't be late. But you have 125 other guests that also have that same [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u7ODjZ-lAw&t=457.76s)]
*  thing without cell phones. So the difficulty starts with just getting to the right place at [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u7ODjZ-lAw&t=462.96s)]
*  the right time. And then you have to carry out the mission. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u7ODjZ-lAw&t=467.84s)]
*  Mark, how? How did they do this without communication? [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u7ODjZ-lAw&t=470.96s)]
*  Well, there's always some type of communication. And you know, it is all encrypted that they can [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u7ODjZ-lAw&t=477.52s)]
*  still maintain that with especially within the military structure itself. And that planning and [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u7ODjZ-lAw&t=482.96s)]
*  that execution of what they did with the number of planes, I think surprised a lot of people. And [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u7ODjZ-lAw&t=489.28s)]
*  I think that was necessary. It was a one time chance to go after these nuclear facilities and [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u7ODjZ-lAw&t=495.76s)]
*  to ensure that we stop them from being able to have a nuclear bomb. Yeah, there were also [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u7ODjZ-lAw&t=501.36s)]
*  deception tactics used. Here's chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Dan Raisen Kane, [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u7ODjZ-lAw&t=505.92s)]
*  talking about that. Watch this. The U.S. employed several deception tactics, including decoys, [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u7ODjZ-lAw&t=511.2s)]
*  as the fourth and fifth generation aircraft pushed out in front of the strike package at [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u7ODjZ-lAw&t=519.36s)]
*  high altitude and high speed, sweeping in front of the package for enemy fighters and surface to air [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u7ODjZ-lAw&t=525.92s)]
*  missile threats. I mean, truly remarkable. Dive into that a little bit for us. There were also [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u7ODjZ-lAw&t=532.96s)]
*  B-2s taking off from Missouri and flying west towards the Pacific, which also turned out to be a ruse. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u7ODjZ-lAw&t=537.28s)]
*  Yeah, it did. And you know, those are the tactics of warfare. We could go as far back as SunSuit [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u7ODjZ-lAw&t=542.8s)]
*  and look at how that is and what they recommend then. And you know, President Trump, I think, [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u7ODjZ-lAw&t=550.8s)]
*  is a study of history and a study of military history. And between that and all his advisors, [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u7ODjZ-lAw&t=556.4s)]
*  I think they came up with a great plan. Mark, we had a guest on the weekend show that said, [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u7ODjZ-lAw&t=564.24s)]
*  yes, all the attention is going to be paid to the bombers themselves who drop the payload. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u7ODjZ-lAw&t=569.2800000000001s)]
*  And rightly so. It is a remarkable mission. But this guest also said refueling in flight [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u7ODjZ-lAw&t=573.84s)]
*  is one of the toughest parts of this mission. It is extremely difficult. Can you give us a little [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u7ODjZ-lAw&t=580.6400000000001s)]
*  insight as to what makes it so difficult to refuel these planes, these bombers in flight? [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u7ODjZ-lAw&t=585.6800000000001s)]
*  Well, you know, I would say anybody who's flown commercial up at high altitudes know that, you [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u7ODjZ-lAw&t=592.4s)]
*  know, it's not always a smooth ride. And when you're looking at taking two aircraft traveling, [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u7ODjZ-lAw&t=599.52s)]
*  the speeds that they are in the conditions that they are, and you're trying to look basically, [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u7ODjZ-lAw&t=608.56s)]
*  it's a two foot by two foot area that you are trying to bring that nozzle into and [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u7ODjZ-lAw&t=614.48s)]
*  make connection to that other aircraft. And when doing that, you know, there's so many things that [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u7ODjZ-lAw&t=622.9599999999999s)]
*  can go wrong. And it is a to the guys and gals out there that were doing this, that were behind the [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u7ODjZ-lAw&t=627.12s)]
*  scenes that will never be known. We got to give them kudos and a thumbs up to all that they did [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u7ODjZ-lAw&t=634.88s)]
*  to help this mission become successful. Amen to that. So what do you think the plane ride [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u7ODjZ-lAw&t=642.08s)]

*  that everyone was back home, that I'm sure there was some some back patent and some great celebrations [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u7ODjZ-lAw&t=677.1999999999999s)]
*  going on. Yeah, don't celebrate before you cross the end zone. I'd imagine in light of your [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u7ODjZ-lAw&t=684.3199999999999s)]
*  experience in Benghazi that you are a student of history. Can you put this strike these strikes in [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u7ODjZ-lAw&t=691.1999999999999s)]
*  the context of other major events in history? In other words, when our kids, Carly and my kids [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u7ODjZ-lAw&t=697.84s)]
*  read about this in a history book in 20 years, what are they going to be comparing these strikes to? [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u7ODjZ-lAw&t=703.44s)]
*  You know, these are these strikes are compared to, you know, any of the major military operations [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u7ODjZ-lAw&t=710.32s)]
*  that we have encountered since the founding of this country, especially modern warfare since [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u7ODjZ-lAw&t=717.76s)]

*  the nature that is behind it. I mean, we're talking about nuclear armament of a country that is has a [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u7ODjZ-lAw&t=744.7199999999999s)]

*  America and everything we stand for. And they've used their proxies, Hezbollah and, you know, [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u7ODjZ-lAw&t=757.76s)]
*  Yemen and the Houthis to attack us continually. And it's been increased. And this is something [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u7ODjZ-lAw&t=764.0s)]
*  that is going to change that. Well, more than 125 U.S. aircraft took part in this mission and they [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u7ODjZ-lAw&t=770.4799999999999s)]
