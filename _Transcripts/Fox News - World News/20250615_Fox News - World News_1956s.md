# Netanyahu makes SHOCKING claim about Trump assassination attempts, his own
**Fox News - World News:** [June 15, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw)
*  Good afternoon. Welcome to Washington. For a special edition of Special Report, I'm Brett [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=0.0s)]
*  Baer. Coming up in a few minutes, my world-exclusive live interview with Israeli Prime Minister [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=9.14s)]
*  Benjamin Netanyahu, the first since the Israeli strikes on Iran began. But first, this afternoon [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=13.96s)]
*  of Fox News Alert, the growing conflict in the Middle East, Israel launching a third [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=20.16s)]
*  of airstrikes across Iran. Israeli officials advising Iranians to evacuate arms factories [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=25.04s)]
*  and threatening to use even greater force. Iran saying 128 people have been killed, 900 [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=30.92s)]
*  wounded so far. The Islamic Republic responding with missile attacks of its own, which have [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=37.0s)]
*  killed 13 people, wounding more than 360. Iran's foreign minister saying today his [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=42.120000000000005s)]
*  country will stop its attacks if Israel stops theirs. Let's get the latest now from chief [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=48.400000000000006s)]
*  foreign correspondent Trey Yankst live in Tel Aviv. Good afternoon, Trey. Brett, good [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=54.26s)]
*  afternoon. Since the conflict began, Iran has launched more than 250 ballistic missiles [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=60.42s)]
*  into Israel. Overnight, 11 people were killed when some of those missiles slipped past air [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=65.74s)]
*  defense systems, slamming into residential areas. Hundreds more have been wounded. When [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=71.34s)]
*  we arrived at one impact site this morning, rescue crews were combing through the rubble [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=76.46s)]
*  of an apartment building in central Israel looking for survivors. One man in his fifties [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=80.42s)]
*  named Mayor was still trapped as his son, who had been wounded in the attack, waited [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=85.04s)]
*  to learn the fate of his father. Right now, rescue workers are digging through the debris [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=89.26s)]
*  following that Iranian ballistic missile attack that targeted central Israel. They are looking [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=94.86s)]
*  for survivors who are trapped under the rubble, including my ear. That father, his son, Ophic, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=99.92s)]
*  still wearing his hospital gown after he was pulled from the blast site. He is hoping for [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=106.98s)]
*  a miracle today following this Iranian attack. Israel is responding to these recent attacks [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=112.30000000000001s)]
*  with more airstrikes targeting both military and energy positions inside Iran. Iranian [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=119.30000000000001s)]
*  media reports 128 people have been killed and 900 injured. We know among that list are [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=124.30000000000001s)]
*  Iranian nuclear scientists and top IRGC commanders targeted by Israel. Iran's foreign minister [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=129.9s)]
*  spoke today about the American support for Israel during the conflict. Now, in conversations [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=135.56s)]
*  with Israeli sources, they are drawing a stark contrast in what is happening here. The Israelis [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=140.82s)]
*  are going after military and nuclear sites. The Iranians are firing ballistic missiles [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=145.78s)]
*  toward Israeli civilians. Brett. Trey Yext in Tel Aviv. Trey, thank you. Joining us now, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=150.72s)]
*  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Mr. Prime Minister, welcome back to Special [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=156.52s)]
*  Report. Thank you. Good to be with you, Brett. First of all, let me start at the beginning. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=160.12s)]
*  Why did you launch this operation now? Because we were facing an imminent threat, a dual [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=165.36s)]
*  existential threat. One, the threat of Iran rushing to weaponize their enriched uranium [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=174.24s)]
*  to make atomic bombs with a specific and declared intent to destroy us. Second, a rush to increase [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=180.20000000000002s)]
*  their ballistic missile arsenal into the capacity that they would have 3,600 weapons a year, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=187.08s)]
*  and then to build new weapons within three years, 10,000 ballistic missiles, each one [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=194.16s)]
*  weighing a ton, coming in at Mach 6, right into our cities, as you saw today. And then [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=198.07999999999998s)]
*  in six years, 20,000. That's no country can sustain that, and certainly not a country [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=204.07999999999998s)]
*  the size of Israel. So we had to act. It was the 12th hour. We did act to save ourselves, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=210.56s)]
*  but also, I think, to not only protect ourselves, but protect the world from this incendiary [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=216.34s)]
*  regime. We can't have the world's most dangerous regime have the world's most dangerous weapons. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=222.32s)]
*  We're protecting ourselves, but by doing so, we're protecting many others. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=227.28s)]
*  You know, I just want to press you on the intel on the nuclear part. Less than two months [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=231.48s)]
*  ago, the new director of national intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard, testified on Capitol Hill saying [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=235.72s)]
*  that everything had been suspended since 2003 and had not restarted, that the nuclear program [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=240.92s)]
*  had not been restarted by the Iranians. So did something change from end of March until [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=247.35999999999999s)]
*  this week? Was the U.S. intel wrong? [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=252.11999999999998s)]
*  The intel we got and we shared with the United States was absolutely clear. It was absolutely [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=256.58s)]
*  clear that they were working in a secret plan to weaponize the uranium. They were marching [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=262.32s)]
*  very quickly. They would achieve a test device and possibly an initial device within months [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=268.53999999999996s)]
*  and certainly less than a year. That was the intel we shared with the United States. I [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=275.03999999999996s)]
*  think we have excellent intel in Iran. I think we've proven that. And that is something that [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=278.71999999999997s)]
*  we couldn't possibly accept. Whether it would be six months or 12 months or 13 months is [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=284.15999999999997s)]
*  immaterial. Once they go that route, it's too late. And we will not have a second Holocaust, [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=289.4s)]
*  a nuclear Holocaust. We already had one in the previous century. The Jewish state is [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=296.08s)]
*  not going to have the Holocaust made it on the Jewish people. It's not going to happen. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=300.38s)]
*  Never again is now and we have to act now. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=304.32s)]
*  What is the goal of these strikes? You talked early in one of your speeches after the attacks [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=307.8s)]
*  began with a message directly to the Iranian people. Clearly some of these strikes have [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=314.2s)]
*  targeted Iranian leadership, military, nuclear scientists and other leaders. So is regime [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=319.8s)]
*  change part of the effort here? [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=325.48s)]
*  Could certainly be the result because the Iran regime is very weak. I think it's basically [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=329.52s)]
*  left with two things. It's plans to have atomic bombs and ballistic missiles. That's basically [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=334.08s)]
*  what Iran has. They certainly don't have the people. Eighty percent of the people will [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=339.96s)]
*  throw these theological thugs out. I mean, they murder them, they oppress them for 46 [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=343.76s)]
*  years, they've yearned for freedom. I mean, they shoot women because their hair is uncovered. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=349.32s)]
*  They shoot students. They just suck the oxygen from this brave and gifted people, the Iranian [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=354.59999999999997s)]
*  people. And you know, the Persian people and the Jewish people have had an ancient friendship. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=361.48s)]
*  Goes back to the times of Cyrus the Great. That could happen again. But again, the decision [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=366.88s)]
*  to act, to rise up at this time is the decision of the Iranian people. We decided to act because [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=370.71999999999997s)]
*  we had to, we saw enough uranium and rich uranium for nine bombs and all they had to [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=377.88s)]
*  do was weaponize them. We stopped that by attacking, we're attacking their nuclear sites. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=383.68s)]
*  We attacked their chief nuclear scientists working, it's like Hitler's nuclear scientists. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=388.64s)]
*  Would you leave them? Of course not. We attacked their top command. I can inform you, Brett, [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=392.96s)]
*  that moments ago we also got the chief intelligence officer and his deputy in Tehran because we're [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=398.08s)]
*  now over the skies of Tehran. Our pilots, our brave pilots are over the skies of Tehran [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=403.68s)]
*  and we're targeting military sites, nuclear sites, that's what we're doing, to take out [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=408.6s)]
*  those two threats. Unlike the Iranians who your reporter said correctly, they're targeting [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=413.4s)]
*  our civilians. They're bombing our civilians. So that's the difference. They're a terrorist [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=417.92s)]
*  regime. We can't have Iran have nuclear weapons. And by the way, our intel shows that they [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=422.24s)]
*  intend to give these nuclear weapons to their Houthi proxies and others. And that's nuclear [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=429.32s)]
*  terrorism on a global scale. It threatens everyone. And the last thing is they have [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=435.20000000000005s)]
*  plans to develop intercontinental ballistic missiles. Right now, 8,000 kilometers, very [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=440.28000000000003s)]
*  soon, just at a little distance, and they can reach the eastern seaboard of the United [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=445.48s)]
*  States. These people who chant, death to America, try to assassinate President Trump twice, [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=449.52000000000004s)]
*  kill 241 of your marines in Beirut, killed and injured thousands of American soldiers [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=455.04s)]
*  in Afghanistan and Iraq, try to bomb a restaurant in Washington, D.C., chant, death to America, [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=460.24s)]
*  burn the American flag. Do you want these people to have nuclear weapons and the means [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=467.24s)]
*  to deliver them to your cities? Of course not. So we're defending ourselves, but we're [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=472.24s)]
*  also defending the world. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=476.08s)]
*  I want to talk about the nuclear threat. I want to talk about President Trump. You just [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=477.64s)]
*  said Iran tried to assassinate President Trump twice. Do you have intel that the assassination [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=480.59999999999997s)]
*  attempts on President Trump were directly from Iran? [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=486.59999999999997s)]
*  Through proxies, yes. Through their intel, yes. They want to kill him. Look, he's enemy [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=490.88s)]
*  number one. He's a decisive leader. He never took the path that others took to try to bargain [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=495.6s)]
*  with him in a way that is weak, giving them basically a pathway to enrich uranium, which [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=502.6s)]
*  means a pathway to the bomb, padding it with billions and billions of dollars. He took [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=508.20000000000005s)]
*  up this fake agreement and basically tore it up. He killed Qassem Soleimani. He made [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=512.6800000000001s)]
*  it very clear, including now, you cannot have a nuclear weapon, which means you cannot enrich. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=519.2s)]
*  He's been very forceful. So for them, he's enemy number one. Look, they also tried to [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=524.28s)]
*  kill me, but I'm his junior partner. They understand that President Trump is a great [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=530.0s)]
*  threat to Iran's plans to weaponize nuclear weapons and use them. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=534.4399999999999s)]
*  When did you tell President Trump you were going to launch these strikes? [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=538.76s)]
*  Look, I've been in constant contact with President Trump. We've known each other for many years. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=541.9599999999999s)]
*  And obviously we informed our American friends and President Trump, our great friend, ahead [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=548.1999999999999s)]
*  of time. He knew about it, of course. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=553.8s)]
*  I mean, there were reports that President Trump kind of helped you achieve your strategic [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=556.5999999999999s)]
*  surprise by publicly urging you not to attack when he already knew you had decided to do [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=560.12s)]
*  it. So you were closely coordinating with the U.S. throughout this process. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=566.0799999999999s)]
*  Look, we're fully coordinated, but understand that America, under President Trump, will [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=570.0799999999999s)]
*  make the decisions that are best for America. And that's the way it is. He understands that [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=575.4399999999999s)]
*  I, as the Prime Minister of Israel, the one and only Jewish state, must make the decisions [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=581.68s)]
*  that are important for the survival of my country, and he will do what is best for America. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=586.52s)]
*  That is a relationship of mutual respect and mutual confidence. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=590.92s)]
*  Does Israel have the capacity to strike Iran's nuclear sites deep underground? [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=595.96s)]
*  Well, we've certainly done quite a bit. We've destroyed the main facility in Natanz. That's [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=602.96s)]
*  the main enrichment facility. And if we need to, we'll add whatever is needed. But yes, [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=608.64s)]
*  we're committed to achieving both goals. And I'm not going to get into all of our objectives. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=613.52s)]
*  I don't want to get into specific operational plans. But it's our existence, but not only [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=618.88s)]
*  ours. I think it's a wider battle here of civilization against barbarism, of good against [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=623.84s)]
*  bad. I mean, this regime, look at what it's done without nuclear weapons. It just fomented [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=628.6s)]
*  evil everywhere. I mean, they've pushed international terrorism to the hilt, into every part of [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=634.6s)]
*  the Middle East, in Syria, in Iraq, Lebanon, where they had Hezbollah, Hamas, where they [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=641.08s)]
*  encouraged the Houthis, the great massacre of October 7, the Houthis. That's what they're [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=647.6s)]
*  doing when they don't have nuclear weapons, including attacking American targets. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=653.0400000000001s)]
*  Now, imagine what they'll do if they had nuclear weapons. And I'm always amazed at people who [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=656.84s)]
*  say they care about America and they don't want a war. They're right. This is a forever [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=661.48s)]
*  war that Iran is doing without nuclear weapons. And imagine what they will do if they have [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=667.36s)]
*  them. I think for the security of Israel, America, the world, it must make sure that [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=671.84s)]
*  they don't have these weapons and the means to deliver them. And they're working on both. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=676.88s)]
*  I just want to ask you about the nuclear sites. Forto Nuclear Enrichment Facility, located [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=681.12s)]
*  deep inside a mountain. These are from Iranian nuclear experts inside this mountain near [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=686.52s)]
*  Combe. Esfahan, deeply buried facility where Iran stores its highly enriched uranium. In [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=692.72s)]
*  some ways, experts say it might even be more important than Forto. The IAEA says it's a [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=698.84s)]
*  half mile deep. So I guess the question is, if the goal is destroying Iran's nuclear program, [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=703.88s)]
*  how do you do so without the 30,000-pound bunker buster bombs that really only the U.S. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=709.96s)]
*  has? Have you asked President Trump to use that 30,000-pound penetrator bomb to get to those [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=715.6800000000001s)]
*  facilities? I'm not going to get into my discussions with the president, but understand [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=722.4s)]
*  that his decisions are his decisions. As for these targets, we've destroyed in Esfahan the [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=727.28s)]
*  conversion facility that had that. So a very important facility that without which you can't [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=733.8000000000001s)]
*  really build a weapon. That's gone. There are other plans that we have. I won't get into it. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=740.4s)]
*  I think Israel has shown that it has, well, how shall I say it? We're the innovation nation. We're [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=746.84s)]
*  called that, startup nation. So we have quite a few startups and quite a few rabbits up our sleeve, [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=752.4s)]
*  and I don't think that I should get into that. Okay. Well, I mean, are you getting everything [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=758.4s)]
*  from the U.S. that you've asked for? Is there something that you've asked for that you're not [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=762.9599999999999s)]
*  getting? What I'll say this is that I deeply appreciate President Trump's decision to help [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=768.04s)]
*  in the defense of Israel. American pilots are shooting down drones that are headed towards [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=773.8399999999999s)]
*  Israel, as do our pilots. American THAAD missile batteries are helping defend Tel Aviv and Greater [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=779.24s)]
*  Tel Aviv area. American Aegis ships are in the Mediterranean. That's all a decision by President [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=787.24s)]
*  Trump, which I deeply appreciate. Again, his decisions on what to do, what to do at any given [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=792.32s)]
*  time is the president's decision. I trust his judgment completely. Do you have any estimate on [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=798.44s)]
*  how much you have set back Iran's nuclear program? I think we've set them back quite a bit. I think [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=803.6s)]
*  they were completely surprised. And you know, surprise is a great element of success. Remember [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=809.24s)]
*  the Pragers? Remember Nasrallah? That's part of breaking up the Iranian axis. And we achieved [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=814.8000000000001s)]
*  that with surprise. And I think we achieved a great surprise the other day when we started. You [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=819.92s)]
*  know, we could wait and wait and wait. They'd string along the negotiations. We gave them a [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=824.76s)]
*  chance. I gave them a chance. But it was clear they were not serious about it. It became clear, [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=828.88s)]
*  I think, to the United States as well, because the president was very clear. He said, you can't have [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=833.92s)]
*  nuclear weapons. And in order not to have nuclear weapons, you can't enrich uranium. And they [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=839.0s)]
*  basically strung everybody along. And it was clear to us it was going nowhere. I could wait [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=844.48s)]
*  and wait until they officially declared that the talks were off. And we'd officially declared [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=850.08s)]
*  that we're going to attack them. That's not how I conduct wars, and it's not how Israel conducts [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=855.9200000000001s)]
*  wars. So we're geared to do whatever is necessary to achieve our dual aim, to remove two existential [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=861.52s)]
*  threats, two existential threats, the nuclear threat and the ballistic missile threat. And we're [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=870.0s)]
*  doing that as we speak now in Tehran, but we're not bombing the population. We're telling the [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=875.44s)]
*  population, leave. So when we hit the targets embedded in civilian areas, you won't be hurt. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=880.72s)]
*  And there is now mass migration from Tehran right now. That's what's happening, [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=886.4000000000001s)]
*  because we're giving them forewarning. Mr. Prime Minister, what proportion of Iranian air [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=891.7600000000001s)]
*  defenses do you think you've taken out? Back in October, their defenses were really decimated. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=895.9200000000001s)]
*  Now you say you have kind of control of the skies as you're picking these targets. Yet these missiles [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=902.08s)]
*  and drones are still coming your way as they attack, as you point out, civilian areas inside [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=908.08s)]
*  Israel. Well, you're right. First of all, we're doing a lot to prevent a lot of them from coming [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=914.64s)]
*  in, but it's not hermetic. You're quite right. But when I say we have control of the skies, [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=920.08s)]
*  you correctly said that they had a very dense anti-aircraft batteries between the [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=924.1600000000001s)]
*  western border of Iran and Tehran, and basically are incredible. There's no other word to describe [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=931.5200000000001s)]
*  it. Are incredible intel guys and the Mossad. They did wonderful work to peel off the layers of [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=938.24s)]
*  protection that they had, and our pilots took them out. And so we have a free highway to Tehran, [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=947.12s)]
*  and we can now pick off the targets that we need in Tehran and other places without having our [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=955.28s)]
*  planes shot down. And so far, none of them have been shot down. And I hope that continues. But we [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=960.48s)]
*  are absolutely resolute to remove this threat. This is what you have to do when you stand [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=965.68s)]
*  at the brink of catastrophe. And I think it's not just our test. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=972.0s)]
*  You know, Churchill talked about the slumber of democracies. He said that democracies tend to [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=975.8399999999999s)]
*  sleep until the jarring gong of danger wakes them up. Well, sometimes it might not wake them up. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=981.52s)]
*  Certainly we didn't need to wake up gong. I've been talking about the Iranian threat for 40 years, [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=988.24s)]
*  three years, I think, or four years after the Iranian regime, the Atollah regime, [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=994.9599999999999s)]
*  hijacked Iran and the people of Iran. I said the greatest threat facing Israel, [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=999.04s)]
*  and potentially the world, is this regime that will try to arm itself with nuclear weapons. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=1003.4399999999999s)]
*  And I've devoted a considerable part of my life, in fact, most of my life, [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=1008.16s)]
*  to preventing that. And when the gong of danger sounds, and you know it's the last moment, [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=1012.4s)]
*  it's the 12th hour, you've got to act. That's what responsible leaders do. And what I want, [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=1017.52s)]
*  what I seek is that the entire world will do what President Trump is doing. He's standing up [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=1023.12s)]
*  for good against evil. He's standing up for the right against the wrong. He's standing up for good [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=1028.8s)]
*  against bad. And I think that's very admirable. I salute you for it, President Trump. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=1034.24s)]
*  The president's also, however, Mr. Prime Minister, calling for Iran to get back to the table, [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=1040.3999999999999s)]
*  to the negotiating table. You don't seem to be saying that that's worth it. How does this end? [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=1044.32s)]
*  Well, in fact, I said it is worth it if they'll do what the president wants, and that is eliminate [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=1050.24s)]
*  their enrichment capacity. That's a lot better than my country, my forces, my brave pilots having [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=1055.28s)]
*  to do it. It's much better than our Assad operatives on the ground having to do it. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=1063.36s)]
*  But if they don't do it, and they certainly didn't want to do it, it became very clear, [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=1068.48s)]
*  we had to act. We don't wait until we have a nuclear holocaust. That's not going to happen again. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=1073.44s)]
*  So how does it end? [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=1078.8799999999999s)]
*  Well, it'll end when we remove those capacities, and we will. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=1080.96s)]
*  You stopped short of killing Iran's civilian leaders, just military commanders, [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=1085.28s)]
*  I mentioned, nuclear scientists, but not the supreme leader, [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=1089.76s)]
*  Khamenei. There is a Reuters report just moving, saying that President Trump in the last couple [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=1093.52s)]
*  of days vetoed an Israeli plan to kill Iran's supreme leader, according to two U.S. officials. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=1098.32s)]
*  Is that true? [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=1103.52s)]
*  Actually, there's so many false reports of conversations that never happened, [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=1105.84s)]
*  and I'm not going to get into that. But I can tell you, I think that we do what we need to do. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=1111.28s)]
*  We'll do what we need to do. And I think the United States knows what is good for the United [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=1118.16s)]
*  States, and I'm just not going to get into that. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=1123.68s)]
*  The Iran foreign minister today told reporters this. If Israel stops attacks on Iran, [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=1125.6s)]
*  quote, our responses will stop. The attack on Iran in the midst of nuclear talks clearly [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=1132.72s)]
*  demonstrates the Israeli regime's opposition to any form of negotiation. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=1137.12s)]
*  Of the canceled talks that were intended to take place today, he said Iran would have presented [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=1140.9599999999998s)]
*  a counterproposal that, quote, could have opened doors for an all-out agreement with the Americans. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=1145.1999999999998s)]
*  So again, the foreign minister saying, if you stop, they will stop. What's your response to that? [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=1150.32s)]
*  Well, first of all, it's hogwash. While they were negotiating, Dayatollah [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=1155.6799999999998s)]
*  himself, Khamenei, tweeted again and again, death to Israel. Israel must be destroyed. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=1159.84s)]
*  So some good faith there, right? Aside from that, they had bad faith because they were [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=1167.3600000000001s)]
*  cheating. And we saw it in our intel. It was very clear. And the U.S. had the same intel. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=1171.04s)]
*  Believe me, we shared it. We share that intelligence. One of the great things of our [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=1175.52s)]
*  unprecedented cooperation that has happened under President Trump is that we share every bit of [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=1179.92s)]
*  information. So number one, he's lying. That's not new. Iran lies all the time. They cheat. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=1185.2s)]
*  But the second point is that they say, okay, we'll stop if you stop. Stop what? [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=1190.72s)]
*  You'll continue to develop your engines of death, mass death, continue to develop your nuclear bombs, [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=1197.04s)]
*  continue to develop the ballistic missiles like the one that fell near Tel Aviv today. I was there. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=1203.92s)]
*  The whole building just slammed through. Children sleeping in their beds killed. Women sleeping in [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=1209.52s)]
*  their beds killed. Horrible stuff. Yeah, they'll stop and continue to develop the means for our [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=1214.64s)]
*  extermination. That's not going to happen. So obviously, that's not said in good faith. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=1220.96s)]
*  The issue here is not de-escalation. The issue here is not ceasefire. The issue here is stopping [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=1226.0s)]
*  those things that will threaten our survival. And we're committed to stopping them. And I think we [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=1232.4s)]
*  can achieve them. Now, if they are willing to accept President Trump's terms, that's a different [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=1236.88s)]
*  matter. I said that months ago. And I said in my meeting with the president in Washington. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=1242.48s)]
*  Yeah, overnight. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=1247.84s)]
*  If you can get a deal that does it, fine. But he did not because the president didn't want it. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=1248.32s)]
*  It's because Iran didn't want it, and they cheated. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=1254.08s)]
*  Overnight, you expanded your airstrikes to include oil and energy infrastructure in Iran. Is that a [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=1256.8s)]
*  different phase? What's the point? Well, this was an oil container. It wasn't a production site. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=1263.36s)]
*  But it merely means that we're ready to take whatever action is needed. And of course, [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=1272.3999999999999s)]
*  we'll take some of those actions in response to what Iran does to us. But as I said, our main [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=1277.84s)]
*  targets are the military and nuclear targets, and we're taking them out with precision and [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=1283.84s)]
*  with purpose. You know, we're not hearing much harsh criticism from the Gulf Arab countries. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=1291.1999999999998s)]
*  There have been some statements. Saudi Arabia putting out the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia expresses [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=1297.36s)]
*  its condemnation, strong denunciation of the Israeli attacks that targeted the Islamic Republic [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=1301.4399999999998s)]
*  of Iran, which violated sovereignty. These attacks represent a blatant violation of international [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=1306.1599999999999s)]
*  laws and norms. That was early on, but not much since then. How do you judge the Gulf [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=1310.56s)]
*  States' response to what's happening now? Well, I'll leave that to them. They can [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=1316.08s)]
*  speak for themselves. But I think, I truly believe, you know, that we have a great future [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=1322.32s)]
*  if we take out Iran. Iran has been the systematic for mentor of wars, sabotage, terrorism. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=1327.84s)]
*  They attacked Aramco, you know, the Saudi oil facilities. They sent terrorists everywhere [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=1336.96s)]
*  throughout the Middle East. So I think that I have a different conception, a different future. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=1342.8s)]
*  And it was embarked on with the help of President Trump and his leadership in the Abraham Accords, [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=1347.68s)]
*  where we signed peace treaties with four Arab states, expanding the peace, something that [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=1353.3600000000001s)]
*  wasn't done for a quarter of a century. And I believe that we'll have opportunities to expand [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=1357.92s)]
*  the peace as well with other of the Arab states next to us. I think they understand that Iran is [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=1362.24s)]
*  a mortal threat to them as well. They have their eyes on their oil facilities. They want the water [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=1368.48s)]
*  ways with the Houthis. They want to conquer the Middle East. And the one obstacle they've had so [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=1374.0s)]
*  far is the state of Israel, because we're the ones fighting Iranians. And the other obstacle they have [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=1379.1200000000001s)]
*  is President Trump. And I think, I'll tell you, they think that President Trump is an enormous [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=1384.48s)]
*  obstacle. They think that Israel is a very big obstacle, and they're out to get us both. In fact, [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=1390.16s)]
*  they tried to kill me too. They fired a missile into my bedroom window. They missed. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=1396.72s)]
*  Wow. The Saudi Crown Prince, as you remember, in September of 23, told me he was getting closer [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=1402.0800000000002s)]
*  every day to recognizing Israel and normalization the very next day. You repeated that to me. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=1409.28s)]
*  Take a listen. Reports that you had suspended talks. No, no, that's not true. Not true. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=1416.56s)]
*  So you think if you were to characterize it, are you close? [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=1423.2s)]
*  Every day we get closer. I know you heard those words from the Saudi Crown Prince. What was your [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=1427.04s)]
*  response? Well, I was delighted to hear what he had to say and to borrow a phrase. I think we're [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=1431.76s)]
*  getting closer to peace every day that passes. Obviously, October 7th was just a few days later. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=1438.24s)]
*  Can you get back to that moment pre-October 7th? [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=1447.44s)]
*  I think what you heard was correct. One of the possible reasons for the timing of Hamas's attack, [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=1453.2s)]
*  and remember Hamas is Iran's, one of Iran's terror proxies, one of the reasons that they may have [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=1461.76s)]
*  brought up the attack, not even coordinated with others as they were supposed to do, [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=1467.84s)]
*  is perhaps that they were afraid that the words of the Saudi Crown Prince and my own words were [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=1472.56s)]
*  about to materialize. But they will materialize one day, I'm sure of it. And that day will be a [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=1478.48s)]
*  lot sooner once we get rid of this mortal threat that Iran poses not only to Israel, [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=1483.52s)]
*  but to our Arab neighbors, to Europe, to the United States, to many others. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=1489.76s)]
*  Last thing, Mr. Prime Minister, I'd be remiss if I didn't ask about the situation in Gaza. One of [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=1494.48s)]
*  the reasons it's not moving forward, the normalization, is because of how that's [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=1500.4s)]
*  happening. Understand that you put the onus on Hamas for everything that's happening there. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=1504.8000000000002s)]
*  But as of now, we take the Gaza Health Ministry for what it is. They say the death is 55,000. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=1509.8400000000001s)]
*  The United Nations puts it at that number as well. But they're citing the Gaza Health Ministry and [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=1516.8000000000002s)]
*  women and children making up half of the dead. Is there an Israeli estimate as far as the death [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=1522.24s)]
*  in Gaza since the start of that operation? Well, the ratio of civilian combatants to [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=1527.44s)]
*  noncombatants is about one to one, which is unheard of in such a dense urban environment. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=1533.1200000000001s)]
*  And that's happening because we're telling the population leave and Hamas at gunpoint, [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=1537.92s)]
*  and sometimes shooting them, saying stay in the war zone. That's why you have or had a lot of [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=1543.1200000000001s)]
*  civilian casualties. That has decreased and happily because we're doing everything in our [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=1548.0s)]
*  power to separate combatants from noncombatants. The reason this war has been going on for so long [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=1554.08s)]
*  is, well, one primary reason is the hostages. They've taken hostages. Remember, this is the [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=1560.32s)]
*  regime that took Americans hostage. That's how they began. There's 53 captives, less than half [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=1565.1999999999998s)]
*  of them believed to be alive. Is that fair? About 20 are alive. The rest, unfortunately, are not [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=1570.96s)]
*  alive. But we started out with, we've already brought back 202 hostages, most of them alive. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=1578.48s)]
*  Some people believed in the beginning of the war. In fact, our senior, the most senior military [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=1588.96s)]
*  people, they said, we'll be lucky if we got one. And I said, no, I don't think so. I think that a [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=1594.08s)]
*  combination of military and diplomatic pressure will get us, we can get them out. And I'm committed [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=1599.3600000000001s)]
*  to getting all of them out. I've said two days ago, I've instructed our people to try to resume [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=1605.52s)]
*  the negotiations for a ceasefire that would enable us to take, Steve Witkoff, the American envoy, [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=1613.36s)]
*  has made an offer to begin a 60-day ceasefire in which half of those hostages would be released [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=1620.4s)]
*  right away. And I said, yes, we're ready to go. There's been some development there. I hope we [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=1628.32s)]
*  are able to do that because I'm committing to getting them out. And I'm committed to getting [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=1633.6s)]
*  them out and also to get to separate the Hamas from controlling the humanitarian aid that we're [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=1637.84s)]
*  trying to give the people of Gaza because they rob it, they steal it, and then they take a good [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=1645.28s)]
*  chunk for themselves and then they hike up the prices and give a pittance to the civilian [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=1650.7199999999998s)]
*  population. So we have a plan that we devised with the help of American firms to separate [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=1655.36s)]
*  the giving of the humanitarian aid to the population from Hamas control. And we're [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=1660.72s)]
*  accused of starvation policies and all these other demonizations and vilifications against Israel. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=1666.32s)]
*  Look, we're a democracy fighting an island in the sea of evil, and we're doing what we can [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=1672.0s)]
*  to remove this proxy, this Iran terror proxy as well. But the big problem, the big question for [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=1678.64s)]
*  Israel, for humanity, for the world, for Israel and the United States, is whether we can take away [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=1684.32s)]
*  the weapons of mass death from this cult of death that is in Tehran. The tyrants of Tehran will not [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=1691.76s)]
*  win. We, with God's help, we will win. So just address the critics who say about Gaza, that [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=1698.32s)]
*  you're trying to make Gaza unlivable in order to push Palestinians out of the territory permanently. [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=1705.1200000000001s)]
*  When they say that, what's the response? Well, because it's another lie. These are incredible [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=1711.36s)]
*  lies. I think, first of all, no army in the history of the world has gone to the lengths [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=1717.4399999999998s)]
*  that Israel has gone to separate combatants from non-combatants using millions of text messages, [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=1721.4399999999998s)]
*  phone calls, you name it, everything, leaflets even, getting the population out. Otherwise, [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=1727.4399999999998s)]
*  we'd have an enormous number of civilian deaths. And of course, Israel has that firepower, but we [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=1735.12s)]
*  don't use it because that's our moral base. But the other thing is, equally, that we're not trying [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=1740.56s)]
*  to destroy Gaza. We're trying to remove the threat from Gaza. And as far as the choice of people, [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=1747.6799999999998s)]
*  if they want to leave or not, President Trump has given a brilliant idea. He said, look, Gaza has to [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=1753.9199999999998s)]
*  be rebuilt. It's been destroyed because every place is booby trapped. So you know, the population [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=1758.32s)]
*  finally leaves. They overcome the threats by Hamas to shoot them, and they just leave. They [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=1764.32s)]
*  tell Hamas, leave our buildings. And they almost get shot by Hamas. But when they leave, they booby [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=1770.48s)]
*  trap everything. So when we come to fight the terrorists, they set off these charges and they [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=1776.3999999999999s)]
*  kill our soldiers. What we do is we bring a supercharge. It detonates all the booby traps, [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=1780.8799999999999s)]
*  and that's how you have buildings destroyed. We also go into tunnels. Sometimes a great sacrifice. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=1785.84s)]
*  UN ambassador Leiter had his son, 39-year-old father of seven, killed because he went as a reserve [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=1791.4399999999998s)]
*  soldier to defuse these tunnels. But we put charges there. They blow up the tunnels. The tunnels are [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=1798.8s)]
*  below buildings. The buildings collapse. So there's a lot of demolition in Gaza. It has to be [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=1804.32s)]
*  rebuilt. President Trump said, OK, let the people have a choice. Why are they locked in? They're not [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=1809.28s)]
*  locked in in other battle scenes. You know, and people leave by the millions in Ukraine and Iraq [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=1815.9199999999998s)]
*  and Syria. They're left by the millions. In Gaza, they're locked in. He said, why? Give them a [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=1820.72s)]
*  choice. If they want to leave to other locations, help them with a voluntary relocation. If they [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=1825.2s)]
*  want to come back, they'll come back after the work of basically restructuring Gaza is complete. [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=1830.24s)]
*  And I think that's a brilliant plan. I think it's all for the good. It's good for peace. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=1837.28s)]
*  It's good for Israel and the United States. I think it's good for Palestinians. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=1842.32s)]
*  They should be given a choice. Mr. Prime Minister, very last thing. I asked you how [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=1847.1200000000001s)]
*  long this may last. You said it's up to the Iranians. If you had the opportunity, and you do now, [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=1850.56s)]
*  to speak directly to the Supreme Leader and to speak directly to the Iranian people, [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=1855.36s)]
*  what are those two messages you'll send? Well, the Iranian dictator, really, he's a dictator. [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=1860.0s)]
*  He's a tyrant. He has sent us a message calling just about every day for the death of Israel, [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=1869.2s)]
*  the destruction of Israel and America, but the death of Israel. So my answer to him [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=1876.72s)]
*  is with action, not with words. But to the people of Iran, I say you're a great people. [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=1882.96s)]
*  You're a people of great talent and genius who have been usurped by this tyranny that has robbed [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=1889.52s)]
*  you of hope, has robbed you of a good life. You know, I speak to the Iranian people directly. [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=1896.4s)]
*  I don't know if you know this, Brett. I do these videos. I get millions and millions of responses. [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=1902.32s)]
*  And they say, Viva Israel, Bravo Israel, free us from this tyranny. And I say to them, [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=1909.9199999999998s)]
*  your hour of freedom is near. Rise up. Be free. Mr. Prime Minister, we appreciate your time in [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=1917.28s)]
*  the middle of a very dangerous time inside Israel. We should point out you are inside Israel. We've [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=1925.9199999999998s)]
*  kept your location private since it's a security situation, but we appreciate all the time you've [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=1931.12s)]
*  given us. You're welcome back on Special Report anytime. Thank you. Thank you, Brett. Thank you. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEoIbNTJHw&t=1937.4399999999998s)]
