# I hope Iran knows this about US-Israel, GOP lawmaker says
**Fox News - World News:** [June 14, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kz07yKWDMQg)
*  with reaction, Arkansas senator Tom Cotton, senator. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kz07yKWDMQg&t=0.0s)]
*  Clearly the Israelis—when you look at the level of sophistication, how deeply they penetrated [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kz07yKWDMQg&t=4.16s)]
*  prior to the launch of this attack into Iranian territory, and that they had weaponry there [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kz07yKWDMQg&t=11.96s)]
*  and drones there and the ability to identify where these top leaders are, be it scientists [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kz07yKWDMQg&t=18.04s)]
*  or Revolutionary Guard members, it is—to me, this is going to be studied for probably [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kz07yKWDMQg&t=24.12s)]
*  the next hundred years, the military strategies of the Israelis. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kz07yKWDMQg&t=32.160000000000004s)]
*  Yes, Sean, I commend once again the bravery and the audacity of the Israeli defense forces [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kz07yKWDMQg&t=36.72s)]
*  and the Mossad and Prime Minister Netanyahu. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kz07yKWDMQg&t=45.36s)]
*  I also commend President Trump for being true to his word, consistent in his support for [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kz07yKWDMQg&t=47.92s)]
*  opposition to Iran ever getting a nuclear weapon that's been his consistent position [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kz07yKWDMQg&t=52.6s)]
*  for 10 years. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kz07yKWDMQg&t=57.44s)]
*  And it's clear that Israel had more than a few tricks up their sleeve last night that [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kz07yKWDMQg&t=59.4s)]
*  Iran was not anticipating, as they did last year with Hezbollah and what you might call [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kz07yKWDMQg&t=63.88s)]
*  Operation Grim Beeper, when they had seeded beepers through Hezbollah's leadership structure [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kz07yKWDMQg&t=68.6s)]
*  and then detonated them remotely. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kz07yKWDMQg&t=73.26s)]
*  And if I were sitting in Tehran tonight as an Ayatollah, I would wonder if Israel has [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kz07yKWDMQg&t=75.52s)]
*  any other tricks up their sleeve. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kz07yKWDMQg&t=79.88s)]
*  But I think you put it well, too, about the difference between these two countries. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kz07yKWDMQg&t=81.64s)]
*  Israel last night targeted one of Iran's three key nuclear sites and their missile [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kz07yKWDMQg&t=86.56s)]
*  and their drones. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kz07yKWDMQg&t=92.44s)]
*  They did target residential neighborhoods with extremely precise weapons, so precise [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kz07yKWDMQg&t=93.92s)]
*  that you could see the holes going through the penthouses where their military leadership [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kz07yKWDMQg&t=99.96000000000001s)]
*  were. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kz07yKWDMQg&t=104.24000000000001s)]
*  And isn't it curious that all those generals are staying in fancy penthouses? [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kz07yKWDMQg&t=105.24000000000001s)]
*  And it goes to show you how corrupt the regime is, not just evil. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kz07yKWDMQg&t=109.36s)]
*  But then look at what happened tonight. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kz07yKWDMQg&t=111.76s)]
*  Iran targets Israel with indiscriminate missile fires into civilian neighborhoods, causing [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kz07yKWDMQg&t=112.92s)]
*  dozens of casualties and at least one death. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kz07yKWDMQg&t=119.24s)]
*  Just imagine what they would do if they had nuclear weapons. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kz07yKWDMQg&t=122.14s)]
*  And remember, it's not just a threat to Israel or our friends in the region. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kz07yKWDMQg&t=124.84s)]
*  It's a threat to the United States. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kz07yKWDMQg&t=128.24s)]
*  They don't just chant death to Israel. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kz07yKWDMQg&t=130.0s)]
*  They chant death to America. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kz07yKWDMQg&t=131.52s)]
*  And they're working on missiles that can hit us here in America. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kz07yKWDMQg&t=132.52s)]
*  You know, the Israelis knew the risk going in, Senator. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kz07yKWDMQg&t=137.12s)]
*  Now that they've started this operation, I don't see any scenario under which they would [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kz07yKWDMQg&t=140.24s)]
*  stop until the nuclear facilities are completely, you know, incapable of ever running again. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kz07yKWDMQg&t=145.4s)]
*  I don't think they stop at this point. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kz07yKWDMQg&t=155.96s)]
*  I think otherwise, I think negotiations at that time would only buy them time to rebuild. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kz07yKWDMQg&t=157.88000000000002s)]
*  Sean, I think it's right that there's not going to be an end to this until those nuclear [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kz07yKWDMQg&t=162.84s)]
*  facilities are dismantled. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kz07yKWDMQg&t=168.6s)]
*  Now, as President Trump said today, Iran still has a chance, second chance, after getting [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kz07yKWDMQg&t=169.6s)]
*  many chances over the last 60 days to negotiate an end to that nuclear program. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kz07yKWDMQg&t=173.64000000000001s)]
*  Israel struck one of three of those facilities. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kz07yKWDMQg&t=179.88s)]
*  It did not strike at Iran's political leadership. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kz07yKWDMQg&t=182.46s)]
*  It did not strike at Iran's energy infrastructure. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kz07yKWDMQg&t=185.48000000000002s)]
*  There are many targets in Iran left that the Ayatollahs might want to preserve. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kz07yKWDMQg&t=188.08s)]
*  But obviously Israel is striking back now, as any nation must when their civilian population [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kz07yKWDMQg&t=192.76s)]
*  is targeted for indiscriminate attack. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kz07yKWDMQg&t=198.2s)]
*  But as President Trump has said, they still have an opportunity, after all of the opportunities [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kz07yKWDMQg&t=200.24s)]
*  he's given them, to come back to the table and to agree to dismantle the rest of their [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kz07yKWDMQg&t=204.76s)]
*  nuclear infrastructure. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kz07yKWDMQg&t=209.18s)]
*  But I hope tonight in Tehran the Ayatollahs understand that Israel and America mean business. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kz07yKWDMQg&t=211.07999999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kz07yKWDMQg&t=218.48s)]
*  Senator Tom Cotton, thank you. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kz07yKWDMQg&t=219.48s)]
*  We appreciate your time. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kz07yKWDMQg&t=221.4s)]
