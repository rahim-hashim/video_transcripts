# Iran fires another wave of ballistic missiles at Israel #shorts #israel #iran #world #breakingnews
**Fox News - World News:** [June 17, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Zjbkhun_Lg)
*  We'll stay as long as we can. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Zjbkhun_Lg&t=0.0s)]
*  And you can hear there's a massive explosion overhead. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Zjbkhun_Lg&t=2.2s)]
*  And once we have another minute, we're going to go out and see if anything was hit. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Zjbkhun_Lg&t=5.8s)]
*  But you could just hear that explosion there, Jesse, and that's why we get off the balcony [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Zjbkhun_Lg&t=11.4s)]
*  as the fire starts to get heavier. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Zjbkhun_Lg&t=15.16s)]
*  But again, this has been going on for the past four days as the Iranians respond to [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Zjbkhun_Lg&t=17.740000000000002s)]
*  these strikes that are taking place across their territory. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Zjbkhun_Lg&t=22.36s)]
*  And despite the fact that the Israelis told us earlier today that they were able to take [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Zjbkhun_Lg&t=25.7s)]
*  out around 40 percent of the missile launchers, we understand that they have not been able [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Zjbkhun_Lg&t=29.72s)]
*  to take out all of them. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Zjbkhun_Lg&t=36.44s)]
*  And so we expect to see more of this type of fire in the days ahead. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Zjbkhun_Lg&t=38.1s)]
