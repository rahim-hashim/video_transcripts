# Trump FURIOUS with Israel, Iran on faltering ceasefire as he leaves for NATO summit
**Fox News - World News:** [June 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mCQHeXq1Mg)
*  But reports coming from the region suggest that the sides accused each other for violating the ceasefire. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mCQHeXq1Mg&t=0.0s)]
*  So, what is your — [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mCQHeXq1Mg&t=6.4s)]
*  I think they both violated it. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mCQHeXq1Mg&t=6.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mCQHeXq1Mg&t=8.1s)]
*  I don't think they — I'm not sure they did it intentionally. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mCQHeXq1Mg&t=8.6s)]
*  They couldn't rein people back. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mCQHeXq1Mg&t=11.1s)]
*  I don't like the fact that Israel went out this morning at all. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mCQHeXq1Mg&t=12.5s)]
*  And I'm going to see if I can stop it. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mCQHeXq1Mg&t=15.9s)]
*  So, as soon as I get away from you, I'm going to see if I can stop it. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mCQHeXq1Mg&t=17.7s)]
*  Okay? [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mCQHeXq1Mg&t=21.400000000000002s)]
*  Are you talking at the Yahoo! store? [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mCQHeXq1Mg&t=21.900000000000002s)]
*  Are you supposed to do it in the morning? [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mCQHeXq1Mg&t=23.7s)]
*  How confident are you that you're not going to take a hold of the situation, strictly, with Donald? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mCQHeXq1Mg&t=24.900000000000002s)]
*  I think it's been completely demolished. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mCQHeXq1Mg&t=29.5s)]
*  I think the reason we're here is because those pilots — those B-2 pilots did an unbelievable job. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mCQHeXq1Mg&t=31.3s)]
*  And, you know, the fake news, like CNN in particular, they're trying to — you know, they're trying to say, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mCQHeXq1Mg&t=37.6s)]
*  well, I agree that it was destroyed, but maybe not that destroyed. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mCQHeXq1Mg&t=42.2s)]
*  You know what they're doing? [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mCQHeXq1Mg&t=46.6s)]
*  They're really hurting great pilots that put their lives in the line. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mCQHeXq1Mg&t=47.3s)]
*  CNN is scum. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mCQHeXq1Mg&t=50.900000000000006s)]
*  And so is MSDNC. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mCQHeXq1Mg&t=52.400000000000006s)]
*  They're all — and, frankly, the networks aren't much better. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mCQHeXq1Mg&t=54.0s)]
*  It's all fake news, but they should not have done that. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mCQHeXq1Mg&t=57.300000000000004s)]
*  Those pilots hit their targets. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mCQHeXq1Mg&t=60.6s)]
*  Those targets were obliterated. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mCQHeXq1Mg&t=62.2s)]
*  And the pilots should be given credit. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mCQHeXq1Mg&t=64.2s)]
*  They're not after the pilots. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mCQHeXq1Mg&t=66.2s)]
*  They're after me. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mCQHeXq1Mg&t=67.4s)]
*  They want to try and demean me. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mCQHeXq1Mg&t=68.0s)]
*  But you don't believe that Iran can rebuild its nuclear program? [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mCQHeXq1Mg&t=69.2s)]
*  No, I mean, Iran will never rebuild its nuclear. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mCQHeXq1Mg&t=71.5s)]
*  From there? [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mCQHeXq1Mg&t=74.4s)]
*  Absolutely not. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mCQHeXq1Mg&t=75.2s)]
*  That place is under rock. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mCQHeXq1Mg&t=76.4s)]
*  That place is demolished. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mCQHeXq1Mg&t=78.10000000000001s)]
*  The B-2 pilots did their job. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mCQHeXq1Mg&t=79.9s)]
*  They did it better than anybody could even imagine. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mCQHeXq1Mg&t=81.9s)]
*  They hit late in the evening. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mCQHeXq1Mg&t=84.2s)]
*  It was dark with no moon. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mCQHeXq1Mg&t=86.4s)]
*  And they hit that target with every one of those things. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mCQHeXq1Mg&t=88.30000000000001s)]
*  And that place is gone. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mCQHeXq1Mg&t=90.80000000000001s)]
*  But when I see CNN all night long, they're trying to say, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mCQHeXq1Mg&t=93.0s)]
*  well, maybe it wasn't really as demolished as we thought. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mCQHeXq1Mg&t=95.7s)]
*  It was demolished. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mCQHeXq1Mg&t=99.7s)]
*  You take a look at the pinpricks and you see that place is gone. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mCQHeXq1Mg&t=100.7s)]
*  And I will say, I think CNN ought to apologize to the pilots of the B-2s. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mCQHeXq1Mg&t=105.0s)]
*  I think that MSDNC ought to apologize. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mCQHeXq1Mg&t=110.10000000000001s)]
*  I think these guys really, these networks and these cable networks are real losers. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mCQHeXq1Mg&t=113.8s)]
*  You really are. You're real losers. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mCQHeXq1Mg&t=119.8s)]
*  The Press. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mCQHeXq1Mg&t=121.5s)]
*  It is real sad that they violated the security rules. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mCQHeXq1Mg&t=122.8s)]
*  You're gutless losers. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mCQHeXq1Mg&t=126.10000000000001s)]
*  I say that to CNN because I watch it. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mCQHeXq1Mg&t=127.2s)]
*  I have no choice. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mCQHeXq1Mg&t=130.1s)]
*  I got to watch that garbage. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mCQHeXq1Mg&t=130.8s)]
*  It's all garbage. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mCQHeXq1Mg&t=131.9s)]
*  It's all fake news. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mCQHeXq1Mg&t=132.8s)]
*  But I think CNN is a gutless group of people. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mCQHeXq1Mg&t=134.2s)]
*  And the people that run it, nobody even knows it's been sold so many times. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mCQHeXq1Mg&t=138.0s)]
*  The people that run it ought to be ashamed. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mCQHeXq1Mg&t=141.7s)]
*  MSDNC, a guy named Brian Roberts, he heads it. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mCQHeXq1Mg&t=143.29999999999998s)]
*  He's a disgrace. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mCQHeXq1Mg&t=146.6s)]
*  He's a weak, pathetic disgrace. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mCQHeXq1Mg&t=147.6s)]
*  Yeah, I do. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mCQHeXq1Mg&t=157.29999999999998s)]
*  They violated it, but Israel violated it too. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mCQHeXq1Mg&t=158.29999999999998s)]
*  Israel, as soon as we made the deal, they came out and they dropped a load of bombs, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mCQHeXq1Mg&t=162.6s)]
*  the likes of which I've never seen before. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mCQHeXq1Mg&t=166.6s)]
*  The biggest load that we've seen. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mCQHeXq1Mg&t=168.89999999999998s)]
*  I'm not happy with Israel. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mCQHeXq1Mg&t=170.79999999999998s)]
*  You know, when I say, okay, now you have 12 hours, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mCQHeXq1Mg&t=172.6s)]
*  you don't go out in the first hour and just drop everything you have on them. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mCQHeXq1Mg&t=175.7s)]
*  So I'm not happy with them. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mCQHeXq1Mg&t=179.1s)]
*  I'm not happy with Iran either. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mCQHeXq1Mg&t=180.79999999999998s)]
*  But I'm really unhappy if Israel is going out this morning [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mCQHeXq1Mg&t=182.6s)]
*  because the one rocket that didn't land, that was shot, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mCQHeXq1Mg&t=185.6s)]
*  perhaps by mistake, that didn't land. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mCQHeXq1Mg&t=189.0s)]
*  I'm not happy about that. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mCQHeXq1Mg&t=191.39999999999998s)]
*  You know what? [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mCQHeXq1Mg&t=194.7s)]
*  We basically have two countries that have been fighting so long and so hard [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mCQHeXq1Mg&t=195.5s)]
*  that they don't know what the fuck they're doing. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mCQHeXq1Mg&t=200.6s)]
*  Do you understand that? [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mCQHeXq1Mg&t=202.9s)]
*  Okay. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mCQHeXq1Mg&t=230.6s)]
*  Don't spray it because it's not an overkill. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mCQHeXq1Mg&t=260.6s)]
