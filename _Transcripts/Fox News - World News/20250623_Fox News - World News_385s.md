# Israel striking Iran after earlier additional airstrikes
**Fox News - World News:** [June 23, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEIYrImJS08)
*  from Trey Yankst right now on Israel striking Iran right now, Trey? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEIYrImJS08&t=0.0s)]
*  Yeah, John Sandra Fox News has learned Israel is currently striking targets in [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEIYrImJS08&t=6.84s)]
*  Iran. This is a wave of strikes. We don't know what exactly they're trying to hit, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEIYrImJS08&t=11.36s)]
*  but it follows additional airstrikes that took place earlier today, going [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEIYrImJS08&t=15.92s)]
*  after a variety of targets in and around the capital of Tehran. Smoke could be [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEIYrImJS08&t=20.16s)]
*  seen rising from the Iranian capital and the idea of saying those earlier [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEIYrImJS08&t=24.86s)]
*  strikes went after underground military infrastructure, missile storage sites [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEIYrImJS08&t=28.7s)]
*  and UAV storage sites. We do expect these Israeli strikes to continue again [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEIYrImJS08&t=32.980000000000004s)]
*  at this hour. We can report there are jets over Iranian territory, striking [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEIYrImJS08&t=37.7s)]
*  different targets at this moment, but these will likely continue as the [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEIYrImJS08&t=42.5s)]
*  Israelis come under more ballistic missile fire from Iran early this [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEIYrImJS08&t=46.3s)]
*  morning. Two different waves of missile strikes targeted this country going [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEIYrImJS08&t=50.06s)]
*  after infrastructure in the south and residential areas in the north. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEIYrImJS08&t=54.14s)]
*  Israeli officials say they'd like this war to be over in a matter of days, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEIYrImJS08&t=58.14s)]
*  but they are preparing for the possibility that this drags out for [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEIYrImJS08&t=61.7s)]
*  weeks. John Sandra. So, Trey, let's go to the politics of Iran itself via [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEIYrImJS08&t=65.02s)]
*  the sources that you've talked to into the region. I'm wondering what you're [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEIYrImJS08&t=70.06s)]
*  picking up that's going on inside the country because, you know, when [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEIYrImJS08&t=73.66s)]
*  a regime is at the tipping point, you usually get some pretty good indications [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEIYrImJS08&t=78.1s)]
*  that that's about to happen. Syria, for example, there were pretty obvious [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEIYrImJS08&t=81.62s)]
*  signs that things were not going well for Assad and then suddenly it tipped [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEIYrImJS08&t=86.46s)]
*  over into a regime change. We saw the same thing in Afghanistan when the [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEIYrImJS08&t=90.38s)]
*  Taliban swept out the Afghanistan government. Do you get a sense that Iran [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEIYrImJS08&t=94.26s)]
*  is anywhere near a tipping point here or do the authorities in charge now, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEIYrImJS08&t=99.98s)]
*  led, I guess, by the IRGC, still have a pretty good handle on all the levers [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEIYrImJS08&t=105.34s)]
*  of power there? Look, Israeli officials say they still have a pretty good [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEIYrImJS08&t=110.53999999999999s)]
*  handle on the situation in Tehran, but it's important to note the Israelis [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEIYrImJS08&t=115.9s)]
*  have gone after much of the military leadership trying to decimate top [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEIYrImJS08&t=120.9s)]
*  commanders from the IRGC. And the strike today on the American base outside [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEIYrImJS08&t=124.62s)]
*  of Doha, al-Udayed, is a significant development, but it's also a coordinated [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEIYrImJS08&t=130.02s)]
*  development. The Americans knew there would be some response from the [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEIYrImJS08&t=135.58s)]
*  Iranians following these strikes that were ordered by President Trump over [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEIYrImJS08&t=138.94s)]
*  the weekend against Iran's key nuclear facilities. And this is in part because [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEIYrImJS08&t=142.45999999999998s)]
*  the Iranians are looking to save face domestically. They're under immense [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEIYrImJS08&t=146.7s)]
*  domestic political pressure. We have seen the images of Iranian civilians, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEIYrImJS08&t=150.42s)]
*  millions of them evacuating the capital of Tehran, lines of traffic as people [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEIYrImJS08&t=154.42s)]
*  tried to get out of the way. Earlier today, the Israelis released an [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEIYrImJS08&t=158.77999999999997s)]
*  infographic showing an IRGC command center in the heart of Tehran urging [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEIYrImJS08&t=162.54s)]
*  Iranian civilians to stay away from these facilities. It's hard to get a [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEIYrImJS08&t=167.42s)]
*  real sense of the feelings from the civilian population given the fact that [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEIYrImJS08&t=171.5s)]
*  the regime has cracked down on Internet access there and people have very [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEIYrImJS08&t=175.38s)]
*  limited ability to speak to the outside world. But as this moves forward, there [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEIYrImJS08&t=179.5s)]
*  is still a political chain of command that exists. You have the Ayatollah [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEIYrImJS08&t=183.82s)]
*  Khamenei, who has reportedly appointed successors if needed, but you also have [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEIYrImJS08&t=187.46s)]
*  President Masoud Peseskyan and his deputies who have not been killed in [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEIYrImJS08&t=193.10000000000002s)]
*  these Israeli strikes. The Israeli strikes have gone after military [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEIYrImJS08&t=196.78s)]
*  leadership so far, and they've been precise in a way that they have used [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEIYrImJS08&t=200.45999999999998s)]
*  their intelligence apparatus here in Tel Aviv to track down these military [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEIYrImJS08&t=204.05999999999997s)]
*  commanders in an effort to weaken Iran's ability to fire back at Israel. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEIYrImJS08&t=208.1s)]
*  And while we certainly have seen that there are fewer missiles flying through [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEIYrImJS08&t=212.54s)]
*  the skies of Israel in recent days, they still have the ability to coordinate [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEIYrImJS08&t=215.7s)]
*  these counterattacks. And so we saw the ballistic missile attack this morning [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEIYrImJS08&t=219.94s)]
*  that targeted those installations in the south of Israel and also residential [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEIYrImJS08&t=223.94s)]
*  areas in the north. And then just last hour, this attack against a U. S. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEIYrImJS08&t=228.06s)]
*  base in Qatar. The key here is the missile supply and the ability to launch [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEIYrImJS08&t=231.82s)]
*  these missiles. It is not surprising that they used short and medium range [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEIYrImJS08&t=236.7s)]
*  missiles in the attack today on the U. S. base in Qatar because the Israelis [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEIYrImJS08&t=240.5s)]
*  have been going after their long range missile supply. They have tried to take [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEIYrImJS08&t=245.38s)]
*  out as many of the launching positions as possible, and the Iranians have had [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEIYrImJS08&t=248.5s)]
*  to systematically start moving where they're firing the missiles from [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEIYrImJS08&t=252.3s)]
*  because the Israelis have control over the skies of Tehran and the surrounding [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEIYrImJS08&t=255.94s)]
*  areas. And again, as we can report at this hour, Israel is currently striking [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEIYrImJS08&t=260.34s)]
*  targets in and around Tehran, an indication that they will keep up this [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEIYrImJS08&t=264.94s)]
*  air campaign in the hours and days ahead. And I'm checking with sources here [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEIYrImJS08&t=269.3s)]
*  in the region to try to get an understanding about the current security [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEIYrImJS08&t=273.62s)]
*  alert in the Gulf right now, because there is concern that this event [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEIYrImJS08&t=277.74s)]
*  retaliating against the United States directly targeting a U. S. base that [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEIYrImJS08&t=281.38s)]
*  normally houses around 10,000 American soldiers may not be over. And so [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEIYrImJS08&t=285.22s)]
*  everyone here is in a high state of alert. The Israelis as well, certainly [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEIYrImJS08&t=289.54s)]
*  coordinating intelligence behind the scenes with the Americans as this [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEIYrImJS08&t=293.46000000000004s)]
*  operation continues. But remember, we learned from Israeli sources over the [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEIYrImJS08&t=297.42s)]
*  past two days that ahead of the American strikes that took out in part [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEIYrImJS08&t=300.74s)]
*  these nuclear facilities in Iran, there was an effort by the Israelis to take [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEIYrImJS08&t=305.66s)]
*  out the air defense systems of the Iranian regime, not only to clear the [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEIYrImJS08&t=310.82000000000005s)]
*  path for American bombers, but also to make it easier to put this pressure on [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEIYrImJS08&t=314.46s)]
*  the regime, the political leadership that's left in Tehran, understanding [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEIYrImJS08&t=319.21999999999997s)]
*  that once you take out the majority of their nuclear program and once their [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEIYrImJS08&t=322.97999999999996s)]
*  ballistic missile program is decimated, all they have left is turning to their [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEIYrImJS08&t=326.74s)]
*  proxies in the region. And over the past year and a half, amid the Israeli [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEIYrImJS08&t=330.62s)]
*  campaign against Hezbollah in southern Lebanon, the American and Israeli [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEIYrImJS08&t=334.17999999999995s)]
*  campaign against the Houthis in Yemen, Israeli strikes against Hamas and [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEIYrImJS08&t=337.91999999999996s)]
*  Islamic Jihad inside Gaza and ongoing limited attacks against Iranian proxies, [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEIYrImJS08&t=341.7s)]
*  the Shia militias in Iraq and Syria. Their proxy ability has also been [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEIYrImJS08&t=346.7s)]
*  decimated. And so Iran is the running out of buttons to push, and so they can [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEIYrImJS08&t=351.38s)]
*  still launch these counterattacks as they have done today, but they don't have [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEIYrImJS08&t=355.3s)]
*  an unlimited supply of missiles. And both the Israelis and the Americans know [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEIYrImJS08&t=358.94s)]
*  that. Okay, Trey Yanks, as our reporters stand by with us in the news breaks, [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEIYrImJS08&t=362.74s)]
