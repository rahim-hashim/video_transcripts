# Putin vs. Trump: What's really going on #foxnews #news #shorts
**Fox News - World News:** [July 09, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybmIGVK8h1w)
*  And what he really wants to do is get the president so frustrated, Bill and Dana, that [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybmIGVK8h1w&t=0.0s)]
*  he walks away and doesn't support Ukraine. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybmIGVK8h1w&t=4.78s)]
*  Well, the president is frustrated. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybmIGVK8h1w&t=7.72s)]
*  But guess what? [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybmIGVK8h1w&t=10.200000000000001s)]
*  He's not walking away. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybmIGVK8h1w&t=11.200000000000001s)]
*  And he's providing military assistance to Ukraine that they desperately need to fend [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybmIGVK8h1w&t=13.36s)]
*  off these attacks. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybmIGVK8h1w&t=18.36s)]
*  Now, 700 things in the air at one time, 500, 600 of them are drones coming at Ukraine now [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybmIGVK8h1w&t=19.36s)]
*  nightly to include ballistic missiles. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybmIGVK8h1w&t=26.52s)]
*  And the ballistic missiles are the most difficult thing for them to stop. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybmIGVK8h1w&t=30.02s)]
*  They used to stop 98 percent of everything several months ago. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybmIGVK8h1w&t=33.980000000000004s)]
*  A few weeks ago it was 90, 95 percent. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybmIGVK8h1w&t=37.74s)]
*  Now it's down to 70 percent. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybmIGVK8h1w&t=40.66s)]
*  That means things are getting through and they are killing and wounding people. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybmIGVK8h1w&t=43.18s)]
*  And the target are civilians. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybmIGVK8h1w&t=47.260000000000005s)]
*  And President Trump is on to this. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybmIGVK8h1w&t=49.96s)]
*  He gets more detailed briefings than I obviously have information to. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybmIGVK8h1w&t=51.32s)]
*  And he knows that this killing is going to continue and Putin is fully intended to do that. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybmIGVK8h1w&t=54.98s)]
*  He wants to break the will of the United States and also undermine Europe's support for Ukraine. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybmIGVK8h1w&t=60.54s)]
*  So he can do what? [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybmIGVK8h1w&t=66.53999999999999s)]
*  Take the country. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybmIGVK8h1w&t=67.53999999999999s)]
*  He's never given that up. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybmIGVK8h1w&t=68.53999999999999s)]
