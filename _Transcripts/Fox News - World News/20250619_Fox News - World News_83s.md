# BREAKING: Iran missiles strike hospital, high-rise apartments #shorts #foxnews #israel #iran #news
**Fox News - World News:** [June 19, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZdGvF65zzw)
*  And this came off one of the Iranian missiles that crashed here in the area of Tel Aviv this morning. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZdGvF65zzw&t=0.0s)]
*  This piece of shrapnel is the kind of thing that went flying all around this area as that rocket made impact, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZdGvF65zzw&t=4.96s)]
*  or immediately after the rocket made impact. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZdGvF65zzw&t=10.48s)]
*  And you think about it, this made the trip in from Iran this morning. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZdGvF65zzw&t=12.48s)]
*  As I get out of the way, I can show you the area we're talking about with one of these strikes. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZdGvF65zzw&t=15.8s)]
*  This neighborhood is Ramat Gan. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZdGvF65zzw&t=19.88s)]
*  It's a modernized both business and residential area. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZdGvF65zzw&t=22.12s)]
*  What you can see are a bunch of the apartment buildings. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZdGvF65zzw&t=26.12s)]
*  There's even one old apartment building there that took a lot of impact from this strike. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZdGvF65zzw&t=28.279999999999998s)]
*  And the missile came down, I'm told it hit directly on one of the residential buildings. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZdGvF65zzw&t=32.68s)]
*  And you can see there was so much impact with the surrounding buildings here. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZdGvF65zzw&t=37.08s)]
*  Remarkably, the injuries here were all relatively minor, environmental shrapnel, that kind of thing. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZdGvF65zzw&t=42.28s)]
*  And that's because the Israelis are respecting these warnings. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZdGvF65zzw&t=48.8s)]
*  The sirens go off and they head for the bomb shelters. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZdGvF65zzw&t=51.8s)]
*  The other impact was in a town called Halon. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZdGvF65zzw&t=54.68s)]
*  Also a residential area, a lot of older buildings in that area. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZdGvF65zzw&t=57.279999999999994s)]
*  Again, the injuries are minor because the Israelis are respecting the warnings. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZdGvF65zzw&t=61.08s)]
*  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that they will now extract a price from the tyrants in Iran. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZdGvF65zzw&t=65.6s)]
*  His words, posting to social media. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZdGvF65zzw&t=71.36s)]
*  Defense Minister Yisrael Katz said they will now intensify the air campaign in Iran. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZdGvF65zzw&t=73.36s)]
