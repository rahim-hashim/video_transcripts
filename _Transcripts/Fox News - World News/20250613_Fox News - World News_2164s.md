# IRAN WARNS US: 'Backer' of Israel will be 'held fully accountable'
**Fox News - World News:** [June 13, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA)
*  Fox News alert. Israel is under attack from Iran after taking out their new sites and [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=0.0s)]
*  top military leaders. For what this means for the U.S. and our troops overseas in the [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=4.8s)]
*  Middle East, let's go right to Jennifer Griffin live from the Pentagon. Hey, Jennifer. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=8.92s)]
*  Hi, Greg. Well, U.S. officials who I've spoken to here at the Pentagon tell me that both [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=12.88s)]
*  U.S. Navy and U.S. Army assets were used to help track and shoot down incoming Iranian [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=18.12s)]
*  missiles. However, the U.S. does not want to appear to be involved in this direct conflict [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=23.72s)]
*  between Israel and Iran. The president would like for Iran to come back to the negotiating [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=28.36s)]
*  table. As we speak, CENTCOM is moving more air and naval assets into the region. U.S. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=33.32s)]
*  Navy officials tell us U.S. Navy assets have been used to protect Israel and the hundreds [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=38.92s)]
*  of thousands of Americans living there. The USS Thomas Hudner, a guided missile destroyer, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=44.08s)]
*  is moving from the western Mediterranean to the eastern Med near Israel, joining the USS [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=49.64s)]
*  Sullivan's and the USS Arleigh Burke, which are already in position off the coast of [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=54.72s)]
*  Israel. Fox's Lucas Tomlinson learned that the U.S. Army had employed the THAAD missile [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=60.12s)]
*  defense system, which can shoot down an incoming ballistic missile from 120 miles out, and [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=65.46s)]
*  the Patriot PAC-3 battery, which has about one each of those has about 100 U.S. soldiers [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=72.12s)]
*  manning them inside Israel tonight. The U.S. sent one THAAD battery in October of last year [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=78.08s)]
*  and another in April, two of the seven in the Army's arsenal. The U.S. has one aircraft [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=83.92s)]
*  carrier strike group in the Middle East right now. The USS Carl Vinson in the Arabian Sea [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=89.52s)]
*  off the coast of Oman, where those Iran nuclear talks were supposed to take place on Sunday. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=94.8s)]
*  Now many Iranian leaders who were supposed to participate in those talks are dead, killed [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=100.24000000000001s)]
*  in Israeli strikes. A senior Israeli security source told me last night Iran had accumulated [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=105.8s)]
*  large amounts of highly enriched uranium sufficient for more than nine nuclear bombs. One third [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=111.92s)]
*  of that was enriched and accumulated in the last three months alone while those negotiations [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=117.16s)]
*  were taking place. That's why Israel decided to act. The International Atomic Energy Agency [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=122.92s)]
*  said tonight that the above ground Natanz uranium enrichment facility was destroyed [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=128.85999999999999s)]
*  in the Israeli air strikes overnight. Greg? Thanks Jennifer. In the meantime, Kamala's [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=134.4s)]
*  failed V. Tim Walz now suggesting that Communist China might be the voice of moral authority [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=140.12s)]
*  following Israel's strikes on Iran. Now who is the voice in the world that can negotiate [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=145.28s)]
*  some type of agreement in this? Who holds the moral authority? Who holds the ability [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=152.76s)]
*  to do that? Because we are not seen as a neutral actor. Now I ask who that is. And I mean, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=157.72s)]
*  consistently over and over again, we're going to have to face the reality. It might be the [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=164.92000000000002s)]
*  Chinese. So Charlie, if you wanted to do a deep fake to make Tim Walz look like a [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=169.48s)]
*  complete jackass, you couldn't even be that. So you really could. You know, he has a background [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=175.44s)]
*  with China. Yeah. So this is like, I mean, what's going on here? It's so funny you said [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=181.44s)]
*  that because when I first saw it on Twitter and the first thing I did, I saw it was I [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=187.2s)]
*  went back and look, I was like, well, obviously this is not real. And then finally I got [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=192.12s)]
*  back to C-SPAN and I was like, well, C-SPAN is not shipping around deep fakes. So, but it is, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=195.1s)]
*  no, it's beyond absurdity. And this is the standard bearer that Democrats just six months ago [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=201.1s)]
*  had picked out of nowhere. You could have picked anybody, but they picked this guy. And I really [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=208.22s)]
*  do think that it's sort of, you know, it's a reminder of where we are. Big picture. You have [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=214.06s)]
*  decades of, you know, Barack Obama won the Nobel peace prize before he even became president in [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=219.9s)]
*  2008. He wasn't even inaugurated yet. And he was granted the Nobel peace prize in part because [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=226.94s)]
*  they thought he was going to solve the Middle East. These problems are problems that we've been [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=231.98s)]
*  talking about forever. They've been intractable forever and nobody has ever, we've just sort of [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=235.42s)]
*  resigned ourselves to thinking that nothing will ever move over there. And then you take Don from [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=238.94s)]
*  Queens who comes at it from a completely different perspective, understanding human nature [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=244.46s)]
*  and applies all the parts and applies all the pressures. And then suddenly things begin to [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=250.22s)]
*  break loose. And it does make you kind of wonder if Trump had not had his interregnum, his interrupt, [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=255.42000000000002s)]
*  his interruptus, you know, would, would we not even be talking about this right now? Would [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=261.90000000000003s)]
*  Saudi Arabia and Israel and all of its neighbors already be living in peace and like, you know, [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=268.14s)]
*  trading, you know, mercantile goods instead of missiles? Good point. Jessica, may I operate [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=273.98s)]
*  an analogy? I think so. I'm a little afraid, but imagine the Democrat party is a face [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=281.34000000000003s)]
*  and Tim Walz is like a cold sore that goes away for a few weeks and it keeps coming back. And [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=288.54s)]
*  every time it comes back, it's more inflamed. It's more inflamed. How, what would you do to get rid [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=294.86s)]
*  of this cold sore that seems to be just a lot? Yes. You guys need some industrial political [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=300.7s)]
*  strength. Valtrex. I was going to say, I didn't want to make it seem like I knew too much about [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=308.53999999999996s)]
*  this because I don't have her big simplex. But now that you've said Valtrex, that is the solution. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=313.9s)]
*  I too thought maybe I was being punked and I know Tim Walz doesn't care about me much, but [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=320.7s)]
*  he should have known that I was going to have to show up at work today and talk about this clip. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=326.54s)]
*  There are so many good ways to talk about mistakes Donald Trump has made without saying that the [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=331.82s)]
*  Chinese are the arbiters of good principles or whatever the exact phrase theology was. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=340.70000000000005s)]
*  Donald Trump's proposed Iran nuclear deal part two is the same one that he ripped up. If you want to say, [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=348.94s)]
*  oh, Iran's been enriching uranium at this fast pace, well go figure. It's because we [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=359.26s)]
*  ripped up the nuclear deal. Make that case if you want to. You can talk about any number of things, [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=363.90000000000003s)]
*  but you don't need to talk about that. And it's a big point of frustration. We don't have to be [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=370.14s)]
*  reflexively against everything. You pick and choose your spots and you make a cogent case. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=375.5s)]
*  I think that you can do that quite effectively, but when you dismiss things like the Abraham [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=382.06s)]
*  Accords, and I know that he's going for the Abraham Accords part two and thinks that he'll [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=386.38s)]
*  have extra nations that will sign on and that's what might be his best chance at getting the [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=390.94s)]
*  peace prize, I think you need to say yay to this and yay to that. So you seem like a normal human [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=395.42s)]
*  being and then people will consider us to be president again in 2028. That is a high bar to [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=400.7s)]
*  expect Tim Walz to be a normal human being. Bartha, what is the Chinese piece to this? Why [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=405.82s)]
*  did he bring it up? I don't understand this and we know he went to China many times and he was [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=412.06s)]
*  he's involved in some kind of... Tiananmen Tim as Jesse would say. Yes, exactly. So he knows it really well, [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=416.94s)]
*  Craig. It's obvious. He's a China expert and that's why. No, but I kept thinking as all this was [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=422.53999999999996s)]
*  unfolding about the only two people who might be sitting around the globe going, oh, you know, [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=428.22s)]
*  we're this kind of axis of evil of Russia and Iran and China and you see Russia reaching out. Well, [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=433.66s)]
*  I can come up with some sort of deal. Just get me in there and I'll fix it just like I did with [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=441.74s)]
*  Ukraine and my own country. But China's tea is very mum. So I don't think China's going to be the [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=445.34000000000003s)]
*  moral authority because when they're in this situation, they like to sit back and just sort [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=450.86s)]
*  of whistle a little bit because they're not going to get in the middle of this whole thing. But what [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=454.94s)]
*  I find fascinating is that, you know, with regard to the Iran deal, Jessica, this, I think this Iran [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=459.34s)]
*  deal was not the old Iran deal because this Iran deal had verifiable anytime, anywhere inspections. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=464.78s)]
*  They don't want that. This Iran deal had restrictions on ballistic missiles, which we know [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=472.06s)]
*  they like very much. We've seen them using them all day today. So they did not want this deal and [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=477.58s)]
*  Trump kept saying to them, super simple. All you have to do is sign on the dotted line. I will never [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=483.1s)]
*  have a nuclear weapon and we'll know if you do because we're going to be in your facilities [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=487.66s)]
*  whenever we want to. They could not. Humiliation is a huge factor in Iran right now. They have, [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=492.38s)]
*  as I said before, zero economy. Their currency has crashed. They have about half the population [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=498.46000000000004s)]
*  living in poverty and they have a huge significant part of the population who wants the leadership [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=504.06s)]
*  They are desperate at this point. So the only thing they have was the threat of nuclear weapons [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=509.34s)]
*  and chanting death to America every five minutes. Everybody else in the neighborhood wants them, [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=515.98s)]
*  wants them gone, toppled. And so this is a unique moment and Israel recognized and I think [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=521.1s)]
*  President Trump, even though he does not like war and doesn't want this to turn into a war, [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=526.7s)]
*  understood the importance of the moment. Last word, Katie. Do you know what's going on with [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=533.26s)]
*  with him in China? Well, I would say that although the Iranians have been humiliated [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=539.3399999999999s)]
*  over the last 24 hours, then you trot out Tim Walsh and have him talk about this serious [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=545.26s)]
*  situation and bring up something weird like China. Tim Walsh wants to be president. He wants to be [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=549.5799999999999s)]
*  the commander in chief and over the past 24 hours, what this has actually highlighted is that we don't [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=555.26s)]
*  have really any kind of drone protection here in the United States and China has purchased a lot of [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=560.94s)]
*  farmland in this country. China has tried to smuggle in agricultural bio weapons to disrupt [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=566.22s)]
*  the crops in this country. There are spies all over our university system and you have Tim Walsh who [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=572.3000000000001s)]
*  instead of taking a step and saying why is it that we lost the 2024 election because we were [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=578.0600000000001s)]
*  so insane and out of touch with reality and the threats that face the country, he then throws [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=583.1s)]
*  the United States under the bus and says that China is the one who should begin negotiating [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=588.78s)]
*  these things even though they also have been enemies of the United States. So he's not a [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=592.86s)]
*  serious person. We have very serious issues with China and yet he thinks that they should be dealing [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=596.9399999999999s)]
*  with the situation and no one thinks that Tim Walsh and Kamala Harris could handle this better. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=601.74s)]
*  No one. You all got the question wrong. He's a communist. Well that's true. Do I have to spell it out to you? [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=605.9s)]
*  That we bring in Nazi Mournian, associate fellow at the Middle East Institute. She grew up in Tehran [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=612.62s)]
*  moved to the United States at the start of the 1979 revolution. Nazi, welcome. It is great to have you [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=618.86s)]
*  with us today. As someone who witnessed the overthrow of the Shah and the institution of [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=624.78s)]
*  the IRGC and the Ayatollah, what is going through your mind as you watch this? [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=632.06s)]
*  Thank you, Martha. I think I'm on a delay on Zoom but I will continue. A lot of emotions [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=636.7s)]
*  has been historic today for any Iranian in the world that is dreaming of a free democratic Iran. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=646.1400000000001s)]
*  Every call that I get from within Iran is a call of gratitude. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=653.74s)]
*  They keep telling me we've been waiting for a day like this and Benjamin Netanyahu and President Trump are our heroes. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=662.6999999999999s)]
*  So it's a day of gratitude for what the idea has done, what is continuing to do on behalf of the Iranian people [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=670.6999999999999s)]
*  and I think humanity in general is one of the worst political structures in the history of the Middle East. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=678.6999999999999s)]
*  Do you see this as a moment, you hear what Netanyahu is saying now about encouraging the Iranian people to look to a brighter future without the Islamic regime at the head? [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=687.1s)]
*  Do you think that that moment is now? Is that possible? What's your read? [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=703.1s)]
*  I'm hopeful as many are. I think when Iran, the Islamic Republic of Iran, crossed the ruby [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=707.34s)]
*  combat attacking Israel directly, not through its proxies but directly, it kind of changed the mindset within the IDF, [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=720.7800000000001s)]
*  the ideational and the operational vision that they had for Iran. They received intelligence that [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=729.4200000000001s)]
*  pointed to a collaboration between Hamas and the Islamic Republic to physically attack Israel and make it collapse. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=735.74s)]
*  These are the information that the IDF received just after the attack of October 7th. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=747.26s)]
*  They saw no choice but to go to the Islamic Republic infrastructure, the key sites, the strategic sites, the nuclear reactors and attack. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=752.0600000000001s)]
*  And this is, to me, this is a message to the world that they should take Israel both literally and seriously. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=764.46s)]
*  Is there any way of knowing how effective these attacks have been on the nuclear infrastructure in Iran? [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=774.38s)]
*  Your information, what we get out of different platforms is probably as correct as it gets. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=783.1s)]
*  It's what information I have. I haven't been able to speak to any IDF general directly. It's all been through different channels. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=797.66s)]
*  But between 10 to 12 nuclear scientists have been eliminated. The head of Iranian IRGC has been eliminated. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=806.7800000000001s)]
*  Cheney Khomeini, the Supreme Leader of Iran, had no clothes and it was blind to the sky of Iran [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=815.5s)]
*  because the S-300s were taken out in October. This is just more pressure on the Islamic regime [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=827.1800000000001s)]
*  to either capitulate or come to the negotiating table humbled by the strength, the commitments and the resolve of both the US and Israelis. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=834.38s)]
*  Just quickly, Nazi, when you listen to those voices of people on the streets in Tehran, you know, [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=845.42s)]
*  cheering on the retaliation and death to Israel and all that, what would be your message to American viewers who are watching those voices on the streets of Tehran? [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=849.82s)]
*  That's a great question, Martha. Iran is a contradictory country. It has a very devout Shiite population that back the regime, [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=858.62s)]
*  but it also has this forward-looking cosmopolitan, sophisticated, educated population that yearn to be part of the international community. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=872.86s)]
*  So, and those voices are gaining more momentum, more power than the traditional base of the regime. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=882.3s)]
*  The traditional base of the regime is actually being marginalized as time goes on because they see that the regime hasn't been able to provide any of the basic food, [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=889.18s)]
*  the basic rights that countries provide for their people. This is all ideological fervor. I don't think it will matter at the end. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=900.38s)]
*  I think the resolve of the Iranian people will carry the day with the help of IDF and the US. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=911.02s)]
*  I want to also add that, you know, it was 1979 when I left Iran, just at the start of the revolution. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=920.3s)]
*  The Shah had come to the TV stream to address the Iranian people that I've heard your calls for the revolution, I'm willing to reform, and I will do better. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=928.06s)]
*  So that was just the beginning of the end for the Shah because the Islamism that was going in Iran kind of took that as a sign that it's going forward with its agenda, [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=940.86s)]
*  which is toppling the Shah, and the Shah is at its weakest point. Right now the Islamic regime is on its weakest point. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=952.78s)]
*  Nazi, thank you so much. Nazi Monian joining us today as we watch all of this unfold. Great to have you with us. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=960.62s)]
*  Hey, Sean Hannity here. Hey, click here to subscribe to Fox News YouTube page and catch our hottest interviews and most compelling analysis. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=967.0200000000001s)]
*  You will not get it anywhere else. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=975.4200000000001s)]
*  We begin with Trey Yanks. He's in Tel Aviv and he's got the latest for where it's on the ground there in the Middle East, right? [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=979.0200000000001s)]
*  Yeah, John, good afternoon. Waves of Israeli strikes have targeted positions across Iran throughout the day. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=986.0600000000001s)]
*  Again, I do want to just read you this alert we're getting in right now. Due to detection of missile launches toward Israel, alerts may be activated in areas in the coming minutes. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=992.62s)]
*  And so you'll stay with us here. But again, Israel is bracing for the possibility of a large scale Iranian response to these strikes that took place overnight and throughout the day. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=1001.98s)]
*  We do know more than 200 Israeli jets participated in the first wave of strikes, not only hitting the Iranians capital, but nuclear facilities, also killing nuclear scientists and top IRGC leadership, including the head of the IRGC, Hussein Salami. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=1012.6199999999999s)]
*  Fox News has learned new information about the strikes that targeted individuals. An Israeli security source tells us that more than 20 sites were hit in less than 15 minutes, aimed solely at taking out these people. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=1029.26s)]
*  With the help of the Mossad, the Israelis tricked the top command of Iran's Air Force into a meeting and then kept them there. I'm told by this source they go on to say, quote, we did specific activities to help us understand things about them and then use that information to make them act in a specific way. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=1041.26s)]
*  We knew this would make them meet. But more importantly, we knew how to keep them there. Now, Israel is bracing for that expected Iranian retaliation. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=1057.66s)]
*  Overnight, Iran responded by launching 100 suicide drones at Israel, but most of them were shot down outside of Israeli airspace. Officials here warned that Iran has the ability to launch large barrages of ballistic missiles. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=1065.58s)]
*  So the country remains in a state of emergency. Now, I've been talking today, John, with not only Israeli sources, with the Qataris and with the Iranians trying to understand what comes next. All agree there are tense days ahead for the region. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=1077.02s)]
*  John, yeah, I'm looking at that same alert system that you get there. And for the very first time, I see the entire country of Israel lit up in red. So something big might be coming their way. You said that you've talked to Qataris. You've also talked to the Iranians. What are you hearing from the Iranians about all this? [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=1090.38s)]
*  Yeah, the Iranians released a statement through an official coming directly from the supreme leader saying, quote, the armed forces will bring the vile regime to ruin. They will not escape unscathed from this crime. The Iranian nation can be assured there will be no negligence. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=1105.66s)]
*  A clear indication that the Iranians plan to respond. And despite the fact that the Israelis targeted not only these nuclear sites, but many of the ballistic missile launching sites, Israeli officials have made very clear to us in conversation. We have talked with not only officials from the army, but from Israeli intelligence. They understand Iran has significant capabilities to target Israeli population centers. And remember, the Israelis have air defense systems that are far more advanced than the Iron Dome, that system that we talk about often when it comes to rocket fire. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=1123.42s)]
*  They have a lot of different systems that fire from places like Gaza and Lebanon, but they have David Sling, the Arrow two and three systems and of course the American Patriot systems and a THAAD system. And so it is not a perfect defense against incoming missile fire. It certainly will shoot down some of that incoming fire when it does start. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=1153.42s)]
*  And that is the reason they are warning civilians to stay close to bomb shelters tonight because there is real concern that some of these missiles will slip past the defense systems slamming into major cities like Jerusalem and where we're standing right now in Tel Aviv. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=1171.34s)]
*  John? [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=1185.26s)]
*  Well, Israel has vowed to give people 10 minutes warning if they have to get to the shelter. So we'll keep you on hot standby, Trey. Thanks so much. Appreciate it. Our chief national security correspondent Jennifer Griffin live from the Pentagon with the latest from there. How is the U.S. reacting, Jennifer? [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=1186.26s)]
*  Well, John, U.S. Central Command, CENTCOM, is moving more air and naval assets into the region. It's clear that Israel avoided targeting Iran's civilian leaders and President Trump, who's been meeting with his national security team, says he would like Iran to return to the negotiating table. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=1200.26s)]
*  But a number of those who were at the negotiating table representing Iran at the talks were killed last night. As Alex mentioned, four of the top commanders, but not the head of the IRGC Quds Force. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=1217.22s)]
*  He survived. A senior Israeli security source told me last night, quote, Iran had accumulated large amounts of highly enriched uranium sufficient for more than nine nuclear bombs. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=1229.1s)]
*  One third of that was enriched and accumulated in the last three months alone, I'm told, while negotiations were taking place. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=1239.98s)]
*  A drastic increase of production volume. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=1247.7s)]
*  Iran, the source told me, was stalling and playing for time with negotiations while racing toward breakout. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=1250.26s)]
*  An accelerated effort has not been seen in the last two decades like this, according to the source. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=1256.5s)]
*  U.S. Navy officials say the USS Thomas Hudnur, a guided missile destroyer, is moving from the western Mediterranean to the eastern Med near Israel. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=1262.94s)]
*  And a second U.S. Navy destroyer is being deployed as well. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=1273.34s)]
*  The U.S. had pulled some assets from the region after the Houthi operation ended a month ago. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=1276.74s)]
*  The U.S. has one aircraft carrier strike group in the Middle East right now. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=1282.46s)]
*  The USS Carl Vinson. It's in the Arabian Sea off the coast of Oman, where those Iran nuclear talks were supposed to take place on Sunday. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=1286.62s)]
*  Deception was a key part of the launch of this operation. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=1295.78s)]
*  Israel's Mossad, as Alex reported, built a secret drone base deep inside Iran, which helped with targeting last night, a deceptive tactic that looks very similar to what the Ukrainians pulled off inside Russia just two weeks ago. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=1299.94s)]
*  Israel saw a window to strike after last October. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=1314.22s)]
*  I'm told when Iran fired 180 ballistic missiles at Israel, the U.S. helped intercept many of those missiles. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=1317.66s)]
*  But 40 got through and Israel then took out nearly all of Iran's air defense systems. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=1324.74s)]
*  Iran's ability to defend its skies and sensitive nuclear installations was significantly degraded last October. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=1330.38s)]
*  And many within Netanyahu's security cabinet felt the time was right to strike. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=1337.22s)]
*  They had been asking to do so since January. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=1341.8600000000001s)]
*  There are no briefings expected here at the Pentagon, John, not even any off-camera gaggles. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=1344.74s)]
*  We have had only one press briefing here at the Pentagon since January 20th. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=1350.18s)]
*  John. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=1354.54s)]
*  All right, we'll see what comes out of that meeting in the Situation Room that got underway at 11 o'clock this morning as well. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=1355.8600000000001s)]
*  Jennifer Griffin for us at the Pentagon. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=1361.38s)]
*  Jennifer, thank you. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=1362.9s)]
*  Chief National Security correspondent Jennifer Griffin is live at the Pentagon tonight with the latest there. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=1363.66s)]
*  Good evening, Jennifer. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=1368.14s)]
*  Good evening, Brett. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=1369.1000000000001s)]
*  This growing war between Israel and Iran is far from over. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=1369.9s)]
*  The potential for escalation and expansion is huge. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=1373.6200000000001s)]
*  The president has made clear the U.S. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=1377.34s)]
*  military is not taking part in Israel strikes targeting Iran's nuclear program unless attacked. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=1379.1s)]
*  U.S. officials confirm the U.S. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=1385.5s)]
*  military was involved in helping to defend Israel from the three waves of approximately 100 ballistic missiles per wave fired from Iran today. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=1387.22s)]
*  It takes about 13 minutes for a ballistic missile to reach Israel from those mobile launch sites inside Iran. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=1397.1s)]
*  As we speak, CENTCOM is moving more air and naval assets into the region. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=1404.06s)]
*  U.S. Navy officials tell us U.S. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=1409.06s)]
*  Navy assets have already been used to protect Israel and the hundreds of thousands of Americans living there. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=1411.02s)]
*  The USS Thomas Hudner, a guided missile destroyer, is moving from the western Mediterranean to the eastern Med near Israel, [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=1417.9399999999998s)]
*  joining the USS Sullivan's and USS Arleigh Burke, which are already in position helping Israel. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=1425.4199999999998s)]
*  Fox's Lucas Tomlinson learned that the U.S. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=1431.9799999999998s)]
*  Army has employed the THAAD missile defense system, which can shoot down an incoming ballistic missile from 120 miles out. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=1434.4199999999998s)]
*  And the Patriot PAC-3 battery each has about 100 U.S. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=1442.8999999999999s)]
*  soldiers manning them inside Israel tonight. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=1446.8999999999999s)]
*  The U.S. sent one THAAD battery in October and another in April, two of the seven in the Army's arsenal. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=1449.9399999999998s)]
*  The U.S. has one aircraft carrier strike group in the Middle East right now. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=1457.1s)]
*  The USS Carl Vinson in the Arabian Sea off the coast of Oman, where those Iran nuclear talks were supposed to take place on Sunday. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=1460.94s)]
*  Now, many Iranian leaders who were supposed to participate in those talks are dead, killed in targeted Israeli strikes. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=1469.78s)]
*  A senior U.S. military source tells FoxBret Iran can only fire about 100 ballistic missiles at one time, given the limitation to the number of [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=1477.38s)]
*  mobile missile launchers that they currently have. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=1487.5s)]
*  The U.S. military is not taking part in the offensive strikes against Iran, but would do so if any of its bases or personnel are targeted by Tehran. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=1490.7s)]
*  The head of the IAEA, Brett, said Israel destroyed the above ground uranium enrichment site at Natanz today. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=1500.9s)]

*  Jennifer, thank you. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=1511.02s)]
*  Chief Foreign Correspondent Trey Yanks joins us once again with the very latest from there, from the ground there. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=1512.06s)]
*  Hi, Trey. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=1517.9399999999998s)]
*  Martha, good afternoon. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=1520.58s)]
*  We can match Jennifer's reporting at the Pentagon. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=1521.62s)]
*  Israeli intelligence sources are now telling Fox News and confirming that the Americans are involved in the process of shooting down these incoming [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=1524.54s)]
*  ballistic missiles. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=1533.34s)]
*  We saw the explosions here in Tel Aviv as they lit up the sky. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=1534.6599999999999s)]
*  Some of those missiles slipping past Israeli and American air defense systems. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=1538.5s)]
*  And as we look forward, an important point was raised about the capabilities of the Iranians. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=1543.06s)]
*  They have only a relatively small number of launching positions and these mobile units make it very difficult for the Israelis to strike them [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=1548.6599999999999s)]
*  after they fire on Tel Aviv or other major population centers here. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=1558.02s)]
*  And when those alarms were sounding just last hour and earlier, even this hour, there were alerts going off not just in cities across [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=1562.62s)]
*  central Israel, but as far north as the city of Haifa and then into the Negev desert in the south. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=1569.46s)]
*  We do anticipate in the moments ahead a new statement from Israel's top military spokesman about the situation on the ground. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=1575.62s)]
*  We do anticipate we'll get more details as they start to trickle in to the aftermath of these strikes. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=1583.78s)]
*  There are reports in local media of some more moderate injuries and people actually being removed from rubble in the Dan region of [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=1591.06s)]
*  Israel. And when we look at this, it will take hours to get a full picture of what exactly happened and the extent of the damage. [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=1598.86s)]
*  Israeli officials have been very clear about what took place. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=1607.62s)]
*  Israel's defense minister, Israel Katz, releasing a statement saying that the Iranians crossed a red line in their response, not trying to [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=1611.02s)]
*  target military installations in Israel, but firing directly into Israeli population centers. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=1618.18s)]
*  So we can expect more Israeli strikes in the hours ahead to target Iran and possibly even a ratcheting up of the targets within [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=1623.5400000000002s)]
*  Iranian territory. As Jennifer mentioned, the focus overnight was not only on the nuclear sites, but also on leadership from the [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=1631.74s)]
*  IRGC. Politicians within the Iranian political echelon were not targeted. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=1638.9s)]
*  Certainly, they could be targets in the future for the Israelis. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=1644.4599999999998s)]
*  As officials here tell us, they anticipate this exchange of fire will continue for days, if not weeks, as the region braces for more [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=1648.1s)]
*  conflict ahead. Martha. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=1656.6999999999998s)]
*  Okay, Trey, thank you so much. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=1658.4199999999998s)]
*  President Trump met with his National Security Council today. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=1660.54s)]
*  He says Iran may still have an opportunity to get a deal. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=1663.34s)]
*  Correspondent Alexandria Hoff is at the White House, joins us live from the North Lawn. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=1667.78s)]
*  Good evening, Alexandria. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=1671.4199999999998s)]
*  Good evening, Brett. Yeah, the White House is continuing to emphasize that the U.S. was not involved in the strikes against [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=1673.34s)]
*  Iran, that this was unilateral action taken by Israel. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=1678.86s)]
*  But we also know that President Trump and Prime Minister Netanyahu spoke several times in the days prior and then again today. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=1683.42s)]
*  With a complex weekend approaching, the White House captured this photo of the president in the West Wing today, though much of [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=1690.74s)]
*  the afternoon was spent in the Situation Room with his National Security Council. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=1696.86s)]
*  On overnight strike action taken by Israel, the president tells Fox News the Iranians were hit 10 times worse than they thought [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=1700.5s)]
*  they would be. They weren't ready to negotiate. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=1708.38s)]
*  I think they may be now. [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=1710.54s)]
*  We'll see. President Trump eyeing up whether a weakened Iran will encourage progress in reaching a nuclear deal. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=1711.66s)]
*  A sixth round of talks were scheduled for Sunday in Oman. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=1718.06s)]
*  A senior U.S. official expressed hope to Fox News this morning that the meeting would still take place. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=1721.46s)]
*  That's despite Iranian state media reporting that the regime pulled out of Sunday's session. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=1726.22s)]
*  President Trump was aware of Israel's strikes beforehand, revealing yesterday only that he did not want military action to disrupt the [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=1731.22s)]
*  nuclear talks. As long as I think there is an agreement, I don't want them going in because I think I would blow it. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=1738.22s)]
*  Might help it, actually, but it also could blow it. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=1744.42s)]
*  They can't have a nuclear weapon. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=1747.42s)]
*  I'd prefer I'd prefer the more friendly path. [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=1749.8600000000001s)]
*  This morning, the president stated two months ago, I gave Iran a 60 day ultimatum to make a deal. [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=1752.78s)]
*  They should have done it. Today is day 61. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=1758.1399999999999s)]
*  I told them what to do, but they just couldn't get there. [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=1760.3799999999999s)]
*  Now they have perhaps a second chance. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=1763.06s)]
*  The rest of the administration has remained largely quiet. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=1765.8999999999999s)]
*  We just got word that Mr. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=1768.8999999999999s)]
*  Wyckoff will not be able to join us due to the fluid situation. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=1769.98s)]
*  Special envoy to the Middle East, Steve Wyckoff, was forced to miss the opening of an exhibit in Washington that pays tribute to [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=1773.26s)]
*  festivalgoers killed in Israel. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=1778.86s)]
*  And we really not have not heard much of anything from the president's cabinet since Iran launched its retaliation campaign. [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=1781.62s)]
*  Energy Secretary Chris Wright, though, did post that he is right now tracking any potential impacts to the global energy supply. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=1787.4199999999998s)]
*  Brett. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=1794.1399999999999s)]
*  I was Andrew Hoff live in the North Lawn. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=1795.1799999999998s)]
*  Alex, that we bring in Nasi Monian, associate fellow at the Middle East Institute. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=1796.9399999999998s)]
*  She grew up in Tehran, moved to the United States at the start of the 1979 revolution. [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=1801.9799999999998s)]
*  Nasi, welcome. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=1807.5s)]
*  It is great to have you with us today as someone who witnessed the overthrow of the Shah and the Institute, institution of the IRGC and the [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=1808.46s)]
*  Ayatollah. [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=1818.3000000000002s)]
*  What is going through your mind as you watch this? [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=1819.5s)]
*  Thank you, Martha. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=1827.46s)]
*  I think I'm on a delay on a zoom, but I will continue. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=1828.3000000000002s)]
*  A lot of emotions has been historic today for any Iranian that is dreaming of a free democratic Iran. [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=1832.78s)]
*  This is every call that I get from within Iran is a call of gratitude. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=1842.3s)]
*  They keep telling me we've been waiting for a day like this. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=1850.8600000000001s)]
*  And and Benjamin Netanyahu and President Trump are heroes. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=1854.18s)]
*  So it's a day of gratitude for what the idea has done, what is being done on behalf of the people. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=1859.5s)]
*  And I think the one of the worst political structures in the history of the Middle East. [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=1867.02s)]
*  Do you see this as a moment? [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=1876.3s)]
*  You hear what Netanyahu is saying now about encouraging the Iranian people to look to a brighter future without the Islamic regime at the [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=1878.3s)]
*  head. [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=1887.4199999999998s)]
*  Do you think that that moment is now? [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=1888.3s)]
*  Is that possible? [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=1890.46s)]
*  What's your read? [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=1891.34s)]
*  I'm hopeful, as many are. [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=1897.8999999999999s)]
*  I think when Iran, the Islamic Republic of Iran, crossed the Ruby Conbay, attacking Israel directly, not through its proxies, but [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=1900.06s)]
*  directly, it kind of changed the mindset within the IDF, the additional and the operational vision that they had for [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=1908.9399999999998s)]
*  Iran. [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=1917.58s)]
*  They received intelligence that pointed to a collaboration between Hamas and the Islamic Republic to physically attack Israel and and make it [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=1918.22s)]
*  collapse. [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=1931.1799999999998s)]
*  I mean, these are the information that the IDF received just after the attack of October 7th. [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=1931.74s)]
*  They saw no choice but to go to the Islamic Republic infrastructure. [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=1936.78s)]
*  The key sites, the strategic sites, the nuclear reactors and attack. [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=1943.74s)]
*  And this is to me, this is a message to the world that they should take Israel both literally and seriously. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=1949.26s)]
*  Is there any way of knowing how effective these attacks have been on the nuclear infrastructure in Iran? [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=1959.18s)]
*  Your information, what we get out of different platforms is probably as correct as it gets. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=1973.98s)]
*  It's what information I have. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=1982.54s)]
*  I haven't been able to speak to any IDF general directly. [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=1984.0600000000002s)]
*  It's all been through different channels. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=1989.5800000000002s)]
*  But between 10 to 12 nuclear scientists have been eliminated. [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=1991.5800000000002s)]
*  The head of Iranian IRGC has been eliminated. [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=1996.14s)]
*  To me, the Khomeini, the Ayatollah, the Supreme Leader of Iran had no clothes. [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=1998.94s)]
*  And it was blind to the sky of Iran because the S-300s were taken out in October. [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=2007.1000000000001s)]
*  This is just more pressure on the Islamic regime to either capitulate or come to the negotiating table humbled by the strength, the [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=2014.94s)]
*  commitments and the resolve of both the US and the Israelis. [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=2025.58s)]
*  Just quickly, Nazi, when you listen to those voices of people on the streets in Tehran, [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=2030.22s)]
*  you know, cheering on the retaliation and death to Israel and all that, [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=2033.98s)]
*  what would be your message to American viewers who are watching those voices on the streets of Tehran? [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=2038.54s)]
*  That's a great question, Martha. [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=2048.14s)]
*  You know, Iran is a contradictory country. [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=2049.8199999999997s)]
*  It has a very devout Shiite population that back the regime. [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=2052.94s)]
*  But it also has this forward-looking cosmopolitan, sophisticated, educated population that yearn to be part of the international community. [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=2057.5s)]
*  So and those voices are gaining more momentum, more power than the traditional base of the regime. [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=2067.18s)]
*  The traditional base of the regime is actually being marginalized as time goes on because they see that the regime [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=2073.98s)]
*  hasn't been able to provide any of the basic food, the basic rights that countries provide for their people. [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=2081.1s)]
*  This is all ideological fervor. [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=2089.74s)]
*  I don't think it will matter at the end. [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=2092.62s)]
*  I think the resolve of the Iranian people will carry the day with the help of IDF and the US. [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=2095.9s)]
*  I want to also add that, you know, it was 1979 when I left Iran, just at the start of the revolution. [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=2105.1s)]
*  The Shah had come to the TV stream to address the Iranian people that I've heard your calls for the revolution. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=2112.86s)]
*  I'm willing to reform and I will do better. [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=2121.2599999999998s)]
*  So that was just the beginning of the end for the Shah because the Islamism that was going in Iran kind of [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=2125.66s)]
*  took that as a sign that it's going forward with its agenda, which is [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=2132.86s)]
*  toppling the Shah and the Shah is at its weakest point. [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=2137.98s)]
*  The Islamic regime is on its way to its point. [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=2143.1000000000004s)]
*  Nazi, thank you so much. Nazi Monian joining us today as we watch all of this unfold. [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuMkwUfzdQA&t=2145.42s)]
