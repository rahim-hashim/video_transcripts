# CHILLING warning on China targeting US power grid
**Fox News - World News:** [June 06, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enpWWJp2oEw)
*  A former NSA Intel analyst warning that Americans and our power grid is at risk, directly caused [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enpWWJp2oEw&t=0.0s)]
*  by solar panels from China being used on farms across the US. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enpWWJp2oEw&t=8.36s)]
*  Here to explain, that former NSA official, Rocky Cole, founder of Iverify. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enpWWJp2oEw&t=12.92s)]
*  Rocky, thanks for being here. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enpWWJp2oEw&t=17.32s)]
*  Can you explain exactly what China did here? [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enpWWJp2oEw&t=18.68s)]
*  Sure. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enpWWJp2oEw&t=21.72s)]
*  Undisclosed communication devices were recently found in the power inverters of a number of [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enpWWJp2oEw&t=22.88s)]
*  solar panels sold in the United States and which were manufactured in China. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enpWWJp2oEw&t=27.4s)]
*  And the concern is that the devices could be used to attack the United States power [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enpWWJp2oEw&t=31.759999999999998s)]
*  grid. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enpWWJp2oEw&t=34.6s)]
*  Specifically, they could have attacked the panels themselves or could have been a jumping [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enpWWJp2oEw&t=35.599999999999994s)]
*  off point to move into the wider grid they're connected to. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enpWWJp2oEw&t=40.3s)]
*  It's not entirely clear. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enpWWJp2oEw&t=43.28s)]
*  Either way, these findings raise the possibility that China could cut power to key areas of [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enpWWJp2oEw&t=44.879999999999995s)]
*  the United States to hurt the economy in the event of a war. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enpWWJp2oEw&t=49.239999999999995s)]
*  So to be clear, when you buy a product, any product, specifically in this case from China, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enpWWJp2oEw&t=51.94s)]
*  there's a list of 10 items in the product. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enpWWJp2oEw&t=57.04s)]
*  But in this case, there was an 11th and it was this communication device that they did [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enpWWJp2oEw&t=59.92s)]
*  not disclose, correct? [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enpWWJp2oEw&t=64.28s)]
*  Correct. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enpWWJp2oEw&t=66.24s)]
*  And it's very concerning and unfortunately not an isolated incident. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enpWWJp2oEw&t=67.24s)]
*  China and the United States have been engaged in what you might call a cyber cold war for [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enpWWJp2oEw&t=70.92s)]
*  over a decade. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enpWWJp2oEw&t=75.28s)]
*  And the public evidence overwhelmingly suggests that China has orchestrated a long running [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enpWWJp2oEw&t=76.4s)]
*  stealth campaign to implant US critical infrastructure with similar back doors that could be activated [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enpWWJp2oEw&t=81.4s)]
*  in the event of a war, specifically to disrupt the to disrupt American commerce and government [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enpWWJp2oEw&t=86.44000000000001s)]
*  operations. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enpWWJp2oEw&t=90.80000000000001s)]
*  And frankly, the solar panels are the tip of the iceberg. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enpWWJp2oEw&t=91.80000000000001s)]
*  OK, so to that point, what other products do you have concern about that China has sabotaged [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enpWWJp2oEw&t=93.52000000000001s)]
*  with items, other products within said products that we don't know about? [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enpWWJp2oEw&t=99.92s)]
*  Well, a September 2024 report from the House Committee on China jointly with the House [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enpWWJp2oEw&t=105.72s)]
*  Homeland Security Committee alleged that Chinese made pork grains used in the United States [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enpWWJp2oEw&t=112.24000000000001s)]
*  seaports contained unexplained cellular modems that could also have served as a back door [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enpWWJp2oEw&t=117.76s)]
*  for data collection, possible disruption. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enpWWJp2oEw&t=122.72s)]
*  And this on top of that news earlier this week about that potential bioterrorism that [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enpWWJp2oEw&t=125.12s)]
*  could destroy many American crops is extremely concerning. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enpWWJp2oEw&t=130.36s)]
*  Of course, the Chinese are denying this. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enpWWJp2oEw&t=133.88s)]
*  They put out a statement. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enpWWJp2oEw&t=135.56s)]
*  I'm not going to read it because you know what it says. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enpWWJp2oEw&t=136.56s)]
*  We didn't do it. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enpWWJp2oEw&t=138.56s)]
*  But of course, that remains to be seen. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enpWWJp2oEw&t=139.56s)]
*  Anytime your company, I verify uncovering evidence of possible spyware on iPhones within [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enpWWJp2oEw&t=141.12s)]
*  the U.S. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enpWWJp2oEw&t=146.64000000000001s)]
*  What did you discover, Rocky? [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enpWWJp2oEw&t=147.64000000000001s)]
*  We have throughout late last year and early this year, our platform detected anomalous [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enpWWJp2oEw&t=150.56s)]
*  activity on iPhones belonging to political campaigns, media organizations, governments [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enpWWJp2oEw&t=155.32000000000002s)]
*  and A.I. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enpWWJp2oEw&t=159.92000000000002s)]
*  companies operating in the United States. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enpWWJp2oEw&t=160.92000000000002s)]
*  And this anomalous behavior turned out to be the result of a previously unknown vulnerability [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enpWWJp2oEw&t=163.28s)]
*  in iMessage related to assigning nicknames and avatars to iPhone contacts. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enpWWJp2oEw&t=167.22s)]
*  In the course of investigating the vulnerability, we discovered evidence suggesting this vulnerability [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enpWWJp2oEw&t=172.5s)]
*  may have been used in targeted attacks as recently as February of this year. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enpWWJp2oEw&t=177.02s)]
*  We monitor a very large number of mobile devices and the behaviors we saw on these devices [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enpWWJp2oEw&t=181.3s)]
*  were extremely rare, concentrated exclusively among the types of people who are routinely [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enpWWJp2oEw&t=185.9s)]
*  targeted with spyware. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enpWWJp2oEw&t=190.72s)]
*  And Apple even sent a threat notification to one of the targeted individuals. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enpWWJp2oEw&t=192.18s)]
*  Who's behind it? [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enpWWJp2oEw&t=196.38000000000002s)]
*  Well, it's very difficult to do attribution if you're a private company like we are. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enpWWJp2oEw&t=198.38000000000002s)]
*  But I can say that all the targets had some sort of direct connection to China. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enpWWJp2oEw&t=202.46s)]
*  Either they were had been previously surveilled by China, they were engaged in some sort of [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enpWWJp2oEw&t=206.18s)]
*  activism against China or engaged in business pursuits counter to or of great interest to [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enpWWJp2oEw&t=209.9s)]
*  China. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enpWWJp2oEw&t=214.58s)]
*  The head of Apple Security, Engineering and Architecture denying these claims, saying [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enpWWJp2oEw&t=215.58s)]
*  the following, we thoroughly analyze the information provided by iVerify and strongly disagree [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enpWWJp2oEw&t=218.86s)]
*  with the claims of a targeted attack against our users. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enpWWJp2oEw&t=224.1s)]
*  Rocky Cole, quick response? [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enpWWJp2oEw&t=228.01999999999998s)]
*  We have a very large body of circumstantial evidence that we find very convincing. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enpWWJp2oEw&t=231.26s)]
*  No smoking gun, but it was definitely worth putting out for the research community to [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enpWWJp2oEw&t=235.22s)]
*  chew on. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enpWWJp2oEw&t=238.7s)]
*  Rocky Cole, really interesting and frightening stuff. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enpWWJp2oEw&t=239.7s)]
*  Appreciate it this morning. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enpWWJp2oEw&t=241.45999999999998s)]
*  Thank you, sir. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enpWWJp2oEw&t=242.45999999999998s)]
*  Thank you for your time. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enpWWJp2oEw&t=243.45999999999998s)]
*  Carly. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enpWWJp2oEw&t=244.45999999999998s)]
