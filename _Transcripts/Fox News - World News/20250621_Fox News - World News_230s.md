# Trump: Iran, the bully of the Middle East, must now make peace
**Fox News - World News:** [June 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsVGP102DbU)
*  Let's go to the White House. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsVGP102DbU&t=0.0s)]
*  This is a Fox News alert. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsVGP102DbU&t=1.0s)]
*  Here's the president. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsVGP102DbU&t=2.7600000000000002s)]
*  A short time ago, the U.S. military carried out massive precision strikes on the three [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsVGP102DbU&t=3.7600000000000002s)]
*  key nuclear facilities in the Iranian regime, Fordow, Netanj and Esfahan. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsVGP102DbU&t=9.38s)]
*  Everybody heard those names for years as they built this horribly destructive enterprise. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsVGP102DbU&t=19.12s)]
*  Our objective was the destruction of Iran's nuclear enrichment capacity and a stop to [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsVGP102DbU&t=26.84s)]
*  the nuclear threat posed by the world's number one state sponsor of terror. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsVGP102DbU&t=33.2s)]
*  Tonight, I can report to the world that the strikes were a spectacular military success. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsVGP102DbU&t=38.28s)]
*  Iran's key nuclear enrichment facilities have been completely and totally obliterated. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsVGP102DbU&t=46.08s)]
*  Iran, the bully of the Middle East, must now make peace. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsVGP102DbU&t=51.760000000000005s)]
*  If they do not, future attacks will be far greater and a lot easier. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsVGP102DbU&t=56.76s)]
*  For 40 years, Iran has been saying, death to America, death to Israel. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsVGP102DbU&t=61.559999999999995s)]
*  They have been killing our people, blowing off their arms, blowing off their legs with [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsVGP102DbU&t=66.2s)]
*  roadside bombs. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsVGP102DbU&t=71.0s)]
*  That was their specialty. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsVGP102DbU&t=73.18s)]
*  We lost over a thousand people, and hundreds of thousands throughout the Middle East and [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsVGP102DbU&t=74.6s)]
*  around the world have died as a direct result of their hate. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsVGP102DbU&t=80.03999999999999s)]
*  In particular, so many were killed by their general, Qassem Soleimani. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsVGP102DbU&t=83.4s)]
*  I decided a long time ago that I would not let this happen. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsVGP102DbU&t=90.36s)]
*  It will not continue. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsVGP102DbU&t=94.4s)]
*  I want to thank and congratulate Prime Minister Bibi Netanyahu. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsVGP102DbU&t=96.36000000000001s)]
*  We worked as a team like perhaps no team has ever worked before, and we've gone a long [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsVGP102DbU&t=101.36000000000001s)]
*  way to erasing this horrible threat to Israel. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsVGP102DbU&t=106.84s)]
*  I want to thank the Israeli military for the wonderful job they've done. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsVGP102DbU&t=110.4s)]
*  And most importantly, I want to congratulate the great American patriots who flew those [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsVGP102DbU&t=115.36s)]
*  magnificent machines tonight, and all of the United States military on an operation the [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsVGP102DbU&t=119.34s)]
*  likes of which the world has not seen in many, many decades. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsVGP102DbU&t=125.4s)]
*  Hopefully we will no longer need their services in this capacity. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsVGP102DbU&t=129.84s)]
*  I hope that so. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsVGP102DbU&t=133.76s)]
*  I also want to congratulate the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Dan Raisen [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsVGP102DbU&t=135.48s)]
*  Kane, spectacular general, and all of the brilliant military minds involved in this [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsVGP102DbU&t=140.72s)]
*  attack. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsVGP102DbU&t=146.2s)]
*  With all of that being said, this cannot continue. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsVGP102DbU&t=147.66s)]
*  There will be either peace or there will be tragedy for Iran far greater than we have [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsVGP102DbU&t=150.3s)]
*  witnessed over the last eight days. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsVGP102DbU&t=156.16s)]
*  Remember, there are many targets left. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsVGP102DbU&t=158.56s)]
*  Peace was the most difficult of them all by far, and perhaps the most lethal. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsVGP102DbU&t=162.96s)]
*  But if peace does not come quickly, we will go after those other targets with precision, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsVGP102DbU&t=169.04000000000002s)]
*  speed, and skill. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsVGP102DbU&t=174.60000000000002s)]
*  Most of them can be taken out in a matter of minutes. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsVGP102DbU&t=177.52s)]
*  There's no military in the world that could have done what we did tonight, not even close. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsVGP102DbU&t=180.72s)]
*  There has never been a military that could do what took place just a little while ago. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsVGP102DbU&t=185.8s)]
*  Tomorrow, General Kane, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth will have a press conference [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsVGP102DbU&t=191.48s)]
*  at 8 a.m. at the Pentagon. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsVGP102DbU&t=197.48s)]
*  And I want to just thank everybody, and in particular, God. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsVGP102DbU&t=200.04s)]
*  I want to just say we love you, God, and we love our great military. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsVGP102DbU&t=205.24s)]
*  Protect them. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsVGP102DbU&t=209.51999999999998s)]
*  God bless the Middle East. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsVGP102DbU&t=210.84s)]
*  God bless Israel. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsVGP102DbU&t=213.01999999999998s)]
*  And God bless America. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsVGP102DbU&t=214.01999999999998s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsVGP102DbU&t=216.2s)]
