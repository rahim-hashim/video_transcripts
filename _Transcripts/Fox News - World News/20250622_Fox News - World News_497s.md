# 'CANNOT BE ALLOWED': GOP sen stresses Iran cannot have a nuclear weapon
**Fox News - World News:** [June 22, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsyr0RUbc5k)
*  Joining us now, Oklahoma Senator James Langford, member of the Senate Intel Committee and Homeland [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsyr0RUbc5k&t=0.0s)]
*  Security Committees. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsyr0RUbc5k&t=4.48s)]
*  Senator, welcome to Fox News Sunday. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsyr0RUbc5k&t=5.48s)]
*  You heard what your colleague there had to say from the other side of the aisle. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsyr0RUbc5k&t=7.4s)]
*  I don't think anybody is excited or supportive of a, quote, war in the Middle East. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsyr0RUbc5k&t=10.92s)]
*  So what happens next? [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsyr0RUbc5k&t=15.36s)]
*  Yeah, certainly we're not excited about a war in the Middle East. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsyr0RUbc5k&t=17.16s)]
*  No one's looking for a war in the Middle East. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsyr0RUbc5k&t=21.16s)]
*  And President Trump has made it very clear he's not trying to be able to start a war [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsyr0RUbc5k&t=22.88s)]
*  in the Middle East. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsyr0RUbc5k&t=26.240000000000002s)]
*  He's trying to be able to protect American lives around the world. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsyr0RUbc5k&t=27.240000000000002s)]
*  People forget there are 700,000 Americans that are in Israel right now and they're [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsyr0RUbc5k&t=29.92s)]
*  facing an onslaught. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsyr0RUbc5k&t=35.32s)]
*  We've had 174 attacks on American warships right off the coast of Yemen with Iranian [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsyr0RUbc5k&t=36.800000000000004s)]
*  weapons. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsyr0RUbc5k&t=43.56s)]
*  We've had multiple attacks on Americans in the region, in Iraq, just in the past few [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsyr0RUbc5k&t=44.56s)]
*  months. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsyr0RUbc5k&t=49.6s)]
*  So we have faced a tremendous amount of inbound attacks from Iran. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsyr0RUbc5k&t=50.6s)]
*  So I think the president's shown incredible restraint. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsyr0RUbc5k&t=54.74s)]
*  And as for the argument that somehow Iran is a long way from a nuclear weapon, I think [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsyr0RUbc5k&t=57.32s)]
*  everybody skipping over the International Atomic Energy Agency just May 30th said that [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsyr0RUbc5k&t=62.36s)]
*  Iran is two days away at that point. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsyr0RUbc5k&t=69.4s)]
*  They said it's May 30th, two days away from having their first weapons-grade uranium. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsyr0RUbc5k&t=73.08s)]
*  They also found evidence of a weapons manufacturing technology that's happening. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsyr0RUbc5k&t=78.24000000000001s)]
*  So all of this thought about they're a long way away from it. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsyr0RUbc5k&t=84.42s)]
*  Two days doesn't seem like a long way away from having their first weapons-grade uranium. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsyr0RUbc5k&t=88.1s)]
*  They might have been a month away from having a dozen, but not their first. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsyr0RUbc5k&t=93.48s)]
*  And all it takes is having their first ready. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsyr0RUbc5k&t=98.0s)]
*  President's been very, very clear they cannot have a nuclear weapon. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsyr0RUbc5k&t=100.94s)]
*  In fact, that has been a bipartisan statement that Iran cannot have a nuclear weapon for [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsyr0RUbc5k&t=104.5s)]
*  a very long time. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsyr0RUbc5k&t=109.16s)]
*  I want to play a little bit of something from Iran's foreign minister speaking a short [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsyr0RUbc5k&t=110.47999999999999s)]
*  time ago, talking about also that he's going to meet with President Vladimir Putin of Russia [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsyr0RUbc5k&t=113.92s)]
*  today. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsyr0RUbc5k&t=118.72s)]
*  Here's what Iran's foreign minister had to say. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsyr0RUbc5k&t=119.72s)]
*  While President Trump was elected on a platform of putting an end to America's costly involvement [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsyr0RUbc5k&t=122.84s)]
*  of forever wars in our part of the world, he has betrayed not only Iran by abusing our [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsyr0RUbc5k&t=129.92s)]
*  commitment to diplomacy, but also deceived his own voters by submitting to the wishes [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsyr0RUbc5k&t=138.0s)]
*  of a wanted war criminal who has grown accustomed to exploiting the lives and wealth of American [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsyr0RUbc5k&t=144.48s)]
*  citizens to further the Israeli regime's objectives. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsyr0RUbc5k&t=152.54s)]
*  Not surprising that's how the Iran foreign minister would term all of that. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsyr0RUbc5k&t=157.16s)]
*  But what do you make a now of him taking that attitude to go meet with Putin and their strategic [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsyr0RUbc5k&t=160.82s)]
*  partnership those two countries say they've got? [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsyr0RUbc5k&t=166.45999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, right now, Putin is slaughtering the Ukrainians next door using Iranian weapons [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsyr0RUbc5k&t=168.57999999999998s)]
*  as they have done for a very long time now through this war. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsyr0RUbc5k&t=173.85999999999999s)]
*  And so it is not surprising that the two of them continue to be able to ally together. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsyr0RUbc5k&t=177.06s)]
*  The challenge that we have right now is we cannot have a nuclear armed Iran. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsyr0RUbc5k&t=181.54s)]
*  We cannot have an Iran that is the largest state sponsor of terrorism, that continues [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsyr0RUbc5k&t=185.98s)]
*  to be able to develop new technologies to be able to attack their neighbors. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsyr0RUbc5k&t=190.2s)]
*  We cannot allow them to be able to have a nuclear weapon. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsyr0RUbc5k&t=194.22s)]
*  That has been clear. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsyr0RUbc5k&t=197.26s)]
*  President Biden said that but did nothing about it. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsyr0RUbc5k&t=198.62s)]
*  President Trump has said that. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsyr0RUbc5k&t=201.56s)]
*  President Obama said that before. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsyr0RUbc5k&t=203.14s)]
*  This cannot be allowed. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsyr0RUbc5k&t=204.62s)]
*  And President Trump has been the one to be able to take the strong action to say they've [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsyr0RUbc5k&t=206.62s)]
*  done one thing. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsyr0RUbc5k&t=209.74s)]
*  They've stopped the nuclear weapons program there. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsyr0RUbc5k&t=211.14s)]
*  And what has been very clear is in Fordow, that deep mountain, that there's no way to [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsyr0RUbc5k&t=213.57999999999998s)]
*  be able to stop it without American support. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsyr0RUbc5k&t=218.22s)]
*  So contrary to popular statements here, to be able to say the Israelis have somehow set [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsyr0RUbc5k&t=221.4s)]
*  back the Iranians where they couldn't advance that program. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsyr0RUbc5k&t=225.6s)]
*  Everyone's been very clear. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsyr0RUbc5k&t=228.52s)]
*  Fordow is the location where they've been advancing their nuclear technology towards [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsyr0RUbc5k&t=230.20000000000002s)]
*  weaponization. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsyr0RUbc5k&t=234.04000000000002s)]
*  That spot could only be taken out by American forces. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsyr0RUbc5k&t=235.54000000000002s)]
*  The president's taken that one spot out. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsyr0RUbc5k&t=238.12s)]
*  And they said now it's time to be able to actually come to the table because Iran for [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsyr0RUbc5k&t=240.44s)]
*  months has refused to be able to make an agreement to be able to eliminate those nuclear weapons. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsyr0RUbc5k&t=244.24s)]
*  So we eliminate their capability for them. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsyr0RUbc5k&t=249.4s)]
*  So what about Senator Kaine's point? [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsyr0RUbc5k&t=251.92000000000002s)]
*  And he's not the only one making it. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsyr0RUbc5k&t=253.24s)]
*  There are others who have said that President Trump bears some responsibility for where [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsyr0RUbc5k&t=254.74s)]
*  we found ourselves because of his withdrawal from the earlier agreement and the fact that [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsyr0RUbc5k&t=258.04s)]
*  it gave Iran some autonomy with proceeding without some of the guardrails or inspections [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsyr0RUbc5k&t=263.12s)]
*  it would have had otherwise. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsyr0RUbc5k&t=268.16s)]
*  So they continue to have inspections. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsyr0RUbc5k&t=270.8s)]
*  The International Atomic Energy Agency continue to be able to have their cameras, their inspection [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsyr0RUbc5k&t=272.44s)]
*  devices, their technology that was in those locations. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsyr0RUbc5k&t=277.15999999999997s)]
*  Iran is the one that actually took those apart several months ago. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsyr0RUbc5k&t=279.68s)]
*  Again, we go back to President Obama that actually made this agreement that allowed [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsyr0RUbc5k&t=282.59999999999997s)]
*  over 10 years Iran to continue their nuclear technology and to have a 10 year time period [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsyr0RUbc5k&t=286.56s)]
*  until they could actually get to a bomb. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsyr0RUbc5k&t=291.76s)]
*  President Trump stepped in and said, no, we're not going to give you 10 years time period. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsyr0RUbc5k&t=294.2s)]
*  You can't have a bomb at all. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsyr0RUbc5k&t=297.52s)]
*  You can't continue your nuclear work on this. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsyr0RUbc5k&t=299.4s)]
*  So President Trump set that aside. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsyr0RUbc5k&t=302.71999999999997s)]
*  Biden came back and said, well, we'll negotiate again. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsyr0RUbc5k&t=304.98s)]
*  Maybe we'll allow you to be able to have that. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsyr0RUbc5k&t=307.62s)]
*  President Trump came back again as the American people asked him to do and said, you cannot [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsyr0RUbc5k&t=309.26s)]
*  have a nuclear weapon. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsyr0RUbc5k&t=313.94s)]
*  This is not about they can't do their nuclear power. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsyr0RUbc5k&t=315.98s)]
*  Of course they could do nuclear power. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsyr0RUbc5k&t=319.78s)]
*  But every single country that has nuclear power, including Iran, that power is actually [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsyr0RUbc5k&t=321.68s)]
*  supplied that uranium is supplied from the source that actually set up the actual nuclear [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsyr0RUbc5k&t=326.78s)]
*  power plants. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsyr0RUbc5k&t=331.94s)]
*  Iran is trying to be the only country in the world saying we're trying to only do peaceful [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsyr0RUbc5k&t=333.90000000000003s)]
*  power but also produce their own uranium. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsyr0RUbc5k&t=337.90000000000003s)]
*  They're also producing uranium at highly enriched levels that no other country in the world, [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsyr0RUbc5k&t=341.1s)]
*  unless they have a nuclear weapon, actually has. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsyr0RUbc5k&t=346.1s)]
*  There's no question Iran was working towards having a nuclear weapon that is without question. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsyr0RUbc5k&t=348.90000000000003s)]
*  Everyone knows that that looks at the data on this. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsyr0RUbc5k&t=354.70000000000005s)]
*  The question is, will they be allowed to be able to actually finish their work to be able [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsyr0RUbc5k&t=357.3s)]
*  to do that? [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsyr0RUbc5k&t=361.02000000000004s)]
*  President Trump said no, you cannot do that for the security of the entire world and of [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsyr0RUbc5k&t=362.02s)]
*  American citizens living in that region. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsyr0RUbc5k&t=365.9s)]
*  So of course this quickly turned political as these issues will. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsyr0RUbc5k&t=368.65999999999997s)]
*  Last night an account attributed to Congressman Sean Caston, not his official account but [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsyr0RUbc5k&t=372.06s)]
*  one that's personal. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsyr0RUbc5k&t=377.18s)]
*  It's not verified but it says this, this is not about the merits of Iran's nuclear program. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsyr0RUbc5k&t=378.18s)]
*  No president has the authority to bomb another country that does not pose an imminent threat [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsyr0RUbc5k&t=382.7s)]
*  to the U.S. without the approval of Congress. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsyr0RUbc5k&t=386.7s)]
*  This is an unambiguous impeachable offense. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsyr0RUbc5k&t=389.42s)]
*  Do you think we're headed down that road again? [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsyr0RUbc5k&t=392.66s)]
*  If Democrats get control of Congress, we are most certainly headed towards impeachment again. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsyr0RUbc5k&t=396.42s)]
*  That has been the playbook that they played twice on President Trump. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsyr0RUbc5k&t=400.26s)]
*  So certainly if they get control of Congress in this next election, they will work towards [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsyr0RUbc5k&t=403.3s)]
*  impeachment. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsyr0RUbc5k&t=407.58000000000004s)]
*  That's their favorite play to be able to do. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsyr0RUbc5k&t=408.58000000000004s)]
*  This is something Bernie Sanders has talked about. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsyr0RUbc5k&t=410.14s)]
*  This is something Representative Ocasio-Cortez has talked about. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsyr0RUbc5k&t=412.08000000000004s)]
*  Now that Senator Tim Kaine is talking about, not impeachment but just we're going to find [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsyr0RUbc5k&t=416.74s)]
*  a way to be able to block the president from protecting American citizens in that region [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsyr0RUbc5k&t=421.86s)]
*  and to be able to stop Iran from having a nuclear weapon. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsyr0RUbc5k&t=426.06s)]
*  The same country that operates Hezbollah, Hamas, the Houthis, the Shia militias that [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsyr0RUbc5k&t=429.12s)]
*  are in Iraq that attacked American citizens, all those attacks that are on American warships [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsyr0RUbc5k&t=434.72s)]
*  that are coming through the Gulf, that same entity is the same one that's developing a [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsyr0RUbc5k&t=439.3s)]
*  nuclear weapon and chanting at the same time, death to America. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsyr0RUbc5k&t=443.82s)]
*  That is a threat and the president has to make a difficult decision to say when is the [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsyr0RUbc5k&t=447.54s)]
*  moment to be able to prevent that threat from happening. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsyr0RUbc5k&t=452.26s)]
*  The 9-11 doctrine that we came down to in America said we are not going to wait until [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsyr0RUbc5k&t=455.28000000000003s)]
*  another country attacks us. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsyr0RUbc5k&t=460.46000000000004s)]
*  If we know they plan and intend to attack us, we're going to stop them to be able to [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsyr0RUbc5k&t=462.38s)]
*  protect American lives. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsyr0RUbc5k&t=466.6s)]
*  We don't want to go to war, but we're not going to allow you to attack us. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsyr0RUbc5k&t=467.90000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, and we'll see what the retribution turns out to be in the days, weeks, months ahead. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsyr0RUbc5k&t=470.98s)]
*  Senator Lankford, thank you for your time. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsyr0RUbc5k&t=476.02000000000004s)]
