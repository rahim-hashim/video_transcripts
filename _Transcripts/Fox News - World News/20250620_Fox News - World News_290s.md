# Here's the 'likelihood' of Israel standing down
**Fox News - World News:** [June 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqMNcPQR3yw)
*  Let's bring in David Friedman, the former U.S. ambassador to Israel. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqMNcPQR3yw&t=0.0s)]
*  Thank you so much, sir, for joining us today. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqMNcPQR3yw&t=3.0s)]
*  Please do give us your thoughts in this obviously very important moment in all of this. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqMNcPQR3yw&t=5.4s)]
*  As we do await, what's next for the United States in all of it? [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqMNcPQR3yw&t=10.94s)]
*  Well, Sandra, thanks for having me. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqMNcPQR3yw&t=14.8s)]
*  I think the first overriding point is this. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqMNcPQR3yw&t=17.96s)]
*  There are a lot of things to talk about. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqMNcPQR3yw&t=20.52s)]
*  There are some complexities, multiple vectors, but all roads lead to a non-nuclear Iran. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqMNcPQR3yw&t=21.96s)]
*  I mean, that is where we're going to end up, and that's everybody's goal, and we're going to achieve it. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqMNcPQR3yw&t=28.56s)]
*  Now, will it be militarily? Will it be with a deal? [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqMNcPQR3yw&t=33.92s)]
*  I will tell you that the likelihood that Israel will stand down in favor of the right to negotiate is probably zero. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqMNcPQR3yw&t=38.16s)]
*  You know, they've had 500 ballistic missiles shot at them. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqMNcPQR3yw&t=46.64s)]
*  Yesterday, they were on the receiving end of a cluster bomb, which is a per se war crime that took out a hospital [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqMNcPQR3yw&t=50.16s)]
*  that serves the Negev, probably more than half the patients are Arab and Muslim. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqMNcPQR3yw&t=57.16s)]
*  They've had four or five hundred drones shot at them every night. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqMNcPQR3yw&t=64.67999999999999s)]
*  You know, people are going into shelters. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqMNcPQR3yw&t=68.72s)]
*  They're not standing down until they've achieved their goals. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqMNcPQR3yw&t=70.2s)]
*  So that's I think that demand is going to go nowhere. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqMNcPQR3yw&t=73.4s)]
*  Now, the other thing I would say is knowing President Trump now for at least 25 years, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqMNcPQR3yw&t=76.16s)]
*  you know, way back when I used to represent him in a lot of deals, I know his negotiating style. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqMNcPQR3yw&t=83.03999999999999s)]
*  The deal he will make is when the Iranian leader takes a piece of paper out of the printer, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqMNcPQR3yw&t=88.08s)]
*  takes a white piece of paper, blank page, and he writes down on it, we surrender. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqMNcPQR3yw&t=93.2s)]
*  We give up our nukes. We're going to destroy this mantle or facilities. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqMNcPQR3yw&t=98.04s)]
*  You're welcome to come and observe and inspect whenever you want. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqMNcPQR3yw&t=102.24000000000001s)]
*  And we're going to stop shooting missiles at your allies. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqMNcPQR3yw&t=105.4s)]
*  When he writes that on a piece of paper, that nothing more, nothing less. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqMNcPQR3yw&t=108.28s)]
*  I think there'll be a diplomatic deal. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqMNcPQR3yw&t=111.84s)]
*  And I think the probability of that is awfully low. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqMNcPQR3yw&t=113.44s)]
*  Remember, you know, Abbas Arachi, who's like the only guy left who's negotiating this, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqMNcPQR3yw&t=116.68s)]
*  who even knows, you know, where his instructions are coming from? [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqMNcPQR3yw&t=123.80000000000001s)]
*  And remember, the Iranians are telling their people that they're winning the war. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqMNcPQR3yw&t=127.08000000000001s)]
*  You know, they're telling their people that they've got they've dominating the dominating [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqMNcPQR3yw&t=131.8s)]
*  Israel airspace, you know, that they're not telling them that they've shot a thousand [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqMNcPQR3yw&t=136.24s)]
*  projectiles and only about five percent have landed. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqMNcPQR3yw&t=140.44s)]
*  You know, so all of a sudden he's going to surrender. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqMNcPQR3yw&t=144.08s)]
*  It just seems so unlikely. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqMNcPQR3yw&t=146.76s)]
*  OK, so, Ambassador, you said the Israeli Israeli people are not standing down. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqMNcPQR3yw&t=149.20000000000002s)]
*  This is General Jack Keene joining us last hour on Outnumbered. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqMNcPQR3yw&t=155.72s)]
*  And this is why he says that is the case. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqMNcPQR3yw&t=160.64000000000001s)]
*  Listen. For 25 years, they've taken every step [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqMNcPQR3yw&t=163.68s)]
*  that's humanly possible not only to develop a nuclear weapon, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqMNcPQR3yw&t=168.12s)]
*  but also they put into this major enterprise. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqMNcPQR3yw&t=172.52s)]
*  And this is what some people don't get is the Ayatollah has built an enterprise [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqMNcPQR3yw&t=175.88s)]
*  that's redundant and resilient because he knows at some point it would be attacked [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqMNcPQR3yw&t=181.44s)]
*  and he wants to absorb that attack, survive it, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqMNcPQR3yw&t=187.16s)]
*  recover and rebuild. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqMNcPQR3yw&t=192.07999999999998s)]
*  Ambassador, I wanted to get your reaction to that. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqMNcPQR3yw&t=194.64s)]
*  Well, look, General Keene's exactly right. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqMNcPQR3yw&t=198.07999999999998s)]
*  And there's it just seems so unlikely they've staked their regime [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqMNcPQR3yw&t=200.28s)]
*  on the North Korean model. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqMNcPQR3yw&t=205.36s)]
*  You know, they want to get nukes and then try to hold the world hostage. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqMNcPQR3yw&t=207.16s)]
*  That's the only way they're going to keep their regime alive. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqMNcPQR3yw&t=210.84s)]
*  So the idea that that they will somehow surrender seems unlikely. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqMNcPQR3yw&t=213.48000000000002s)]
*  Now, could could the regime change in short order? [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqMNcPQR3yw&t=218.44s)]
*  And, you know, that's incredibly wishful thinking will be wonderful. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqMNcPQR3yw&t=221.28s)]
*  But that would be the way to get to a deal. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqMNcPQR3yw&t=224.36s)]
*  And as far as Israel's concerned, look, I, you know, I have I have got some of my kids [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqMNcPQR3yw&t=226.24s)]
*  there now. I know what life is like there, you know, because the missiles [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqMNcPQR3yw&t=230.16s)]
*  are coming from a thousand miles away, they get about a 10, 15 minute warning. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqMNcPQR3yw&t=234.44s)]
*  And so, you know, when the warning hits, they run for shelters. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqMNcPQR3yw&t=239.0s)]
*  But the rest of the day, you know, there, you know, you've seen pictures. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqMNcPQR3yw&t=241.35999999999999s)]
*  They're on the beach. They're they're living their lives. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqMNcPQR3yw&t=244.88s)]
*  They're starting to come back to normal. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqMNcPQR3yw&t=247.24s)]
*  This is not going to bring down Israel. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqMNcPQR3yw&t=248.76s)]
*  Israel is in this for the long haul. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqMNcPQR3yw&t=250.48s)]
*  They will not allow their children and grandchildren to live under the shadow [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqMNcPQR3yw&t=252.6s)]
*  of a nuclear attack from Iran. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqMNcPQR3yw&t=257.0s)]
*  They will not permit another Holocaust. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqMNcPQR3yw&t=258.32s)]
*  As we continue to hear a very firm message sent from Benjamin Netanyahu, [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqMNcPQR3yw&t=260.48s)]
*  Israel's prime minister, as we did in that interview on Sunday [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqMNcPQR3yw&t=266.12s)]
*  and continue to hear from him. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqMNcPQR3yw&t=269.12s)]
*  Ambassador, thank you so much for joining us. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqMNcPQR3yw&t=270.68s)]
*  We appreciate your time. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqMNcPQR3yw&t=272.48s)]
