# 'FRIGHTENING': FBI says China targeted US food supply in 'agroterrorism' plot
**Fox News - World News:** [June 04, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glgqoRIYhtM)
*  The FBI now says two Chinese nationals have been charged with smuggling a potentially [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glgqoRIYhtM&t=0.0s)]
*  toxic fungus that could ravage crops in the United States. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glgqoRIYhtM&t=5.24s)]
*  They were trying to bring those to the homeland. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glgqoRIYhtM&t=10.200000000000001s)]
*  Now one of those suspects is in custody, will appear in a federal courtroom tomorrow at [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glgqoRIYhtM&t=12.32s)]
*  1 p.m. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glgqoRIYhtM&t=17.44s)]
*  The other is in China after he was denied entry into the U.S. while trying to smuggle [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glgqoRIYhtM&t=18.64s)]
*  in that biological pathogen last year. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glgqoRIYhtM&t=23.8s)]
*  Really interesting details coming up. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glgqoRIYhtM&t=28.560000000000002s)]
*  Hello everyone, this is Outnumbered, I'm Kaylee McEnany, here's my co-host, Emily Campagno. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glgqoRIYhtM&t=29.92s)]
*  Also joining us, Laura Trump, host of My View with Laura Trump, Kaylee McGee-White, Fox [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glgqoRIYhtM&t=34.440000000000005s)]
*  News contributor, and Ari Fleischer, Fox News contributor and former White House press secretary. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glgqoRIYhtM&t=38.72s)]
*  Well, the FBI warning Americans that our food supply may be the target of attacks from China. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glgqoRIYhtM&t=43.68s)]
*  Here's a photo of the fungus found at the Detroit airport last year. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glgqoRIYhtM&t=51.32000000000001s)]
*  It was found in four plastic baggies. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glgqoRIYhtM&t=56.36s)]
*  It was stashed into wads of tissue paper. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glgqoRIYhtM&t=58.12s)]
*  And authorities say that the toxins caused, quote, vomiting, liver damage, and reproductive [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glgqoRIYhtM&t=61.8s)]
*  defects in both humans and livestock. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glgqoRIYhtM&t=67.72s)]
*  What were they doing with this? [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glgqoRIYhtM&t=70.8s)]
*  Why were they trying to bring this into our country? [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glgqoRIYhtM&t=72.08s)]
*  Now according to a U.S. attorney's office in Michigan, the 34-year-old Chinese researcher [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glgqoRIYhtM&t=74.8s)]
*  who works at the University of Michigan intentionally hid the samples in his backpack because he [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glgqoRIYhtM&t=79.25999999999999s)]
*  knew that the restrictions on importing them existed. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glgqoRIYhtM&t=85.56s)]
*  The professor claims he had hoped to do further research on the fungus at his University of [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glgqoRIYhtM&t=88.4s)]
*  Michigan lab. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glgqoRIYhtM&t=93.84s)]
*  FBI Director Cash Patel says, quote, this case is sobering. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glgqoRIYhtM&t=95.2s)]
*  It's a reminder that the Chinese Communist Party continues to deploy operatives and researchers [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glgqoRIYhtM&t=99.44s)]
*  to infiltrate our institutions and target our food supply, an act that could cripple [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glgqoRIYhtM&t=104.52000000000001s)]
*  our economy and endanger American lives. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glgqoRIYhtM&t=109.92s)]
*  Smuggling a known agroterrorism agent into the U.S. is not just a violation of law. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glgqoRIYhtM&t=112.84s)]
*  It's a direct threat to national security. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glgqoRIYhtM&t=117.2s)]
*  Now the details here are chilling. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glgqoRIYhtM&t=120.64s)]
*  I have the complaint here. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glgqoRIYhtM&t=122.0s)]
*  Carrie Urbahn pulled out some really interesting details, Emily. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glgqoRIYhtM&t=123.64s)]
*  So listen to this. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glgqoRIYhtM&t=126.64s)]
*  Zhuan is the woman. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glgqoRIYhtM&t=127.64s)]
*  There was the boyfriend and girlfriend. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glgqoRIYhtM&t=129.02s)]
*  So Zhuan's the woman. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glgqoRIYhtM&t=130.8s)]
*  The FBI has evidence that she had done this before. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glgqoRIYhtM&t=131.8s)]
*  She had worked with someone else to smuggle in the same pathogen. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glgqoRIYhtM&t=134.92000000000002s)]
*  She gave the other person detailed instructions on how to smuggle it in a book and said there [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glgqoRIYhtM&t=138.14s)]
*  are usually no problems. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glgqoRIYhtM&t=143.23999999999998s)]
*  Rest assured I have mailed these before. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glgqoRIYhtM&t=145.57999999999998s)]
*  So you wonder how many times she's done this. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glgqoRIYhtM&t=147.7s)]
*  And then she lied on her visa saying she was studying a topic distinct from the use of [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glgqoRIYhtM&t=149.98s)]
*  this pathogen. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glgqoRIYhtM&t=155.38s)]
*  This raises all kinds of questions about subterfuge and frequency. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glgqoRIYhtM&t=156.82s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glgqoRIYhtM&t=160.45999999999998s)]
*  Look, this is absolutely frightening. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glgqoRIYhtM&t=161.45999999999998s)]
*  And most frightening is how under the prior administration, this stuff was just swept [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glgqoRIYhtM&t=163.5s)]
*  under the rug in terms of the perceived and actual threat. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glgqoRIYhtM&t=168.1s)]
*  Now we know under the Trump first administration that Secretary of State Pompeo deployed a [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glgqoRIYhtM&t=171.46s)]
*  maximum pressure against China in all of those arenas. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glgqoRIYhtM&t=175.9s)]
*  He saw and articulated that the threats to our intellectual property, our college campuses, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glgqoRIYhtM&t=178.78s)]
*  our physical military bases, and so much more was profound and real. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glgqoRIYhtM&t=184.06s)]
*  And if you look at the DOJ history of prosecutions and arrests, it was sky high because they [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glgqoRIYhtM&t=188.02s)]
*  were deploying resources toward this articulated threat. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glgqoRIYhtM&t=192.82s)]
*  Cut to the Biden administration and I guess everything's awesome. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glgqoRIYhtM&t=196.3s)]
*  And now we're seeing the fruits of that investment by the CCP. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glgqoRIYhtM&t=199.22s)]
*  This is on the heels as well of University of Michigan, other students that were arrested [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glgqoRIYhtM&t=202.74s)]
*  and prosecuted for counter surveillance and so much more. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glgqoRIYhtM&t=206.72s)]
*  So look, this dovetails in with the topic as well of the visas and the college campuses [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glgqoRIYhtM&t=209.82s)]
*  of the students, right? [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glgqoRIYhtM&t=214.5s)]
*  And over 27 percent of foreign students being from China. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glgqoRIYhtM&t=215.78s)]
*  And there's the direct correlation is obviously not not China related. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glgqoRIYhtM&t=219.22s)]
*  It's CCP related. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glgqoRIYhtM&t=223.54000000000002s)]
*  The fact that this administration now sees this for what it is and is dedicated to preventing [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glgqoRIYhtM&t=225.94s)]
*  this kind of thing is so relieving. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glgqoRIYhtM&t=231.22s)]
*  But we have to know that the seeds have been planted and really buried deep under the prior [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glgqoRIYhtM&t=234.34s)]
*  administration. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glgqoRIYhtM&t=238.1s)]
*  So for me, this is one in what is likely the tip of the iceberg. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glgqoRIYhtM&t=239.1s)]
*  I think you're right. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glgqoRIYhtM&t=242.9s)]
*  You know, sadly, Laura, when you look at this woman's background, she got Chinese government [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glgqoRIYhtM&t=243.9s)]
*  funding for her work. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glgqoRIYhtM&t=248.58s)]
*  And not only that, some of the information that she had on her said there was membership [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glgqoRIYhtM&t=249.98s)]
*  and loyalty to the Chinese Communist Party. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glgqoRIYhtM&t=253.98s)]
*  Yeah, I think the overall takeaway is something that we've heard Donald Trump talk about for [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glgqoRIYhtM&t=256.5s)]
*  a long time. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glgqoRIYhtM&t=261.9s)]
*  I think, you know, you look at China, you look at the CCP, this is our greatest geopolitical [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glgqoRIYhtM&t=262.9s)]
*  foe, I think, in the entire world. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glgqoRIYhtM&t=268.38s)]
*  I did an interview for my show this weekend with John Radcliffe, the CIA director. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glgqoRIYhtM&t=271.02s)]
*  He said they are specifically looking and putting so much investment in China because [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glgqoRIYhtM&t=274.86s)]
*  they are such a big threat. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glgqoRIYhtM&t=279.94s)]
*  When I look at this and I think about what it says there, that it could take out livestock, [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glgqoRIYhtM&t=281.72s)]
*  that it could take out all of our food supply, it could cause reproductive issues for humans. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glgqoRIYhtM&t=286.40000000000003s)]
*  This is an overall push, I believe, from the CCP to try and take down the United States [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glgqoRIYhtM&t=292.20000000000005s)]
*  of America. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glgqoRIYhtM&t=298.32000000000005s)]
*  There's a book called The Hundred Year Marathon, and it details the fact that China has in [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glgqoRIYhtM&t=299.32000000000005s)]
*  the background been waging this kind of silent war that most Americans don't know about to [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glgqoRIYhtM&t=303.04s)]
*  try and usurp America as the superpower of the world. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glgqoRIYhtM&t=307.90000000000003s)]
*  This seems like another step in that direction. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glgqoRIYhtM&t=310.84s)]
*  Look at TikTok in China. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glgqoRIYhtM&t=312.79999999999995s)]
*  These kids are all learning how to play, you know, the cello, the violin. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glgqoRIYhtM&t=314.38s)]
*  They're doing things to improve themselves. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glgqoRIYhtM&t=317.28s)]
*  Look at it in America. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glgqoRIYhtM&t=318.85999999999996s)]
*  We're teaching our kids to twerk. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glgqoRIYhtM&t=319.85999999999996s)]
*  Look at the education between China and America. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glgqoRIYhtM&t=321.11999999999995s)]
*  They have surpassed our American students long ago. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glgqoRIYhtM&t=324.11999999999995s)]
*  When you look at this, you look at China buying up farmland, and then I look at something [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glgqoRIYhtM&t=328.52s)]
*  like this, to me it says this is another step in China trying to take over America as a [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glgqoRIYhtM&t=332.11999999999995s)]
*  superpower. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glgqoRIYhtM&t=337.2s)]
*  Yeah, and John Radcliffe, the perfect person to talk to, he was a part of the first Trump [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glgqoRIYhtM&t=338.2s)]
*  administration when they were taking on Confucius Institutes on college campuses. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glgqoRIYhtM&t=340.68s)]
*  So they've been on this for a long time. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glgqoRIYhtM&t=344.64000000000004s)]
*  You know, Ari, the most chilling detail of this 25-page complaint is this. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glgqoRIYhtM&t=346.96000000000004s)]
*  There's an interesting WeChat exchange between this young woman and her boyfriend. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glgqoRIYhtM&t=351.84000000000003s)]
*  One week before she smuggled the pathogen into the United States, or he did, he told [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glgqoRIYhtM&t=356.68s)]
*  his girlfriend, once this is done, everything else will be easy, to which she replied, my [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glgqoRIYhtM&t=361.44000000000005s)]
*  seedlings are not usable yet. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glgqoRIYhtM&t=367.08000000000004s)]
*  I don't know if you could read that any which way, but it's a chilling way to read it when [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glgqoRIYhtM&t=369.78s)]
*  you compound it with the symptoms that Laura mentioned, reproductive birth defects, if [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glgqoRIYhtM&t=372.96s)]
*  this got out into the U.S. population. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glgqoRIYhtM&t=377.91999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, I'm looking forward to hearing more from law enforcement when they get into the [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glgqoRIYhtM&t=379.23999999999995s)]
*  details of this today. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glgqoRIYhtM&t=382.64s)]
*  How deep does this go? [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glgqoRIYhtM&t=384.76s)]
*  What do they suspect? [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glgqoRIYhtM&t=385.96s)]
*  But what this takes me back to is after September 11th. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glgqoRIYhtM&t=386.96s)]
*  After September 11th, the CIA concluded and they said to the White House, that is not [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glgqoRIYhtM&t=390.88s)]
*  a question of if, it's a question of when. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glgqoRIYhtM&t=394.59999999999997s)]
*  There will be a second attack. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glgqoRIYhtM&t=397.03999999999996s)]
*  The second attack that we feared the most and prepared the hardest to prevent was a [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glgqoRIYhtM&t=398.65999999999997s)]
*  biological attack, because that can cause the greatest destruction. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glgqoRIYhtM&t=402.58s)]
*  And don't forget, we're dealing with a China that regularly hacks and infiltrates America's [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glgqoRIYhtM&t=407.3s)]
*  industrial infrastructure. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glgqoRIYhtM&t=411.9s)]
*  They have made it a state business to get inside American systems to disrupt them, to [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glgqoRIYhtM&t=413.65999999999997s)]
*  steal from us, to take, to harm us, not to mention what they've done with Fentanyl, to [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glgqoRIYhtM&t=418.41999999999996s)]
*  poison us. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glgqoRIYhtM&t=424.02s)]
*  This is the China we deal with. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glgqoRIYhtM&t=425.82s)]
*  And if this does turn out to be, if the investigators say, if the Department of Justice reveals [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glgqoRIYhtM&t=427.47999999999996s)]
*  that this does appear to be tied to a biological attack, I don't know what the next step has [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glgqoRIYhtM&t=432.0s)]
*  to be with China, because that's an act of war. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glgqoRIYhtM&t=437.52s)]
*  And we've got to be very cautious. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glgqoRIYhtM&t=442.28s)]
*  I don't want to overplay this. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glgqoRIYhtM&t=443.44s)]
*  But as you pointed out, Emily, this is frightening. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glgqoRIYhtM&t=445.28s)]
*  If they're going to biologically mess with our food supply, we cannot sit back and take this. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glgqoRIYhtM&t=448.58s)]
*  No, you have to act. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glgqoRIYhtM&t=453.88s)]
*  And I'm confident the Commander-in-Chief would act in an appropriate fashion. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glgqoRIYhtM&t=455.38s)]
*  You know, Kayleigh, when you look at this and the events of this week, and then you [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glgqoRIYhtM&t=458.46000000000004s)]
*  look at the policies of the Trump administration, President Trump said, I want to look at visas [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glgqoRIYhtM&t=462.22s)]
*  on college campuses with these individuals who are protesting. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glgqoRIYhtM&t=465.78000000000003s)]
*  And then we get that horrific attack where eight Jewish men and women are burned because [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glgqoRIYhtM&t=469.52000000000004s)]
*  of their religion, a guy who overstayed his visa. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glgqoRIYhtM&t=473.12s)]
*  Then you had Marco Rubio Thursday say, we're going to look at China visas too. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glgqoRIYhtM&t=476.5s)]
*  And then you get this. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glgqoRIYhtM&t=480.38s)]
*  I mean, they've been ahead of the ballgame here. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glgqoRIYhtM&t=481.38s)]
*  If there's not a footnote to substantiate the policies they're making, if there's not [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glgqoRIYhtM&t=483.84s)]
*  a better one than this, I don't know what will convince people. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glgqoRIYhtM&t=487.59999999999997s)]
*  Well, and Ari, yes, what the next step is. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glgqoRIYhtM&t=489.88s)]
*  The next step is to revoke every single Chinese student visa. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glgqoRIYhtM&t=492.08s)]
*  Keep in mind, this is the second national security-related incident involving a Chinese [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glgqoRIYhtM&t=495.32s)]
*  visa that we've learned about this week. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glgqoRIYhtM&t=500.0s)]
*  There was another report earlier this week that a student in the University of Michigan, [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glgqoRIYhtM&t=501.68s)]
*  another Chinese national, fled the country after illegally voting in Michigan's election [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glgqoRIYhtM&t=505.76s)]
*  in November. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glgqoRIYhtM&t=510.24s)]
*  And he apparently voluntarily released his passport before doing so. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glgqoRIYhtM&t=511.44s)]
*  But this is a pattern of behavior. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glgqoRIYhtM&t=515.24s)]
*  And we need to keep in mind that China has a law requiring every single one of its citizens [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glgqoRIYhtM&t=517.0s)]
*  to spy on behalf of the Chinese Communist Party. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glgqoRIYhtM&t=522.26s)]
*  You see this with some of the details that were revealed in this affidavit, where this [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glgqoRIYhtM&t=525.62s)]
*  researcher was still receiving funding from the Chinese Communist Party to conduct research [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glgqoRIYhtM&t=529.0600000000001s)]
*  in the United States. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glgqoRIYhtM&t=534.7s)]
*  And they are exploiting our visa program to do that. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glgqoRIYhtM&t=536.38s)]
*  We are essentially holding open the front door to allow our greatest adversary to flood [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glgqoRIYhtM&t=539.34s)]
*  our country with people who are spying on us and undermining our national security. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glgqoRIYhtM&t=544.44s)]
*  And you mentioned subterfuge, but what the Chinese government does in public is just [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glgqoRIYhtM&t=548.88s)]
*  as revealing. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glgqoRIYhtM&t=553.74s)]
*  Let's remember last year, a Chinese state-run media outlet ran an editorial endorsing the [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glgqoRIYhtM&t=555.02s)]
*  pro-Hamas protests on U.S. college campuses because they know that if they target our [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glgqoRIYhtM&t=560.38s)]
*  higher education system and if they target my generation in particular, they can create [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glgqoRIYhtM&t=565.02s)]
*  division in our country. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glgqoRIYhtM&t=570.02s)]
*  And that is exactly what they're trying to do. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glgqoRIYhtM&t=571.46s)]
*  Yeah, without question. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glgqoRIYhtM&t=573.18s)]
