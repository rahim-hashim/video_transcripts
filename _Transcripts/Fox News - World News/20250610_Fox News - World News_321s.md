# 'Alarming': ANOTHER Chinese national accused of smuggling bio weapon into US
**Fox News - World News:** [June 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7vtUWWMUUE)
*  to say the least. The feds arrest a third Chinese national for allegedly smuggling biological [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7vtUWWMUUE&t=0.0s)]
*  materials into the United States and making false statements about it. According to the [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7vtUWWMUUE&t=8.52s)]
*  DOJ, the suspect is a PhD student in Wuhan. They say she sent four packages containing [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7vtUWWMUUE&t=13.32s)]
*  the concealed materials to a laboratory at the University of Michigan. Joining us now [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7vtUWWMUUE&t=19.64s)]
*  is Fox News contributor Andy McCarthy, a former assistant US attorney. And I want to run by [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7vtUWWMUUE&t=24.36s)]
*  what a current US attorney said about all of this. This is Jerome F. Gordon Jr. The [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7vtUWWMUUE&t=29.66s)]
*  alleged smuggling of biological materials by this alien from a science and technology [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7vtUWWMUUE&t=34.7s)]
*  university in Wuhan, China, to be used at a University of Michigan laboratory is part [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7vtUWWMUUE&t=38.7s)]
*  of an alarming pattern that threatens our security. The American taxpayers should not [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7vtUWWMUUE&t=43.96s)]
*  be underwriting a PRC-based smuggling operation at one of our crucial public institutions. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7vtUWWMUUE&t=48.82s)]
*  I mean, the fact that this stuff came from Wuhan, what are you thinking? [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7vtUWWMUUE&t=54.34s)]
*  Well, it's alarming, John. Usually when you're talking about bio weapons, according to the [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7vtUWWMUUE&t=59.620000000000005s)]
*  complaint, what we're talking about here is a roundworm, which is a parasite. So it's not a [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7vtUWWMUUE&t=68.02000000000001s)]
*  virus or a bacteria or a toxin, which is what we generally look for with bio weapons. But it's [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7vtUWWMUUE&t=73.94s)]
*  alarming in a number of ways. It could be involved in contamination of humans, of agriculture, of [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7vtUWWMUUE&t=80.3s)]
*  water supply. So you have to be concerned about that. The fact that it's coming from China, the [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7vtUWWMUUE&t=88.25999999999999s)]
*  fact that the student evidently swiped or wiped the communications device she had clean before [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7vtUWWMUUE&t=93.22s)]
*  she came here, I think three days before coming to the United States, all of that is alarming. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7vtUWWMUUE&t=100.14s)]
*  I think, though, the Justice Department appears to be going at it with appropriate caution. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7vtUWWMUUE&t=105.1s)]
*  According to the press release they put out, they said that they hadn't even decided whether to [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7vtUWWMUUE&t=110.94s)]
*  indict the case yet. This person was arrested on a complaint. So we'll have to see going forward. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7vtUWWMUUE&t=115.1s)]
*  I think they're trying to grapple with what they're dealing with. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7vtUWWMUUE&t=120.66s)]
*  This comes on the heels of what we saw last week, samples of certain fungi being seized. And those [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7vtUWWMUUE&t=123.13999999999999s)]
*  are fungi that if they got out, the greater agricultural community here in the United States [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7vtUWWMUUE&t=131.22s)]
*  could do enormous damage to our crops, even have deleterious effects on animals and humans. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7vtUWWMUUE&t=135.46s)]
*  Yeah, that's absolutely right. And again, the thing is, if this was a random kid from a different [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7vtUWWMUUE&t=140.98000000000002s)]
*  country, we might be able to sort of slough it off a little bit more. Obviously, you always have to [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7vtUWWMUUE&t=148.38s)]
*  be cautious. But because of the involvement in China and because China presses its people and [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7vtUWWMUUE&t=154.46s)]
*  its companies into the service of its intelligence and military activities, you have to assume the [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7vtUWWMUUE&t=160.29999999999998s)]
*  worst and hope as you investigate that it turns out to be benign. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7vtUWWMUUE&t=166.06s)]
*  All right. Let's turn our attention to California, since that really is the big news of the day. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7vtUWWMUUE&t=170.1s)]
*  Gavin Newsom, the governor of California, is suing President Trump for sending the National Guard [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7vtUWWMUUE&t=175.5s)]
*  to Los Angeles without either his request or his okay. Also critical of the deployment of 700 [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7vtUWWMUUE&t=180.29999999999998s)]
*  Marines. This is what Gavin Newsom wrote on X. He said, quote, US Marines serve a valuable purpose [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7vtUWWMUUE&t=188.26s)]
*  for this country defending democracy. They're not political pawns. The secretary of defense is [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7vtUWWMUUE&t=193.06s)]
*  illegally deploying them onto American streets so Trump can have a talking point at his parade this [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7vtUWWMUUE&t=197.7s)]
*  weekend. It's a blatant abuse of power. We will sue to stop this. The courts in Congress must act. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7vtUWWMUUE&t=203.02s)]
*  Checks and balances are crumbling. This is a red line and they're crossing it. Wake up. In terms of [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7vtUWWMUUE&t=207.54s)]
*  this idea of it being illegal to deploy the Marines, they're just there. My understanding is, [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7vtUWWMUUE&t=213.62s)]
*  it's a stopgap until all of the National Guard are mobilized. Does President Trump have the law [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7vtUWWMUUE&t=219.22s)]
*  on his side or does Newsom? The president absolutely has the law on his side. Since the civil war, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7vtUWWMUUE&t=224.82s)]
*  the courts have recognized that the president not only has the authority but the duty to protect the [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7vtUWWMUUE&t=233.62s)]
*  United States when there are conditions that could lead to violent rebellion. Enforcement of [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7vtUWWMUUE&t=239.14s)]
*  the immigration laws is a plenary federal responsibility. The Supreme Court has held that [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7vtUWWMUUE&t=245.77999999999997s)]
*  for years now and the president has unquestioned authority to protect federal personnel, federal [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7vtUWWMUUE&t=251.22s)]
*  resources, federal facilities, including the buildings that have been attacked, and obviously [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7vtUWWMUUE&t=258.74s)]
*  to protect the execution of federal law. So I really don't think Newsom has a leg to stand on here. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7vtUWWMUUE&t=264.9s)]
*  All right. So let me ask you this question. Newsom obviously is going to try to go to some friendly [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7vtUWWMUUE&t=270.09999999999997s)]
*  district court in California. How quickly do you think could this get to the Supreme Court on an [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7vtUWWMUUE&t=274.02s)]
*  emergency petition from the White House very quickly? Yeah, I think Chief Justice Roberts [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7vtUWWMUUE&t=278.73999999999995s)]
*  has been pretty emphatic, John, that the court can act quickly when there's an emergent situation. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7vtUWWMUUE&t=284.41999999999996s)]
*  I don't expect that Newsom is going to find the courts to be as friendly as perhaps he expects. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7vtUWWMUUE&t=291.3s)]
*  Interesting. All right, Andy, we'll see how this progresses. It certainly will be fascinating to [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7vtUWWMUUE&t=297.38000000000005s)]
*  watch all this unfold. Appreciate your time, sir. Thank you, John. Hey, everyone. I'm Emily Campagno. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7vtUWWMUUE&t=301.78000000000003s)]
