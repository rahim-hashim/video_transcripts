# Inside the agency that destroyed Fordow
**Fox News - World News:** [June 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CECEEWTOpJE)
*  Meanwhile, the historically successful strike on Iranian nuclear sites, especially the one [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CECEEWTOpJE&t=0.0s)]
*  of Fordow, was 15 years in the making. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CECEEWTOpJE&t=4.32s)]
*  And we're learning more about the little-known agency behind it. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CECEEWTOpJE&t=6.84s)]
*  There's an organization in the U.S. called the Defense Threat Reduction Agency, DITRA. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CECEEWTOpJE&t=11.92s)]
*  DITRA does a lot of things for our nation, but DITRA is the world's leading expert on [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CECEEWTOpJE&t=18.48s)]
*  deeply buried underground targets. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CECEEWTOpJE&t=24.8s)]
*  In the case of Fordow, the DITRA team understood with a high degree of confidence the elements [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CECEEWTOpJE&t=27.32s)]
*  of the target required to kill its functions. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CECEEWTOpJE&t=34.36s)]
*  And the weapons were designed, planned, and delivered to ensure that they achieve the [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CECEEWTOpJE&t=37.2s)]
*  effects in the mission space. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CECEEWTOpJE&t=43.28s)]
*  Amazing, right? [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CECEEWTOpJE&t=45.68s)]
*  Someone who knows a lot more about DTRA, the organization just described, and worked there [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CECEEWTOpJE&t=47.120000000000005s)]
*  is Joey Jones, a Fox News contributor, retired U.S. Marine Bomb Tech, and author of the number [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CECEEWTOpJE&t=52.42s)]
*  one New York Times bestseller, Beyond the Badge. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CECEEWTOpJE&t=57.2s)]
*  Joey, you were one of the few people that knew what he was talking about. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CECEEWTOpJE&t=60.440000000000005s)]
*  Can you tell me what their mission is? [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CECEEWTOpJE&t=64.12s)]
*  Yeah, so I had an internship there after I was injured and lost my legs. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CECEEWTOpJE&t=66.44s)]
*  I have a couple of mentors that were there for several years. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CECEEWTOpJE&t=70.88s)]
*  So DITRA is one of those few agencies that was created before 9-11 that is forward thinking [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CECEEWTOpJE&t=74.08s)]
*  and fits well into the homeland security model. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CECEEWTOpJE&t=79.32000000000001s)]
*  Basically, it's a collection of previous agencies. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CECEEWTOpJE&t=82.32000000000001s)]
*  Before 9-11, and the goal here is really think nuclear, chemical, biological, radiological, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CECEEWTOpJE&t=86.03999999999999s)]
*  what we classically consider a weapon of mass destruction, whether it be a power plant that [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CECEEWTOpJE&t=92.88s)]
*  goes offline, like Three Mile Island, or what happened in Japan, or what Iran had. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CECEEWTOpJE&t=97.3s)]
*  And so the agency has several key roles and responsibilities. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CECEEWTOpJE&t=103.88s)]
*  One of the first ones is that they plan exercises within the U.S. for if something goes wrong. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CECEEWTOpJE&t=107.72s)]
*  If people don't know this, we've lost more than a dozen nukes, most of them at sea, one [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CECEEWTOpJE&t=114.32s)]
*  of them in a cornfield in the Midwest that we never recovered. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CECEEWTOpJE&t=118.56s)]
*  And so there are nuclear threats out there within our borders that we don't even think [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CECEEWTOpJE&t=121.88s)]
*  about. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CECEEWTOpJE&t=126.0s)]
*  You have nuclear and radiological material that go missing from road crew equipment, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CECEEWTOpJE&t=127.0s)]
*  hospitals every year. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CECEEWTOpJE&t=131.16s)]
*  And if somebody collected that and wanted to make a nefarious item out of it, they could. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CECEEWTOpJE&t=132.35999999999999s)]
*  DITRA would be one of the organizations most responsible for looking at it. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CECEEWTOpJE&t=136.76s)]
*  DITRA also is in charge, or plays a key role in our inspection of both our own stuff and [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CECEEWTOpJE&t=140.32s)]
*  things abroad. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CECEEWTOpJE&t=146.2s)]
*  And it goes on and on. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CECEEWTOpJE&t=147.2s)]
*  And of course, you learned about a cell that they generally try to keep quiet that plans [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CECEEWTOpJE&t=148.52s)]
*  for contingencies, as we call it. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CECEEWTOpJE&t=153.08s)]
*  You've got things like the Japanese nuclear meltdown after the tsunami. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CECEEWTOpJE&t=154.84s)]
*  So it's been created since 98. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CECEEWTOpJE&t=159.72s)]
*  You can see a need for it. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CECEEWTOpJE&t=161.0s)]
*  So if Iran says, OK, I need some sanctions relief, do what I'm going to do, the 1-800, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CECEEWTOpJE&t=162.22s)]
*  I'm going to do the Qaddafi plan. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CECEEWTOpJE&t=167.32s)]
*  Come get my stuff. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CECEEWTOpJE&t=169.07999999999998s)]
*  Would this be the agency that came in and saw what was left of their nuclear program [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CECEEWTOpJE&t=170.07999999999998s)]
*  and took it? [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CECEEWTOpJE&t=175.23999999999998s)]
*  They would be under peaceful circumstances? [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CECEEWTOpJE&t=176.23999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, it would be one of them for sure. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CECEEWTOpJE&t=178.44s)]
*  The thing about the United States government is it's bloated and it swells. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CECEEWTOpJE&t=182.07999999999998s)]
*  For example, a good example of Space Force, what is Space Command now, I mean, used to [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CECEEWTOpJE&t=185.2s)]
*  fall under DITRA because ultimately, between you and me, Ryan, we've got to make sure there [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CECEEWTOpJE&t=191.66s)]
*  aren't nukes and satellites in space already. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CECEEWTOpJE&t=196.68s)]
*  But intercontinental ballistic missiles need to go exo-atmospheric. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CECEEWTOpJE&t=198.72s)]
*  That's a DITRA responsibility. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CECEEWTOpJE&t=202.24s)]
*  When Obama came in, he basically took the organization and said, focus on nuclear because [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CECEEWTOpJE&t=204.16s)]
*  if you can handle that, you can handle all the other stuff, chemical, biological, and [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CECEEWTOpJE&t=208.28s)]
*  what we call radiological, which is similar to nuclear, but it doesn't blow up. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CECEEWTOpJE&t=212.72s)]
*  It just puts out radiation. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CECEEWTOpJE&t=216.12s)]
*  So they play a key role in all of that. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CECEEWTOpJE&t=218.08s)]
*  I remember when we thought with Yeltsin in charge and Gorbachev immediately in charge, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CECEEWTOpJE&t=220.16s)]
*  and Yeltsin took over, we thought we'd have a good relationship with the new Russia. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CECEEWTOpJE&t=225.56s)]
*  And we went in there to help them dismantle their nuclear program and make sure they didn't [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CECEEWTOpJE&t=229.84s)]
*  get involved with rogue states or the Chechnians. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CECEEWTOpJE&t=235.92000000000002s)]
*  And it was Senator Lugar and a young senator named Barack Obama who played a role in a [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CECEEWTOpJE&t=241.8s)]
*  lot of that evaluation early. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CECEEWTOpJE&t=246.44s)]
*  Yeah, and I'm sure that's why the Obama administration was so interested in DITRA. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CECEEWTOpJE&t=249.24s)]
*  Nuclear threat is a big one. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CECEEWTOpJE&t=256.88s)]
*  I can understand why any president would say, hey, focus on the one that would really hurt. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CECEEWTOpJE&t=258.0s)]
*  And what I want people to understand is when it comes to radiological, what we call fissile [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CECEEWTOpJE&t=261.8s)]
*  material, it's not just an explosion. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CECEEWTOpJE&t=266.6s)]
*  There are instances abroad and here where material that puts off radiation, alpha, beta, [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CECEEWTOpJE&t=270.32s)]
*  gamma in a way that could hurt you, give you sickness and kill you. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CECEEWTOpJE&t=276.08s)]
*  You could bury a piece of that under a park bench and it would take weeks, if not months [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CECEEWTOpJE&t=279.64s)]
*  to find it and people would get... [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CECEEWTOpJE&t=283.56s)]
*  So there's a terrorism element here that DITRA was focused on for a long time. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CECEEWTOpJE&t=286.2s)]
*  Now I think it's pointed back towards a more conventional outlook and that's kind of scary. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CECEEWTOpJE&t=290.52s)]
*  They say between 400 and 800 kilograms of uranium could be out and about somewhere in [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CECEEWTOpJE&t=297.88s)]
*  Iran. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CECEEWTOpJE&t=302.91999999999996s)]
*  Just real quick, Joey. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CECEEWTOpJE&t=303.91999999999996s)]
*  Can they do it in hostile situations? [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CECEEWTOpJE&t=304.91999999999996s)]
*  For example, General Cain said, we don't grade our own homework. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CECEEWTOpJE&t=306.76s)]
*  Can DITRA do that even if they're not invited? [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CECEEWTOpJE&t=311.12s)]
*  Can they look at the analysis? [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CECEEWTOpJE&t=314.12s)]
*  Can they look at the readings and do that report card? [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CECEEWTOpJE&t=315.36s)]
*  So it's my understanding and listen, I'm 10 plus years removed from the organization, [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CECEEWTOpJE&t=320.84000000000003s)]
*  but it's my understanding that we have types of boots on the ground in the intel community [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CECEEWTOpJE&t=326.32s)]
*  that know what to look for, report that information back to an organization like DITRA and they [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CECEEWTOpJE&t=331.64s)]
*  would be the analysts that look at it. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CECEEWTOpJE&t=336.32s)]
*  What makes DITRA, one of the things that makes it so unique is they have a mix of your really [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CECEEWTOpJE&t=339.08s)]
*  smart scientists and also your hands-on techs like myself. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CECEEWTOpJE&t=343.44s)]
*  The best quote I can give you from a Marine Bomb Tech is DITRA is the only place that [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CECEEWTOpJE&t=348.8s)]
*  I fully use my top secret security clearance. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CECEEWTOpJE&t=352.96s)]
*  And he's like, I can't tell you much else. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CECEEWTOpJE&t=355.47999999999996s)]
*  And Joey, you're now a quadruple threat or a five tool player. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CECEEWTOpJE&t=357.96s)]
*  You're now also the number one New York Times bestseller, beyond the badge, number one in [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CECEEWTOpJE&t=361.44s)]
*  the country. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CECEEWTOpJE&t=366.08000000000004s)]
*  Congratulations, man. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CECEEWTOpJE&t=367.08000000000004s)]
*  I know how much every one of those stories means to you. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CECEEWTOpJE&t=368.08000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, thank you very much. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CECEEWTOpJE&t=370.92s)]
*  The credit goes to the non-people in the book for sure. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CECEEWTOpJE&t=372.96000000000004s)]
