**Fox News - World News:** [June 22, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tYT_1bhbBM)
*  We rescued many people after the Hamas attacks on October 7, 2023. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tYT_1bhbBM&t=0.0s)]
*  We've also rescued Floridians and other Americans from instability in Haiti. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tYT_1bhbBM&t=5.44s)]
*  And so we sprung into action. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tYT_1bhbBM&t=9.84s)]
*  We were able to get 1,500 during the first week out of Israel, and we're now running [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tYT_1bhbBM&t=11.040000000000001s)]
*  flights. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tYT_1bhbBM&t=16.28s)]
*  We've had hundreds of people repatriated back to Florida. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tYT_1bhbBM&t=17.28s)]
*  I was in Tampa the other day greeting people in the wee hours of the morning. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tYT_1bhbBM&t=19.84s)]
*  And it's a difficult situation. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tYT_1bhbBM&t=24.44s)]
*  If you're a college student over there studying abroad, or if you're there with your family, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tYT_1bhbBM&t=26.28s)]
*  all of a sudden you're in this midst of a situation which is very, very dicey. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tYT_1bhbBM&t=31.04s)]
*  So those operations are ongoing. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tYT_1bhbBM&t=35.24s)]
*  We're going to continue to help rescue our fellow Floridians and fellow Americans when [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tYT_1bhbBM&t=37.52s)]
*  they need help. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tYT_1bhbBM&t=41.72s)]
*  Thank you for those flights from Tel Aviv to Tampa. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tYT_1bhbBM&t=42.72s)]
*  Very effective. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tYT_1bhbBM&t=45.52s)]
