# We're on the cusp of REAL change: Gen. Keane
**Fox News - World News:** [June 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vc6ww9HLJgk)
*  So the Pentagon defending the work of those fighter pilots involved in destroying key [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vc6ww9HLJgk&t=0.0s)]
*  Iranian nuclear sites. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vc6ww9HLJgk&t=6.5600000000000005s)]
*  When the crews went to work on Friday, they kissed their loved ones goodbye, not knowing [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vc6ww9HLJgk&t=9.4s)]
*  when or if they'd be home. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vc6ww9HLJgk&t=13.84s)]
*  Late on Saturday night, their families became aware of what was happening. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vc6ww9HLJgk&t=17.36s)]
*  And on Sunday, when those jets returned from Whiteman, their families were there. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vc6ww9HLJgk&t=22.16s)]
*  Flags flying and tears flowing. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vc6ww9HLJgk&t=28.64s)]
*  I have chills literally talking about this. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vc6ww9HLJgk&t=30.28s)]
*  He also went on to honor the 44 soldiers, all under the age of 28, who remained at Al [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vc6ww9HLJgk&t=34.44s)]
*  Adid Air Base in Qatar to defend the base against incoming Iranian strikes. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vc6ww9HLJgk&t=39.3s)]
*  We didn't know where those strikes were going to go. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vc6ww9HLJgk&t=43.88s)]
*  Retired four-star General Jack Keane joins us now. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vc6ww9HLJgk&t=45.92s)]
*  General, we forget about that. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vc6ww9HLJgk&t=48.519999999999996s)]
*  We thought for sure that they were going to zero in on Qatar or Iraq through their militias. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vc6ww9HLJgk&t=49.96s)]
*  It must take a lot of courage. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vc6ww9HLJgk&t=55.56s)]
*  What are you thinking when you're sitting at that base, knowing that you could be the [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vc6ww9HLJgk&t=57.4s)]
*  target of a reprisal? [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vc6ww9HLJgk&t=59.92s)]
*  Yeah, well, that's certainly the case here. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vc6ww9HLJgk&t=62.12s)]
*  I think the Iranians carefully selected this target. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vc6ww9HLJgk&t=66.4s)]
*  And when you reflect on it, it's pretty obvious what they were doing. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vc6ww9HLJgk&t=70.92s)]
*  This was the best defended base in the Middle East in terms of air defense systems that [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vc6ww9HLJgk&t=74.96s)]
*  we had and also what Qatar had. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vc6ww9HLJgk&t=79.42s)]
*  The same thing for our Navy base that is in Bahrain. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vc6ww9HLJgk&t=81.68s)]
*  The bases in Iraq and Syria are not the same. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vc6ww9HLJgk&t=85.64s)]
*  Nor do they have as many people, nor are they sprawling in the sense of a major air base [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vc6ww9HLJgk&t=88.92s)]
*  like this. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vc6ww9HLJgk&t=95.04s)]
*  So I think they fundamentally selected this because they knew it was so well defended. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vc6ww9HLJgk&t=96.84s)]
*  They really had their fingers crossed, likely, when they fired off those 14 missiles, they [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vc6ww9HLJgk&t=103.24000000000001s)]
*  did not want them to kill any Americans at that base because they knew what the result [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vc6ww9HLJgk&t=109.84s)]
*  of that would be. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vc6ww9HLJgk&t=114.64s)]
*  And that's why, Brian, they told Qatar that the attack was coming. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vc6ww9HLJgk&t=115.64s)]
*  And certainly that was to make certain that the best defense was ready for that attack. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vc6ww9HLJgk&t=120.82s)]
*  So the Iranians were doing a symbolic attack for sure, limited as we have described, for [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vc6ww9HLJgk&t=125.92s)]
*  the obvious reasons. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vc6ww9HLJgk&t=133.04s)]
*  They intend to stand down here and they certainly didn't want any recriminations from the Trump [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vc6ww9HLJgk&t=134.28s)]
*  administration. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vc6ww9HLJgk&t=139.6s)]
*  The foreign minister came out yesterday and there's some doubt on when these talks are [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vc6ww9HLJgk&t=140.64s)]
*  going to get started, but let's assume they get started. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vc6ww9HLJgk&t=146.07999999999998s)]
*  They should be direct. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vc6ww9HLJgk&t=148.2s)]
*  But General, you also caution that this can't just be about the nuclear program. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vc6ww9HLJgk&t=149.64s)]
*  The funding of these surrogates, Hamas, Hezbollah, Islamic Jihad, the Houthis, is what's causing [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vc6ww9HLJgk&t=154.04s)]
*  and roiling the entire Middle East. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vc6ww9HLJgk&t=160.39999999999998s)]
*  How do you get them to stop it? [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vc6ww9HLJgk&t=162.95999999999998s)]
*  How do you enforce that? [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vc6ww9HLJgk&t=165.01999999999998s)]
*  a lot of its money and training? [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vc6ww9HLJgk&t=166.35999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, well, I think we've got to try. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vc6ww9HLJgk&t=167.92s)]
*  I mean, this is a diabolical regime that likely has already made up his mind to recover and [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vc6ww9HLJgk&t=171.76s)]
*  rebuild its nuclear enterprise. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vc6ww9HLJgk&t=178.12s)]
*  That's where these guys are. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vc6ww9HLJgk&t=179.79999999999998s)]
*  But listen, they're on their knees in a way they never have been. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vc6ww9HLJgk&t=181.48s)]
*  As you mentioned the commentary about the Ayatollah doesn't look as good as he used [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vc6ww9HLJgk&t=185.22s)]
*  to look. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vc6ww9HLJgk&t=189.68s)]
*  Well, he's been in a bunker for almost two weeks with Israeli jets flying over the border [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vc6ww9HLJgk&t=190.68s)]
*  day and night. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vc6ww9HLJgk&t=196.28s)]
*  That's that's that's quite a moment for these guys. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vc6ww9HLJgk&t=197.28s)]
*  So I do think we have some opportunities here at least to try and get them to change their [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vc6ww9HLJgk&t=200.08s)]
*  behavior. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vc6ww9HLJgk&t=205.6s)]
*  Stop the aggression against Israel. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vc6ww9HLJgk&t=206.92000000000002s)]
*  Number one, recognize that Israel has a right to exist as a state in the Middle East. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vc6ww9HLJgk&t=209.76s)]
*  Number two, stop funding and supporting the proxies. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vc6ww9HLJgk&t=215.98s)]
*  Stop supporting terrorism in the Middle East and around the world in exchange for what [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vc6ww9HLJgk&t=221.84s)]
*  sanction relief over time, gradually based on actual behavior being changed, not just [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vc6ww9HLJgk&t=230.28s)]
*  signing some written document and open up the doors for trading. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vc6ww9HLJgk&t=238.64000000000001s)]
*  I think President Trump has got the wind that is back here. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vc6ww9HLJgk&t=243.8s)]
*  He's got leverage that he didn't have before. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vc6ww9HLJgk&t=247.32000000000002s)]
*  Obviously, of the fact that look at this country has been defeated. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vc6ww9HLJgk&t=250.32s)]
*  They all have but surrendered. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vc6ww9HLJgk&t=254.64000000000001s)]
*  They didn't wave a white flag, but we've seen the elements of it. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vc6ww9HLJgk&t=257.04s)]
*  We have leverage here and I think we can take advantage. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vc6ww9HLJgk&t=261.04s)]
*  Now, will they change? [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vc6ww9HLJgk&t=263.92s)]
*  My instincts tell me no, but it's worth a try. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vc6ww9HLJgk&t=265.4s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vc6ww9HLJgk&t=268.4s)]
*  Because of that leverage and because of how weak they are. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vc6ww9HLJgk&t=269.4s)]
*  Yeah, the weakness, too, is what can you actually do a lot less than you used to? [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vc6ww9HLJgk&t=271.88s)]
*  Just a couple of notes. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vc6ww9HLJgk&t=276.36s)]
*  The foreign minister is going to visit China and if China starts saying, okay, this is [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vc6ww9HLJgk&t=277.52s)]
*  how you rebuild your nuclear program and North Korea goes, yeah, I got some expertise, I'll [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vc6ww9HLJgk&t=281.03999999999996s)]
*  share with you, too. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vc6ww9HLJgk&t=284.52s)]
*  What do we do on that note? [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vc6ww9HLJgk&t=286.47999999999996s)]
*  In the big picture, do you really believe that Israel should be ready to absorb a rocket [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vc6ww9HLJgk&t=289.96s)]
*  here or a rocket there in the gradual uptick with Hezbollah and Hamas again? [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vc6ww9HLJgk&t=295.64s)]
*  Or do you think there is a chance at a total new Middle East now? [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vc6ww9HLJgk&t=300.2s)]
*  I think we're on the cusp of some real paradigm change. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vc6ww9HLJgk&t=304.72s)]
*  First of all, dealing with Russia and China, none of them came to assist their partner [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vc6ww9HLJgk&t=309.8s)]
*  in part of the China-Russia-Iran-North Korea alliance that was formed, the so-called AXIS [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vc6ww9HLJgk&t=317.38s)]
*  that was put together here in Iran's most desperate moment. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vc6ww9HLJgk&t=323.64s)]
*  Neither one of those countries came to help and they have plenty of ballistic missiles. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vc6ww9HLJgk&t=327.64s)]
*  They have plenty of air defense systems. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vc6ww9HLJgk&t=331.42s)]
*  Those are the things that they needed, no help. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vc6ww9HLJgk&t=334.04s)]
*  We have leverage with Russia and China that we did not have before this strike because [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vc6ww9HLJgk&t=336.52000000000004s)]
*  it reflects Americans' boldness and strength. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vc6ww9HLJgk&t=342.52000000000004s)]
*  This is all about the President of the United States and he's the one that has a relationship [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vc6ww9HLJgk&t=345.76s)]
*  with both of those leaders. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vc6ww9HLJgk&t=350.8s)]
*  I think his hand has gotten stronger in dealing with them as a result of this. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vc6ww9HLJgk&t=352.44s)]
*  That's just the reality of what we're facing out there. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vc6ww9HLJgk&t=359.72s)]
*  That is all good news. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vc6ww9HLJgk&t=362.68s)]
*  It is. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vc6ww9HLJgk&t=363.68s)]
*  Now, as opposed to what is happening with the proxies, I was told, I asked the Israelis, [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vc6ww9HLJgk&t=364.68s)]
*  I didn't see Hezbollah come to Iran's defense. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vc6ww9HLJgk&t=372.28000000000003s)]
*  The principal reason why they were organized with billions of dollars through the years [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vc6ww9HLJgk&t=377.0s)]
*  and also 150,000 rockets and missiles was not just terrorism, which is what they did [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vc6ww9HLJgk&t=381.36s)]
*  and they were very good at it, but primarily to defend Iran. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vc6ww9HLJgk&t=387.56s)]
*  I asked them, do they have any rockets and missiles left? [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vc6ww9HLJgk&t=393.15999999999997s)]
*  Is that the reason? [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vc6ww9HLJgk&t=394.96s)]
*  And he said, oh, they do have thousands of rockets and missiles. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vc6ww9HLJgk&t=396.59999999999997s)]
*  I said, why aren't they in the fight? [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vc6ww9HLJgk&t=399.47999999999996s)]
*  They don't have the will. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vc6ww9HLJgk&t=401.56s)]
*  And they also see that Iran is back on its heels. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vc6ww9HLJgk&t=403.36s)]
*  Why take that risk when they know what the outcome is going to be? [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vc6ww9HLJgk&t=406.0s)]
*  That is stunning. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vc6ww9HLJgk&t=410.03999999999996s)]
*  It is, General. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vc6ww9HLJgk&t=411.03999999999996s)]
*  So we have those proxies back on their heels. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vc6ww9HLJgk&t=412.03999999999996s)]
*  Imagine if Lebanon was in control of Lebanon, the Lebanese. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vc6ww9HLJgk&t=415.15999999999997s)]
*  Thanks so much, General. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vc6ww9HLJgk&t=418.64s)]
*  It would be great talking to you. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vc6ww9HLJgk&t=419.64s)]
