# Tulsi Gabbard's SHOCKING nuclear war warning
**Fox News - World News:** [June 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ApkqVT_y3w)
*  All right, President Trump out of Fort Bragg in North Carolina there kicking off celebrations for the Army's [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ApkqVT_y3w&t=0.0s)]
*  150th birthday, it's coming up this Saturday. Trump announced he is reverting now names of several bases that had previously [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ApkqVT_y3w&t=6.8s)]
*  honored Confederate leaders. Former President Biden had renamed them after what his administration called [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ApkqVT_y3w&t=14.200000000000001s)]
*  Social Justice [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ApkqVT_y3w&t=20.6s)]
*  Warriors. Let's bring in the perfect person to talk about this. Mike Cirelli. He's a retired Navy SEAL. Mike, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ApkqVT_y3w&t=22.28s)]
*  what do you make of the restoration to the previously named bases under the current president? [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ApkqVT_y3w&t=27.68s)]
*  You know, that is part of our history. Thank God that President Trump reversed it. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ApkqVT_y3w&t=36.8s)]
*  Us as veterans still responded to it or referred to it as Fort Bragg or Fort Hood. So this is much needed. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ApkqVT_y3w&t=40.96s)]
*  I'll tell you this, Gillian. In my 20 years, I've never seen a military audience more electrified [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ApkqVT_y3w&t=46.16s)]
*  than yesterday. It was almost the return of Eisenhower. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ApkqVT_y3w&t=52.08s)]
*  We've never seen morale at its highest because of this administration. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ApkqVT_y3w&t=55.86s)]
*  Take a listen to President Trump making the case for his decision. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ApkqVT_y3w&t=61.14s)]
*  A lot of battles out of those forts. It's no time to change. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ApkqVT_y3w&t=67.46s)]
*  And I'm superstitious, you know, I like to keep it going, right? I'm very superstitious. We want to keep it going. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ApkqVT_y3w&t=72.25999999999999s)]
*  So, you know, he says it's superstition. What do you make of that? [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ApkqVT_y3w&t=78.5s)]
*  It's part of our history. He understands that the Trump administration has respect [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ApkqVT_y3w&t=89.7s)]
*  and values our military as long as well as our history. And he understands the purpose of our [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ApkqVT_y3w&t=93.86s)]
*  military and our service members. So this was seen and heard by our current military forces [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ApkqVT_y3w&t=98.18s)]
*  and it's well received. So, again, I applaud the president for making this decision, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ApkqVT_y3w&t=104.58s)]
*  regardless of what the naysayers will say. If they haven't served, quite frankly, I don't care. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ApkqVT_y3w&t=109.14s)]
*  He also, as you know, is sort of ordering this massive parade to celebrate the upcoming birthday [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ApkqVT_y3w&t=114.1s)]
*  of the Army on Saturday. A lot of folks here in Washington excited, planning to attend that. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ApkqVT_y3w&t=122.58s)]
*  We're going to have special coverage right here on Fox News. What's the reaction to this? [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ApkqVT_y3w&t=127.62s)]
*  Among folks on the ground. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ApkqVT_y3w&t=135.3s)]
*  Gillian, I'll tell you this. I have more friends, Army brethren. I served in the Marine Corps and [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ApkqVT_y3w&t=137.94000000000003s)]
*  the Navy. Was saved more than I can count times by the Army. I have more friends hanging out to [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ApkqVT_y3w&t=141.70000000000002s)]
*  D.C. to take part in this celebration. The Army has defended our freedoms in our nation. They've [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ApkqVT_y3w&t=147.54000000000002s)]
*  answered the call for over 250 years. While this may fall on President Trump's birthday, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ApkqVT_y3w&t=153.70000000000002s)]
*  this is about our military service members. And so this is a great celebration, long overdue, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ApkqVT_y3w&t=158.66000000000003s)]
*  to have these type of parades so that our public can see just the disciplined, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ApkqVT_y3w&t=164.26s)]
*  uniformed services that we know. Something totally different. This caught our eye, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ApkqVT_y3w&t=168.57999999999998s)]
*  the Director of National Intelligence warning of nuclear annihilation. Take a listen to [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ApkqVT_y3w&t=175.78s)]
*  Telsey Gabbard. Want to get your response. As we stand here today, closer to the brink of [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ApkqVT_y3w&t=182.34s)]
*  nuclear annihilation than ever before, political elite and warmongers are carelessly fomenting [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ApkqVT_y3w&t=186.82s)]
*  fear and tensions between nuclear powers. We must reject this path to nuclear war and work [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ApkqVT_y3w&t=193.54s)]
*  toward a world where no one has to live in fear of a nuclear holocaust. What do you think about that? [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ApkqVT_y3w&t=199.54s)]
*  First off, I'll say this. I know, Tulsi, we could not have a stronger woman, a leader and [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ApkqVT_y3w&t=209.62s)]
*  representative of this nation sitting in that DNIC. Both President Trump, his administration, [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ApkqVT_y3w&t=213.85999999999999s)]
*  and Tulsi understand this, the implications of the current conflicts. They are fighting against [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ApkqVT_y3w&t=218.82s)]
*  the military industrial complex, the goblets, and even the warmongers to prevent a nuclear [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ApkqVT_y3w&t=223.78s)]
*  holocaust, which could come out of the Ukraine-Russia war. The EU continues to poke the bear, Russia, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ApkqVT_y3w&t=229.78s)]
*  which has more nuclear warheads by volume than any other nation. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ApkqVT_y3w&t=236.01999999999998s)]
*  Trump came in and was elected under the promise of bringing peace and stability to the world. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ApkqVT_y3w&t=240.1s)]
*  He's trying to do that. He's trying to de-escalate things, as well as Tulsi. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ApkqVT_y3w&t=244.74s)]
*  So this is a warning call. This is a warning message that if this continues, [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ApkqVT_y3w&t=248.82000000000002s)]
*  if we do not find a resolution to the Ukraine-Russia war, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ApkqVT_y3w&t=254.18s)]
*  these are the potential implications, which I assure you nobody wants. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ApkqVT_y3w&t=257.7s)]
*  There is also, of course, the looming menace of Iran now just two weeks, less than two weeks, [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ApkqVT_y3w&t=261.3s)]
*  really breakout time to nuclear enrichment capabilities. Mike, thanks so much for taking [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ApkqVT_y3w&t=267.62s)]
*  time with us. We appreciate it. Thanks, Gillian. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ApkqVT_y3w&t=272.34s)]
