# This is the best shot Trump has to end the Iranian threat, expert reveals
**Fox News - World News:** [June 18, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9C0POf9ypw)
*  Certainly are. Jillian, here is the state of play right now on the board behind me. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9C0POf9ypw&t=0.0s)]
*  This is Iran's ballistic missile estimations. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9C0POf9ypw&t=4.0s)]
*  This is essentially what the regime has to fight at the moment. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9C0POf9ypw&t=7.0s)]
*  About 3,000 total capacity, of which anywhere between 1,000 to 2,000, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9C0POf9ypw&t=11.0s)]
*  have the ability to travel the distance from Tehran to Tel Aviv. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9C0POf9ypw&t=16.0s)]
*  And that's very significant, as we can show through the map here, okay? [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9C0POf9ypw&t=19.0s)]
*  Tehran to Israel, Tel Aviv, let's say, is about 1,000 miles, okay? [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9C0POf9ypw&t=23.0s)]
*  So not the entire ballistic missile arsenal can get there. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9C0POf9ypw&t=29.0s)]
*  So the Iranians have a decision to make depending on how many can travel this distance, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9C0POf9ypw&t=33.0s)]
*  1,000 miles from Tehran. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9C0POf9ypw&t=38.0s)]
*  In addition now, you have at least 400 that have been fired. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9C0POf9ypw&t=41.0s)]
*  Some estimates say about 450 thus far. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9C0POf9ypw&t=45.0s)]
*  So the Iranian leadership and the military have these decisions to make [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9C0POf9ypw&t=48.0s)]
*  as to how long they want to go with this ballistic missile supply. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9C0POf9ypw&t=51.0s)]
*  Also, you've got, according to the IDF, 120 missile launchers that have been taken out. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9C0POf9ypw&t=55.0s)]
*  That is critical if you cannot have the capacity to deliver the missiles toward Iran [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9C0POf9ypw&t=60.0s)]
*  and affect the damage on the ground. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9C0POf9ypw&t=66.0s)]
*  Talked about Iran yesterday. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9C0POf9ypw&t=68.0s)]
*  Borders closed with Azerbaijan, borders closed down here with Pakistan. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9C0POf9ypw&t=70.0s)]
*  The airspace is closed as well. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9C0POf9ypw&t=74.0s)]
*  Iran is a massive country. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9C0POf9ypw&t=76.0s)]
*  It's about the size of Alaska. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9C0POf9ypw&t=78.0s)]
*  It's about two times the state of Texas. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9C0POf9ypw&t=80.0s)]
*  You could put 75 Israels inside of Iran, a country of 90 million people. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9C0POf9ypw&t=82.0s)]
*  Tehran's got about 9, 10 million, plus another 8 to 9 million in the metropolitan area of Tehran. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9C0POf9ypw&t=88.0s)]
*  It's highly dense, it's populated, and it's very large. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9C0POf9ypw&t=95.0s)]
*  A big challenge for the Israelis and perhaps the U.S. as well. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9C0POf9ypw&t=99.0s)]
*  One key significant factor we've noticed over the past six days. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9C0POf9ypw&t=103.0s)]
*  Who was supporting Iran? [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9C0POf9ypw&t=108.0s)]
*  Well, here are the headlines now from the Jerusalem Post. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9C0POf9ypw&t=110.0s)]
*  Iran remains isolated five days into the strikes. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9C0POf9ypw&t=112.0s)]
*  New York Times, despite close ties with Iran, Russia stands aside as Israel attacks. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9C0POf9ypw&t=116.0s)]
*  In addition to that, what's Beijing doing, right? [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9C0POf9ypw&t=122.0s)]
*  China sides with Tehran but wields little influence in the Iran-Israeli war, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9C0POf9ypw&t=125.0s)]
*  which shows you how isolated this regime has become. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9C0POf9ypw&t=129.0s)]
*  I'm going to move over here for a second. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9C0POf9ypw&t=133.0s)]
*  Jimmy D'Ancino is the former foreign policy advisor for President Bush. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9C0POf9ypw&t=135.0s)]
*  Got a great podcast too, called me back. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9C0POf9ypw&t=139.0s)]
*  And Dan, good morning to you. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9C0POf9ypw&t=141.0s)]
*  Good to be with you, Bill. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9C0POf9ypw&t=143.0s)]
*  Welcome to our coverage here. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9C0POf9ypw&t=144.0s)]
*  This comes from the Institute for the Study of War. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9C0POf9ypw&t=145.0s)]
*  Jack Keene and others, they write this. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9C0POf9ypw&t=148.0s)]
*  Iran has used significantly fewer munitions in its response to Israel than originally planned [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9C0POf9ypw&t=150.0s)]
*  because the IDF destroyed and damaged missile launchers and silos that Iran planned to use to retaliate against Israel. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9C0POf9ypw&t=156.0s)]
*  We are on day six. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9C0POf9ypw&t=163.0s)]
*  Can Israel manage this alone? [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9C0POf9ypw&t=165.0s)]
*  Israel can manage the defense of Israel alone. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9C0POf9ypw&t=168.0s)]
*  Israel can continue to do serious damage to Iran's military assets, its military leadership, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9C0POf9ypw&t=172.0s)]
*  and its nuclear program, with the exception of Fordow. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9C0POf9ypw&t=178.0s)]
*  That is the big question mark. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9C0POf9ypw&t=182.0s)]
*  Fordow, as you know, is this enrichment capability or asset that's deep-hunkered down into bunkers, basically, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9C0POf9ypw&t=184.0s)]
*  very hard to access. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9C0POf9ypw&t=192.0s)]
*  And it's, I mean, the Israelis say they have some capabilities that could tackle Fordow. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9C0POf9ypw&t=194.0s)]
*  They've done Natanz. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9C0POf9ypw&t=199.0s)]
*  The question is, can they do Fordow? [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9C0POf9ypw&t=201.0s)]
*  They say they have capabilities to do Fordow. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9C0POf9ypw&t=203.0s)]
*  The Americans, the U.S. definitely has the capacity to do Fordow. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9C0POf9ypw&t=205.0s)]
*  I think Israel's capabilities are probably there, but they will be messy and they will take longer. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9C0POf9ypw&t=209.0s)]
*  And I think the U.S., if the U.S. participated in some way, would be a much cleaner shot. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9C0POf9ypw&t=214.0s)]
*  So we've heard a lot from the president so far today. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9C0POf9ypw&t=218.0s)]
*  I think it was yesterday when he said unconditional surrender, or perhaps that was Monday. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9C0POf9ypw&t=221.0s)]
*  Things are running together. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9C0POf9ypw&t=225.0s)]
*  But significant that J.D. Vance said this yesterday. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9C0POf9ypw&t=227.0s)]
*  People are right to be worried about foreign entanglement after the last 25 years of idiotic foreign policy. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9C0POf9ypw&t=229.0s)]
*  But I believe the president has earned some trust on this issue. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9C0POf9ypw&t=235.0s)]
*  He's only interested in using the American military to accomplish American people's goals. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9C0POf9ypw&t=238.0s)]
*  Is the administration getting warmer to the possibility of war? [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9C0POf9ypw&t=244.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9C0POf9ypw&t=248.0s)]
*  Well, they've already gotten warm to the possibility of war because there is a war going on that the U.S. supports. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9C0POf9ypw&t=249.0s)]
*  The only question is, as one Republican U.S. senator put it to me the other day, who has been talking to President Trump, [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9C0POf9ypw&t=255.0s)]
*  he said, to finish this off, Israel has done all the difficult, dirty work. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9C0POf9ypw&t=260.0s)]
*  It has cleared the path now for the U.S. to come in the end and finish it off. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9C0POf9ypw&t=264.0s)]
*  Israel could probably finish it off, as I said earlier, which is, again, Fordow. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9C0POf9ypw&t=268.0s)]
*  But he said Israel's chance of success, doing it on its own, is much lower. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9C0POf9ypw&t=272.0s)]
*  If the U.S. finishes it off, the success rate is 90% plus. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9C0POf9ypw&t=277.0s)]
*  So on that, what is the calculation on behalf of the commander in chief if this does not go as planned, [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9C0POf9ypw&t=281.0s)]
*  if it goes sideways, not just in Iran, but our military installations throughout the Middle East [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9C0POf9ypw&t=288.0s)]
*  or perhaps Americans who are living abroad or even here at home? [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9C0POf9ypw&t=294.0s)]
*  Keep in mind, we had how many millions of people walk across that border for four years. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9C0POf9ypw&t=298.0s)]
*  I think the big question for the president is, if this doesn't wrap up cleanly and soon, [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9C0POf9ypw&t=304.0s)]
*  you will have this war dragging on. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9C0POf9ypw&t=312.0s)]
*  Israel is not going to pull back and presumably Iran is not going to pull back. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9C0POf9ypw&t=315.0s)]
*  What does that look like? What does that look like to Israel? [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9C0POf9ypw&t=319.0s)]
*  What does it look like to Iran? And what does it look like to the region? [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9C0POf9ypw&t=321.0s)]
*  A. B. Never forget that Iran has been a threat to the United States and the West for decades. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9C0POf9ypw&t=323.0s)]
*  I mean, literally, after al-Qaeda, you can't think of a bigger source of terrorism. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9C0POf9ypw&t=332.0s)]
*  You can't think of an entity or a country that has more American blood on its hands than Iran. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9C0POf9ypw&t=336.0s)]
*  American military, I saw it firsthand in Iraq where they were killed by terrorists supported by Iran, [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9C0POf9ypw&t=341.0s)]
*  directly by the Iranian military. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9C0POf9ypw&t=347.0s)]
*  They run rabid all over the world, threatening American interests. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9C0POf9ypw&t=349.0s)]
*  So this is the best shot President Trump has since the revolution in 1979 to put the Iranian threat away. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9C0POf9ypw&t=354.0s)]
*  He would be the president that makes this thing go away. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9C0POf9ypw&t=362.0s)]
*  If he did, the man would deserve the Nobel Peace Prize. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9C0POf9ypw&t=364.0s)]
*  Last question. The Supreme Leader was out three hours ago. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9C0POf9ypw&t=367.0s)]
*  He rejected surrender. He rejected unconditional surrender, whatever the phrase was at the time. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9C0POf9ypw&t=371.0s)]
*  What cards does he have today? [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9C0POf9ypw&t=377.0s)]
*  I don't think he has many. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9C0POf9ypw&t=381.0s)]
*  On my podcast this morning, I interviewed an expert who's lived in Iran, who's Kareem Sajipour, who's an expert on Iran. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9C0POf9ypw&t=384.0s)]
*  He says he can't think of many cards, any cards Iran has right now. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9C0POf9ypw&t=391.0s)]
*  And the problem is with the Supreme Leader is he's old, he's dug in, he's deeply ideological, and he's really uncompromising. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9C0POf9ypw&t=395.0s)]
*  The Iran deal he did in 2015 with Obama, which was an enormously generous deal to Iran, [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9C0POf9ypw&t=402.0s)]
*  was considered by him a massive capitulation. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9C0POf9ypw&t=408.0s)]
*  This is not a man who wants to make real concessions. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9C0POf9ypw&t=411.0s)]
*  So unfortunately Iran does not have many cards right now. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9C0POf9ypw&t=414.0s)]
*  And for the Iranian people, what's tragic is they have a leader who's in his 80s and does not seem to be prepared to change his ways. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9C0POf9ypw&t=418.0s)]
*  Day six and we push you on. Dan, it's great to get your analysis today. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9C0POf9ypw&t=426.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9C0POf9ypw&t=429.0s)]
*  Dan Sienawer, thanks. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9C0POf9ypw&t=430.0s)]
*  Thanks. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9C0POf9ypw&t=431.0s)]
*  The most modest interviews and most compelling analysis. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9C0POf9ypw&t=438.0s)]
