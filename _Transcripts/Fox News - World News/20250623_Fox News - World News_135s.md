# BREAKING: Trump calls out 'weak' response from Iran
**Fox News - World News:** [June 23, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-C4hxh0voVE)
*  We have some breaking news from the White House. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-C4hxh0voVE&t=0.0s)]
*  President Trump has just made a statement. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-C4hxh0voVE&t=3.2800000000000002s)]
*  Rich Edson. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-C4hxh0voVE&t=5.36s)]
*  Good afternoon, Martha. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-C4hxh0voVE&t=6.36s)]
*  So, the president, taking to true socialists a short while ago, he says Iran has officially [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-C4hxh0voVE&t=7.36s)]
*  responded to our obliteration of their nuclear facilities with a very weak response, which [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-C4hxh0voVE&t=11.6s)]
*  we expected and have very effectively countered. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-C4hxh0voVE&t=16.2s)]
*  There have been 14 missiles fired, 13 were knocked down. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-C4hxh0voVE&t=18.96s)]
*  One was set free because it was headed in a non-threatening direction. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-C4hxh0voVE&t=22.36s)]
*  I am pleased to report that no Americans were harmed and hardly any damage was done. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-C4hxh0voVE&t=26.08s)]
*  Most importantly, they've gotten it all out of their system and there will hopefully be [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-C4hxh0voVE&t=30.4s)]
*  no further hate. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-C4hxh0voVE&t=34.94s)]
*  I want to thank Iran for giving us early notice, which made it possible for no lives to be [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-C4hxh0voVE&t=36.0s)]
*  lost and nobody to be injured. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-C4hxh0voVE&t=40.8s)]
*  Perhaps Iran can now proceed to peace and harmony in the region and I will enthusiastically [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-C4hxh0voVE&t=42.4s)]
*  encourage Israel to do the same. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-C4hxh0voVE&t=47.879999999999995s)]
