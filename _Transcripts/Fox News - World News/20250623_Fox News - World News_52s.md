# WATCH: Iran strikes Israel following weekend attack on nuclear sites #shorts #usa #iran #israel #fox
**Fox News - World News:** [June 23, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uG_DO-VsTOE)
*  I wonder how many of those countries around Iran have called to thank our U.S. president, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uG_DO-VsTOE&t=0.0s)]
*  because it provides them with safety as well. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uG_DO-VsTOE&t=5.4s)]
*  Iran and Israel are still trading strikes today as the world prepares for how Iran will [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uG_DO-VsTOE&t=8.88s)]
*  respond. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uG_DO-VsTOE&t=14.36s)]
*  Dramatic new video shows the moment a missile hit the side of the road as Iran launched [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uG_DO-VsTOE&t=15.36s)]
*  a new wave of attacks. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uG_DO-VsTOE&t=19.68s)]
*  That strike was south of Tel Aviv. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uG_DO-VsTOE&t=21.46s)]
*  And the Israeli Defense Force is responding with its own strikes in a series of attacks [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uG_DO-VsTOE&t=24.28s)]
*  that hit six Iranian airports, destroying 15 fighter jets and attack helicopters. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uG_DO-VsTOE&t=28.56s)]
*  Note the difference. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uG_DO-VsTOE&t=33.72s)]
*  Iran goes after highly populated areas, residential areas, business areas of Israel. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uG_DO-VsTOE&t=34.72s)]
*  And the United States and Israel go after their military targets and anything nuclear [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uG_DO-VsTOE&t=42.32s)]
*  at this point that we can get to. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uG_DO-VsTOE&t=46.92s)]
