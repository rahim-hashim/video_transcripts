# Trump's call with Netanyahu after Iran strikes revealed
**Fox News - World News:** [June 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvc9dpCu2A4)
*  All right, let's go straight to Peter Ducey. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvc9dpCu2A4&t=0.0s)]
*  Hi, Peter. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvc9dpCu2A4&t=2.4s)]
*  And, Martha, just as you were showing the video, the live picture, rather, of the class [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvc9dpCu2A4&t=3.4s)]
*  photo being taken, I received a text message from a White House official traveling with [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvc9dpCu2A4&t=9.4s)]
*  the president who is confirming to us now that after Saturday's strikes in Iran, the [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvc9dpCu2A4&t=13.96s)]
*  U.S. strikes on the nuclear facilities in Iran, President Trump told Benjamin Netanyahu [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvc9dpCu2A4&t=19.72s)]
*  not to expect any further American military intervention there. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvc9dpCu2A4&t=24.88s)]
*  That was on a call today that White House officials are diplomatically describing to [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvc9dpCu2A4&t=31.2s)]
*  us as exceptionally firm and direct that followed President Trump's now viral four-letter word [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvc9dpCu2A4&t=35.32s)]
*  on the South Lawn. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvc9dpCu2A4&t=43.36s)]
*  There was going to be a retaliation this morning by Israel, and they said, you got to call [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvc9dpCu2A4&t=44.36s)]
*  back the planes. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvc9dpCu2A4&t=52.08s)]
*  It's enough. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvc9dpCu2A4&t=53.08s)]
*  And they did, which I respect very greatly. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvc9dpCu2A4&t=54.28s)]
*  So nobody was killed. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvc9dpCu2A4&t=58.6s)]
*  That was the, sorry. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvc9dpCu2A4&t=59.6s)]
*  But there were a lot of planes going in the wrong direction. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvc9dpCu2A4&t=60.6s)]
*  You know that, right? [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvc9dpCu2A4&t=64.6s)]
*  When his plane, Air Force One, landed, a lot of pomp and circumstance today. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvc9dpCu2A4&t=67.4s)]
*  The president was greeted by the king and the queen ahead of what's being billed right [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvc9dpCu2A4&t=70.96s)]
*  now as a social dinner with the other NATO leaders who, according to a private text message [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvc9dpCu2A4&t=74.08s)]
*  from the NATO secretary general that President Trump screenshotted and posted online, they [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvc9dpCu2A4&t=79.88000000000001s)]
*  have all signed on to double their defense spending. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvc9dpCu2A4&t=84.12s)]
*  What do you think is Trump's motivation to publish a private conversation? [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvc9dpCu2A4&t=87.12s)]
*  I don't know, but I have absolutely no trouble. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvc9dpCu2A4&t=92.36s)]
*  The problem is that because there's nothing in it which has to stay secret. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvc9dpCu2A4&t=94.08s)]
*  And this is a bit humiliating to have to explain this exchange with your allies, isn't it? [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvc9dpCu2A4&t=97.08000000000001s)]
*  No, no, absolutely no problem. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvc9dpCu2A4&t=101.08000000000001s)]
*  No, there's nothing in it which has to stay secret. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvc9dpCu2A4&t=102.08000000000001s)]
*  President Trump is also now teasing that tomorrow he might seek changes to Article 5. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvc9dpCu2A4&t=106.8s)]
*  That is the NATO rule that requires all NATO members to jump to the defense of any member [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvc9dpCu2A4&t=111.28s)]
*  that gets attacked. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvc9dpCu2A4&t=117.88s)]
*  And that could be really tough news for NATO countries that have not been paying the minimum [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvc9dpCu2A4&t=118.88s)]
*  amount of their GDP over the last couple of years. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvc9dpCu2A4&t=124.24s)]
*  Extraordinary. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvc9dpCu2A4&t=127.56s)]
*  Peter, thank you very much. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvc9dpCu2A4&t=128.56s)]
*  Peter, do see you traveling with the president at the NATO summit in Brussels. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvc9dpCu2A4&t=130.51999999999998s)]
