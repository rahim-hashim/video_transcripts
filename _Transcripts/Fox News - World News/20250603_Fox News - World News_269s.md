# Jillian Michaels: The Olympics 'gaslit all of us'
**Fox News - World News:** [June 03, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ny1nkj1UwGI)
*  Why is the left refusing to protect young girls and all the work they put in to their moment and their competitions? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ny1nkj1UwGI&t=0.0s)]
*  I actually can't presume to have an answer. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ny1nkj1UwGI&t=12.0s)]
*  And what I find so shocking is that we all recently saw Gavin Newsom do that mea culpa to Charlie Kirk like, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ny1nkj1UwGI&t=16.0s)]
*  Yeah, I can see that this isn't really fair. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ny1nkj1UwGI&t=25.0s)]
*  Even though an equal playing field is a tent pole of sports, along with safety, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ny1nkj1UwGI&t=28.0s)]
*  which we just heard about Amain Khalif being validated yet again as being a biological male in boxing. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ny1nkj1UwGI&t=34.0s)]
*  So it's not just an equal playing field, but it's safety concerns. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ny1nkj1UwGI&t=42.0s)]
*  I don't know. And what I will simply say is it's not leadership, it's cowardice. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ny1nkj1UwGI&t=45.0s)]
*  And the fact that he has admitted it makes him absolutely complicit in any hope of plausible deniability has gone out the window, which is despicable and infuriating. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ny1nkj1UwGI&t=50.0s)]
*  Now, Jillian, citing these tests given by that International Boxing Association, to your point, you know, that's the International Olympic Committee. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ny1nkj1UwGI&t=61.0s)]
*  They do recognize in 2023, Three Wire Sports is reporting that in chromosome tests given amid the International Boxing Association's 2022-2023 World Championships, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ny1nkj1UwGI&t=70.0s)]
*  Amain Khalif's DNA showed XY markers with male karyotypes. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ny1nkj1UwGI&t=83.0s)]
*  Now, this person won the gold, as you said, in women's boxing in 2024. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ny1nkj1UwGI&t=89.0s)]
*  Of course, said I'm not transgender. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ny1nkj1UwGI&t=93.0s)]
*  It's a lot of legal gobbledygook there, but come on. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ny1nkj1UwGI&t=95.0s)]
*  Come on, Jillian. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ny1nkj1UwGI&t=100.0s)]
*  This is the most offensive for the following reasons. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ny1nkj1UwGI&t=103.0s)]
*  Number one, I'm not transgender, which means I'm not even on puberty blockers and cross-sex hormones, which makes this individual far more dangerous in a combat sport. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ny1nkj1UwGI&t=106.0s)]
*  It's arguably the highest level of achievement in sports, a gold medal that you have stripped away from the women that have been studying or training their entire lives for this moment. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ny1nkj1UwGI&t=116.0s)]
*  And the fact that the Olympics actually gaslit all of us who had eyes. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ny1nkj1UwGI&t=129.0s)]
*  I could sit here and explain to you what that means. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ny1nkj1UwGI&t=134.0s)]
*  XY chromosomes, XY karyotypes. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ny1nkj1UwGI&t=137.0s)]
*  I own a sports medicine facility, but do you need me to? [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ny1nkj1UwGI&t=139.0s)]
*  Or do your eyes tell you that something is not right here? [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ny1nkj1UwGI&t=142.0s)]
*  And I used to be so much softer and so much more empathetic, but I am sick and tired of this. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ny1nkj1UwGI&t=146.0s)]
*  Enough is enough. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ny1nkj1UwGI&t=153.0s)]
*  We are done seeing women get their face bashed in in a boxing ring on an international stage. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ny1nkj1UwGI&t=155.0s)]
*  And you know what? If the Democrats want to go down with this ship, I would say let them. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ny1nkj1UwGI&t=162.0s)]
*  But how many more women are going to suffer while that ship sinks? [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ny1nkj1UwGI&t=166.0s)]
*  And I just keep thinking, Jillian, back to my old days playing field hockey and softball. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ny1nkj1UwGI&t=171.0s)]
*  And there was another incident where I guess there was a trans athlete playing women's softball as a pitcher the other day. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ny1nkj1UwGI&t=176.0s)]
*  And I thought to myself, wow, I mean, I was a pitcher, probably wouldn't have had that spot on the team. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ny1nkj1UwGI&t=185.0s)]
*  And I was a center fielder, probably wouldn't have had that spot on the team. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ny1nkj1UwGI&t=191.0s)]
*  You know, if the situation were different and the year was different. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ny1nkj1UwGI&t=194.0s)]
*  And that's just the sisterhood of sports for women's sports and girls sports. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ny1nkj1UwGI&t=198.0s)]
*  Those are still among some of my best friends still. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ny1nkj1UwGI&t=204.0s)]
*  And that changes it. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ny1nkj1UwGI&t=207.0s)]
*  It completely changes it. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ny1nkj1UwGI&t=210.0s)]
*  And again, this is not about disrespecting people who are trans people who are trans. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ny1nkj1UwGI&t=213.0s)]
*  I will say this again for the hundredth time deserve respect and to live dignified lives. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ny1nkj1UwGI&t=221.0s)]
*  This is about fairness and this is about safety. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ny1nkj1UwGI&t=226.0s)]
*  Inclusion comes second to those two things in sports. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ny1nkj1UwGI&t=230.0s)]
*  Period. End of story. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ny1nkj1UwGI&t=234.0s)]
*  This needs to stop. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ny1nkj1UwGI&t=236.0s)]
*  And I used to sit there and list all of the studies that would show what you already know, that biological males are physically superior. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ny1nkj1UwGI&t=238.0s)]
*  Period. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ny1nkj1UwGI&t=248.0s)]
*  And it is just time for this to end. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ny1nkj1UwGI&t=249.0s)]
*  And I am grateful that Trump is using the fines to go after California and teach them a lesson once and for all. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ny1nkj1UwGI&t=251.0s)]
*  Jillian, always great to spend time. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ny1nkj1UwGI&t=257.0s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ny1nkj1UwGI&t=259.0s)]
