# Iran retaliates with attack on US air base in Qatar #shorts #iran #israel #usa #world #worldnews
**Fox News - World News:** [June 23, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVchkyawDW8)
*  Let's get right to the Pentagon. Jennifer Griffin, you've got some new information. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVchkyawDW8&t=0.0s)]
*  Well, Sandra, I think it's pretty clear at this point that the U.S. intelligence and the [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVchkyawDW8&t=3.84s)]
*  intelligence that was shared with the United States and with the Pentagon indicated that this [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVchkyawDW8&t=8.32s)]
*  strike was likely and even the timing of the strike. I think it's no coincidence that the [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVchkyawDW8&t=13.36s)]
*  defense secretary and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs were in the Situation Room when this began. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVchkyawDW8&t=18.16s)]
*  They've been monitoring it. They've been monitoring the air interception, as well as [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVchkyawDW8&t=23.36s)]
*  whether any U.S. personnel have been injured or killed, which we can report none have. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVchkyawDW8&t=28.8s)]
*  The statement from Qatar, I think, is significant in saying that we reassure everyone that Qatar's [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVchkyawDW8&t=35.04s)]
*  air defenses successfully thwarted the attack and intercepted the Iranian missiles. And, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVchkyawDW8&t=43.04s)]
*  quote, we can confirm that no injuries or human casualties resulted. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVchkyawDW8&t=48.72s)]
