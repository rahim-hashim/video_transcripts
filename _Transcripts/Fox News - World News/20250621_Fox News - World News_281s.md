# Trump hits Iran ‘HARD’: ‘There was no off ramp for diplomacy’
**Fox News - World News:** [June 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esFnFJloh6c)
*  All right, we want to head to Israel on the ground. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esFnFJloh6c&t=0.0s)]
*  I just want to reiterate, this is a huge moment in that President Donald Trump has authorized [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esFnFJloh6c&t=2.2s)]
*  and the U.S. military has just pulled off strikes inside Iran at three different nuclear [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esFnFJloh6c&t=7.68s)]
*  sites, Fordow, Natanz and Esfahan. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esFnFJloh6c&t=14.08s)]
*  The word coming from President Trump's truth social that the planes, the bombers were outside [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esFnFJloh6c&t=17.16s)]
*  of Iranian airspace, that the payload of bombs was dropped on the primary site, Fordow, as [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esFnFJloh6c&t=23.22s)]
*  you look at the map there. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esFnFJloh6c&t=29.24s)]
*  I want to go live on the ground to Trey Yengst, chief foreign correspondent about reaction [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esFnFJloh6c&t=30.52s)]
*  there on the ground, what the Israelis are saying, plus what you think this fallout may [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esFnFJloh6c&t=36.879999999999995s)]
*  be. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esFnFJloh6c&t=41.239999999999995s)]
*  Yeah, Brett, good evening. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esFnFJloh6c&t=42.239999999999995s)]
*  This has been the talk of Israel for the past several days as the country waited to see [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esFnFJloh6c&t=45.04s)]
*  if the Americans would get directly involved in the conflict. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esFnFJloh6c&t=49.06s)]
*  And even up in the last few hours, I was talking with current and former sources, trying to [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esFnFJloh6c&t=52.68s)]
*  get an understanding of when this might happen. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esFnFJloh6c&t=57.279999999999994s)]
*  And at 1 55 local time, one source said, rumors, Trump gave the word supposed to be happening [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esFnFJloh6c&t=59.199999999999996s)]
*  now. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esFnFJloh6c&t=65.2s)]
*  We were working on tracking it down and the president taking to true social to say the [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esFnFJloh6c&t=66.2s)]
*  Americans did indeed strike three separate Iranian nuclear facilities, including the [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esFnFJloh6c&t=70.47999999999999s)]
*  Fordow nuclear facility deep underground outside of the Iranian capital of Tehran. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esFnFJloh6c&t=75.6s)]
*  The bottom line here is that people are talking about enrichment. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esFnFJloh6c&t=81.14s)]
*  They understand that this decision was made because the Iranians were increasing their [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esFnFJloh6c&t=84.72000000000001s)]
*  uranium enrichment capabilities and increasing the purity closer and closer to weapons grade [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esFnFJloh6c&t=88.92s)]
*  material. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esFnFJloh6c&t=94.04s)]
*  And the concern was that the Iranian regime was just weeks away from being able to build [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esFnFJloh6c&t=95.04s)]
*  a nuclear bomb. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esFnFJloh6c&t=99.88000000000001s)]
*  We've seen over the past nine days, the country has the ability to strike major population [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esFnFJloh6c&t=101.16000000000001s)]
*  centers here in Israel with ballistic missiles. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esFnFJloh6c&t=106.08000000000001s)]
*  So you can imagine that having a nuclear warhead that could ultimately be attached to a ballistic [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esFnFJloh6c&t=108.78s)]
*  missile would clearly be a direct threat to the Jewish state. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esFnFJloh6c&t=113.1s)]
*  And that was why the Israelis said that they made the decision to start these strikes against [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esFnFJloh6c&t=116.6s)]
*  Iranian nuclear facilities and against top IRGC officials. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esFnFJloh6c&t=121.02s)]
*  And clearly tonight, President Trump ordering these strikes against the Iranian regime's [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esFnFJloh6c&t=125.02s)]
*  nuclear program because there was no off ramp for diplomacy at this point. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esFnFJloh6c&t=129.26s)]
*  There was that 60 day window that President Trump gave the Iranians to come to the table. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esFnFJloh6c&t=134.29999999999998s)]
*  Five rounds of conversations, most of them taking place in Oman. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esFnFJloh6c&t=139.01999999999998s)]
*  With Steve Witkoff, President Trump's Middle East envoy, other top American officials [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esFnFJloh6c&t=142.8s)]
*  meeting directly and indirectly with their Iranian counterparts. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esFnFJloh6c&t=147.02s)]
*  But the Iranians did not want to finish a deal. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esFnFJloh6c&t=150.72s)]
*  And ultimately the decision was made by Israel to launch this operation that has led to a [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esFnFJloh6c&t=153.68s)]
*  war developing between the two countries. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esFnFJloh6c&t=157.9s)]
*  And then again, tonight, the Americans getting directly involved launching these strikes [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esFnFJloh6c&t=160.72000000000003s)]
*  with those bombers over Iranian territory. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esFnFJloh6c&t=164.68s)]
*  We will certainly learn more information as daylight comes tomorrow in the region. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esFnFJloh6c&t=167.42000000000002s)]
*  But the bottom line here is that a decision was made that will change the reality of the [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esFnFJloh6c&t=172.79999999999998s)]
*  current war between Israel and Iran and possibly create a scenario where the Iranians really [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esFnFJloh6c&t=177.12s)]
*  have no other option than to give in. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esFnFJloh6c&t=182.39999999999998s)]
*  Because the president has hit them so hard with these strikes and the Israelis are continuing [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esFnFJloh6c&t=185.04s)]
*  to take out their top military leadership that the country is in a state of disarray. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esFnFJloh6c&t=190.16s)]
*  And so the bottom line here is that these strikes tonight show not only solidarity with [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esFnFJloh6c&t=195.51999999999998s)]
*  in the Middle East, Israel, but also they show that the region is at a crossroads here. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esFnFJloh6c&t=200.76s)]
*  There are clear decisions that will have to be made by the regime officials that are still [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esFnFJloh6c&t=205.32s)]
*  alive and by the country's supreme leader and the country's president, Massoud Pesosky. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esFnFJloh6c&t=208.95999999999998s)]
*  And so certainly more hours ahead, we will learn that information. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esFnFJloh6c&t=214.07999999999998s)]
*  But again, the bottom line tonight is that the decision was made by President Trump to [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esFnFJloh6c&t=217.56s)]
*  take out, in effect, these nuclear facilities that the Iranians were using to enrich uranium [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esFnFJloh6c&t=222.2s)]
*  closer and closer to weapons grade material. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esFnFJloh6c&t=227.28s)]
*  You might remember back during the nuclear deal that President Trump pulled out of in [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esFnFJloh6c&t=229.88s)]
*  2018, the Iranians were enriching uranium at 3.67 percent. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esFnFJloh6c&t=233.56s)]
*  According to the International Atomic Energy Agency, they were enriching uranium close [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esFnFJloh6c&t=238.68s)]
*  to 60 percent purity, getting very, very close to a weapons grade purity, which would give [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esFnFJloh6c&t=243.18s)]
*  them the component that they would need to create a nuclear weapon. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esFnFJloh6c&t=249.14s)]
*  And so this is a historic moment in the Middle East tonight and again, an opportunity for [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esFnFJloh6c&t=252.58s)]
*  the region as the president laid out in his statement for peace in the future, because [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esFnFJloh6c&t=257.38s)]
*  this is a region that understands peace through strength. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esFnFJloh6c&t=262.02000000000004s)]
*  Brett. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esFnFJloh6c&t=265.3s)]
*  Yes, that's definitely true. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esFnFJloh6c&t=266.3s)]
*  I try to stand by. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esFnFJloh6c&t=267.86s)]
