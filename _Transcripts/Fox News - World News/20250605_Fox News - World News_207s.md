# China called out amid Trump’s steel and aluminum tariffs
**Fox News - World News:** [June 05, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hiGjYe1HFE)
*  There is probably the lion's share of steel and aluminum comes to the United States from [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hiGjYe1HFE&t=0.0s)]
*  Canada and not the European Union. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hiGjYe1HFE&t=5.84s)]
*  Here's the statistics. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hiGjYe1HFE&t=7.96s)]
*  Steel, we import $7.1 billion worth from Canada every year. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hiGjYe1HFE&t=9.8s)]
*  Aluminum, $9.4 billion. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hiGjYe1HFE&t=15.56s)]
*  From the EU, $7 billion in steel and $1.5 billion in aluminum. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hiGjYe1HFE&t=18.36s)]
*  Premier, I don't know if you heard those statistics now that we've got you back, but it would [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hiGjYe1HFE&t=23.080000000000002s)]
*  seem that the lion's share of steel and aluminum coming into this country comes from Canada. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hiGjYe1HFE&t=28.08s)]
*  So while you make the case that this could hurt American consumers in terms of price [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hiGjYe1HFE&t=32.879999999999995s)]
*  increases, this could also really hurt Canada unless they hurry up and get a deal done. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hiGjYe1HFE&t=37.12s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hiGjYe1HFE&t=42.08s)]
*  Yeah, no, it could hurt both sides of the border. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hiGjYe1HFE&t=43.08s)]
*  If you add up the aluminum and steel, it's a $15 billion tax on the backs of Americans. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hiGjYe1HFE&t=46.239999999999995s)]
*  The costs are going up by 16% right across the US on any steel products. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hiGjYe1HFE&t=51.68s)]
*  And it's unfortunate. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hiGjYe1HFE&t=58.08s)]
*  We actually buy $30 billion of steel and aluminum off the US and vice versa. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hiGjYe1HFE&t=60.8s)]
*  The trade's pretty equal there. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hiGjYe1HFE&t=68.2s)]
*  But what I believe in, we should be creating an environment to create 250,000 new steel [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hiGjYe1HFE&t=70.24s)]
*  and aluminum jobs between Canada and the US. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hiGjYe1HFE&t=77.92s)]
*  The problem we're facing, both countries, is one culprit, and that's called China. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hiGjYe1HFE&t=81.52s)]
*  China is shipping in steel through the US with a different type of flag on it, and it's [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hiGjYe1HFE&t=86.64s)]
*  costing American and Canadian jobs. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hiGjYe1HFE&t=91.8s)]
*  Our trade on steel and aluminum is $30 billion either way. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hiGjYe1HFE&t=94.67999999999999s)]
*  But this is just going to be an additional tax on the backs of Americans, $15 billion [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hiGjYe1HFE&t=100.08s)]
*  worth of steel. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hiGjYe1HFE&t=106.44s)]
*  We're just going to start on-shoring all the products. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hiGjYe1HFE&t=107.44s)]
*  And you're just going to be- [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hiGjYe1HFE&t=109.76s)]
*  I was just going to say that your counterpart, Daniel Smith, the premier of Alberta, says [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hiGjYe1HFE&t=112.0s)]
*  that there are US concerns about China back-dooring steel through Canada. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hiGjYe1HFE&t=117.48s)]
*  So again, the point is made, it would be in the interests of everybody. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hiGjYe1HFE&t=122.04s)]
*  She's hopeful it'll get done too before the G7 and Cananaskis, which is coming up. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hiGjYe1HFE&t=126.6s)]
*  You get a deal, you rewrite the USMCA, which shows that tariffs are off on most goods right [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hiGjYe1HFE&t=131.84s)]
*  now, with the exception of cars and steel and aluminum and timber as well. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hiGjYe1HFE&t=138.0s)]
*  Just let's level the playing field and just get the job done. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hiGjYe1HFE&t=142.51999999999998s)]
*  I agree. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hiGjYe1HFE&t=146.16s)]
*  You know something, John, I wish I could be down there right now getting the deal done [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hiGjYe1HFE&t=147.16s)]
*  with the president. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hiGjYe1HFE&t=151.72s)]
*  I have all the confidence in the prime minister is going to strike a deal. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hiGjYe1HFE&t=153.2s)]
*  So let's get it done and start reducing these tariffs. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hiGjYe1HFE&t=157.16s)]
*  I believe in the Amcan fortress, American-Canadian fortress, that's what we need to do. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hiGjYe1HFE&t=161.23999999999998s)]
*  The last thing I want to do is start shipping our critical minerals and our aluminum and [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hiGjYe1HFE&t=167.04s)]
*  other commodities we have around the world. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hiGjYe1HFE&t=172.88s)]
*  I want to send it down to our closest friend and allies. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hiGjYe1HFE&t=175.6s)]
*  I love the US, I love the American people, and we have to move quick on this. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hiGjYe1HFE&t=179.2s)]
*  It's absolutely critical for both countries. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hiGjYe1HFE&t=184.8s)]
*  Why can't we all just get along? [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hiGjYe1HFE&t=187.88s)]
*  Premier, good of you to join us. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hiGjYe1HFE&t=189.36s)]
*  Thanks very much. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hiGjYe1HFE&t=190.36s)]
