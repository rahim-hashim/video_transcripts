# BREAKING: Iran launches another round of missiles before ceasefire begins
**Fox News - World News:** [June 23, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HF4TeEGg2d0)
*  Hey, Trace, yeah, with the ceasefire set to begin between Israel and Iran, seems like [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HF4TeEGg2d0&t=0.0s)]
*  Iran wants to get in its last legs. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HF4TeEGg2d0&t=5.6000000000000005s)]
*  Just a few minutes ago, we got word that ballistic missiles were launched from Iran. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HF4TeEGg2d0&t=7.92s)]
*  We heard the sirens blare here in Tel Aviv. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HF4TeEGg2d0&t=13.700000000000001s)]
*  And then it turns out there is at least one impact to the south of us, near the town of [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HF4TeEGg2d0&t=17.32s)]
*  Beersheba, in a residential area. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HF4TeEGg2d0&t=21.56s)]
*  There is damage to the buildings there, but so far, no reports of injuries. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HF4TeEGg2d0&t=24.68s)]
*  Meanwhile, Israel had a very busy day on Monday as well. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HF4TeEGg2d0&t=30.28s)]
*  Symbols of the Iranian regime took a pounding in Tehran, including the notorious Evin Prison, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HF4TeEGg2d0&t=34.56s)]
*  which houses political prisoners under terrible conditions. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HF4TeEGg2d0&t=40.2s)]
*  Iran's air power got another once over. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HF4TeEGg2d0&t=43.760000000000005s)]
*  Six different air bases struck by Israel, Iranian fighter jets and helicopters destroyed. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HF4TeEGg2d0&t=45.6s)]
*  Two days after those US B-2s dropped those bunker busting bombs on the Fordow nuclear [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HF4TeEGg2d0&t=51.800000000000004s)]
*  facility, Israeli fighter jets tried to finish things off, knocking out access routes to [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HF4TeEGg2d0&t=57.72s)]
*  the badly damaged complex. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HF4TeEGg2d0&t=63.36s)]
*  Iran earlier today was also busy, dramatic footage showing an Iranian missile narrowly [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HF4TeEGg2d0&t=65.84s)]
*  missing a highway. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HF4TeEGg2d0&t=71.24000000000001s)]
*  It was targeting an industrial area, an energy center in Israel's south, and Tehran launched [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HF4TeEGg2d0&t=72.24000000000001s)]
*  seven drones on their way to northern Israel. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HF4TeEGg2d0&t=78.52s)]
*  All were shot down on either side of the border by Israeli jets. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HF4TeEGg2d0&t=81.6s)]
*  But again, trace a little bit of action in the past half hour here. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HF4TeEGg2d0&t=86.64s)]
*  Some impacts, a sign that Iran is not going to go down easily, but within this timeframe [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HF4TeEGg2d0&t=90.84s)]
*  of this ceasefire process, and I think everybody here in Israel is hoping this ceasefire goes [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HF4TeEGg2d0&t=97.75999999999999s)]
*  forward, including all those people that once they hear the sirens have to run to those [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HF4TeEGg2d0&t=104.56s)]
*  bomb shelters once, twice, maybe three times a day. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HF4TeEGg2d0&t=109.36s)]
*  Back to you. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HF4TeEGg2d0&t=112.52s)]
*  Greg Palca, we'll get back to you as the news warrants. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HF4TeEGg2d0&t=113.52000000000001s)]
*  Live for us in Tel Aviv. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HF4TeEGg2d0&t=116.0s)]
