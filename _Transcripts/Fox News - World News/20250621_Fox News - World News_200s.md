# WATCH: Netanyahu responds to the US strike on Iran
**Fox News - World News:** [June 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKM-3b6JDf8)
*  addressing the nation. We go back to Trey Yankst. He is in Israel tonight. I would expect, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKM-3b6JDf8&t=0.0s)]
*  as we head into dawn, that Prime Minister Netanyahu will be addressing his nation, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKM-3b6JDf8&t=5.76s)]
*  probably in the early morning hours. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKM-3b6JDf8&t=11.120000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, Sean, absolutely. We're witnessing a historic moment in the Middle East right now [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKM-3b6JDf8&t=15.120000000000001s)]
*  that has a real chance to change the status quo for the region. And Israeli Prime Minister [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKM-3b6JDf8&t=19.36s)]
*  Benjamin Netanyahu has just released his first remarks following the American strikes against [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKM-3b6JDf8&t=23.84s)]
*  Iranian nuclear facilities. He says tonight, President Trump and the U.S. acted with a lot [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKM-3b6JDf8&t=29.759999999999998s)]
*  of strength. President Trump, I thank you. The people of Israel, thank you. He goes on to talk [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKM-3b6JDf8&t=34.72s)]
*  about the close coordination between the Americans and the Israelis. But we just heard from President [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKM-3b6JDf8&t=40.08s)]
*  Trump there speaking at the White House, and he made clear what he has effectively done, Sean, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKM-3b6JDf8&t=45.28s)]
*  is taking away Iran's leverage in any sort of conversations moving forward. Because remember, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKM-3b6JDf8&t=51.12s)]
*  Iran had two key levers to pull. They had their ballistic missile program that has been largely [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKM-3b6JDf8&t=56.8s)]
*  decimated by Israeli strikes, and they had their nuclear program that has been largely decimated [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKM-3b6JDf8&t=61.68s)]
*  by American strikes. And tonight, the region is in a new place. There is a new path forward, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKM-3b6JDf8&t=66.88s)]
*  and President Trump is giving the Iranians yet another chance to step back from what would be [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKM-3b6JDf8&t=72.08s)]
*  more American strikes and Israeli strikes targeting what's left of IRGC leadership [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKM-3b6JDf8&t=77.44s)]
*  and what's left of the political leadership inside Iran. Now, I spoke tonight with an Israeli [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKM-3b6JDf8&t=82.64s)]
*  security source asking what the mood was like in the security echelon here in Israel. That source [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKM-3b6JDf8&t=87.12s)]
*  said everyone is just repeating, God bless America, God bless President Trump. They describe this as [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKM-3b6JDf8&t=93.28s)]
*  euphoria and historic for these officials, saying there is a sense of relief. Remember, the Israelis [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKM-3b6JDf8&t=99.03999999999999s)]
*  largely considered Iran as the big war that they would face. The past nine days have been incredibly [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKM-3b6JDf8&t=104.96s)]
*  difficult for the Israeli people as they've come under ballistic missile fire following the launch [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKM-3b6JDf8&t=110.0s)]
*  of this Israeli operation against those nuclear sites and against top nuclear scientists inside of [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKM-3b6JDf8&t=115.19999999999999s)]
*  Iran. But tonight, the region has changed. The nuclear sites have been largely destroyed, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKM-3b6JDf8&t=121.03999999999999s)]
*  according to President Trump. There still is a minor threat of ballistic missile fire, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKM-3b6JDf8&t=127.11999999999999s)]
*  but we understand that tonight Israel remains on high alert. They are entering into a new state [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKM-3b6JDf8&t=131.6s)]
*  of emergency, changing the Home Front Command guidelines for the civilian population here of [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKM-3b6JDf8&t=136.56s)]
*  more than nine million people, trying to limit public gatherings tomorrow, canceling workplaces [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKM-3b6JDf8&t=141.35999999999999s)]
*  and schools, understanding that Iran may decide to respond. But again, the latest information, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKM-3b6JDf8&t=146.48s)]
*  Sean, that we have here tonight, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reacting to these [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKM-3b6JDf8&t=152.0s)]
*  American strikes that targeted Iranian nuclear facilities, Isfahan, Natanz and Fordow, the places [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKM-3b6JDf8&t=156.4s)]
*  that the Iranians were enriching uranium, trying to get closer to weapons-grade material that they [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKM-3b6JDf8&t=163.36s)]
*  would then use in a nuclear bomb. President Trump announcing tonight from the White House those sites [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKM-3b6JDf8&t=168.08s)]
*  have been destroyed and Iran no longer has the leverage that they had just 24 hours ago going [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKM-3b6JDf8&t=173.44s)]
*  into any future conversations with the Americans or the Europeans across the world. Sean? [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKM-3b6JDf8&t=178.88s)]
*  All right, Trey Yankst in Israel tonight. We'll get back to you. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKM-3b6JDf8&t=184.08s)]
