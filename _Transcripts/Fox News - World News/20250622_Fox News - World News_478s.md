*  We congratulate President Trump and congratulate the brave American Armed Forces [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9Gi1WkmWCU&t=44.68s)]
*  Armed Forces [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9Gi1WkmWCU&t=50.04s)]

*  Iran's nuclear [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9Gi1WkmWCU&t=56.84s)]
*  Facilities this is important. This is this makes you more hopeful about the future of the region and the world in general [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9Gi1WkmWCU&t=58.96s)]
*  Thank you so much for joining us. What fears do you have over retaliation from Iran now? I [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9Gi1WkmWCU&t=65.76s)]
*  don't I woke up this morning from sirens and [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9Gi1WkmWCU&t=72.76s)]
*  Explosions next to my house and I went over there and people were hit and houses were hit [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9Gi1WkmWCU&t=77.64s)]
*  but the people of Israel are strong and [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9Gi1WkmWCU&t=82.72s)]
*  And we know what is important and therefore [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9Gi1WkmWCU&t=85.68s)]
*  We are more than willing to take what needs to be taken in order to make sure this is this is this job is done [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9Gi1WkmWCU&t=89.60000000000001s)]
*  We need to get rid of the threat of Iran as a nuclear power [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9Gi1WkmWCU&t=96.76s)]
*  This will throw the entire region into a nuclear arms race [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9Gi1WkmWCU&t=101.28s)]
*  This will throw the entire world think of it this week. Everybody's afraid of an Iranian bomb or [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9Gi1WkmWCU&t=105.0s)]
*  Iranian missile think of a terrorist with with a dirty suitcase [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9Gi1WkmWCU&t=112.08000000000001s)]
*  entering JFK or [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9Gi1WkmWCU&t=117.12s)]
*  Logan this is a threat to the world not only for Israel [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9Gi1WkmWCU&t=119.76s)]
*  It's an existential threat to Israel [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9Gi1WkmWCU&t=123.04s)]
*  But it's also a threat to the world and to United States as you know from years of watching demonstrations in Iran [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9Gi1WkmWCU&t=124.76s)]
*  The United States is big Satan and we are the small Satan. So we are we are all in this together [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9Gi1WkmWCU&t=131.24s)]
*  Mr. Lepede you said a second ago that what happened last night makes people in the region hopeful that there could be a different future [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9Gi1WkmWCU&t=137.24s)]
*  It is also the thrown a lot of uncertainty into what that future might hold if the ayatollah [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9Gi1WkmWCU&t=142.88s)]
*  Were to fall and the regime were to collapse what fills the power vacuum? [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9Gi1WkmWCU&t=148.96s)]
*  I know that Reza Pahlavi the crown prince of Iran the son of the former Shah [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9Gi1WkmWCU&t=153.48000000000002s)]
*  Would like to go in there as an interim leader the NCRI the former Mek would like to go in there and form a government [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9Gi1WkmWCU&t=159.16s)]
*  The IRGC may decide if there is no more ayatollah that they are running the country [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9Gi1WkmWCU&t=166.0s)]
*  So what what are your thoughts about what the future may hold in terms of Iran and the government there? [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9Gi1WkmWCU&t=171.44s)]
*  Well, first of all, what we have now in Iran is the worst of all possible possibilities [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9Gi1WkmWCU&t=177.72s)]
*  this this regime is a fun is a regime of fanatics and [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9Gi1WkmWCU&t=183.51999999999998s)]
*  Whatever replace, you know when when when we killed Hassan Nasrallah the leader of his by line Lebanon [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9Gi1WkmWCU&t=187.72s)]
*  Everybody said well, we don't know what's gonna happen now. I tell you what happened then [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9Gi1WkmWCU&t=193.5s)]
*  Nothing because they were not able to retaliate [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9Gi1WkmWCU&t=199.3s)]
*  So what we what if you ask me, I think the people of Iran are more than ready for a democracy [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9Gi1WkmWCU&t=202.42s)]
*  They're interesting people that cultures people. This is a culture of [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9Gi1WkmWCU&t=208.54s)]
*  6,000 years and by the way that had no conflict with us. We don't have a history of conflict with Iran [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9Gi1WkmWCU&t=212.78s)]
*  We don't have a border with Iran [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9Gi1WkmWCU&t=219.1s)]
*  the only reason there is a conflict with Iran is because this is the regime is so deeply anti-Semite and [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9Gi1WkmWCU&t=221.01999999999998s)]
*  Therefore, I think the people of Iran are more than willing now to take the future on their own hand [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9Gi1WkmWCU&t=227.42s)]
*  Let me remind you what happened in the last two decades is that the regime took billions of Iranian money [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9Gi1WkmWCU&t=232.7s)]
*  This is not a rich country and instead of building roads and hospitals and schools. It was trying to build [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9Gi1WkmWCU&t=240.82s)]
*  A nuclear nuclear industry that was eliminated in a week [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9Gi1WkmWCU&t=248.5s)]
*  So this is not a really good bargain for the people of Iran and they can get themselves a better bargain [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9Gi1WkmWCU&t=253.02s)]
*  With be becoming a democracy [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9Gi1WkmWCU&t=258.42s)]
*  So I'm hopeful for the people of Iran and for the region and for the world in general that this will be [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9Gi1WkmWCU&t=260.78000000000003s)]
*  What replaced this regime if the regime falls as you can imagine sir [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9Gi1WkmWCU&t=267.78000000000003s)]
*  There are some members of the United States Congress who are objecting to what happened last night [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9Gi1WkmWCU&t=272.44s)]
*  Including Ilhan Omar and I'd like to get your reaction to that [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9Gi1WkmWCU&t=278.16s)]
*  She tweeted that if the military strikes will not bring to peace they will only provoke more violence. They will [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9Gi1WkmWCU&t=281.4s)]
*  Destabilize the region and danger US troops and civilians. We've seen what happens when diplomacy is sidelined in favor of bombs [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9Gi1WkmWCU&t=289.4s)]
*  It only brings more death and destruction [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9Gi1WkmWCU&t=296.12s)]
*  How do you respond to those who are saying this was the wrong move [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9Gi1WkmWCU&t=299.08s)]
*  Well, where were where wait day when in October 7th? [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9Gi1WkmWCU&t=304.15999999999997s)]
*  2023 when Israel was attacked when were they were way there when when his ball [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9Gi1WkmWCU&t=309.15999999999997s)]
*  I was formed when Iran was sponsored terror all around the world [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9Gi1WkmWCU&t=314.15999999999997s)]
*  That what is is there is did the regime did anything but using force all of a sudden? [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9Gi1WkmWCU&t=317.79999999999995s)]
*  Against the use of force if you are against the use of force you have to be against the regime in Iran [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9Gi1WkmWCU&t=324.08000000000004s)]
*  Because this is the regime that brought all the terror into the region and into the world [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9Gi1WkmWCU&t=329.56s)]
*  You know when the Israeli embassy in Buenos Aires exploded by and it was brought by Iranian terrorists [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9Gi1WkmWCU&t=334.22s)]
*  Then we didn't hear nobody saying well the use of force is the problem [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9Gi1WkmWCU&t=341.40000000000003s)]
*  The problem has become is always when the United States or Israel is using force to promote democracy and freedom around the world [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9Gi1WkmWCU&t=345.48s)]
*  Sometimes if you want peace you have to get it through strengths. I think President Reagan was the one to [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9Gi1WkmWCU&t=353.64000000000004s)]
*  Say it better than anyone else if you want peace be as powerful as you can this what happened last night [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9Gi1WkmWCU&t=361.68s)]
*  The United States reminded everybody in the region who is the most powerful force in the world? [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9Gi1WkmWCU&t=367.24s)]
*  So the Secretary of State [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9Gi1WkmWCU&t=373.68s)]
*  Marco Rubio was on with Maria Bartiromo earlier today on our program and he was asked about [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9Gi1WkmWCU&t=376.0s)]
*  Whether or not negotiations could bring about some sort of settlement regarding the nuclear program in Iran's [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9Gi1WkmWCU&t=382.28000000000003s)]
*  Insistence that they want to have a civilian nuclear program to create electricity. Here's what the Secretary of State said [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9Gi1WkmWCU&t=387.48s)]
*  What they want is a civil nuclear program where they have power plants like every other kind a lot of other countries in the world [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9Gi1WkmWCU&t=394.16s)]
*  Have they can do that. That's the deal. It's been offered to them. They rejected it [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9Gi1WkmWCU&t=399.48s)]
*  Marco Rubio said that instead of having a civilian nuclear [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9Gi1WkmWCU&t=403.32000000000005s)]
*  Program for power generation that's out there in the open they hide it in a mountain [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9Gi1WkmWCU&t=407.24s)]
*  So I mean how could anybody think that they're up to any other game other than doing something in secret? [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9Gi1WkmWCU&t=411.88s)]
*  The only people who believe them are the people who really wanted to believe them [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9Gi1WkmWCU&t=416.96000000000004s)]
*  They said in order to have a civic nuclear industry [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9Gi1WkmWCU&t=421.28000000000003s)]
*  You need an enrich you need enrich who met who ran into the level of three point seventy five percent [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9Gi1WkmWCU&t=425.56s)]
*  They went all the way to sixty percent the only reason you want a sixty percent in reach to uranium is to build an atomic [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9Gi1WkmWCU&t=431.2s)]
*  bomb that what is what was [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9Gi1WkmWCU&t=439.28s)]
*  prevented in the last week and especially last night [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9Gi1WkmWCU&t=442.59999999999997s)]
*  We appreciate you joining us today, sir. Just an a monumental moment for the world. Thank you. Good to talk you sir [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9Gi1WkmWCU&t=446.76s)]
