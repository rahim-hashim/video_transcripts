# Top Iranian official 'undermines' ayatollah's claims on nuclear damage
**Fox News - World News:** [June 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcZdKqSXE9I)
*  All right, we got an alert. House lawmakers will receive a classified briefing today on [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcZdKqSXE9I&t=0.0s)]
*  the successful U.S. strikes on Tehran's nuclear program. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcZdKqSXE9I&t=5.32s)]
*  So this comes as Iran's foreign minister makes new comments on the damage to their nuclear [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcZdKqSXE9I&t=9.08s)]
*  facility. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcZdKqSXE9I&t=14.68s)]
*  So let's get right to Mike Tobin, who is live in Israel. He's in Tel Aviv. Hey, Mike. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcZdKqSXE9I&t=15.68s)]
*  Good morning, Ainsley. Good morning, gang. We're still on the mode of determining the [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcZdKqSXE9I&t=21.36s)]
*  extent of damage done to Iran's nuclear program by this 12-day war. Former U.S. Secretary [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcZdKqSXE9I&t=23.76s)]
*  of State Condoleezza Rice spoke with Brett Baer last night and said it was irresponsible [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcZdKqSXE9I&t=29.04s)]
*  to leak and publish the information from that early low-confidence intelligence report. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcZdKqSXE9I&t=33.6s)]
*  She said that the Iranian nuclear program has indeed been set back in the entire region, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcZdKqSXE9I&t=38.76s)]
*  changed by 20 months of war since October 7th. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcZdKqSXE9I&t=43.12s)]
*  When you look at what the Israelis were able to do to Hezbollah, what they were able to [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcZdKqSXE9I&t=47.2s)]
*  do to Hamas, the significant efforts against the Iranian military establishment, against [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcZdKqSXE9I&t=51.56s)]
*  scientists. This really is a now crippled Iran, and a crippled Iran is good for the [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcZdKqSXE9I&t=61.36s)]
*  region. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcZdKqSXE9I&t=67.24000000000001s)]
*  Iran's foreign minister Abbas Araq, she spoke on Iranian state TV and undermined what was [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcZdKqSXE9I&t=70.12s)]
*  said by the Grand Ayatollah. He said significant damage wasn't indeed done to Iran's nuclear [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcZdKqSXE9I&t=74.6s)]
*  program. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcZdKqSXE9I&t=79.72s)]
*  I must say that the damage is excessive and serious, but for the inspectors to visit, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcZdKqSXE9I&t=81.72s)]
*  that is a decision that must be made. And in my opinion, in accordance with the law [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcZdKqSXE9I&t=87.92s)]
*  of the parliament, the Supreme National Security Council should make this decision. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcZdKqSXE9I&t=92.32s)]
*  Araq, she also countered President Trump and said there are no plans for talks between [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcZdKqSXE9I&t=97.64s)]
*  Iranian and U.S. representatives. Now, the Guardian Council of Iran passed a measure [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcZdKqSXE9I&t=102.88s)]
*  that would ban cooperation with Iran and the U.N. nuclear watchdog, the IAEA. The director [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcZdKqSXE9I&t=108.92s)]
*  general of the IAEA says that would put Iran outside of international law. Guys, back to you. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcZdKqSXE9I&t=114.92s)]
*  So Mike, is there a sense that we might have a new Iran? Is anyone thinking that, or we [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcZdKqSXE9I&t=120.92s)]
*  just think we have a Iran that's been knocked back? [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcZdKqSXE9I&t=126.67999999999999s)]
*  Well I think it's very significant that you have the foreign minister on state TV undermining [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcZdKqSXE9I&t=132.16s)]
*  what was said by the Grand Ayatollah. You wouldn't have seen that in the past. It seems [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcZdKqSXE9I&t=136.44s)]
*  to be an evolution toward modernization if you have someone looking practically at the [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcZdKqSXE9I&t=140.52s)]
*  situation and giving an evaluation as opposed to the usual Grand Bellicose statements that [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcZdKqSXE9I&t=145.48s)]
*  you get out of Iranian leaders. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcZdKqSXE9I&t=151.04s)]
*  You know Mike, I was looking at all the Iranian activists that I follow and a lot of people [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcZdKqSXE9I&t=153.8s)]
*  pointed out how much the Ayatollah has aged just over the past, before the strike and [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcZdKqSXE9I&t=161.52s)]
*  after the strike. He doesn't look so well. Did you recognize that? [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcZdKqSXE9I&t=167.84s)]
*  I didn't really recognize that. I just noticed the fact that he didn't come out for a long [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcZdKqSXE9I&t=174.84s)]
*  time but I think that was somewhat old fashioned where you have so many people in these days [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcZdKqSXE9I&t=179.08s)]
*  of social media reacting very quickly to things. I think the Grand Ayatollah thought he had [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcZdKqSXE9I&t=184.92000000000002s)]
*  his time, he could take his time coming out to make a public statement. It took him a [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcZdKqSXE9I&t=189.64s)]
*  little while but I think that's just because he's old school. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcZdKqSXE9I&t=193.72s)]
*  Alright thanks Mike. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcZdKqSXE9I&t=197.16s)]
*  Thank you so much. Yesterday we had the press briefing at the last hour of our show. It [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcZdKqSXE9I&t=198.11999999999998s)]
*  lasted about 45 minutes with Pete Hegseth and the Joint Chiefs General Dan Raising Cane. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcZdKqSXE9I&t=202.79999999999998s)]
*  What a great name for a general. And he really outlined everything that happened. He talked [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcZdKqSXE9I&t=208.79999999999998s)]
*  about what happened at our military base in Qatar. He talked about these pilots and [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcZdKqSXE9I&t=213.84s)]
*  then we also know about the soldiers or the seamen that were in the submarine. It's incredible [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcZdKqSXE9I&t=219.88s)]
*  how this was all pulled off and with such precision. He detailed how the strike was [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcZdKqSXE9I&t=226.88s)]
*  conducted and he spoke about the emotional moment when those American pilots came back [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcZdKqSXE9I&t=230.92000000000002s)]
*  to the United States. Listen. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcZdKqSXE9I&t=236.32s)]
*  When the crews went to work on Friday they kissed their loved ones goodbye not knowing [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcZdKqSXE9I&t=239.04s)]
*  when or if they'd be home. Late on Saturday night their families became aware of what [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcZdKqSXE9I&t=243.48s)]
*  was happening. And on Sunday when those jets returned from Whiteman their families were [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcZdKqSXE9I&t=250.52s)]
*  there. Flags flying and tears flowing. I have chills literally talking about this. The jets [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcZdKqSXE9I&t=256.92s)]
*  rejoined into a formation of four airplanes followed by a formation of three and came [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcZdKqSXE9I&t=264.08000000000004s)]
*  up overhead Whiteman proudly in the traffic pattern pitching out to land right over the [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcZdKqSXE9I&t=269.2s)]
*  base and landing to the incredible cheers of their families who sacrifice and serve [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcZdKqSXE9I&t=275.44s)]
*  right alongside their family members. Like I said there were a lot of flags and a lot [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcZdKqSXE9I&t=282.36s)]
*  of tears. One commander told me this is a moment in the lives of our families that they [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcZdKqSXE9I&t=287.56s)]
*  will never forget. That my friends is what America's Joint Force does. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcZdKqSXE9I&t=293.24s)]
*  It was a patriotic moment and there was two parts of the press conference that I really [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcZdKqSXE9I&t=298.24s)]
*  enjoyed. It was the fact that he was so eloquent in how he explained the mission and we had [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcZdKqSXE9I&t=305.24s)]
*  Jack Keenan who has been a legend for a while within the military community of explaining [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcZdKqSXE9I&t=313.28000000000003s)]
*  things. He even he said I've never seen a press conference in the Pentagon that explained [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcZdKqSXE9I&t=318.64s)]
*  a mission so well. And then the second layer was having the four star as well as the Secretary [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcZdKqSXE9I&t=324.12s)]
*  of Defense praise the men and women that completed this mission giving them praise. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcZdKqSXE9I&t=332.88s)]
*  Guys I don't care what the initial report said there's a lot of damage done. There [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcZdKqSXE9I&t=339.12s)]
*  it is. And for 14 years they've been working on this. They didn't have the type of bomb [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcZdKqSXE9I&t=343.71999999999997s)]
*  when they started this and they didn't know what they were dealing with in terms of nuclear [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcZdKqSXE9I&t=348.12s)]
*  facilities. But some of these groups sympathetic to us and the West and looking to work against [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcZdKqSXE9I&t=352.03999999999996s)]
*  the Aetola some of the same groups that allowed the intelligence to flow and allowed those [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcZdKqSXE9I&t=359.64s)]
*  commanders to be killed and the CUD's force to be assassinated were able to provide detailed [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcZdKqSXE9I&t=363.52s)]
*  schemes of what Fordo looked like and what Natanz looked like. So they knew about it. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcZdKqSXE9I&t=369.71999999999997s)]
*  They worked on it. They did the prototypes. Think about this. People started this and [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcZdKqSXE9I&t=375.04s)]
*  retired during the mission just waiting to see what president and at what point we're [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcZdKqSXE9I&t=379.72s)]
*  going to actually be forced to take action. Then at the last minute he finds that they're [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcZdKqSXE9I&t=384.72s)]
*  putting cement in the shafts. So they must have figured out the way they can blow up [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcZdKqSXE9I&t=388.78000000000003s)]
*  this thing is through the shafts. So they adjusted. So they did it. There's no way this [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcZdKqSXE9I&t=393.40000000000003s)]
*  thing is not blown up. And you have the IAEA head the IAEA head says the centrifuges are [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcZdKqSXE9I&t=397.68s)]
*  definitely blown up. And Iran's foreign minister conceded that our nuclear installations have [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcZdKqSXE9I&t=404.02s)]
*  been badly damaged. So I think the issue of how much damage is not even worth discussing. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcZdKqSXE9I&t=409.02s)]
*  The courage to make the decision and where we go from here really should be where we [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcZdKqSXE9I&t=415.29999999999995s)]
*  go because the Aetola according to people that watch him they say that he's inspirational. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcZdKqSXE9I&t=419.26s)]
*  He's usually smooth. Here he was stumbling and he was not clear and he seemed to be a [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcZdKqSXE9I&t=423.46s)]
*  energy in his delivery that if we pick that up in the West. Can you imagine what the people [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcZdKqSXE9I&t=429.78s)]
*  of Iran think? And Brian real quickly to your point about they find out about that concrete [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcZdKqSXE9I&t=435.02s)]
*  that just shows you the human intelligence was so good on the ground that they even got [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcZdKqSXE9I&t=439.74s)]
*  the measurement of that concrete so our guys could adjust their plan when they blew that [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcZdKqSXE9I&t=444.74s)]
*  part off. So there were those three holes the vents and they said that Iran if you didn't [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcZdKqSXE9I&t=451.34s)]
*  the press conference yesterday covered them up with cement. Our first strike blew off [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcZdKqSXE9I&t=458.1s)]
*  that cement and then they were able to shoot number two number three number four number [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcZdKqSXE9I&t=462.98s)]
*  five down into that center hole and they said destroy the nuclear facility and Donald Trump [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcZdKqSXE9I&t=467.38s)]
*  said if Iran attempts to repair their nuclear program again that the U.S. will not hesitate [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcZdKqSXE9I&t=473.34000000000003s)]
*  to just launch another strike. And then Senator John Kennedy said and if Tehran tries to do [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcZdKqSXE9I&t=478.46000000000004s)]
*  that then Israel will know their intelligence is incredible. They're watching everything [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcZdKqSXE9I&t=483.7s)]
*  on the ground and they know what's happening. Although there were 700 executions in Iran [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcZdKqSXE9I&t=489.1s)]
*  by people that they say were spies including some they said three Mossad agents. I don't [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcZdKqSXE9I&t=492.74s)]
*  know if this true but it's you would think that they would be trying to get to the bottom [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcZdKqSXE9I&t=497.02s)]
*  of it. The other thing was the foreign ministers going to China. Right. He wants to a sad but [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcZdKqSXE9I&t=500.82s)]
*  you know China left him. You know they buy the oil but they didn't do anything to defend [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcZdKqSXE9I&t=505.18s)]
*  him. We have to think about what if China starts coming in with nuclear components of [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcZdKqSXE9I&t=508.42s)]
*  a nuclear program all in North Korea. Do we stop those ships in the Persian Gulf. It's [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcZdKqSXE9I&t=511.82s)]
*  going to be a big debate. Remember China sent in the five the five airplanes into Iran right [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcZdKqSXE9I&t=516.18s)]
*  before this strike. What were they doing there. What were they taking with them. That's right. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcZdKqSXE9I&t=520.9399999999999s)]
*  Those are some of the questions. But the secretary of state said he believes it was people. So [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcZdKqSXE9I&t=525.5s)]
*  I'm just saying that's what Marco Rubio said because I think they were getting people out. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcZdKqSXE9I&t=529.74s)]
