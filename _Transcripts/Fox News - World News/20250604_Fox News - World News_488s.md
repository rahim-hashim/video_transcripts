# Putin getting 'desperate' as Ukraine launches new 'extraordinary' attack
**Fox News - World News:** [June 04, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wIk-FMsXb8)
*  Ukraine with another offensive attack on Russia, this time damaging a key bridge linking Russia [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wIk-FMsXb8&t=0.0s)]
*  to Crimea, the only bridge with massive underwater explosives. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wIk-FMsXb8&t=7.0600000000000005s)]
*  This coming after Sunday's massive drone attack against Russian warplanes, which was 117 drones [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wIk-FMsXb8&t=11.68s)]
*  that were hidden, and a second round of peace talks ending with no major breakthrough. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wIk-FMsXb8&t=17.86s)]
*  In fact, it lasted about an hour where essentially Vladimir Putin says, why did you just surrender? [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wIk-FMsXb8&t=21.98s)]
*  Joining us now is the former Secretary of State, National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wIk-FMsXb8&t=27.06s)]
*  Great to see you, Madam Secretary. Thanks so much for putting us on your hit list. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wIk-FMsXb8&t=31.34s)]
*  It's a pleasure. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wIk-FMsXb8&t=34.339999999999996s)]
*  Your thoughts about what Ukraine has done over the last four days. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wIk-FMsXb8&t=35.14s)]
*  Well, it's extraordinary. I read the word audacious. I think that's exactly right. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wIk-FMsXb8&t=38.58s)]
*  But it shows a couple of things. First, the changing nature of warfare, that you can do this with relatively cheap drones. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wIk-FMsXb8&t=43.019999999999996s)]
*  $2,000 drone? [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wIk-FMsXb8&t=48.86s)]
*  Exactly. Against the Russian strategic air fleet, which has caused billions and billions of dollars. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wIk-FMsXb8&t=49.78s)]
*  Secondly, it shows that the Ukrainians are very advanced in what they are doing in their defense industry [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wIk-FMsXb8&t=56.46s)]
*  with the building of these drones and an employment strategy for them. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wIk-FMsXb8&t=62.3s)]
*  And third, it is an incredible intelligence coup. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wIk-FMsXb8&t=66.1s)]
*  Vladimir Putin is undoubtedly now wondering whether there was an inside job. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wIk-FMsXb8&t=69.58s)]
*  You're probably going to see a witch hunt in Russia as he tries to figure out who did this inside. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wIk-FMsXb8&t=74.74s)]
*  So it just shows that just with a little bit of help, the Ukrainians can make Vladimir Putin pay for his aggression. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wIk-FMsXb8&t=80.82000000000001s)]
*  So where would you go from here if you're President Trump and Marco Rubio, the Secretary of State? [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wIk-FMsXb8&t=90.82000000000001s)]
*  Because they just came out with a casualty number. So far, three years, 1.4 million casualties, most of which are Russians, two-thirds are Russian. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wIk-FMsXb8&t=95.62s)]
*  And they've lost 250,000 deaths. So dead or wounded? [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wIk-FMsXb8&t=104.82000000000001s)]
*  Well, let me say first, the president was absolutely right to try and stop this war. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wIk-FMsXb8&t=108.38s)]
*  It's a horrible war. A lot of civilian casualties as well, mostly on the Ukrainian side because of the way the Russians are fighting. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wIk-FMsXb8&t=114.38s)]
*  But Vladimir Putin has had 900,000 casualties is the number that's out there. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wIk-FMsXb8&t=122.38s)]
*  And I'll tell you, Ryan, they're not the blond boys from Moscow and St. Petersburg. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wIk-FMsXb8&t=127.38s)]
*  These are poor kids from Dagestan and Khabarovsk. And he'll just keep throwing unarmed young men at the front. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wIk-FMsXb8&t=132.29999999999998s)]
*  So hopefully they can get a ceasefire. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wIk-FMsXb8&t=139.29999999999998s)]
*  But this also shows that the Ukrainians can hold at risk things that Putin cares about. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wIk-FMsXb8&t=142.29999999999998s)]
*  And that, more than anything, will eventually get him to the table. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wIk-FMsXb8&t=148.3s)]
*  What about the flowing of American arms, which Ukraine says they can buy now? [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wIk-FMsXb8&t=151.3s)]
*  They want more patriots. They want armaments, artillery that only we can give. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wIk-FMsXb8&t=155.3s)]
*  What kind of message would that be to Vladimir Putin? Because Joe Biden was worried about escalation constantly. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wIk-FMsXb8&t=160.22s)]
*  Well, and if we had given them everything at the beginning of the war, when the Russians thought this war was going to take five days, they might have won outright. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wIk-FMsXb8&t=164.22s)]
*  So I would urge that if these talks are going nowhere, if Vladimir Putin is playing along, hoping that he can just keep this war, this kind of 19th century war going, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wIk-FMsXb8&t=172.22s)]
*  that we will help the Ukrainians, let them buy the weapons, and let them buy the weapons from us and from Europe. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wIk-FMsXb8&t=185.14s)]
*  So do you believe that the Russians have been sincere at all to this point in the negotiations? [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wIk-FMsXb8&t=191.14s)]
*  Well, I do think there's a little part of Vladimir Putin that recognizes, particularly that the energy infrastructure in Russia is degrading, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wIk-FMsXb8&t=196.14s)]
*  and that he would be better off to stop this war. But it's being overcome by that other Putin who still thinks he can extinguish Ukraine. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wIk-FMsXb8&t=204.14s)]
*  And he needs the president more than the president needs him. And so making very clear to him that he's not going to get his maximalist claims is extremely important at this point. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wIk-FMsXb8&t=214.05999999999997s)]
*  You knew him for a long time. Real quick, I want to get to Iran. But is he the same guy you dealt with? Does he seem to be the same guy? [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wIk-FMsXb8&t=226.05999999999997s)]
*  Well, he seems to be more out of control than he used to be. He was always a very controlled figure. Don't get me wrong. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wIk-FMsXb8&t=233.98s)]
*  He was never a Jeffersonian Democrat. He was always an autocrat. He was always an imperialist. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wIk-FMsXb8&t=241.98s)]
*  But there is something about him now that seems almost more desperate in wanting to extinguish Ukraine. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wIk-FMsXb8&t=247.98s)]
*  Iran evidently is mulling over an opportunity to gradually go to zero enrichment when it comes to the nuclear program. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wIk-FMsXb8&t=256.9s)]
*  What would you demand from Iran? And do you believe at all they are serious in getting rid of the nuclear program in order to get rid of sanctions? [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wIk-FMsXb8&t=264.9s)]
*  First thing, remember, there's only one decision-maker. That's the Ayatollah. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wIk-FMsXb8&t=273.9s)]
*  He's 85 now. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wIk-FMsXb8&t=278.82s)]
*  That's right. But he's the decision-maker. Whoever you're talking to at the table, you can't really trust that that is the Iranian position. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wIk-FMsXb8&t=280.82s)]
*  I do think it was a good thing again to try to test the waters with the Iranians. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wIk-FMsXb8&t=287.82s)]
*  Remember, I was the one who created as secretary the P5 plus 1, the negotiating structure with the Iranians. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wIk-FMsXb8&t=292.82s)]
*  So fine to test the waters. But no enrichment. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wIk-FMsXb8&t=299.82s)]
*  Because enrichment is, once you've solved the science, it's only a matter of time until you get to pure enough uranium to fuel a weapon. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wIk-FMsXb8&t=303.74s)]
*  So no enrichment. Turn over that fuel that you have already made. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wIk-FMsXb8&t=312.74s)]
*  And by the way, never think about trying to put together bomb design, fuel and delivery vehicle. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wIk-FMsXb8&t=317.74s)]
*  And the Iranians are in a weakened position right now. This is the time to have a kind of maximalist claim. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wIk-FMsXb8&t=324.74s)]
*  I will say, I read in the papers the administration is going to give up on this. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wIk-FMsXb8&t=331.66s)]
*  I never believe that you should try to speculate on what's going on inside. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wIk-FMsXb8&t=336.66s)]
*  I've been inside. I can remember getting up in the morning and seeing the newspapers. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wIk-FMsXb8&t=341.66s)]
*  The Bush administration should stop Iran from enriching. I think, why didn't I think of that? [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wIk-FMsXb8&t=345.66s)]
*  Right. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wIk-FMsXb8&t=351.66s)]
*  So we should be careful about speculating what the administration is thinking. But zero enrichment would be my view. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wIk-FMsXb8&t=352.66s)]
*  You're in Stanford University teaching a course you understand about college. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wIk-FMsXb8&t=360.58000000000004s)]
*  You see what's going on with Harvard, the Ivy Leagues and the anti-American pro-Palestinian slash Hamas attitude on these campuses. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wIk-FMsXb8&t=362.58000000000004s)]
*  Is President Trump right to go after this funding? [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wIk-FMsXb8&t=369.58000000000004s)]
*  Well, let me say universities have made a lot of mistakes, including in the way that reacting to October 7th. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wIk-FMsXb8&t=374.58000000000004s)]
*  Our kids chant from the river to the sea. Some of them don't know from what river to what sea. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wIk-FMsXb8&t=381.58000000000004s)]
*  We have failed in terms of educating them about the Middle East, educating them about history, [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wIk-FMsXb8&t=388.5s)]
*  where we still talk about oppressors and oppressed, colonizers and colonized. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wIk-FMsXb8&t=394.5s)]
*  So, yes, universities have made a mistake. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wIk-FMsXb8&t=399.5s)]
*  I will say this. The scientific research base of the United States of America is the research university. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wIk-FMsXb8&t=402.5s)]
*  We made that decision 80 years ago. We don't have a plan B. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wIk-FMsXb8&t=408.5s)]
*  I am a major believer in making sure that we are able to continue the kind of research that produced the stem cell revolution, [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wIk-FMsXb8&t=413.42s)]
*  that produced actually at Stanford, the double helix, that produced the heart transplant. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wIk-FMsXb8&t=424.42s)]
*  We just have to make sure, especially at a time when we are being challenged by China along the technological front. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wIk-FMsXb8&t=431.42s)]
*  But you also agree that to get a message to these universities, funding is basically the only way that gets their attention? [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wIk-FMsXb8&t=438.34000000000003s)]
*  I don't know. I just want to make sure that when we come out of all of this, that scientific funding is intact. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wIk-FMsXb8&t=444.34000000000003s)]
*  Because, Brian, we will pay a price if we don't have scientific funding to do the things that have led to this magnificent innovation that we have. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wIk-FMsXb8&t=450.34000000000003s)]
*  With our university system. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wIk-FMsXb8&t=460.34000000000003s)]
*  It's just where we chose to put fundamental research 80 years ago, and we actually don't have a plan B. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wIk-FMsXb8&t=463.26s)]
*  Madam Secretary, always thrilled to hear. I always hope one day you are going to say I am running for office, but you always tell me, Brian, no way. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wIk-FMsXb8&t=467.26s)]
*  Not in my DNA, but thanks a lot. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wIk-FMsXb8&t=473.26s)]
*  All right. Thanks so much for coming in. Appreciate it. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wIk-FMsXb8&t=475.26s)]
