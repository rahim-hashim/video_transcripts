# Dana Perino: This was CHILLING
**Fox News - World News:** [June 04, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMwCLNFRsW8)
*  Also this last night, a chilling announcement from the Justice Department. Prosecutors charging two [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMwCLNFRsW8&t=0.0s)]
*  Chinese nationals here at the University of Michigan with smuggling a dangerous fungus [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMwCLNFRsW8&t=4.72s)]
*  that's potentially a bio weapon. Rich Edson, live in Washington with details. Hi Rich. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMwCLNFRsW8&t=9.040000000000001s)]
*  Hey, good morning Dana. Well, the FBI says this is a reminder of how the Chinese government is [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMwCLNFRsW8&t=14.0s)]
*  looking to target American vulnerabilities. The Justice Department says it has charged [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMwCLNFRsW8&t=18.080000000000002s)]
*  Yeung Kwan Ji-yeon and Zeng Yang Liu, both Chinese citizens, with conspiracy, smuggling goods into [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMwCLNFRsW8&t=22.56s)]
*  the United States, false statements, and visa fraud. Prosecutors claim Liu flew from China to [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMwCLNFRsW8&t=28.48s)]
*  Detroit in July of 2024 and stashed a dangerous pathogen in his backpack. They say Customs and [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMwCLNFRsW8&t=34.16s)]
*  Border Protection found a wad of tissues crumpled up with a note in Chinese, a round piece of filter [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMwCLNFRsW8&t=40.72s)]
*  paper with circles drawn on it, and four clear plastic baggies with small clumps of plant material [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMwCLNFRsW8&t=46.96s)]
*  inside, what the Justice Department calls a potential agro-terrorism weapon that could [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMwCLNFRsW8&t=52.16s)]
*  target wheat, barley, maize, and rice. FBI Director Cash Patel tells Fox News, quote, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMwCLNFRsW8&t=57.28s)]
*  this case is a sobering reminder that the Chinese Communist Party continues to deploy [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMwCLNFRsW8&t=62.72s)]
*  operatives and researchers to infiltrate our institutions and target our food supply and act [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMwCLNFRsW8&t=67.52s)]
*  that could cripple our economy and endanger American lives. Smuggling a known agro-terrorism [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMwCLNFRsW8&t=73.52000000000001s)]
*  agent into the United States is not just a violation of law, it is a direct threat to [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMwCLNFRsW8&t=78.32s)]
*  national security. Some members of Congress say the U.S. should further scrutinize Chinese [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMwCLNFRsW8&t=82.88s)]
*  students studying here. We shouldn't be lax on this at all. The full force of law should [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMwCLNFRsW8&t=87.2s)]
*  come down on it. We should prevent anyone associated with the CCP from being at any of our [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMwCLNFRsW8&t=93.52s)]
*  universities. Now, the complaint says Liu wanted to research the pathogen at the lab at the [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMwCLNFRsW8&t=97.6s)]
*  University of Michigan where his girlfriend, Jian, worked. The FBI says it searched Jian's phone and [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMwCLNFRsW8&t=103.84s)]
*  found a form describing her membership and loyalty to the Chinese Communist Party, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMwCLNFRsW8&t=109.2s)]
*  and she will appear in federal court in Detroit. Back to you, Daniel. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMwCLNFRsW8&t=114.96000000000001s)]
*  All right, Rich Edson, thank you. A lot to get to here. Kerry Urbahn [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMwCLNFRsW8&t=119.28s)]
*  joins us, Fox's legal editor. Kerry, nice to have you on today. Quick thing from Pam Bondi, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMwCLNFRsW8&t=122.08s)]
*  AG. No higher mission than keeping the American people safe and protecting our nation from hostile [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMwCLNFRsW8&t=126.4s)]
*  foreign actors who could do us harm. What is your top line take on these arrests so far in Detroit? [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMwCLNFRsW8&t=132.0s)]
*  Well, there's even more that meets the eye than what we know. I was reading the affidavit as part [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMwCLNFRsW8&t=141.36s)]
*  of the complaint this morning, and a few things stood out to me. One, this woman apparently had [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMwCLNFRsW8&t=145.28s)]
*  smuggled the same kind of material into the United States before, so this wasn't the first time. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMwCLNFRsW8&t=150.32s)]
*  The second thing was I thought a pretty chilling text exchange between both of them where he says [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMwCLNFRsW8&t=155.12s)]
*  to her, everything else will be easy once we get this done, and she's saying to him, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMwCLNFRsW8&t=161.28s)]
*  the seeds are, quote, not usable yet. And so I took a look at this and I thought this is exactly [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMwCLNFRsW8&t=166.96s)]
*  why when I was at the Department of Justice out of the National Security Division, they began this [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMwCLNFRsW8&t=173.36s)]
*  program called the China Initiative, where they specifically targeted Chinese threats. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMwCLNFRsW8&t=178.08s)]
*  And the reason being is that the Chinese, the FBI, rather, opens an investigation into Chinese [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMwCLNFRsW8&t=182.48s)]
*  economic espionage efforts every 10 to 12 hours. This is something that Chris Wray [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMwCLNFRsW8&t=189.28s)]
*  repeatedly said when he was the FBI director for seven and a half years. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMwCLNFRsW8&t=194.32s)]
*  It's why DOJ started that program. Strangely, at least I thought it was strange, the Biden [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMwCLNFRsW8&t=197.84s)]
*  administration dismantled that program once we were gone. And then you have the new FBI director, [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMwCLNFRsW8&t=202.16s)]
*  Cash Patel, who told Brett Baer recently that China, when he was asked what keeps you up at [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMwCLNFRsW8&t=207.6s)]
*  night, he said China. So you have these two FBI directors who have information, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMwCLNFRsW8&t=212.56s)]
*  access to information that we don't have, saying this is the greatest threat that we're facing, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMwCLNFRsW8&t=218.32s)]
*  and now we see this right in front of our faces. It's pretty concerning. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMwCLNFRsW8&t=222.56s)]
*  Pam Bondi said this, that there's no higher mission than keeping the American people safe [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMwCLNFRsW8&t=226.0s)]
*  and protecting our nation from hostile foreign actors who would do us harm. The concerns over [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMwCLNFRsW8&t=229.52s)]
*  the fungus would be to agricultural crops like wheat, barley, maize, and rice. Obviously, those [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMwCLNFRsW8&t=234.16s)]
*  are big ticket items in terms of what feeds us and helps feed the world, and also a big part of [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMwCLNFRsW8&t=240.56s)]
*  the way that we help the farmers across the country support themselves. Yeah, that's right. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMwCLNFRsW8&t=246.88s)]
*  And it's interesting that when this woman was conducting research on this pathogen in China, [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMwCLNFRsW8&t=255.76s)]
*  she was doing so from a foundation that was funded largely by the Chinese communist government. So [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMwCLNFRsW8&t=261.76s)]
*  she's doing it over there, then she comes over here, starts doing it at Michigan, her boyfriend [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMwCLNFRsW8&t=268.72s)]
*  comes over, they start working on it together. And then meanwhile, she had been instructing someone [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMwCLNFRsW8&t=273.04s)]
*  previous to this, somebody else that we don't know who that is, I think at this point, to stuff the [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMwCLNFRsW8&t=278.56s)]
*  seeds in the soles of his shoes to get through customs and the airport. And on top of it, [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMwCLNFRsW8&t=282.96000000000004s)]
*  of course, she lied on her visa where she said that she was studying something distinct and [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMwCLNFRsW8&t=288.88000000000005s)]
*  different from this actual pathogen. I think your hunch is exactly right. This affidavit, [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMwCLNFRsW8&t=293.04s)]
*  you've got to know what you're looking for. You got a second screening that took place. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMwCLNFRsW8&t=297.84s)]
*  They found tissues concealed in a note in Chinese, found a round piece of filter paper [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMwCLNFRsW8&t=302.15999999999997s)]
*  with a series of circles drawn on it, four plastic baggies with small clumps of reddish plant [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMwCLNFRsW8&t=307.35999999999996s)]
*  material inside. I think your hunch is exactly right. They were watching them. You had to really [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMwCLNFRsW8&t=312.88s)]
*  know what you were looking for in order to make this arrest. So we'll see where it goes in Michigan. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMwCLNFRsW8&t=319.59999999999997s)]
*  They both worked at the University of Michigan. Executive order. There's been another judge that [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMwCLNFRsW8&t=324.72s)]
*  has stepped in, this time banning the treatment for trans inmates, of which there are 628 [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMwCLNFRsW8&t=329.20000000000005s)]
*  right now in federal prisons. This came up during the campaign with Kamala Harris. Here is her [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMwCLNFRsW8&t=336.56s)]
*  position on that issue then. I made sure that they changed the policy in the state of California [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMwCLNFRsW8&t=343.20000000000005s)]
*  so that every transgender inmate in the prison system would have access to the medical care [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMwCLNFRsW8&t=351.2s)]
*  that they desired and need. I feel very strongly about the Zen at its core. It's a civil rights [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMwCLNFRsW8&t=359.04s)]
*  issue. It's a justice issue. And it's an issue of humanity. It would appear that the hormone [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMwCLNFRsW8&t=363.44s)]
*  treatments can continue, at least for now. Is that the right read? Yeah, that's absolutely the right [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMwCLNFRsW8&t=370.56s)]
*  read. And if you take a step back and think about this, the fact that the American taxpayer [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMwCLNFRsW8&t=378.32s)]
*  is being forced to pay for elective hormone therapy, for preferred clothing, for hair removal [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMwCLNFRsW8&t=382.64s)]
*  devices, for these transgender inmates who would say that they're suffering from mental illness [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMwCLNFRsW8&t=388.24s)]
*  and they need these things, it's really quite something. And one thing, Bill, that bothered me [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMwCLNFRsW8&t=394.0s)]
*  in the opinion from this judge, he said, well, the Trump administration didn't give a reason as to [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMwCLNFRsW8&t=398.96s)]
*  why they did this. And I thought, what are you talking about? The EOs on transgender issues have [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMwCLNFRsW8&t=403.44s)]
*  been crystal clear. And it's pretty simple. It's that men are men and women are women. And our [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMwCLNFRsW8&t=407.6s)]
*  policies are going to be consistent with that. And we're not going to force people to pay for [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMwCLNFRsW8&t=412.56s)]
*  something that, you know, not only do we think is not consistent with science, it's not good for them. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMwCLNFRsW8&t=417.36s)]
*  And so, of course, DOJ is going to appeal this. But in the meantime, these inmates will continue [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMwCLNFRsW8&t=424.56s)]
*  to receive these treatment and clothing as the case is litigated on the merits. All right, [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMwCLNFRsW8&t=428.8s)]
*  Carrie Urbann, thank you for kicking us off today. That was a lot. Thank you. Thanks, Carrie. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMwCLNFRsW8&t=432.64000000000004s)]
