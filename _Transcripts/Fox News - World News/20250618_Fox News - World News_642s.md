# WATCH: Israel hammers Iranian centrifuge production site, says regime 'crossed every red line'
**Fox News - World News:** [June 18, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOjuD0E2h_I)
*  Any moment here we're going to Trey Yankst our Fox News correspondent who's on the ground in Tel Aviv [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOjuD0E2h_I&t=0.0s)]
*  Looks like right now Trey Yankst live from Tel Aviv with more Trey [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOjuD0E2h_I&t=5.88s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOjuD0E2h_I&t=12.200000000000001s)]
*  We just got new alerts from Israel's home front command that Iran has launched a new ballistic missile attack against Central Israel [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOjuD0E2h_I&t=13.24s)]
*  We could see nearly the entirety of the beach area in Tel Aviv evacuating quickly hundreds of people running for shelters [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOjuD0E2h_I&t=21.400000000000002s)]
*  We anticipate at any moment there will be air raid sirens sounding across this city as Iran launches yet another attack [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOjuD0E2h_I&t=29.86s)]
*  Remember last night they launched around 30 ballistic missiles toward this city and others [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOjuD0E2h_I&t=37.02s)]
*  But many of them were intercepted by advanced air defense systems [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOjuD0E2h_I&t=42.9s)]
*  The concern here is that they will continue these small barrages in an effort to drag out this conflict [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOjuD0E2h_I&t=46.620000000000005s)]
*  But we do know according to the IDF [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOjuD0E2h_I&t=52.74s)]
*  They've been able to take out many of the launching positions and this has reduced the Iranian ability to target Israel [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOjuD0E2h_I&t=54.9s)]
*  But it's certainly not destroyed the threat and that is the concern here for the population while the home front command [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOjuD0E2h_I&t=61.46s)]
*  Has issued new directives to civilians saying that people can go back to work [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOjuD0E2h_I&t=67.9s)]
*  They have still kept schools closed across this country [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOjuD0E2h_I&t=72.24000000000001s)]
*  Because there's an understanding that this could drag out for a number of days as the Iranians continue to launch these barrages [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOjuD0E2h_I&t=75.78s)]
*  They are certainly smaller the IDF telling us today that in total more than 400 ballistic missiles have been fired into Israel [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOjuD0E2h_I&t=82.5s)]
*  Since Friday morning when the Israelis launched this operation to go after Iran's nuclear facilities and top [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOjuD0E2h_I&t=90.3s)]
*  IRGC officials and a source that I spoke with earlier on the phone today said they will continue to in their words [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOjuD0E2h_I&t=96.94s)]
*  Hunt down the military leadership of Iran that is responsible for launching these missile barrages into this country [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOjuD0E2h_I&t=102.94s)]
*  But again the latest information that we have right now any moment [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOjuD0E2h_I&t=109.82s)]
*  We expect sirens to sound across the central part of Israel amid incoming Iranian ballistic missiles guys [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOjuD0E2h_I&t=113.33999999999999s)]
*  Trey as we've been watching you there on the ground in real time suffer under these barrages [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOjuD0E2h_I&t=120.89999999999999s)]
*  My question is you've mentioned that they've gotten smaller [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOjuD0E2h_I&t=125.89999999999999s)]
*  Talk to us about the durations and talk to us about the element of viscerality as you've been experiencing them [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOjuD0E2h_I&t=128.6s)]
*  Do they feel smaller or does it feel equally terrifying each time Trey? [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOjuD0E2h_I&t=134.42s)]
*  Each time we can see Israel's advanced air defense systems working to shoot down the incoming fire [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOjuD0E2h_I&t=139.98s)]
*  But oftentimes the missiles will slip past the air defense systems that are both belonging to Israel and the United States [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOjuD0E2h_I&t=146.62s)]
*  they're deployed at different areas to try and protect major population centers like Tel Aviv and [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOjuD0E2h_I&t=153.22s)]
*  When they try to shoot them down oftentimes the Iranians will use drones at the same time [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOjuD0E2h_I&t=159.1s)]
*  So that the attacks are coming from different areas in an effort to overwhelm the missile defense systems and when they do that [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOjuD0E2h_I&t=164.58s)]
*  And they actually slip past and slam into these population centers. It can be incredibly dangerous for the population [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOjuD0E2h_I&t=170.66000000000003s)]
*  We have been at the site in the aftermath of these strikes one in the heart of Tel Aviv [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOjuD0E2h_I&t=177.26000000000002s)]
*  Just 48 hours ago [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOjuD0E2h_I&t=182.22000000000003s)]
*  And we arrived on the scene less than an hour after the blast as they were pulling people out of the rubble and debris [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOjuD0E2h_I&t=183.78s)]
*  I spoke with a woman that I know in Tel Aviv and she described her experience [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOjuD0E2h_I&t=189.57999999999998s)]
*  being trapped inside of a bomb shelter when the [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOjuD0E2h_I&t=193.45999999999998s)]
*  Front part of her building collapsed and rescue workers ultimately got to these people who were safe because they were in a bomb shelter [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOjuD0E2h_I&t=196.29999999999998s)]
*  But others that we spoke to on the scene after that explosion in the middle of the night [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOjuD0E2h_I&t=202.66s)]
*  They were wounded and some of them still in shock their ears ringing at another site that we went to just south of here [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOjuD0E2h_I&t=206.54s)]
*  there were rescue workers digging through the debris and the rubble and the scene I think painted a [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOjuD0E2h_I&t=212.62s)]
*  Representative picture of what this has been like for the population at one location an apartment building was hit with an Iranian ballistic missile [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOjuD0E2h_I&t=218.52s)]
*  And when we arrived we saw a man who was wounded, but he was wearing a hospital gown and he was waiting for his father [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOjuD0E2h_I&t=225.68s)]
*  Right now we're getting the incoming fire as we speak [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOjuD0E2h_I&t=232.60000000000002s)]
*  You can hear the air raid sirens that are sounding across central Israel my cameraman is going to pan out here slightly [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOjuD0E2h_I&t=235.48000000000002s)]
*  so that you can [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOjuD0E2h_I&t=242.88s)]
*  See any of the incoming missile fire and attempts to intercept these missiles just stay with us here and [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOjuD0E2h_I&t=245.28s)]
*  We will update you on the situation here in Tel Aviv [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOjuD0E2h_I&t=253.35999999999999s)]
*  But again the Iranians are currently launching a ballistic missile barrage at Israel's second largest city of Tel Aviv [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOjuD0E2h_I&t=256.28s)]
*  There are currently millions of people in bomb shelters right now [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOjuD0E2h_I&t=263.24s)]
*  Trying to get out of the line of fire [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOjuD0E2h_I&t=267.36s)]
*  guys [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOjuD0E2h_I&t=270.56s)]
*  Stay safe first and foremost [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOjuD0E2h_I&t=272.6s)]
*  We're gonna just take a moment right now to listen to those sirens [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOjuD0E2h_I&t=275.84s)]
*  So guys right now what you're hearing are sirens sounding across Tel Aviv [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOjuD0E2h_I&t=288.44s)]
*  These are the the last line of alerts that the Israeli people will get amid this incoming fire [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOjuD0E2h_I&t=292.8s)]
*  So far we have not seen any of the air defense systems active around this city [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOjuD0E2h_I&t=299.08s)]
*  We just have to give it a moment oftentimes. They'll intercept the fire as it's coming toward Tel Aviv [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOjuD0E2h_I&t=303.96s)]
*  Other times and right now overhead you can see some of these interceptions taking place [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOjuD0E2h_I&t=309.84s)]
*  My cameraman is gonna pan up here and you're gonna see those white streaks in the sky. That is a successful interception [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOjuD0E2h_I&t=314.64s)]
*  It's a little bit difficult to see given the fire and the sunlight at this moment [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOjuD0E2h_I&t=322.44s)]
*  But we're just gonna come off the sticks here and we're gonna walk [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOjuD0E2h_I&t=327.96s)]
*  Just give us one moment [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOjuD0E2h_I&t=331.12s)]
*  Good to wait and Trey as we're watching every time these these events happen [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOjuD0E2h_I&t=335.91999999999996s)]
*  Every time these these happen [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOjuD0E2h_I&t=341.24s)]
*  We have our security and we're trying to get a sense of just how heavy the fire is [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOjuD0E2h_I&t=342.71999999999997s)]
*  We can report that there was one interception over Tel Aviv [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOjuD0E2h_I&t=346.84s)]
*  That was likely Israel's arrow two or three advanced missile defense system [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOjuD0E2h_I&t=350.91999999999996s)]
*  Shooting it down and the way that we can tell that the in and there you hear the explosion right there that is from a [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOjuD0E2h_I&t=355.96s)]
*  successful interception [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOjuD0E2h_I&t=363.59999999999997s)]
*  At this point because the Iranians don't have the wide array that they had earlier in the conflict [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOjuD0E2h_I&t=365.47999999999996s)]
*  It's a little bit easier for the Israelis to shoot down this incoming fire [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOjuD0E2h_I&t=371.2s)]
*  But still it's something that the population has to watch out for [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOjuD0E2h_I&t=374.56s)]
*  We understand by earlier reporting that 40% of the missiles including the surface-to-surface [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOjuD0E2h_I&t=378.44s)]
*  Missiles of Iran were wiped out trade. Do we have updated numbers on that? [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOjuD0E2h_I&t=384.06s)]
*  Yeah, the latest information that we have from the IDF is that 40% of the launching positions have been taken out [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOjuD0E2h_I&t=390.86s)]
*  By the Israelis in these strikes just yesterday [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOjuD0E2h_I&t=397.54s)]
*  They targeted a missile array near to the Isfahan nuclear facility and the reasons the Iranians had missiles here is because this was a [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOjuD0E2h_I&t=400.9s)]
*  Largely protected area at least the Iranians thought it was protected [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOjuD0E2h_I&t=408.44s)]
*  But I spoke yesterday with an Israeli fighter jet pilot and he said look we now have control over much of the skies of Iran [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOjuD0E2h_I&t=412.46000000000004s)]
*  including the Iranian capital of Tehran and this gives Israel the ability to put drones in the air and also use [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOjuD0E2h_I&t=420.18s)]
*  fighter jets so they can see when these mobile launching units come out and they can target them in real time and [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOjuD0E2h_I&t=426.5s)]
*  This has greatly reduced the amount of fire that has targeted Israeli cities [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOjuD0E2h_I&t=432.42s)]
*  and like I said [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOjuD0E2h_I&t=436.34000000000003s)]
*  They still have to follow the alerts that come in because this is not a perfect air defense system and Iran is clearly not only [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOjuD0E2h_I&t=437.5s)]
*  At a reduced capability to launch these attacks [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOjuD0E2h_I&t=445.22s)]
*  But they're also trying to preserve what missiles they have left [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOjuD0E2h_I&t=448.1s)]
*  Israeli sources tell Fox News that at the beginning of this conflict that started almost six days ago Iran had around [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOjuD0E2h_I&t=452.02s)]
*  2,000 missiles they've fired [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOjuD0E2h_I&t=458.74s)]
*  400 of them at Israel and the Israelis have destroyed a number of other missiles belonging to the regime guys [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOjuD0E2h_I&t=460.66s)]
*  Trey final question is about compliance mixed with that visibility during the daylight [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOjuD0E2h_I&t=466.73999999999995s)]
*  So as you see from your deck is there a hundred percent compliance by the Israelis when they hear the sirens or are some people? [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOjuD0E2h_I&t=471.34s)]
*  Indeed out of their shelters and does the daylight have an impact to certainly as viewers as we watch the screen with you in real time [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOjuD0E2h_I&t=478.21999999999997s)]
*  It is difficult to see those intercepted missiles in contrast with at night times talk to us about the experience there during during the day [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOjuD0E2h_I&t=484.9s)]
*  Exactly I'm gonna have my cameraman very quickly pan to the beach because you're going to see an area [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOjuD0E2h_I&t=493.40000000000003s)]
*  That's normally bustling with people and there's one or two people out still right now [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOjuD0E2h_I&t=498.76s)]
*  But this entire area has cleared out just before we got on air here and earlier in the show when we were speaking [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOjuD0E2h_I&t=503.44s)]
*  we saw [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOjuD0E2h_I&t=510.16s)]
*  Hundreds of people out here and they were [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOjuD0E2h_I&t=512.48s)]
*  Sitting by the beach. They were waiting for the sunset to start what we've seen normally because these attacks mostly come at night [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOjuD0E2h_I&t=515.44s)]
*  Israel's trying to have some sense of normalcy during the day [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOjuD0E2h_I&t=521.28s)]
*  And so there are far more people out during the day at night [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOjuD0E2h_I&t=524.0799999999999s)]
*  Tel Aviv and other major population centers look like a ghost town people are staying in their homes [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOjuD0E2h_I&t=527.8399999999999s)]
*  They are ensuring that they can sleep in shelters when the fire is heavy and they're waiting [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOjuD0E2h_I&t=533.1999999999999s)]
*  Because they understand that Iran is going to continue these ballistic missile attacks until the war is over guys [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOjuD0E2h_I&t=538.48s)]
*  Trey Yankst live from Tel Aviv Israel stay safe and thank you [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOjuD0E2h_I&t=545.6s)]
*  Joey Jones your quick thoughts [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOjuD0E2h_I&t=550.96s)]
*  Yeah, if I had a chance to ask him, I guess I would have I would have tried to bring [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOjuD0E2h_I&t=552.96s)]
*  To light the fact that in in any war posture the strategy matters [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOjuD0E2h_I&t=556.56s)]
*  And if you're Iran and you do believe you can carry this war and even win it [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOjuD0E2h_I&t=561.6s)]
*  Your first barrage of missiles don't go to population centers. They go to military bases [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOjuD0E2h_I&t=565.6s)]
*  They go to military bases [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOjuD0E2h_I&t=570.72s)]
