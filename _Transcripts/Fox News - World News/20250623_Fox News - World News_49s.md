# Why President Trump launched Operation Midnight Hammer #trump #iran #foxnews #shorts #news
**Fox News - World News:** [June 23, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fshuPPDVtFw)
*  One of the great things that makes President Trump a great leader is his ability to listen [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fshuPPDVtFw&t=0.0s)]
*  to people with different perspectives, but then ultimately make a decision based on his [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fshuPPDVtFw&t=6.12s)]
*  own instinct and the intelligence that he saw. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fshuPPDVtFw&t=11.28s)]
*  And he saw, based on U.S. intelligence, that Iran is just weeks away from obtaining a nuclear [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fshuPPDVtFw&t=14.48s)]
*  weapon. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fshuPPDVtFw&t=20.48s)]
*  And President Trump has been saying his entire life, not just as a presidential candidate [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fshuPPDVtFw&t=21.48s)]
*  or as president of the United States twice, but also as a private citizen, that Iran cannot [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fshuPPDVtFw&t=25.240000000000002s)]
*  obtain a nuclear weapon. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fshuPPDVtFw&t=29.92s)]
*  And that's something that leaders around this world and on both sides of the political aisle [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fshuPPDVtFw&t=31.520000000000003s)]
*  agree with. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fshuPPDVtFw&t=35.52s)]
*  Again, presidents dating back to Democrat Bill Clinton have said that Iran cannot obtain [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fshuPPDVtFw&t=36.52s)]
*  a nuclear weapon, but none of them had the courage to actually do something about it, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fshuPPDVtFw&t=40.96s)]
*  and President Trump did. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fshuPPDVtFw&t=44.96s)]
