# 'Iran should not target US': Trump admin denies involvement in Israeli strike
**Fox News - World News:** [June 13, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PubYpWmqhY)
*  We're getting brand new video released from the IDF that shows Israel destroying missile [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PubYpWmqhY&t=0.0s)]
*  launchers inside Iran. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PubYpWmqhY&t=4.5s)]
*  Take a look at that. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PubYpWmqhY&t=6.66s)]
*  Wow. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PubYpWmqhY&t=7.66s)]
*  Powerful footage. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PubYpWmqhY&t=8.66s)]
*  And right now, President Trump is currently meeting with his National Security Council [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PubYpWmqhY&t=9.66s)]
*  in the Situation Room that started at 11 a.m. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PubYpWmqhY&t=13.26s)]
*  And the U.S. says it has played no role in Israel's offensive against Iran. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PubYpWmqhY&t=16.38s)]
*  The U.S. has been emphatic on that. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PubYpWmqhY&t=21.06s)]
*  And officials claim they're still hoping to continue the nuclear agreement negotiations [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PubYpWmqhY&t=23.18s)]
*  with the Iranian regime. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PubYpWmqhY&t=28.82s)]
*  Rich Edson is live at the White House with the latest. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PubYpWmqhY&t=30.48s)]
*  Rich. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PubYpWmqhY&t=32.52s)]
*  Well, before that National Security Council meeting this morning, the president has been [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PubYpWmqhY&t=33.52s)]
*  online. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PubYpWmqhY&t=36.68s)]
*  He's been trying to push the Iranians to reach an agreement to dismantle their nuclear program [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PubYpWmqhY&t=37.68s)]
*  so they can avoid attacks like this. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PubYpWmqhY&t=41.72s)]
*  The president posted, quote, Two months ago, I gave Iran a 60-day ultimatum to make a deal. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PubYpWmqhY&t=43.6s)]
*  They should have done it. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PubYpWmqhY&t=48.480000000000004s)]
*  Today is 61. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PubYpWmqhY&t=49.480000000000004s)]
*  I told them what to do, but they just couldn't get there. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PubYpWmqhY&t=50.480000000000004s)]
*  Now they have, perhaps, a second chance. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PubYpWmqhY&t=54.019999999999996s)]
*  The president told Bret Baer that he was aware of these Israeli strikes ahead of time, but [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PubYpWmqhY&t=57.699999999999996s)]
*  the administration is denying that the U.S. participated. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PubYpWmqhY&t=61.5s)]
*  Secretary of State, also the National Security Adviser Marco Rubio, wrote in a statement, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PubYpWmqhY&t=64.78s)]
*  quote, Israel took unilateral action against Iran. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PubYpWmqhY&t=69.58s)]
*  We are not involved in strikes against Iran. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PubYpWmqhY&t=72.7s)]
*  Let me be clear. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PubYpWmqhY&t=75.14s)]
*  Iran should not target U.S. interests or personnel. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PubYpWmqhY&t=76.14s)]
*  Monday, the president spoke with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PubYpWmqhY&t=79.53999999999999s)]
*  A few days later, the U.S. started moving American staff and families out of the region. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PubYpWmqhY&t=84.08s)]
*  Trump had said he wanted Israel to hold off on an attack to allow for negotiations. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PubYpWmqhY&t=88.44s)]
*  Look, it's very simple, not complicated. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PubYpWmqhY&t=93.24000000000001s)]
*  Iran cannot have a nuclear weapon. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PubYpWmqhY&t=98.12s)]
*  Other than that, I want them to be successful. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PubYpWmqhY&t=99.96000000000001s)]
*  I want them to be tremendous. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PubYpWmqhY&t=102.0s)]
*  We'll help them be successful. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PubYpWmqhY&t=103.28s)]
*  We'll trade with them. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PubYpWmqhY&t=104.28s)]
*  We'll do whatever is necessary. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PubYpWmqhY&t=105.28s)]
*  Earlier this week, the president said Iran had become much more aggressive in its nuclear [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PubYpWmqhY&t=107.6s)]
*  negotiations. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PubYpWmqhY&t=111.8s)]
*  Iranian officials have insisted that any agreement allow for them to still enrich uranium on [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PubYpWmqhY&t=113.17999999999999s)]
*  their territory. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PubYpWmqhY&t=118.46s)]
*  White House envoy Steve Witkoff was scheduled to meet again this weekend for a sixth round [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PubYpWmqhY&t=119.46s)]
*  of negotiations with Iranian officials to discuss their nuclear program. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PubYpWmqhY&t=123.94s)]
*  After these attacks, Iranian state media is reporting that Iran is withdrawing from talks [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PubYpWmqhY&t=127.97999999999999s)]
*  until further notice. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PubYpWmqhY&t=132.98s)]
*  We asked if Iranian officials have communicated that to the United States. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PubYpWmqhY&t=134.46s)]
*  If Iran has said to the U.S., hey, we're withholding on these talks, we're not going to join them [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PubYpWmqhY&t=138.38s)]
*  anymore, a U.S. official responded only that we quote, hope to have talks. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PubYpWmqhY&t=142.96s)]
*  Back to you. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PubYpWmqhY&t=148.96s)]
*  All right, Rich, we'll keep us updated. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PubYpWmqhY&t=149.96s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PubYpWmqhY&t=151.79999999999998s)]
*  We'll do. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PubYpWmqhY&t=152.79999999999998s)]
*  So I want us to follow this closely. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PubYpWmqhY&t=153.79999999999998s)]
*  I want to play with the president said yesterday and then juxtapose it against some of the [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PubYpWmqhY&t=155.48s)]
*  reporting that's coming out. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PubYpWmqhY&t=159.12s)]
*  This is what President Trump said during our hour just yesterday. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PubYpWmqhY&t=160.64s)]
*  As the Israelis apparently gear up for some kind of an attack, a possible attack on Iran, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PubYpWmqhY&t=163.24s)]
*  are you trying to talk Netanyahu out of doing that or are you so against Iran having a nuclear [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PubYpWmqhY&t=171.34s)]
*  weapon that you're OK? [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PubYpWmqhY&t=177.34s)]
*  He does his thing because it is not an American war. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PubYpWmqhY&t=178.34s)]
*  Yeah, it's a very fair question. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PubYpWmqhY&t=182.34s)]
*  Look, I want to have an agreement with Iran. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PubYpWmqhY&t=183.54000000000002s)]
*  We're fairly close to an agreement. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PubYpWmqhY&t=186.74s)]
*  We are fairly close to a pretty good agreement. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PubYpWmqhY&t=188.5s)]
*  It's got to be better than pretty good, though, but it's got to be I much prefer an agreement. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PubYpWmqhY&t=192.14000000000001s)]
*  As long as I think there is an agreement, I don't want them going in because I think [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PubYpWmqhY&t=196.94s)]
*  it would blow it might help it actually, but it also could blow it. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PubYpWmqhY&t=200.44s)]
*  So President Trump saying he did not want Israel to do this. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PubYpWmqhY&t=206.35999999999999s)]
*  This comes George's Axios is reporting this from two Israeli officials claim to Axios. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PubYpWmqhY&t=209.68s)]
*  Trump and his aides were pretending to oppose an Israeli attack in public and didn't express [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PubYpWmqhY&t=214.92s)]
*  opposition in private. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PubYpWmqhY&t=219.52s)]
*  We had a clear U.S. green light, one claimed. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PubYpWmqhY&t=220.8s)]
*  The goal, they said, was to convince Iran that no attack was imminent and make sure [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PubYpWmqhY&t=223.6s)]
*  Iranians on Israel's target list wouldn't know the new location. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PubYpWmqhY&t=226.94s)]
*  They claim the plan went so far as for Netanyahu's aides to brief Israeli reporters that Trump [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PubYpWmqhY&t=231.14s)]
*  had tried to put the brakes on the attack in a Monday phone call when in reality there [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PubYpWmqhY&t=237.22s)]
*  was coordination. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PubYpWmqhY&t=241.98s)]
*  The White House denies this. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PubYpWmqhY&t=242.98s)]
*  That's the reporting. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PubYpWmqhY&t=245.01999999999998s)]
*  So the question is, was there the 40 chest going on? [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PubYpWmqhY&t=246.01999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, again, a lot of this is going to play out. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PubYpWmqhY&t=248.66s)]
*  We'll find out ultimately the truth with the president knew how we acted upon that information. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PubYpWmqhY&t=252.34s)]
*  But the bottom line is that he's still offering a diplomatic off ramp for this not to be ratcheted [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PubYpWmqhY&t=259.56s)]
*  up to the next level. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PubYpWmqhY&t=263.9s)]
*  And his policy is very clear that he does not want to commit U.S. troops and have another [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PubYpWmqhY&t=265.36s)]
*  ground war at this stage. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PubYpWmqhY&t=269.8s)]
*  Are we allies with Israel? [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PubYpWmqhY&t=271.86s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PubYpWmqhY&t=273.84000000000003s)]
*  Do we support their defense infrastructure? [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PubYpWmqhY&t=274.84000000000003s)]
*  We have historically. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PubYpWmqhY&t=276.1s)]
*  Are we aligned against Iran? [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PubYpWmqhY&t=277.56s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PubYpWmqhY&t=280.0s)]
*  Will there be collaboration potentially from an intelligence standpoint? [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PubYpWmqhY&t=281.38s)]
*  I suspect that there is because we all anticipate that there will be an Iranian kinetic response [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PubYpWmqhY&t=284.04s)]
*  in the short order. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PubYpWmqhY&t=289.42s)]
*  So I focus less on these kind of details initially because historically the Israelis have advised [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PubYpWmqhY&t=291.74s)]
*  the U.S. and our intelligence agencies that there is a forthcoming attack. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PubYpWmqhY&t=297.40000000000003s)]
*  But even if he did make the argument that we shouldn't or Israelis should not have done [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PubYpWmqhY&t=303.2s)]
*  do we really think that Prime Minister Netanyahu would have said, OK, well, I'm not going to [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PubYpWmqhY&t=308.28000000000003s)]
*  do this. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PubYpWmqhY&t=311.74s)]
*  The Iranians are only three days away from highly enriched uranium and being able to [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PubYpWmqhY&t=312.74s)]
*  arm a missile directed at the Israelis and potentially exterminating their nation. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PubYpWmqhY&t=316.18s)]
*  You know, they've got to act in a way that's in their self-interest. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PubYpWmqhY&t=321.8s)]
*  And I think that's where the consensus is in the Congress, certainly in the White House, [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PubYpWmqhY&t=324.52s)]
*  to make sure that Israel can defend itself in this time of peril. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PubYpWmqhY&t=328.64s)]
*  Harris Barak revealed of Axios says he just spoke with President Trump. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PubYpWmqhY&t=331.72s)]
*  The details are coming out on that call. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PubYpWmqhY&t=334.84000000000003s)]
*  He said it was Trump said a big day yesterday and he noted that Israel used, quote, great [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PubYpWmqhY&t=336.22s)]
*  American equipment during the attack. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PubYpWmqhY&t=341.62s)]
*  No doubt true. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PubYpWmqhY&t=344.26000000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PubYpWmqhY&t=345.26000000000005s)]
*  And, Jillian, you and I were talking about that off camera a few minutes ago during the [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PubYpWmqhY&t=346.26000000000005s)]
*  commercial break. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PubYpWmqhY&t=348.98s)]
*  Like, what would the connective tissue actually look like? [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PubYpWmqhY&t=349.98s)]
*  We work symbiotically on a lot of the intelligence. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PubYpWmqhY&t=353.94000000000005s)]
*  So I can't imagine that we wouldn't have some sort of regard for a shared resource or a [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PubYpWmqhY&t=356.66s)]
*  shared intelligence for this operation. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PubYpWmqhY&t=362.46000000000004s)]
*  Just how deep it went. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PubYpWmqhY&t=365.58s)]
*  I have all confidence that if anybody's going to tell us, it's going to be President Trump. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PubYpWmqhY&t=366.58s)]
*  He's the most transparent president we've ever seen. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PubYpWmqhY&t=370.38s)]
*  I mean, you've got such access to him from the media. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PubYpWmqhY&t=372.34s)]
*  I did think it was interesting from, and I mentioned him earlier, he was an Israeli special [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PubYpWmqhY&t=375.02s)]
*  ops veteran, Aaron Cohen. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PubYpWmqhY&t=380.58s)]
*  He said that, look, would you rather have a situation where you're playing around with [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PubYpWmqhY&t=382.53999999999996s)]
*  an Iranian country that has nuclear power and decries death to America on a daily basis [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PubYpWmqhY&t=388.18s)]
*  all hours 24-7, they hate you and they hate Israel? [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PubYpWmqhY&t=394.5s)]
*  Or would you rather take that weaponry away from them? [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PubYpWmqhY&t=398.06s)]
*  They're still going to be who they are potentially, but now you've killed a lot of them, maybe [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PubYpWmqhY&t=400.97999999999996s)]
*  from the inside out that country changes. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PubYpWmqhY&t=404.94s)]
*  And maybe we'll see that. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PubYpWmqhY&t=407.41999999999996s)]
*  I mean, you're already seeing people push against this government before this. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PubYpWmqhY&t=408.41999999999996s)]
*  I don't know how long it will take for Iranians to say enough is enough with the mullahs and [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PubYpWmqhY&t=413.17999999999995s)]
*  all of it. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PubYpWmqhY&t=418.82s)]
*  So maybe this is an opening for that, too. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PubYpWmqhY&t=419.82s)]
*  I'm optimistic. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PubYpWmqhY&t=421.65999999999997s)]
*  Julian, we learned a lot looking at that Signal chat, you know, Signalgate that happened about [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PubYpWmqhY&t=422.82000000000005s)]
*  the Houthi strikes. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PubYpWmqhY&t=427.98s)]
*  And you saw JD Vance articulate one view of the world. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PubYpWmqhY&t=428.98s)]
*  And then you saw Mike Waltz articulate a more hawkish view of the world. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PubYpWmqhY&t=432.90000000000003s)]
*  Well, Politico says about that Rubio statement where notably, you know, it was we had no [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PubYpWmqhY&t=436.70000000000005s)]
*  involvement. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PubYpWmqhY&t=441.58000000000004s)]
*  There was not that unequivocal we support this line in there. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PubYpWmqhY&t=442.58000000000004s)]
*  Well, Politico says a Trump official told Dasha, one of their reporters, that the White [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PubYpWmqhY&t=445.70000000000005s)]
*  House drove the message put out by Rubio and ardent foreign policy hawk. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PubYpWmqhY&t=449.46s)]
*  And behind the scenes, there was a MAGA versus neocon debate that unfolded over the wording [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PubYpWmqhY&t=453.38s)]
*  of the statement and the lead up to the release. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PubYpWmqhY&t=458.42s)]
*  So that debate is very much alive and well politically and very much within the walls [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PubYpWmqhY&t=462.14s)]
*  of the White House. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PubYpWmqhY&t=465.82s)]
*  Without question. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PubYpWmqhY&t=466.82s)]
*  And all the experts that I've interviewed on this, honestly, I spoke to Sean Hannity [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PubYpWmqhY&t=468.3s)]
*  about it. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PubYpWmqhY&t=473.54s)]
*  I've spoken to Victor Davis Hanson about it. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PubYpWmqhY&t=474.54s)]
*  individuals and culture. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PubYpWmqhY&t=476.78s)]
*  I've spoken to about it. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PubYpWmqhY&t=478.5s)]
*  And you'll hear like, listen, we want America first. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PubYpWmqhY&t=479.94s)]
*  We want to focus on us. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PubYpWmqhY&t=483.34s)]
*  We don't want to be sending hundreds of billions of dollars to fight somebody else's war. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PubYpWmqhY&t=484.46s)]
*  We're fighting for an ideology that they are not in alignment with. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PubYpWmqhY&t=489.41999999999996s)]
*  You know, we left Afghanistan and 90 percent of them still want Sharia law and on and on [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PubYpWmqhY&t=493.65999999999997s)]
*  and on. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PubYpWmqhY&t=497.82s)]
*  But I don't believe that's what's happening here. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PubYpWmqhY&t=498.82s)]
*  And that's my point. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PubYpWmqhY&t=501.38s)]
*  I don't think this is someone else's war or Israel's war, as far as I can tell. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PubYpWmqhY&t=502.38s)]
*  So I think that Trump gave them numerous off ramps and they did not take it. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PubYpWmqhY&t=508.5s)]
*  I think this is a clear threat to America. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PubYpWmqhY&t=514.26s)]
*  I don't think this is someone else's war. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PubYpWmqhY&t=517.26s)]
*  And again, I come back to I don't see the alternative personally. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PubYpWmqhY&t=518.66s)]
*  You know, Emily, one fascinating part of this president Trump did his first international [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PubYpWmqhY&t=522.62s)]
*  trip to the Middle East. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PubYpWmqhY&t=525.98s)]
*  He met with a lot of Arab countries. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PubYpWmqhY&t=526.98s)]
*  And what we've noticed is there's been a lot of silence from other Arab countries. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PubYpWmqhY&t=528.82s)]
*  No one's rushing to Iran's defense. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PubYpWmqhY&t=531.94s)]
*  In fact, Jordan opened its airspace reportedly to Israel. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PubYpWmqhY&t=533.34s)]
*  Not only that, you had for the first time, at least I recall, Lebanon's government telling [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PubYpWmqhY&t=536.98s)]
*  Hezbollah to stand down. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PubYpWmqhY&t=541.62s)]
*  So there's this really improved relation that I have to believe the Trump administration [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PubYpWmqhY&t=543.98s)]
*  had a lot to do with. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PubYpWmqhY&t=548.44s)]
*  Perfect to tee up for what I wanted to talk about, Kayleigh, which was exactly that. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PubYpWmqhY&t=549.94s)]
*  Now, we knew in these leading up years to Trump's sort of stated, you know, new approach, [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PubYpWmqhY&t=553.2600000000001s)]
*  right, the economic investment that we're not going to leave our blood and treasure [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PubYpWmqhY&t=557.94s)]
*  anymore, but we're going to have these coordinated, co equal investments, that that was the way [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PubYpWmqhY&t=561.58s)]
*  toward peace. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PubYpWmqhY&t=565.64s)]
*  And we learned that a lot of these countries the entire time through the Biden administration [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PubYpWmqhY&t=566.64s)]
*  as well had been saying like, oh, gosh, you know, Hezbollah and Hamas, they are the blight [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PubYpWmqhY&t=569.74s)]
*  on our entire region. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PubYpWmqhY&t=574.9s)]
*  All we want is stability. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PubYpWmqhY&t=576.26s)]
*  We do recognize Israel as a state where we are happy to for peace so that our economic [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PubYpWmqhY&t=577.34s)]
*  interests can thrive and so our people can live in peace. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PubYpWmqhY&t=582.5s)]
*  So 100 percent, I think that there have been a bunch of neighboring countries, and especially [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PubYpWmqhY&t=585.02s)]
*  those that signed the Abraham Accord during the first administration and beyond that have [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PubYpWmqhY&t=588.42s)]
*  been waiting for this moment to essentially say, can the kids stop having a tantrum? [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PubYpWmqhY&t=592.02s)]
*  And I say that obviously with full respect to all the lives that have been lost at the [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PubYpWmqhY&t=596.3399999999999s)]
*  hands of these horrific terror organizations as proxies for the Islamic regime. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PubYpWmqhY&t=600.78s)]
*  So I say, though, too, that as we talk about, you know, is it good cop, bad cop? [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PubYpWmqhY&t=604.86s)]
*  How deep does the level of coordination go between Israel and the United States other [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PubYpWmqhY&t=609.14s)]
*  than being our number one and top ally? [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PubYpWmqhY&t=614.0799999999999s)]
*  I think what we will discover and find out is that if Iran indeed takes one of those [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PubYpWmqhY&t=616.5999999999999s)]
*  off ramps, then we will learn whether Israel indeed then gets off the gas pedal. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PubYpWmqhY&t=620.4399999999999s)]
*  Right. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PubYpWmqhY&t=626.04s)]
*  And if they do, then we know that this is a coordinated and and a symbiotic, equally [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PubYpWmqhY&t=627.04s)]
*  yoked attack. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PubYpWmqhY&t=631.3599999999999s)]
*  But if not, if they're like, we don't care what's happening, we're still going for it. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PubYpWmqhY&t=632.3599999999999s)]
*  And then that might reveal a level of either friction or different perspectives going into [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PubYpWmqhY&t=635.3199999999999s)]
*  that. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PubYpWmqhY&t=640.5999999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PubYpWmqhY&t=641.5999999999999s)]
*  And the Israeli ambassador this morning told Bill and Dana, hey, I'd be open to being part [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PubYpWmqhY&t=642.5999999999999s)]
*  of those negotiations and talking about it. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PubYpWmqhY&t=645.22s)]
*  So interesting, kind of leaning into the Trump Trump strategy there. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PubYpWmqhY&t=646.86s)]
