# Levin: This is an EVIL regime
**Fox News - World News:** [June 13, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVCiR9S9zDM)
*  Massive breaking news from the Middle East. Israel now conducting, as we speak, a major [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVCiR9S9zDM&t=0.0s)]
*  airstrike against Iran at the heart of its nuclear program. But also, they are going [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVCiR9S9zDM&t=5.12s)]
*  after their long-range missile sites. But now the world, especially Israel and American [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVCiR9S9zDM&t=10.96s)]
*  bases in the region, they are bracing for a potential uranium response. There's a [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVCiR9S9zDM&t=15.8s)]
*  lot to get into. We're going to join—we joined in a minute by the great one. Well, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVCiR9S9zDM&t=20.64s)]
*  there he is, Mark Levin. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVCiR9S9zDM&t=24.28s)]
*  Mark, I want to give a little bit of a commentary into a question and then hand you the ball [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVCiR9S9zDM&t=25.72s)]
*  here, because I think this is very imperative to point out. The world needs to look at this [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVCiR9S9zDM&t=30.8s)]
*  from Israel's point of view. You know, October 7th was orchestrated in part by the Quds forces [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVCiR9S9zDM&t=35.8s)]
*  in Iran and by the Iranian Revolutionary Guards forces, given a little history here. They [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVCiR9S9zDM&t=42.9s)]
*  are the number one state sponsor of terrorism. Trey Yanks was talking about a seven-front [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVCiR9S9zDM&t=48.72s)]
*  war. You have Lebanon and Hezbollah and Islamic Jihad in the north. You have Gaza. You have [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVCiR9S9zDM&t=54.839999999999996s)]
*  Hamas, the equivalent of 40,000 Americans murdered on October 7th. We had murder and [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVCiR9S9zDM&t=61.839999999999996s)]
*  rape and torture and kidnapping and beheadings. I've seen the videos. Then there's supply [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVCiR9S9zDM&t=67.28s)]
*  and weaponry to the Houthi rebels. Then the Iraqi and the Syrian militias, et cetera, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVCiR9S9zDM&t=72.08s)]
*  and Iran firing missiles into this country on its own. They have threatened to wipe Israel [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVCiR9S9zDM&t=78.75999999999999s)]
*  off the map. If you look at Axios today, and my sources have confirmed this, that they [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVCiR9S9zDM&t=83.86s)]
*  have been building out these 2,000-pound ballistic missiles with warheads and even building out [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVCiR9S9zDM&t=89.24s)]
*  and developing new ballistic missiles with a 4,000-pound warhead. There are reports, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVCiR9S9zDM&t=98.32s)]
*  Axios, 2,000 to 3,000, maybe more. That, to me, represents Plan B. So if you put yourself [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVCiR9S9zDM&t=102.9s)]
*  in the Israeli, in Israel's shoes tonight, they are being, all the terror against them, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVCiR9S9zDM&t=109.26s)]
*  all the threats against them, the head of the snake in all of this, that would be the [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVCiR9S9zDM&t=115.76s)]
*  Iranian regime. They're the ones that have started this. They're the ones fomenting [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVCiR9S9zDM&t=120.4s)]
*  this. They're the ones responsible for all the death, all the destruction. I'll say [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVCiR9S9zDM&t=125.26s)]
*  one last thing. My prediction is Israel will be victorious, as difficult an operation as [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVCiR9S9zDM&t=129.1s)]
*  this will be. I believe Donald Trump, if they dare lift a finger against one American, God [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVCiR9S9zDM&t=135.5s)]
*  help them. He will unleash hell. I would put my, I'd put everything I had on that. And [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVCiR9S9zDM&t=140.48s)]
*  the Israelis do deserve our support, and they will have it at the right time, when needed, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVCiR9S9zDM&t=146.85999999999999s)]
*  if necessary. But I will tell you, the world needs to ask itself a question, and I believe [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVCiR9S9zDM&t=151.98s)]
*  I know the answer. I just got back from the Gulf States. I got back from Saudi Arabia, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVCiR9S9zDM&t=157.1s)]
*  from Qatar, and from the UAE. I talked to a lot of people, Mark. They want this regime [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVCiR9S9zDM&t=162.70000000000002s)]
*  out. They just don't have the courage to take them on, because they fear Iranian hegemony [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVCiR9S9zDM&t=169.34s)]
*  in the region. I'll hand it to you. The Israelis had no choice, from my perspective. What's [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVCiR9S9zDM&t=174.96s)]
*  yours? [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVCiR9S9zDM&t=180.96s)]
*  The Iranians are about to get their asses kicked, and it's been coming since Jimmy [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVCiR9S9zDM&t=186.68s)]
*  Carter. They've slaughtered Americans. They've slaughtered Arabs. They've slaughtered their [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVCiR9S9zDM&t=190.82000000000002s)]
*  own people. They think this is Joe Biden's administration, that they would get away. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVCiR9S9zDM&t=196.22s)]
*  We're getting nuclear weapons, and then the world would sit there, wouldn't know what [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVCiR9S9zDM&t=201.46s)]
*  to do about it. You talk about ballistic missiles. Israel sees thousands of ballistic missiles. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVCiR9S9zDM&t=204.96s)]
*  It can't defend against five, 10,000 ballistic missiles. It's not going to sit there and [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVCiR9S9zDM&t=210.16000000000003s)]
*  take it. This Iranian regime is a terrorist Islamist regime. It's an illegitimate regime. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVCiR9S9zDM&t=214.92000000000002s)]
*  It came to power through the point of a gun, and it expects to stay in power with nuclear [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVCiR9S9zDM&t=221.64000000000001s)]
*  weapons. Thank God we have Donald Trump as president of the United States. Thank God [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVCiR9S9zDM&t=226.56s)]
*  Israel has Benjamin Netanyahu as the prime minister. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVCiR9S9zDM&t=231.66000000000003s)]
*  And I will say this. If this Islamic terrorist regime touches one hair on the head of an [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVCiR9S9zDM&t=236.56s)]
*  American citizen, they're going to wish they hadn't. And I want you to understand something, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVCiR9S9zDM&t=244.04s)]
*  Sean. We have hundreds of thousands of American citizens in Israel. We have our experts telling [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVCiR9S9zDM&t=249.64000000000001s)]
*  us about our bases and so forth. We have hundreds of thousands of American citizens in Israel [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVCiR9S9zDM&t=255.52s)]
*  right now. And so this is a big deal. And I would not ever bet against Israel. I would [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVCiR9S9zDM&t=262.82s)]
*  never bet against the United States of America. In the United States of America, I feel comfortable. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVCiR9S9zDM&t=269.82s)]
*  I don't have inside information. It is watching, it is poised, it is prepared. And this Iranian [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVCiR9S9zDM&t=275.21999999999997s)]
*  regime, which thinks that Israel should just sit there and take it, even though they have [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVCiR9S9zDM&t=282.65999999999997s)]
*  mouthpieces in our own country that have given them aid and comfort, I want the Israeli people [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVCiR9S9zDM&t=287.71999999999997s)]
*  to know the overwhelming majority of the American people tonight are rooting for you. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVCiR9S9zDM&t=293.34s)]
*  We hate this regime too. They've tried to kill the president of the United States. Now, [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVCiR9S9zDM&t=300.82s)]
*  this president, I think, has had enough. This attack, I cannot believe, no inside information [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVCiR9S9zDM&t=307.85999999999996s)]
*  would have gone on without us at least getting a wink and a nod. I want the Israeli people [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVCiR9S9zDM&t=314.65999999999997s)]
*  to know that. I want the American people to know that we stand on the side of a free [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVCiR9S9zDM&t=319.9s)]
*  people, of a democracy. This tiny little country is now fighting a war for their survival. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVCiR9S9zDM&t=325.08s)]
*  They're fighting a war for the United States because these intercontinental missiles are [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVCiR9S9zDM&t=332.65999999999997s)]
*  meant for us. How do I know? Because the enemy has told us. They're fighting a war for Europe. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVCiR9S9zDM&t=337.26s)]
*  Europe that keeps trying to destroy this little country through the UN and their own laws [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVCiR9S9zDM&t=343.58s)]
*  and so forth. This tiny little country is fighting a war for the free world against [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVCiR9S9zDM&t=347.46s)]
*  this Islamic Nazi regime that's backed by the communist Chinese, that's backed by the [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVCiR9S9zDM&t=353.54s)]
*  North Koreans, that's backed by the fascist Russian dictator Putin. We should be supporting [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVCiR9S9zDM&t=358.98s)]
*  Israel every step of the way. I know in America we are. I predict right now they had zillions [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVCiR9S9zDM&t=366.21999999999997s)]
*  of chances with President Trump, Steve Witkoff. They had zillions of chances to survive, this [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVCiR9S9zDM&t=373.78000000000003s)]
*  regime to survive, but they chose not to. You want to know why America? Because they [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVCiR9S9zDM&t=380.34000000000003s)]
*  are always building nuclear weapons despite what some of the propagandists in our country [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVCiR9S9zDM&t=385.98s)]
*  say. They always wanted them to threaten and destroy the state of Israel and to threaten [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVCiR9S9zDM&t=390.46000000000004s)]
*  to potentially destroy the United States. What are we supposed to do? What's Israel [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVCiR9S9zDM&t=395.14000000000004s)]
*  supposed to do? Wait until they have nuclear weapons to find out? Well, they're not going [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVCiR9S9zDM&t=398.9s)]
*  to. These ballistic missiles you speak of, these leakers to Axios, which are just undermining [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVCiR9S9zDM&t=403.78s)]
*  our country, undermining Israel, undermining our president, but these leakers who talk [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVCiR9S9zDM&t=409.34s)]
*  about thousands of ballistic missiles. Think about it, America. Let's say a nation in [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVCiR9S9zDM&t=413.85999999999996s)]
*  Central America had thousands of ballistic missiles and they had already shot some at [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVCiR9S9zDM&t=419.34s)]
*  You think we'd take kindly to that? And that same nation was within a hair's breadth of [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVCiR9S9zDM&t=425.5s)]
*  having nuclear weapons and building missiles specifically so they can reach us. Do you [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVCiR9S9zDM&t=432.18s)]
*  think we would put up with that for a second? Well, just because Israel is small, they're [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVCiR9S9zDM&t=436.82s)]
*  not going to do it. It's a nation of warriors. Look at this poor country. They've been in [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVCiR9S9zDM&t=442.38s)]
*  a war for almost two years. They didn't pick a fight. Their people were slaughtered. Look [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVCiR9S9zDM&t=446.98s)]
*  at this poor country having to deal with Iran. We've dealt with these damnable bastards [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVCiR9S9zDM&t=451.78s)]
*  in Iran for half a century since Jimmy Carter let them in. They've killed our people. They've [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVCiR9S9zDM&t=457.21999999999997s)]
*  attacked our embassies. They've backed every terrorist attack against the United States [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVCiR9S9zDM&t=462.46s)]
*  of America. Israel wiped out the Hezbollah chieftains who killed American Marines. They [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVCiR9S9zDM&t=466.7s)]
*  did that. Israel wiped out Sinwar and the others who were pushing terrorism against [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVCiR9S9zDM&t=473.14s)]
*  America and funding what's going on on our college campuses. Think about what this tiny [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVCiR9S9zDM&t=478.53999999999996s)]
*  little country is doing and is up against tonight. Those countries in Europe that are [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVCiR9S9zDM&t=483.53999999999996s)]
*  organizing against Israel and want to create a separate Palestinian state, shame on you. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVCiR9S9zDM&t=489.94s)]
*  You are damnable. You are disgrace. You should be backing Israel. You should be supporting [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVCiR9S9zDM&t=496.41999999999996s)]
*  what they're doing just because you sold out your country, just because through immigration [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVCiR9S9zDM&t=501.94s)]
*  you've destroyed your country doesn't mean Israel should roll over and play dead. The [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVCiR9S9zDM&t=506.62s)]
*  Jews in Israel, some of them survived the Holocaust. Many of them have family members [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVCiR9S9zDM&t=511.9s)]
*  who experienced it. They're not going to do it again. October 7th was the warning cry. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVCiR9S9zDM&t=517.98s)]
*  Iran was behind it. Iran slaughtered those Jews. Iran did it. Iran slaughtered Americans. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVCiR9S9zDM&t=524.98s)]
*  Iran did it. Now Iran's finally, after half a century, going to get their asses kicked. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVCiR9S9zDM&t=532.0600000000001s)]
*  That's my prediction. Mark, by the way, this is what Israel is reporting. We can't independently [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVCiR9S9zDM&t=539.24s)]
*  confirm that the chief of staff, commander of the Revolutionary Guard, the secretary [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVCiR9S9zDM&t=545.04s)]
*  of supreme council and others have been taken out and one of their major nuclear facilities [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVCiR9S9zDM&t=550.34s)]
*  has taken a direct hit, none of which surprises me. I think the most important thing that [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVCiR9S9zDM&t=555.84s)]
*  you said is imagine if this was America. Imagine if we had a Hezbollah to the north [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVCiR9S9zDM&t=561.56s)]
*  where Canada is or if we had a Hamas to the south, if we had Houthi rebels, if we had [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVCiR9S9zDM&t=570.2399999999999s)]
*  other terror groups or neighboring countries all firing missiles into our country. You [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVCiR9S9zDM&t=577.2399999999999s)]
*  know, I've been to Israel a number of times, as you know, and I've been in these underground [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVCiR9S9zDM&t=582.8399999999999s)]
*  terror tunnels, you know, that they, money that should have been spent on hospitals and [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVCiR9S9zDM&t=586.48s)]
*  schools and helping the people in Gaza have better lives, but it wasn't used for that [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVCiR9S9zDM&t=591.44s)]
*  purpose. It was used for terror. I went to the border towns they wrote. You can see with [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVCiR9S9zDM&t=597.16s)]
*  the naked eye Gaza, that one town, when I went there at that time in the previous 10 [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVCiR9S9zDM&t=602.44s)]
*  years, had been hit with 10,000 rockets and you could see the progression and the size [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVCiR9S9zDM&t=608.48s)]
*  and the lethality of those rockets as they have evolved over the years, Mark. Kids could [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVCiR9S9zDM&t=614.7199999999999s)]
*  not play outdoors in the town of Sderot. They had to play in underground bunker playgrounds [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVCiR9S9zDM&t=621.1999999999999s)]
*  because it only took 12 to 13 seconds once a rocket was fired out of Gaza, often using [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVCiR9S9zDM&t=626.9599999999999s)]
*  civilians as shields from schools or hospitals. You had 13 seconds to get the kids out of [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVCiR9S9zDM&t=634.52s)]
*  the streets, so they had to play underground in a bunker. That has been their reality. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVCiR9S9zDM&t=640.12s)]
*  If Americans had to live with that reality, I think they would have a very different perspective. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVCiR9S9zDM&t=644.72s)]
*  But with all that said, Rasmus and Paul, as you know, came out last week. 84% of Americans [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVCiR9S9zDM&t=650.7s)]
*  support Donald Trump ensuring that they don't have nuclear weapons. It looks like Israel [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVCiR9S9zDM&t=656.16s)]
*  has begun that operation tonight, and I agree with your assessment that the U.S. will be [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVCiR9S9zDM&t=661.24s)]
*  there if needed. I do not believe, for those people that always say, well, this is going [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVCiR9S9zDM&t=665.64s)]
*  to be just like Iraq, it's going to be a long protracted war. No. The nature of warfare [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVCiR9S9zDM&t=669.82s)]
*  has changed dramatically. I have been saying that the next gen. Yes. The next generation [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVCiR9S9zDM&t=674.98s)]
*  of war will be fought in air conditioned offices. It's not going to be door to door stepping [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVCiR9S9zDM&t=682.2600000000001s)]
*  over IEDs without up armored Humvees like we went to in Iraq. That's not how it's [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVCiR9S9zDM&t=687.38s)]
*  going to happen. Mark, you get the last word. Go ahead. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVCiR9S9zDM&t=692.98s)]
*  Real quick. You know who's rooting for Israel? The Iranian people. The Iranian people have [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVCiR9S9zDM&t=695.06s)]
*  been slaughtered, butchered, and tortured. Nobody ever talks about the Persian people [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVCiR9S9zDM&t=701.3399999999999s)]
*  who want their liberty. You know who's rooting for Israel? The cowardice Arab countries, [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVCiR9S9zDM&t=706.18s)]
*  except for Qatar perhaps. They keep their mouths shut and pray to God that the Israelis [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVCiR9S9zDM&t=710.9799999999999s)]
*  end this regime. That's the truth. The people in the dungeons, in the prisons, in Iran, [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVCiR9S9zDM&t=715.4599999999999s)]
*  they're rooting for the state of Israel as I speak right now. And we must be and should [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVCiR9S9zDM&t=721.06s)]
*  be too. They take this rash off of the body politic and their nuclear weapons with them. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVCiR9S9zDM&t=726.14s)]
*  The United States, we can live in peace, at least sleep in peace knowing that that Islamic, [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVCiR9S9zDM&t=733.54s)]
*  Nazi, terrorist regime no longer is a nuclear threat. And that is a big change for our military, [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVCiR9S9zDM&t=739.8199999999999s)]
*  for our geopolitical positions and everything else. It's a big defeat for China, for North [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVCiR9S9zDM&t=746.9000000000001s)]
*  Korea, big defeat for Russia, maybe some of the other countries too. But this is an evil, [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVCiR9S9zDM&t=752.74s)]
*  evil regime. And the idea that there are some people who argue, let them have the nukes, [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVCiR9S9zDM&t=760.38s)]
*  we can manage it. What you see on your screen right now America and Sean, ultimately, believe [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVCiR9S9zDM&t=766.9000000000001s)]
*  it or not, is peace. Because when they're done, when they're done and hopefully this [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVCiR9S9zDM&t=774.18s)]
*  regime loses its nuclear power and perhaps its head based on what the Israelis are doing, [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVCiR9S9zDM&t=779.98s)]
*  this will be viewed as one of the greatest acts of preemption for peace in world history. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVCiR9S9zDM&t=785.98s)]
*  That's what's going on. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVCiR9S9zDM&t=793.26s)]
*  It's not the first time Mark. They did it with Iraq, they did it with Syria and it now [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVCiR9S9zDM&t=793.4599999999999s)]
*  became a necessity for them tonight. And frankly, the world has to ask itself, will it be better [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVCiR9S9zDM&t=797.78s)]
*  off? And every, you know, I did learn in the Gulf, on my trip to the Gulf states, that [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVCiR9S9zDM&t=802.7s)]
*  every one of those countries wants this country neutralized. They don't want a nuclear armed [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVCiR9S9zDM&t=808.1800000000001s)]
*  ram. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVCiR9S9zDM&t=814.1800000000001s)]
*  Alright, the great one, Mark Levin, thank you. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVCiR9S9zDM&t=814.5400000000001s)]
