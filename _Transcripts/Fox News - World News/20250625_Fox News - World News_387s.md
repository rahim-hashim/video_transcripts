# BREAKING: Israel, Iran both claiming victory as ceasefire begins
**Fox News - World News:** [June 25, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2E2N1KqVok)
*  All right, let's bring in Mike Tobin who is live in Tel Aviv with the latest on the ground Mike. Good morning [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2E2N1KqVok&t=0.0s)]
*  Good morning. We have both the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and the Iranian president [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2E2N1KqVok&t=6.5s)]
*  Masoud Pesachian [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2E2N1KqVok&t=11.64s)]
*  Claiming victory now in this first full day in which the ceasefire appears to be holding now [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2E2N1KqVok&t=12.92s)]
*  You just heard from President Trump saying that the Iranian nuclear program has been set back has been devastated has been obliterated [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2E2N1KqVok&t=18.0s)]
*  to kind of paraphrase his words, but [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2E2N1KqVok&t=25.560000000000002s)]
*  The contrary reporting that they're referring to we've got that information through the Reuters news agency [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2E2N1KqVok&t=29.18s)]
*  Citing US intelligence officials saying that the Iranian nuclear program was set back a matter of months [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2E2N1KqVok&t=34.82s)]
*  Not years still in light of that you have the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu claiming victory [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2E2N1KqVok&t=41.379999999999995s)]
*  Saying two existential threats to the Jewish state have been removed the Iranian nuclear program and that he claims that they have decimated [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2E2N1KqVok&t=48.019999999999996s)]
*  The ballistic missile arsenal that belonged to Iran. Here's the Prime Minister [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2E2N1KqVok&t=56.18s)]
*  Citizens of Israel on your behalf [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2E2N1KqVok&t=61.74s)]
*  I thank my friend President Trump and the United States [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2E2N1KqVok&t=64.02s)]
*  For their part in the defense of Israel and in removing the Iranian nuclear threat [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2E2N1KqVok&t=67.7s)]
*  the participation of the US in the campaign not only [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2E2N1KqVok&t=73.1s)]
*  Organizationally, but also offensively is a historic event [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2E2N1KqVok&t=77.38s)]
*  Now the war in Gaza continues and Israel suffered a setback there seven soldiers have been killed [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2E2N1KqVok&t=81.94s)]
*  They were operating in a Puma armored vehicle, which is pretty much just an old British Challenger tank with a turret removed [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2E2N1KqVok&t=87.02s)]
*  A Palestinian managed to attach a bomb to that vehicle and detonate it killing the soldiers inside [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2E2N1KqVok&t=93.66s)]
*  50 Israeli hostages are still believed to be held in the Gaza Strip and 20 of them are believed to be alive [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2E2N1KqVok&t=99.38s)]
*  Carly and Todd. All right, Mike Tobin live for us Mike. Thank you [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2E2N1KqVok&t=105.54s)]
*  Let's bring in former Navy Submariner Naval Defense expert and senior fellow at the Hudson Institute [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2E2N1KqVok&t=108.82s)]
*  Brian Clark Brian [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2E2N1KqVok&t=114.69999999999999s)]
*  Thank you so much for joining us this morning and speaking of the Navy US Navy subs launched 30 Tomahawk [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2E2N1KqVok&t=115.89999999999999s)]
*  Missiles as part of the Iranian strike [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2E2N1KqVok&t=122.17999999999999s)]
*  Operation Midnight Hammer. So what do you think about the president's assessment of the success of that mission that we just heard? [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2E2N1KqVok&t=125.41999999999999s)]
*  Well, I think these intel reports are often pretty preliminary, right? [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2E2N1KqVok&t=132.9s)]
*  So the first time you look at it, you're going to make a really rough assessment of what might have happened [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2E2N1KqVok&t=136.7s)]
*  And I think the strike was obviously successful [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2E2N1KqVok&t=140.02s)]
*  Obviously caused a lot of damage. Obviously, I took away the ability to access those facilities and probably damaged them significantly underground [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2E2N1KqVok&t=143.78s)]
*  So I think that's sort of a given we everybody agrees to that [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2E2N1KqVok&t=151.06s)]
*  I think the question is how long did this delay the program? [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2E2N1KqVok&t=154.1s)]
*  And I think a lot of the initial assessments are based on the fact that the [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2E2N1KqVok&t=157.62s)]
*  uranium is still around and then maybe got moved somewhere else [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2E2N1KqVok&t=161.14s)]
*  But there's a big difference between having some somewhat enriched uranium in a pile somewhere and having the ability to translate that into a bomb [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2E2N1KqVok&t=163.94s)]
*  Well, one of the big things that will come out of this NATO summit this morning is of course the five percent increase in NATO defense spending [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2E2N1KqVok&t=171.85999999999999s)]
*  For all 32 nations that five percent of their GDP [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2E2N1KqVok&t=178.18s)]
*  How significant is that in terms of weapons? [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2E2N1KqVok&t=181.7s)]
*  That that money will be spent towards and how much strength does that have to do with the defense of the nation? [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2E2N1KqVok&t=184.74s)]
*  How much stronger do you think the NATO alliance will be as a result of this increase spending? [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2E2N1KqVok&t=190.82s)]
*  Well, it's huge. I mean you think about most of these NATO countries have been barely getting to two percent of GDP [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2E2N1KqVok&t=196.1s)]
*  So this is a almost doubling of the money they spend on their military [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2E2N1KqVok&t=200.82s)]
*  And then they're in addition to that spending 1.5 percent of GDP on infrastructure and cyber security and some of the other [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2E2N1KqVok&t=205.06s)]
*  Resilience initiatives that are needed to be able to defend against a nearby threat like Russia [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2E2N1KqVok&t=211.29999999999998s)]
*  So it's a huge increase and it will cause those militaries to be a lot stronger [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2E2N1KqVok&t=215.94000000000003s)]
*  I think it'll be particularly impressive to see the level of redundancy that we'll get in in europe [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2E2N1KqVok&t=221.22000000000003s)]
*  I think some people say redundancy is bad [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2E2N1KqVok&t=226.26000000000002s)]
*  But in the military sense, it's usually good because you have more more capacity then and I think one of the things this will do [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2E2N1KqVok&t=228.74s)]
*  Is allow the NATO countries to maybe [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2E2N1KqVok&t=233.86s)]
*  Be able to combine their efforts and be able to have more capacity to address the russian threat instead of having to specialize in one [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2E2N1KqVok&t=236.82000000000002s)]
*  Or two military disciplines. Yeah [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2E2N1KqVok&t=242.98000000000002s)]
*  And right now i'm thinking back to march 4th when president trump made those comments [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2E2N1KqVok&t=244.98s)]
*  Before congress and he promised to establish a new office of shipbuilding within the white house revitalize the industry and bolster [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2E2N1KqVok&t=249.06s)]
*  American navy strength. How are we doing on that front? [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2E2N1KqVok&t=256.18s)]
*  I assumed pretty well. I was impressed with the office's actions to start the the gears turning in terms of regulatory changes that start to [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2E2N1KqVok&t=260.34s)]
*  incentivize companies to move into the shipbuilding industry. We've already seen some [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2E2N1KqVok&t=268.32s)]
*  Investment in us shipyards so hanwha [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2E2N1KqVok&t=272.58s)]
*  Industries, which is a korean company is invested and bought the philly shipyard that shipyard is now looking at building out commercial ships [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2E2N1KqVok&t=275.78s)]
*  There's a huge amount of money going into the us navy shipbuilding effort through this reconciliation bill [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2E2N1KqVok&t=283.53999999999996s)]
*  So definitely a lot of movement in shipbuilding. I would say we're going to see somewhat of a renaissance in [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2E2N1KqVok&t=289.78s)]
*  us shipbuilding [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2E2N1KqVok&t=294.97999999999996s)]
*  The only question is can we sustain it and will there be a demand for these ships on the part of companies that do shipping operations? [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2E2N1KqVok&t=295.78s)]
*  and [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2E2N1KqVok&t=303.21999999999997s)]
*  Going back for the past two weeks now with the iranian military being [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2E2N1KqVok&t=304.41999999999996s)]
*  I guess the key word of the day is decimated in terms of their military leaders. What is your assessment of [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2E2N1KqVok&t=309.46s)]
*  iranian military capability right now [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2E2N1KqVok&t=315.59999999999997s)]
*  Uh, it's pretty much, uh [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2E2N1KqVok&t=319.94s)]
*  completely [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2E2N1KqVok&t=322.17999999999995s)]
*  Destroyed I guess right now. There's very little of iranian military left iran's military consists of the the [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2E2N1KqVok&t=323.62s)]
*  The general the military force the the traditional military and that's largely been destroyed by by virtue of israel's attacks [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2E2N1KqVok&t=329.86s)]
*  And then there's also this iran revolution revolutionary guard corps, which is the special operations part of the of the military and it's been [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2E2N1KqVok&t=336.90000000000003s)]
*  Damaged to quite an extent. It's unclear exactly how how far down it is [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2E2N1KqVok&t=346.42s)]
*  But both sides of the military have been pretty much decimated and there's not much of it left and the question now is [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2E2N1KqVok&t=350.26s)]
*  Iran is going to lash out with its proxies [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2E2N1KqVok&t=356.58s)]
*  But doesn't really have the ability to defend its own territory [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2E2N1KqVok&t=358.74s)]
*  And so how far does it go knowing that it's pretty much undefended right now? [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2E2N1KqVok&t=361.46s)]
*  Very good insight and the nato secretary general congratulated president trump on the strike [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2E2N1KqVok&t=365.22s)]
*  It is certainly something that will be discussed throughout the whole entire day during this nato summit in the netherlands brian clark [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2E2N1KqVok&t=369.62s)]
*  Thank you for joining us. I'm steve juicy. I'm brian killmead and i'm ainsley erhart [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2E2N1KqVok&t=375.78000000000003s)]
