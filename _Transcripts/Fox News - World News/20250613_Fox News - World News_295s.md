# EXPERT WARNS: Iran could activate sleeper cells inside US, Israel after attack
**Fox News - World News:** [June 13, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX5EAWgW47I)
*  Let's bring in former FBI Special Agent and Navy SEAL Jonathan Gilliam. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX5EAWgW47I&t=0.0s)]
*  Jonathan, good morning to you. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX5EAWgW47I&t=3.68s)]
*  I want to talk to you about what has led to this moment in time. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX5EAWgW47I&t=4.96s)]
*  When you think about since October 7th, what Israel was capable of doing with the pager [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX5EAWgW47I&t=8.76s)]
*  attack against Hezbollah, where Hamas stands right now, and where the Houthis that have, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX5EAWgW47I&t=13.52s)]
*  with the help of the United States, been very much decimated and their capabilities to strike [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX5EAWgW47I&t=18.46s)]
*  back. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX5EAWgW47I&t=23.56s)]
*  All of that leading to this moment that we sit in right now. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX5EAWgW47I&t=24.560000000000002s)]
*  Right. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX5EAWgW47I&t=29.68s)]
*  And you know, it's interesting when we look at this, Israel has actually evolved back [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX5EAWgW47I&t=30.68s)]
*  to the out of the box thinking and the tactics of eliminating your enemy, like it was before [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX5EAWgW47I&t=34.64s)]
*  World War II and during World War II. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX5EAWgW47I&t=42.519999999999996s)]
*  After that, the world moved to a different way of fighting. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX5EAWgW47I&t=44.72s)]
*  And we've seen a tremendous amount of advances in techniques and evolution of warfare in [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX5EAWgW47I&t=48.08s)]
*  Ukraine and Russia and the way that the Iranian intel services in China use social media, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX5EAWgW47I&t=54.56s)]
*  for instance, to actually form social issues within other nations. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX5EAWgW47I&t=61.400000000000006s)]
*  And now we see this, where Israel has gone back and systematically taken out the proxies. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX5EAWgW47I&t=68.16s)]
*  Now, this is very important because Iran does not fight their own wars outside of their [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX5EAWgW47I&t=74.24000000000001s)]
*  borders. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX5EAWgW47I&t=79.76s)]
*  They use proxies. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX5EAWgW47I&t=80.76s)]
*  And I don't know if most people realize that. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX5EAWgW47I&t=81.76s)]
*  They have targeted Iran over, excuse me, Israel over and over using Hamas, Hezbollah. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX5EAWgW47I&t=83.72s)]
*  They went after Israel's strategic targets using the Houthis. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX5EAWgW47I&t=92.48s)]
*  And so somewhere along the way, Israel figured this out. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX5EAWgW47I&t=98.44s)]
*  And I think this is part of at least a three-prong operation. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX5EAWgW47I&t=104.48s)]
*  First was the intel gathering about Hamas and Hezbollah and Iran themselves, along with [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX5EAWgW47I&t=109.2s)]
*  the Houthis. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX5EAWgW47I&t=114.28s)]
*  And then they started carrying out attacks to really just cripple Hamas and Hezbollah. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX5EAWgW47I&t=115.86s)]
*  We, as you just said, helped with the Houthis. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX5EAWgW47I&t=124.04s)]
*  But along that way, there was an initial attack inside of Iran. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX5EAWgW47I&t=126.44s)]
*  It tested their air defenses. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX5EAWgW47I&t=130.1s)]
*  We saw that they were horrible. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX5EAWgW47I&t=131.6s)]
*  And it showed that Iran did not have the ability to go the distance all the way over themselves [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX5EAWgW47I&t=133.3s)]
*  into Israel and actually effectively attack Israel. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX5EAWgW47I&t=139.2s)]
*  So with all of that in place and understanding all that and all those different missions [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX5EAWgW47I&t=143.2s)]
*  working, they were able to then go and start putting these operatives inside Iran and setting [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX5EAWgW47I&t=149.28s)]
*  up for the big attack. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX5EAWgW47I&t=156.48s)]
*  And I think the rest of the world needs to realize that this is the way warfighting has [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX5EAWgW47I&t=158.24s)]
*  evolved and Israel is successful because they did it that way. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX5EAWgW47I&t=164.07999999999998s)]
*  They didn't just do it politically. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX5EAWgW47I&t=167.84s)]
*  So Jonathan, what do you think Iran is doing right now? [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX5EAWgW47I&t=169.6s)]
*  Are they calling up their proxies that have been severely degraded over the past year [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX5EAWgW47I&t=172.16s)]
*  and a half and saying, help us strike back? [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX5EAWgW47I&t=177.52s)]
*  Well, so here's where the real issue, I think, of the future for all of us comes into play, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX5EAWgW47I&t=181.0s)]
*  is that we constantly call and I've heard several guests call Iran the terrorists of [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX5EAWgW47I&t=188.16s)]
*  the region. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX5EAWgW47I&t=194.32s)]
*  But the reality is terrorism is a tactic that they use. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX5EAWgW47I&t=195.36s)]
*  Their ideology is fundamental Islam. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX5EAWgW47I&t=199.4s)]
*  And this has been a case for thousands of years. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX5EAWgW47I&t=201.48000000000002s)]
*  And Iran has never evolved or progressed to where they work things out diplomatically. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX5EAWgW47I&t=205.96s)]
*  You could never trust them. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX5EAWgW47I&t=213.08s)]
*  And so with this fundamentalism, this is the fear that I have, is that even inside the [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX5EAWgW47I&t=214.92000000000002s)]
*  exact attack that Israel just carried out inside the borders of Iran, with the way that [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX5EAWgW47I&t=220.56s)]
*  our border was down for four years, there could be cells here that could be activated [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX5EAWgW47I&t=228.28s)]
*  by Iran or proxies and groups that are loyal to Iran. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX5EAWgW47I&t=233.48s)]
*  Same thing in Israel. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX5EAWgW47I&t=238.72s)]
*  That's basically what happened on October 7th when the Hamas went in and attacked Israel. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX5EAWgW47I&t=240.08s)]
*  They weren't prepared for that. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX5EAWgW47I&t=246.92000000000002s)]
*  And so we need to be prepared. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX5EAWgW47I&t=248.68s)]
*  Israel needs to be prepared for those types of attacks. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX5EAWgW47I&t=250.4s)]
*  And the number one way to do that is for the citizenry to be aware. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX5EAWgW47I&t=253.12s)]
*  And that's what's going to prevent the majority of this. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX5EAWgW47I&t=257.32s)]
*  But Israel is definitely on top of their game. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX5EAWgW47I&t=259.40000000000003s)]
*  And right now, Iran should be in panic mode because they don't even have the ability [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX5EAWgW47I&t=261.56s)]
*  right now at this point to run operations with their proxies because they're fighting [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX5EAWgW47I&t=266.2s)]
*  for their lives. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX5EAWgW47I&t=270.56s)]
*  Yeah, the fear of sleeper cells in the United States is very concerning. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX5EAWgW47I&t=271.56s)]
*  Something that the president is very aware of and trying to mitigate as we speak. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX5EAWgW47I&t=275.36s)]
*  Jonathan, thank you for joining us this morning. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX5EAWgW47I&t=280.56s)]
