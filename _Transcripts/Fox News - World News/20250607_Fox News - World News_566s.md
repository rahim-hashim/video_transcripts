# CIA working to ‘counter’ the China threat, explains Director Ratcliffe
**Fox News - World News:** [June 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHZhHj9S0Lg)
*  Director John Radcliffe, thank you so much for having us here at the CIA. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHZhHj9S0Lg&t=0.0s)]
*  This is incredible to be here with you. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHZhHj9S0Lg&t=5.72s)]
*  And I know that one of the fundamentals that you talked about coming in here was restoring [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHZhHj9S0Lg&t=8.74s)]
*  mission clarity. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHZhHj9S0Lg&t=13.72s)]
*  So tell me where you are on that. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHZhHj9S0Lg&t=15.16s)]
*  What does that look like and how far have you come? [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHZhHj9S0Lg&t=16.7s)]
*  The CIA, as you know, is the finest foreign intelligence agency in the world. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHZhHj9S0Lg&t=19.16s)]
*  That's our history. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHZhHj9S0Lg&t=23.98s)]
*  But we've had leaders fall away from that core mission, us not be as effective as we [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHZhHj9S0Lg&t=25.46s)]
*  need to be in what we do in terms of collecting foreign intelligence and stealing secrets [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHZhHj9S0Lg&t=31.18s)]
*  and providing President Trump a decisive strategic advantage against our foreign adversaries. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHZhHj9S0Lg&t=37.5s)]
*  That we're not about politics, that we're about collecting intelligence that matters, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHZhHj9S0Lg&t=44.18s)]
*  that makes a difference, that gives him an advantage as he makes decisions, whether it's [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHZhHj9S0Lg&t=49.7s)]
*  against adversaries like China, Russia, Iran, North Korea, we're dealing with terrorists. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHZhHj9S0Lg&t=54.38s)]
*  Anytime he has engagements with the rest of the world, we want to make sure that he [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHZhHj9S0Lg&t=61.14s)]
*  is armed with the best intelligence to make the best decisions to keep Americans safe. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHZhHj9S0Lg&t=64.38s)]
*  You talked about wanting to eliminate what you call well-documented politicization of [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHZhHj9S0Lg&t=69.38s)]
*  this agency. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHZhHj9S0Lg&t=75.38s)]
*  So what did you find that led you to say that and what have you done to ensure that that's [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHZhHj9S0Lg&t=76.7s)]
*  no longer happening? [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHZhHj9S0Lg&t=82.18s)]
*  Well, you know, everyone saw it, Laura. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHZhHj9S0Lg&t=83.38000000000001s)]
*  It's no secret. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHZhHj9S0Lg&t=85.82000000000001s)]
*  So when you had former leaders in the intelligence community use the Steele dossier as part of [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHZhHj9S0Lg&t=87.26s)]
*  the official intelligence community assessment of what took place in the 2016 election, and [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHZhHj9S0Lg&t=94.82000000000001s)]
*  when you had some of those same intelligence leaders then four years later say that Hunter [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHZhHj9S0Lg&t=101.54s)]
*  Biden's laptop was Russian disinformation, that it wasn't real. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHZhHj9S0Lg&t=107.7s)]
*  Those were the types of politicization that really tarnish what the intelligence community [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHZhHj9S0Lg&t=111.58000000000001s)]
*  is supposed to do. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHZhHj9S0Lg&t=117.02000000000001s)]
*  We're supposed to be apolitical. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHZhHj9S0Lg&t=118.22s)]
*  And that's what President Trump wants me to be. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHZhHj9S0Lg&t=120.26s)]
*  We're going to be better. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHZhHj9S0Lg&t=122.22s)]
*  We're going to get back to what made the CIA great. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHZhHj9S0Lg&t=123.9s)]
*  Well, we did see this past weekend, this this horrific terror attack in Boulder, Colorado. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHZhHj9S0Lg&t=126.26s)]
*  What are you focused on to eliminate terrorism here, both abroad and domestically here in [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHZhHj9S0Lg&t=131.26s)]
*  the U.S.? [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHZhHj9S0Lg&t=136.94s)]
*  The Department of Homeland Security and the FBI is responsible for, you know, lone wolf [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHZhHj9S0Lg&t=137.45999999999998s)]
*  attacks. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHZhHj9S0Lg&t=141.26s)]
*  But the role of the CIA, Laura, is to make sure that we're confronting and countering [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHZhHj9S0Lg&t=141.61999999999998s)]
*  terrorists over there before they come over here, whether it's Al Qaeda or ISIS or Al [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHZhHj9S0Lg&t=149.73999999999998s)]
*  Shabaab. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHZhHj9S0Lg&t=155.57999999999998s)]
*  Every weekend I come in and I brief President Trump on the success that we've had on his [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHZhHj9S0Lg&t=156.98s)]
*  behalf. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHZhHj9S0Lg&t=160.66s)]
*  And as you know, he has a history of being successful against terrorists, against ISIS [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHZhHj9S0Lg&t=161.61999999999998s)]
*  and against terrorist regimes like Iran. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHZhHj9S0Lg&t=166.9s)]
*  And so, again, this is what we need to get back to. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHZhHj9S0Lg&t=168.86s)]
*  And this is the challenge that he wants me to inspire the CIA to do here. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHZhHj9S0Lg&t=171.94s)]
*  And we're off to a great start. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHZhHj9S0Lg&t=176.26s)]
*  So explain where we are with with China, with the CCP and what you guys are doing here at [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHZhHj9S0Lg&t=178.3s)]
*  the agency. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHZhHj9S0Lg&t=183.46s)]
*  So to your point, Laura, you know, when I was DNI for President Trump and his first [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHZhHj9S0Lg&t=184.5s)]
*  administration, as you recall, we were accused of outsizing China as a threat. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHZhHj9S0Lg&t=188.98000000000002s)]
*  It was a peaceful China, right? [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHZhHj9S0Lg&t=194.57999999999998s)]
*  But, you know, now, after Covid, after the Taiwan aggression, after flying spycraft over [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHZhHj9S0Lg&t=198.7s)]
*  the United States for eight days during the Biden administration, stealing our intellectual [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHZhHj9S0Lg&t=204.82s)]
*  property, taking advantage of us on trade, no one's saying that anymore. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHZhHj9S0Lg&t=209.34s)]
*  So the way to counter China is to go on offense. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHZhHj9S0Lg&t=213.54s)]
*  And so we released two Mandarin speaking videos to the Chinese people inviting [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHZhHj9S0Lg&t=217.18s)]
*  them to contact us through the dark web, because a lot of the people in China are not [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHZhHj9S0Lg&t=224.46s)]
*  happy with what's happening and they can be great sources of intelligence for us. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHZhHj9S0Lg&t=229.98000000000002s)]
*  We'll have more people inside behind China's great wall and giving us intelligence and [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHZhHj9S0Lg&t=235.58s)]
*  information on what's happening with the with the PRC and its ruling party, the Chinese [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHZhHj9S0Lg&t=243.78s)]
*  Communist Party. It's those types of things that we're really focused on when it comes [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHZhHj9S0Lg&t=248.34s)]
*  to China is making sure, again, that we're collecting more and reporting more intelligence [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHZhHj9S0Lg&t=253.29999999999998s)]
*  for the president to give him his advantage that he needs when he deals with President Xi. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHZhHj9S0Lg&t=258.5s)]
*  Well, last week, FBI Director Kash Patel flagged that the FBI caught a government-employed [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHZhHj9S0Lg&t=263.78s)]
*  IT specialist who was attempting to transmit classified national defense information to a [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHZhHj9S0Lg&t=270.94s)]
*  foreign country. I'm sure here at the CIA, you guys have things locked down, but are you [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHZhHj9S0Lg&t=277.3s)]
*  on the lookout constantly for things like that to happen? [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHZhHj9S0Lg&t=282.22s)]
*  Fortunately, we have a foreign partner who notified us of that, and that's how Director [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHZhHj9S0Lg&t=285.3s)]
*  Patel was able to move quickly and arrest that individual before any damage was done. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHZhHj9S0Lg&t=290.94000000000005s)]
*  But we constantly have to be aware of that. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHZhHj9S0Lg&t=297.1s)]
*  You know, unfortunately, we have people that will for financial motives or for political [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHZhHj9S0Lg&t=300.14000000000004s)]
*  motives, release classified information that can help our adversaries. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHZhHj9S0Lg&t=306.74s)]
*  So it's one of the things that across the entire Trump administration we're concerned [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHZhHj9S0Lg&t=311.46s)]
*  about, we're focused on. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHZhHj9S0Lg&t=316.38s)]
*  And as you can see, there are a lot more prosecutions and an aggressive approach to it that [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHZhHj9S0Lg&t=317.97999999999996s)]
*  didn't exist for the last four years. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHZhHj9S0Lg&t=322.94s)]
*  And again, President Trump has made this a high priority. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHZhHj9S0Lg&t=324.9s)]
*  So it's something that Director Patel and I talk about a lot. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHZhHj9S0Lg&t=327.97999999999996s)]
*  Well, I think this agency, just to sit here on this seal, I mean, it feels so important [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHZhHj9S0Lg&t=331.82s)]
*  and so special. And this is an agency that a lot of people are curious about. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHZhHj9S0Lg&t=337.41999999999996s)]
*  We don't hear a lot about it. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHZhHj9S0Lg&t=340.9s)]
*  And I know that's for good reason. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHZhHj9S0Lg&t=341.94s)]
*  But tell me about the personnel. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHZhHj9S0Lg&t=343.65999999999997s)]
*  I don't think that the American people hear enough about the people who work here at this [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHZhHj9S0Lg&t=345.9s)]
*  building, who work abroad around the world. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHZhHj9S0Lg&t=350.3s)]
*  There is a real personal cost and a personal sacrifice that goes in to working for the [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHZhHj9S0Lg&t=352.62s)]
*  CIA. Well, first of all, to be able to get a job in this place is really, really difficult. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHZhHj9S0Lg&t=357.74s)]
*  So people have to go through an incredible vetting process because, again, we're trusting [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHZhHj9S0Lg&t=364.7s)]
*  them with our most sensitive national security information. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHZhHj9S0Lg&t=369.46s)]
*  And these are people in many cases that are putting their lives on the line, operating [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHZhHj9S0Lg&t=372.82s)]
*  covertly, operating in the darkest corners, in the most difficult, austere environments [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHZhHj9S0Lg&t=377.21999999999997s)]
*  around the world. They're doing it on government pay, but they're doing it because they [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHZhHj9S0Lg&t=382.21999999999997s)]
*  love their country. The vast majority of the people who work for the CIA are here because [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHZhHj9S0Lg&t=387.17999999999995s)]
*  they love their country. They want to serve their country. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHZhHj9S0Lg&t=391.94s)]
*  And in many cases, unfortunately, they sacrifice a lot, including their own lives. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHZhHj9S0Lg&t=395.22s)]
*  You know, our military heroes, when they give their life for our country, there are [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHZhHj9S0Lg&t=401.46000000000004s)]
*  eulogies and obituaries and stories that talk about the selfless, heroic acts that they [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHZhHj9S0Lg&t=407.98s)]
*  took. Here at the CIA, it's a silent sacrifice because people are operating undercover. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHZhHj9S0Lg&t=413.58s)]
*  And in some cases, they're doing things where we can't acknowledge that the United States [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHZhHj9S0Lg&t=419.54s)]
*  was involved. So think about that. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHZhHj9S0Lg&t=423.3s)]
*  You give your life for your country. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHZhHj9S0Lg&t=424.94s)]
*  And we have on our memorial wall, we have 140 stars of people that have done exactly [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHZhHj9S0Lg&t=426.58s)]
*  that. And in many cases, no one ever knows of the incredible, heroic things that they [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHZhHj9S0Lg&t=432.74s)]
*  did on behalf of their country where they lost their lives and they can never be celebrated. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHZhHj9S0Lg&t=439.78000000000003s)]
*  That really speaks to the kind of person that's willing to work here. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHZhHj9S0Lg&t=444.98s)]
*  It's an incredible privilege to lead an organization like this that that has a history [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHZhHj9S0Lg&t=448.58s)]
*  where really the only thing that we're able to talk about publicly often are the failures, [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHZhHj9S0Lg&t=452.85999999999996s)]
*  not the successes. And the successes so far outweigh, you know, I can tell you that if [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHZhHj9S0Lg&t=457.97999999999996s)]
*  the CIA wasn't here, our adversaries would move quickly against the United States. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHZhHj9S0Lg&t=463.9s)]
*  Oftentimes, we are the first line of defense. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHZhHj9S0Lg&t=469.58s)]
*  We are what's holding back our worst enemies around the world because they know that CIA [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHZhHj9S0Lg&t=472.05999999999995s)]
*  is on guard and on the watch in almost every country around the world, whether we're [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHZhHj9S0Lg&t=478.02s)]
*  welcome there or not. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHZhHj9S0Lg&t=483.14s)]
*  What is your hope going forward? [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHZhHj9S0Lg&t=484.82s)]
*  Say, 10 years from now, when people look at the CIA and what legacy do you, Director John [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHZhHj9S0Lg&t=487.21999999999997s)]
*  Radcliffe, hope to leave here? [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHZhHj9S0Lg&t=493.14s)]
*  Well, my legacy will be whatever President Trump's legacy is. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHZhHj9S0Lg&t=495.74s)]
