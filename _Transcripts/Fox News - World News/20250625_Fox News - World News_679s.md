# 'The Five': The media is 'running wild'
**Fox News - World News:** [June 25, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8)
*  The President is wrapping the summit with a press conference for the ages. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=0.0s)]
*  Operation Midnight hammering the liberal media for hyping up a preliminary low-confidence [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=12.8s)]
*  intel report that suggests the strikes on Iran's nuclear program only delayed it by [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=18.080000000000002s)]
*  a few months. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=24.16s)]
*  Watch. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=25.68s)]
*  Oh, fake news, CNN? [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=26.68s)]
*  Oh, yeah, yeah, here we go. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=28.72s)]
*  When you hear this question. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=30.32s)]
*  We've also spoken to people who have seen the site, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=31.88s)]
*  and the site is obliterated. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=34.72s)]
*  Mr. President, you talked about expecting [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=37.32s)]
*  some on-the-ground assessments at Fordow and other sites. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=39.6s)]
*  Now, here, here again. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=43.08s)]
*  And U.S.? [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=45.16s)]
*  It's been obliterated, Kelly. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=46.72s)]
*  It's been obliterated. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=48.32s)]
*  Obliterated, Kelly. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=51.44s)]
*  Lock it up. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=53.0s)]
*  President Trump calling in the reinforcements [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=53.72s)]
*  to help him obliterate the fake news [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=56.32s)]
*  and the leakers who helped them watch. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=58.76s)]
*  If you want to make an assessment of what happened [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=61.56s)]
*  at Fordow, you better get a big shovel and go really deep, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=63.84s)]
*  because Iran's nuclear program is obliterated. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=68.04s)]
*  Leaking that type of information, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=71.2s)]
*  whatever the information, whatever side it comes out on, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=73.12s)]
*  is outrageous. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=76.03999999999999s)]
*  It's treasonous. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=76.96000000000001s)]
*  These leakers are professional stabbers. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=78.68s)]
*  That's what they are. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=81.24000000000001s)]
*  And somebody's got daddy issues. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=83.2s)]
*  NATO Secretary General giving President Trump props [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=85.68s)]
*  for fathering the ceasefire between Israel and Iran. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=89.56s)]
*  Like two kids in a schoolyard, you know they fight like hell? [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=94.08000000000001s)]
*  You can't stop them. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=97.0s)]
*  Let them fight for about two, three minutes, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=97.80000000000001s)]
*  then it's easy to stop them. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=100.0s)]
*  Daddy has to sometimes use strong language. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=101.60000000000001s)]
*  He called you daddy earlier. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=104.16000000000001s)]
*  Do you regard your NATO allies as kind of children? [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=107.2s)]
*  No, he likes me. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=111.32000000000001s)]
*  I think he likes me. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=112.16000000000001s)]
*  If he doesn't, I'll let you know. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=113.56s)]
*  I'll come back and I'll hit him hard, OK? [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=114.84s)]
*  But do you... [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=116.8s)]
*  He did. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=117.48s)]
*  He did it very affectionately. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=118.0s)]
*  Daddy, you're my daddy. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=118.96000000000001s)]
*  Do you think your NATO allies deserve a good spanking? [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=120.04s)]
*  What did you make of that exchange, Dana? [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=126.96000000000001s)]
*  Well, I loved the entire press conference, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=128.88s)]
*  especially that it ended up in America's newsroom, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=130.72s)]
*  because we usually don't get any of these press conferences. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=133.04s)]
*  They happen usually in the afternoon. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=135.56s)]
*  He took so many questions. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=137.8s)]
*  And I would love... [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=139.2s)]
*  I kind of wanted to do a flashback to Biden [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=140.0s)]
*  at the NATO meeting last year. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=141.92000000000002s)]
*  And just a comparison, right? [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=144.32s)]
*  Here is America triumphant. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=146.2s)]
*  America saying, OK, we'll help. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=147.84s)]
*  You have to help yourselves. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=150.52s)]
*  Israelis help themselves. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=151.44s)]
*  And then we'll come in and we'll help you. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=152.84s)]
*  Trump was there with all of NATO saying, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=154.92000000000002s)]
*  if you guys are willing to pony up and pay your share. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=156.52s)]
*  Yeah, we're in. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=158.52s)]
*  We're a part of it, except for you, Spain. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=159.52s)]
*  And we'll have a conversation about that later. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=160.84s)]
*  The question about the daddy thing, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=163.64s)]
*  I think it was kind of silly. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=165.12s)]
*  I think maybe something was a little lost in translation. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=166.36s)]
*  The president was using a metaphor. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=168.96s)]
*  The NATO director was using a metaphor. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=171.08s)]
*  He was talking about two kids fighting. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=173.2s)]
*  And the dad has to come in and say, knock it off. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=174.88s)]
*  That's what that was about. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=177.12s)]
*  It wasn't that funny. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=178.16s)]
*  Except until Rubio lost it. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=180.68s)]
*  He was so stone-faced the entire time. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=183.64s)]
*  And then if you can pull it up, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=185.88s)]
*  Marco Rubio just like breaks character [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=187.0s)]
*  and has to start laughing because he thought it was so funny. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=189.92s)]
*  It is pretty incredible how many questions [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=193.0s)]
*  the president is willing to take. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=194.84s)]
*  And it's been a whirlwind. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=196.51999999999998s)]
*  Think of how much time and effort [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=198.07999999999998s)]
*  and no sleep for several days, [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=200.35999999999999s)]
*  including the ones leading up to the attack, [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=202.48s)]
*  the ones afterwards, he gets on a plane, he goes to NATO, [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=204.64s)]
*  he has all these meetings, everybody wants to meet with him. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=207.04s)]
*  It's a very different meeting for him [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=209.35999999999999s)]
*  than it was eight years ago. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=210.88s)]
*  Well, it's also a very different meeting than last year [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=212.16s)]
*  when President Biden went overseas and then came back [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=215.44s)]
*  and was incapacitated for weeks. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=217.79999999999998s)]
*  And then blew that big debate. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=220.0s)]
*  So, Jessie, it almost seems like CNN [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=222.83999999999997s)]
*  and the New York Times are using this leaked report, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=225.56s)]
*  whatever it is, to cheer triumphantly [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=228.88s)]
*  that perhaps the bunker buster bomber strike [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=232.32s)]
*  wasn't quite as effective as the administration is claiming. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=235.92s)]
*  What do you make of that? [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=239.32s)]
*  And will the president get credit [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=240.4s)]
*  if he did in fact dismantle Iran's nuclear program? [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=242.36s)]
*  Of course, if there's one thing America can make, it's a bomb. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=245.28s)]
*  Ask the Japanese, ask the Germans. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=249.52s)]
*  I've never heard of an American bomb not working, have you? [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=252.04s)]
*  If this didn't work and it was a dud, [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=255.16s)]
*  Netanyahu would have been on the phone with Trump [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=257.48s)]
*  saying, let's do another run. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=259.32s)]
*  If it didn't work, the Iranians wouldn't have had a ceasefire. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=260.96000000000004s)]
*  This was such a precise strike. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=265.88s)]
*  They put these bombs down the mountain's ventilation shaft. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=268.36s)]
*  Okay, this didn't have to explode and bore into the mountain. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=273.72s)]
*  They put these things untouched [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=277.40000000000003s)]
*  and it slid down the ventilation shaft [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=280.20000000000005s)]
*  and exploded in the main hall [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=283.88s)]
*  and then collapsed the roof of the cavern [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=286.52000000000004s)]
*  and caused a fire. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=289.32s)]
*  You could even see the discoloration [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=291.52000000000004s)]
*  at the top of the mountain. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=292.48s)]
*  This wasn't like carpet bombing the North Vietnamese jungles. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=293.72s)]
*  This was as precise a strike as you can get. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=297.68s)]
*  They compared the target to something [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=301.08000000000004s)]
*  the size of a refrigerator [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=303.24s)]
*  and they did it from 13,000 feet. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=305.48s)]
*  Now, the woman is the same reporter [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=309.08000000000004s)]
*  who said the laptop was Russian [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=311.92s)]
*  and now she says our bombs don't work. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=314.28000000000003s)]
*  You'd think she would have been fired [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=317.12s)]
*  for getting hoodwinked by the deep state a couple years ago, [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=319.56s)]
*  but she actually got promoted. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=323.8s)]
*  She got promoted for being wrong. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=325.72s)]
*  She got a raise for being wrong. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=328.24s)]
*  Now she's on CNN getting hoodwinked all over again [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=330.44s)]
*  because that's the point. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=333.32s)]
*  She's not there to be right. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=334.16s)]
*  She's just there to hurt Donald Trump. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=335.84000000000003s)]
*  And I don't understand CNN's reporting [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=337.88s)]
*  because CNN said before the strike, [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=339.36s)]
*  they were years away from getting a nuke [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=340.84000000000003s)]
*  and then after the strike, they're two months. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=342.84000000000003s)]
*  So you're closer to getting a nuclear weapon [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=346.16s)]
*  after being bombed. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=348.4s)]
*  Doesn't make any sense. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=349.8s)]
*  The Israeli intelligence team, [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=350.8s)]
*  Petraeus, Rubio, the CIA, the IAEA, [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=353.0s)]
*  everybody says direct hit, years to come back from it. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=358.8s)]
*  And then there's CNN alone in the corner in last place [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=363.2s)]
*  spewing enemy propaganda. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=366.16s)]
*  I don't think they can come back from this. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=368.24s)]
*  Do you think they're getting it from [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=370.04s)]
*  some sort of nefarious Iranian sources [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=371.88s)]
*  and it's wishful thinking? [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=373.92s)]
*  Hater in the Pentagon leaked an early report [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=374.92s)]
*  that had no confidence and just relied on some camera [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=377.96s)]
*  up in the sky. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=381.28s)]
*  That's it. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=382.52s)]
*  It's not like there's some Israeli spy down there [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=383.36s)]
*  in the rubble with a phone. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=385.52s)]
*  Yup, we killed this thing. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=387.28s)]
*  Can you guys send some food? [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=389.03999999999996s)]
*  You're never gonna know what happened [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=390.96s)]
*  because the thing is a pile of rubble. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=392.48s)]
*  Do you worry that the Iranians will in fact [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=395.15999999999997s)]
*  be able to rebuild in short order? [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=397.76s)]
*  Good to be back with you. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=400.36s)]
*  Glad you and Taris are both here. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=401.44s)]
*  My thing is three things before. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=403.67999999999995s)]
*  That's the right question. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=406.67999999999995s)]
*  And I think there's some frustration [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=408.23999999999995s)]
*  on the part of the president and his team [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=410.4s)]
*  because there was a lot of success there [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=412.59999999999997s)]
*  at the NATO summit. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=414.52s)]
*  First of all, the fact that we are now gonna see our allies [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=415.4s)]
*  and NATO spend 5% of their GDP on defense [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=418.23999999999995s)]
*  in light of the change circumstances in the world [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=422.28s)]
*  and an emboldened Russia is a really, really good thing [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=424.56s)]
*  and the president deserves a lot of credit for that. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=427.08s)]
*  Two, I think and have been saying for weeks, [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=429.12s)]
*  I thought it was the right thing to do [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=431.08s)]
*  and I think that's what the president did. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=433.84000000000003s)]
*  I was encouraging him and his chairs, [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=435.68s)]
*  many around this network were to take advantage [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=438.04s)]
*  of everything the Israelis had done in Iran, [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=440.8s)]
*  to weaken, to degrade and to make it possible [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=442.76s)]
*  for us to control the air over Iran [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=446.44s)]
*  and we were able to do that [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=450.84000000000003s)]
*  and that helped us do what you just said, [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=452.04s)]
*  strike that little target. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=454.0s)]
*  The president made clear no nuclear program in Iran. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=455.96s)]
*  Now it is unclear as we sit here today [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=458.52s)]
*  how much we've set it back. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=460.6s)]
*  I listened to the secretary Hegsteth and secretary Rubio [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=462.12s)]
*  and even the president say that when they hear criticism [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=465.64s)]
*  or hear questions around this, [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=468.47999999999996s)]
*  it's almost as if people are criticizing the military. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=469.68s)]
*  I wanna be clear, I'm not criticizing the military at all [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=471.91999999999996s)]
*  but I do think that we should follow protocol [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=475.03999999999996s)]
*  which is to try to understand the impact that this bomb had [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=478.08s)]
*  and this attack had which will do in the damage assessment. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=481.24s)]
*  I think at the end of the day, [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=484.35999999999996s)]
*  we'll be massage will help me answer your question [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=485.2s)]
*  because if indeed we've damaged this [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=487.24s)]
*  as much as we believe we have [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=489.67999999999995s)]
*  as much as we believe our weapons systems are able to [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=491.0s)]
*  and I might give the president one more sense of credit, [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=494.12s)]
*  I give him an invite in this. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=495.84s)]
*  The fact that we provided weapons for the Ukrainians, [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=496.92s)]
*  the courage and their will combined with our capability [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=499.32s)]
*  and effectiveness of our weapons system [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=502.8s)]
*  have helped the Ukrainians push back the Russians. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=504.76s)]
*  So there's a lot to be proud of [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=506.68s)]
*  but we should all understand [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=507.72s)]
*  that this is just following basic protocol. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=509.4s)]
*  I hope the answer to your question is yes [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=511.52s)]
*  but if it's not, the Iranians should know one thing [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=513.36s)]
*  and I said it yesterday, [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=515.36s)]
*  we can do this the easy way by you guys coming to the table [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=516.48s)]
*  or we can do it the hard way [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=519.52s)]
*  and send the boys back. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=521.9200000000001s)]
*  And maybe a girl too. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=522.76s)]
*  I say boys, I mean boys and girls. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=524.24s)]
*  Oh, that was very nice. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=525.76s)]
*  Very inclusive. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=526.9200000000001s)]
*  It's very inclusive. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=527.76s)]
*  Thank you for that, Harold. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=528.6s)]
*  That's my DEI way of saying it all. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=529.44s)]
*  So Tyrus, you and I love movies [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=531.2800000000001s)]
*  and we love movie references. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=533.0s)]
*  When I read about this strike, [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=534.72s)]
*  I was like, oh my garden, [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=536.52s)]
*  this is the plot to Top Gun Maverick. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=538.24s)]
*  Do you think, now we oftentimes talk about movie studios [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=540.9200000000001s)]
*  not being creative enough coming up with new material. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=544.52s)]
*  Is the Pentagon guilty of the same thing? [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=547.9200000000001s)]
*  No, and you know what? [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=549.96s)]
*  This is a one time, it's not a movie. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=550.8000000000001s)]
*  I'm gonna take everyone back in the time machine. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=552.08s)]
*  We all remember Jordan, right? [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=554.12s)]
*  If you were a Chicago Bulls fan, [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=556.24s)]
*  you knew that he was the goat and he was the great. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=558.52s)]
*  Every time he went out, he punished everyone. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=561.12s)]
*  President Trump is the new Michael Jordan of government. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=563.2800000000001s)]
*  So you don't need to go to leakers [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=566.2s)]
*  because this is what happened. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=568.0400000000001s)]
*  I was a Celtic fan. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=568.88s)]
*  So every time Michael Jordan went out [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=569.88s)]
*  and put 60 on somebody, you know what I said? [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=571.2s)]
*  Well, he probably should have got 61. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=573.12s)]
*  He's not playing defense. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=574.5600000000001s)]
*  He's just doing this. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=575.96s)]
*  Is he the world champion? [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=576.8000000000001s)]
*  Yes. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=578.44s)]
*  Has he stopped everyone else from getting a championship? [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=579.2800000000001s)]
*  Yes. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=580.36s)]
*  President Trump is doing Jordan-like stuff [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=581.2s)]
*  with government right now. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=582.96s)]
*  And they hate it. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=583.96s)]
*  His crossovers, he's using actual piece by strength. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=584.8000000000001s)]
*  You wanna know if it works? [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=590.08s)]
*  I ran the next day said, [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=591.7600000000001s)]
*  hey, we're gonna shoot six missiles. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=593.08s)]
*  One's not even, I swear, one's not even close. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=595.9200000000001s)]
*  So, cause we have to save some face. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=598.6800000000001s)]
*  Okay, cool. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=600.2800000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=602.24s)]
*  And the more the president say, [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=603.32s)]
*  glad you got it out of your system. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=604.5200000000001s)]
*  He was being, and this is the thing with the daddy thing. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=606.68s)]
*  You're a reporter talking to the president [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=609.4s)]
*  about one of the most successful military actions [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=611.76s)]
*  of all time. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=615.16s)]
*  And your thing was, [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=616.3599999999999s)]
*  we're gonna get him on the daddy situation. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=617.56s)]
*  And completely misread the situation. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=620.0799999999999s)]
*  What he was saying was he was being [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=622.52s)]
*  the grown ass man in the room. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwffaJ-aon8&t=624.0s)]
