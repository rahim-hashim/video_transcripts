# Two BIG 'strategic errors' by Iran
**Fox News - World News:** [June 13, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3V8XqvySu2o)
*  President Trump will hold a National Security Council meeting in just a few hours while [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3V8XqvySu2o&t=0.0s)]
*  the nuclear talks originally planned for Sunday are now in limbo. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3V8XqvySu2o&t=6.0s)]
*  Former Assistant Secretary of State and main gubernatorial candidate Robert Charles joins [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3V8XqvySu2o&t=10.44s)]
*  me now and let's pick up there with those Sunday nuclear talks with Iran. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3V8XqvySu2o&t=14.08s)]
*  Is there any way they happen now? [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3V8XqvySu2o&t=18.16s)]
*  I doubt it Todd. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3V8XqvySu2o&t=21.900000000000002s)]
*  You know I've spent many hours in the National Security Council and I'll just say this. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3V8XqvySu2o&t=22.900000000000002s)]
*  Basically what we're looking at right now is a combination of a strategic error on the [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3V8XqvySu2o&t=28.4s)]
*  part of Iran because at the end of the day they should not have turned away from President [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3V8XqvySu2o&t=31.959999999999997s)]
*  Trump's offer to negotiate out the nuclear deal that they could have had with him. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3V8XqvySu2o&t=36.839999999999996s)]
*  Instead they redoubled, they doubled down, they took the amount of enriched uranium that [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3V8XqvySu2o&t=42.96s)]
*  they had which is at 60 percent and they doubled that. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3V8XqvySu2o&t=47.44s)]
*  In other words they kind of threw back at him. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3V8XqvySu2o&t=51.519999999999996s)]
*  So look President Trump and Israel are locked up together. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3V8XqvySu2o&t=54.239999999999995s)]
*  That was a strategic error. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3V8XqvySu2o&t=58.699999999999996s)]
*  Their second big error was strategic, I'll call it strategic forgetting. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3V8XqvySu2o&t=60.36s)]
*  Forty-five years ago almost exactly Ronald Reagan told them that they needed to hand [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3V8XqvySu2o&t=64.17999999999999s)]
*  the hostages back, same regime, different people needed to hand the hostages back or [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3V8XqvySu2o&t=69.32s)]
*  they would pay a mighty consequence. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3V8XqvySu2o&t=74.22s)]
*  They immediately handed them back. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3V8XqvySu2o&t=76.62s)]
*  That same message was essentially delivered through Trump and with Israel and they ignored [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3V8XqvySu2o&t=78.97999999999999s)]
*  it. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3V8XqvySu2o&t=83.53999999999999s)]
*  And I guess I'll say there's a little bit of strategic remembering going on here Todd. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3V8XqvySu2o&t=84.53999999999999s)]
*  If you go back to 1935 there's an awful lot of people who say that if the West had only [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3V8XqvySu2o&t=88.06s)]
*  remembered, had only recognized that if they were able to deter the buildup by Hitler we [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3V8XqvySu2o&t=93.66s)]
*  would never have faced consequences that became World War II. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3V8XqvySu2o&t=100.7s)]
*  What Israel is doing right now with U.S. full buy-in is to say we're not going to have a [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3V8XqvySu2o&t=104.26s)]
*  World War III. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3V8XqvySu2o&t=108.68s)]
*  We're going to literally get rid of this now. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3V8XqvySu2o&t=109.94s)]
*  We're going to preempt it and that amounts to essentially remembering our better Churchill [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3V8XqvySu2o&t=112.18s)]
*  and our better Reagan and not falling victim to the idea that you can appease this kind [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3V8XqvySu2o&t=115.94s)]
*  of a terror group indefinitely. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3V8XqvySu2o&t=120.78s)]
*  You can't. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3V8XqvySu2o&t=123.0s)]
*  A la Neville Chamberlain. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3V8XqvySu2o&t=124.0s)]
*  We don't want Neville Chamberlain's name coming up in this discussion. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3V8XqvySu2o&t=125.14s)]
*  I want to focus on the National Security Council meeting that's about to happen in just a few [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3V8XqvySu2o&t=128.66s)]
*  hours. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3V8XqvySu2o&t=133.54s)]
*  You have been inside high level meetings like this following a major event like we saw last [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3V8XqvySu2o&t=134.54s)]
*  night. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3V8XqvySu2o&t=139.58s)]
*  How do our leaders craft a response? [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3V8XqvySu2o&t=140.58s)]
*  What should the approach of the Trump administration be? [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3V8XqvySu2o&t=143.62s)]
*  What you always want to do is bring something to closure and you have to have the right [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3V8XqvySu2o&t=148.34s)]
*  pressure. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3V8XqvySu2o&t=152.18s)]
*  So if you think about it, in many ways this is like looking at how well the Hanoi bombings [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3V8XqvySu2o&t=153.18s)]
*  in 72 brought an end to the Vietnam War. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3V8XqvySu2o&t=158.72s)]
*  What you're trying to do here is to get Iran, what's left of their leadership, to make the [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3V8XqvySu2o&t=161.42000000000002s)]
*  right choices. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3V8XqvySu2o&t=166.1s)]
*  So far you don't see Israel hitting the mullahs because they are going to be the ones that [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3V8XqvySu2o&t=167.1s)]
*  negotiate out of this. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3V8XqvySu2o&t=171.06s)]
*  I think ultimately what you do is you try to get an end game that is very similar to [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3V8XqvySu2o&t=172.34s)]
*  the end game we had in Libya back when I was in government. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3V8XqvySu2o&t=176.06s)]
*  We were able to get Libya to disgorge all their nuclear material and be done with it. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3V8XqvySu2o&t=180.44s)]
*  What's left here is going to be a battle of attrition until whatever's left in Iran says [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3V8XqvySu2o&t=186.42000000000002s)]
*  in terms of leadership, no, we're not going to keep going after Israel again and again. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3V8XqvySu2o&t=192.42000000000002s)]
*  The ideology, all your other guests today were exactly right. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3V8XqvySu2o&t=197.9s)]
*  The ideology has been to destroy Israel and the United States, the lesser and the greater [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3V8XqvySu2o&t=201.02s)]
*  Satan's in their world. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3V8XqvySu2o&t=206.70000000000002s)]
*  But at the end of the day, this is a terrorist group, Todd, a terrorist group in the form [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3V8XqvySu2o&t=208.34s)]
*  of a sponsor state. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3V8XqvySu2o&t=213.26000000000002s)]
*  And they made their first strategic error in a long time, and a big one on October 7. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3V8XqvySu2o&t=214.9s)]
*  They made their most recent one by ignoring President Trump's offer for peace. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3V8XqvySu2o&t=219.46s)]
*  And I think they're going to eventually have to come back for that. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3V8XqvySu2o&t=223.38s)]
*  Robert, although other Mideast nations may be coming out and condemning these strikes [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3V8XqvySu2o&t=225.5s)]
*  Are they secretly celebrating in light of how destabilizing Iran has been to the region? [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3V8XqvySu2o&t=230.22s)]
*  Yes. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3V8XqvySu2o&t=235.22s)]
*  There's no question that Shia Iran, which is a sponsor of terror and has been really [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3V8XqvySu2o&t=236.22s)]
*  utterly, utterly unforgiving in the way that they promoted terror, has also presented a [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3V8XqvySu2o&t=242.62s)]
*  direct threat to Saudi Arabia and all of the other countries in the region. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3V8XqvySu2o&t=247.5s)]
*  So I think they're ultimately happy this is happening. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3V8XqvySu2o&t=251.06s)]
*  Robert Charles, thank you so much for your insight on this important morning. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3V8XqvySu2o&t=253.7s)]
*  We appreciate it. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3V8XqvySu2o&t=257.34s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3V8XqvySu2o&t=259.54s)]
