# NEW DETAILS revealed on six ‘bunker buster’ bombs dropped on major Iranian nuclear site
**Fox News - World News:** [June 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_RXrgPaMWs)
*  In the meantime, let's get back to this country and the Washington, the chief national security [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_RXrgPaMWs&t=0.0s)]
*  correspondent, Jennifer Griffin is live for us at the Pentagon. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_RXrgPaMWs&t=4.48s)]
*  Jennifer. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_RXrgPaMWs&t=7.48s)]
*  Well, Trace, I think what's so extraordinary about tonight's strikes, not only, all eyes [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_RXrgPaMWs&t=8.48s)]
*  were on Fordow and for, for the past week, we've been talking about the B-2 bombers and [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_RXrgPaMWs&t=13.42s)]
*  the, the massive ordinance penetrators. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_RXrgPaMWs&t=18.240000000000002s)]
*  Those are the 30,000 pound GBU 57 bunker buster bombs. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_RXrgPaMWs&t=20.68s)]
*  What we can report tonight after Sean Hannity spoke to the president, we learned that there [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_RXrgPaMWs&t=25.84s)]
*  were six massive ordinance penetrators dropped on Fordow. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_RXrgPaMWs&t=30.6s)]
*  And as the president wrote on Truth Social, that Fordow site is gone. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_RXrgPaMWs&t=35.14s)]
*  My sources tell me that those, those bunker buster bombs would have been dropped through [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_RXrgPaMWs&t=39.92s)]
*  the air ventilation, in ventilation shafts at Fordow. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_RXrgPaMWs&t=45.22s)]
*  So most likely three bunker busters through each of those shafts. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_RXrgPaMWs&t=50.28s)]
*  We had been focusing on the entrances. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_RXrgPaMWs&t=53.94s)]
*  There are two entrances to the Fordow site, which is 300 feet underground. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_RXrgPaMWs&t=55.92s)]
*  We've also reported that the mop bomb can penetrate about 200 feet underground, but they [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_RXrgPaMWs&t=60.739999999999995s)]
*  work in pairs. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_RXrgPaMWs&t=66.3s)]
*  The B-2 bomber, which flew out of Whiteman Air Force Base, they fly nonstop and are refueled [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_RXrgPaMWs&t=67.4s)]
*  along the way to this site at Fordow. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_RXrgPaMWs&t=73.58s)]
*  They drop one mop bomb, a 30,000 pound bomb that goes about 200 feet down. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_RXrgPaMWs&t=77.3s)]
*  There's soil that is then removed, exposed. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_RXrgPaMWs&t=83.18s)]
*  And then the second bomb, which drops into a hole that is about, has a radius of about [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_RXrgPaMWs&t=86.42s)]
*  25 feet, it goes into the same hole and can go even deeper. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_RXrgPaMWs&t=90.9s)]
*  So Fordow, we understand, is gone. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_RXrgPaMWs&t=95.5s)]
*  That is significant because that was the main nuclear enrichment site, and it was deeply [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_RXrgPaMWs&t=97.9s)]
*  fortified in that mountain. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_RXrgPaMWs&t=103.4s)]
*  But then there are the two other sites. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_RXrgPaMWs&t=105.36000000000001s)]
*  You have Natanz, which had three underground enrichment facilities. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_RXrgPaMWs&t=107.32000000000001s)]
*  We understand that 30 Tomahawk missiles were fired from U.S. submarines about 400 miles [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_RXrgPaMWs&t=113.46s)]
*  away from these sites, the sites at Isfahan and Natanz. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_RXrgPaMWs&t=120.25999999999999s)]
*  Those U.S. submarines were most likely Ohio-class converted guided missile subs. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_RXrgPaMWs&t=124.58s)]
*  Most likely the USS Georgia or Florida were involved in those strikes. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_RXrgPaMWs&t=132.7s)]
*  What I'm being told, though, is that Isfahan, Isfahan is an even harder target than [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_RXrgPaMWs&t=138.14s)]
*  Fordow. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_RXrgPaMWs&t=142.82s)]
*  We hadn't talked about it as much this week because all the focus was on the B-2s and [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_RXrgPaMWs&t=143.82s)]
*  the MOP bombs and Fordow. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_RXrgPaMWs&t=148.26s)]
*  But Isfahan is where the uranium hexafluoride is, where the centrifuges are made. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_RXrgPaMWs&t=150.38s)]
*  And they, in my understanding, is there is a tunnel into the mountain there, and it is [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_RXrgPaMWs&t=157.02s)]
*  much, much deeper than at Fordow. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_RXrgPaMWs&t=161.66s)]
*  And so we will have to wait and see the bomb damage assessment at that site to see how, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_RXrgPaMWs&t=163.78s)]
*  whether it was completely destroyed. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_RXrgPaMWs&t=169.74s)]
*  I'm told from very, very knowledgeable sources that that was most likely the hardest site. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_RXrgPaMWs&t=171.5s)]
*  So we'll have to see. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_RXrgPaMWs&t=176.38s)]
*  I know we're still getting new information coming in here, Jennifer, but just for kind [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_RXrgPaMWs&t=177.78s)]
*  of clarification here, we have been told or we've been kind of reporting that the B-2s [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_RXrgPaMWs&t=181.06s)]
*  went in and they went into Fordow and may have dropped as many as six of the bunker [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_RXrgPaMWs&t=186.66s)]
*  busters and there were as many as 30 Tomahawks fired at Natanz and Isfahan. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_RXrgPaMWs&t=191.18s)]
*  And I'm wondering, do we know if we ruled out the possibility of any bunker busters [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_RXrgPaMWs&t=196.5s)]
*  being used on Isfahan and on Natanz? [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_RXrgPaMWs&t=200.95999999999998s)]
*  I'm told that the bunker busters were used at Fordow and that it was the Tomahawks that [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_RXrgPaMWs&t=203.64s)]
*  targeted Natanz and Isfahan. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_RXrgPaMWs&t=209.76s)]
*  So at this point in time, you would have had at least three B-2 bombers there above Fordow. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_RXrgPaMWs&t=213.07999999999998s)]
*  Again, when we woke up this morning, all eyes were on the reports and the sightings, the [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_RXrgPaMWs&t=220.64s)]
*  radar trackers, the flight trackers who saw that there were those six B-2 bombers flying [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_RXrgPaMWs&t=226.4s)]
*  towards Guam. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_RXrgPaMWs&t=233.76000000000002s)]
*  And now that's if you were to fly from Whiteman Air Force Base in Missouri all the way to [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_RXrgPaMWs&t=235.28s)]
*  Iran, let's say, that's a 30 hour straight flight. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_RXrgPaMWs&t=240.0s)]
*  So those bombers could not possibly have been involved in this strike. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_RXrgPaMWs&t=244.6s)]
*  That's when we look at what would have been flying east. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_RXrgPaMWs&t=249.20000000000002s)]
*  Clearly, some B-2 bombers from Whiteman flew east. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_RXrgPaMWs&t=252.48s)]
*  And that's why we saw this week about 30 air refuelers that were positioned in Europe and [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_RXrgPaMWs&t=256.36s)]
*  along the way and throughout the Middle East, because they would have been required to create [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_RXrgPaMWs&t=261.88s)]
*  an air refueling bridge to get those B-2s. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_RXrgPaMWs&t=266.64s)]
*  It's a 15 hour flight if you go east from Whiteman to Fordow. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_RXrgPaMWs&t=270.04s)]
*  And so those bombers would have flown east and they would have been refueled along the [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_RXrgPaMWs&t=276.3s)]
*  way and they would be on their way back home to Whiteman as we speak, Trace. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_RXrgPaMWs&t=280.24s)]
*  Jennifer Griffin, we'll get back to you. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_RXrgPaMWs&t=285.04s)]
*  Jennifer, thank you. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_RXrgPaMWs&t=286.48s)]
