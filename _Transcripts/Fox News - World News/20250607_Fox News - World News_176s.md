# Lara Trump: America’s enemies are ‘working together to take us down’
**Fox News - World News:** [June 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNyjBztPaRA)
*  Good evening. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNyjBztPaRA&t=0.0s)]
*  I hope you're having a great Saturday night and welcome back to MyView. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNyjBztPaRA&t=5.0s)]
*  America is back, but so are her enemies. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNyjBztPaRA&t=9.44s)]
*  And they're no longer just testing us, they're working together to take us down. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNyjBztPaRA&t=13.16s)]
*  Just days ago, officials from Iran, Russia, and Communist China met behind closed doors [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNyjBztPaRA&t=18.400000000000002s)]
*  to coordinate their position ahead of a critical hearing on Iran's nuclear program. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNyjBztPaRA&t=23.68s)]
*  The world's most dangerous regimes, the same ones funding terror, hacking our infrastructure, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNyjBztPaRA&t=28.9s)]
*  and undermining our alliances, are now openly collaborating to blunt U.S. influence and [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNyjBztPaRA&t=34.54s)]
*  advance Tehran's nuclear ambitions. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNyjBztPaRA&t=40.54s)]
*  It's not a coincidence, it's a coalition of chaos, and it demands a serious response. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNyjBztPaRA&t=43.26s)]
*  Meanwhile, Chinese spies are crawling all over our country, embedded in academia, industry, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNyjBztPaRA&t=49.739999999999995s)]
*  and yes, even Congress. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNyjBztPaRA&t=55.42s)]
*  You may remember it all started with Fang Fang and California Congressman Eric Swalwell. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNyjBztPaRA&t=57.64s)]
*  That was just the beginning. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNyjBztPaRA&t=63.6s)]
*  Now we're learning of fresh espionage plots, dangerous pathogens smuggled into the U.S., [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNyjBztPaRA&t=65.32s)]
*  and a Chinese Ministry of State Security that's operating in plain sight, exploiting and infiltrating. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNyjBztPaRA&t=71.04s)]
*  And for years, Washington let it happen. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNyjBztPaRA&t=78.2s)]
*  That's why under President Donald Trump and Secretary of State Marco Rubio, the United [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNyjBztPaRA&t=82.0s)]
*  States is taking action, revoking visas for Chinese nationals tied to the CCP, especially [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNyjBztPaRA&t=86.6s)]
*  those working in sensitive fields like A.I., semiconductors, and biotech. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNyjBztPaRA&t=92.72s)]
*  Because let's be clear, China doesn't just want to compete with us, they want to replace us. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNyjBztPaRA&t=97.64s)]
*  They're weaponizing global markets, flooding our streets with fentanyl through cartel proxies, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNyjBztPaRA&t=103.84s)]
*  and rewriting the future of technology to serve a communist dictatorship. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNyjBztPaRA&t=108.88s)]
*  And now they're doing it all while teaming up with Moscow and Tehran. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNyjBztPaRA&t=113.68s)]
*  This is exactly what President Trump warned about. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNyjBztPaRA&t=118.46000000000001s)]
*  And now under his leadership, once again, we're confronting the threat head on, without [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNyjBztPaRA&t=121.66000000000001s)]
*  apology, without hesitation. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNyjBztPaRA&t=126.72000000000001s)]
*  At the heart of that effort is the CIA, newly rebuilt, retooled, and ready to take off the gloves. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNyjBztPaRA&t=129.54000000000002s)]
*  Director John Ratcliffe understands the stakes. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNyjBztPaRA&t=136.0s)]
*  He's focused on intelligence, not politics, mission, not media narratives, and he's dead [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNyjBztPaRA&t=138.92s)]
*  set on restoring America's edge before it's too late. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNyjBztPaRA&t=144.67999999999998s)]
*  I recently got the chance to sit down with the CIA chief for an exclusive conversation [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNyjBztPaRA&t=149.0s)]
*  about the road ahead, from exposing spy networks to countering China, to making sure America [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNyjBztPaRA&t=153.92s)]
*  never falls behind in a world growing darker by the day. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNyjBztPaRA&t=160.04s)]
*  Hey, Sean Hannity here. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNyjBztPaRA&t=163.83999999999997s)]
