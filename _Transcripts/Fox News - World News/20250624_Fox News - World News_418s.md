# Everyone got this wrong: Stephen Miller
**Fox News - World News:** [June 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtPexphANpU)
*  Now, earlier today, before the ceasefire announcement, the Department of Homeland Security issued [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtPexphANpU&t=0.0s)]
*  a national terrorism advisory system bulletin warning of, quote, heightened threat environment [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtPexphANpU&t=7.08s)]
*  inside of America. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtPexphANpU&t=12.84s)]
*  This is just another example of the danger stemming from Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, and [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtPexphANpU&t=14.46s)]
*  Alejandro Mayorkas' absolute preventable disaster at the border, the one that allowed in known [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtPexphANpU&t=19.72s)]
*  murderers, rapists, cartel members, gang members and drug dealers. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtPexphANpU&t=26.44s)]
*  And according to our very own Bill Mollugin, during Biden's time in the White House, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtPexphANpU&t=30.64s)]
*  more than 1,500 Iranian nationals were caught illegally crossing the border. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtPexphANpU&t=34.84s)]
*  More than half were released into the United States. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtPexphANpU&t=40.8s)]
*  In other words, they knew they were Iranian nationals. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtPexphANpU&t=43.56s)]
*  Why would people from Iran be showing up at our southern border? [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtPexphANpU&t=46.52s)]
*  And why would Joe let half of them into the country? [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtPexphANpU&t=49.760000000000005s)]
*  Do you think they all had good intentions for our country? [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtPexphANpU&t=52.56s)]
*  And breaking today, the U.S. Supreme Court handing President Donald Trump a massive victory [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtPexphANpU&t=55.24s)]
*  when they ruled that he can continue deporting illegals to third countries. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtPexphANpU&t=61.2s)]
*  For now, here with reaction, White House Deputy Chief of Staff for Policy and Homeland Security [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtPexphANpU&t=66.18s)]
*  Adviser Stephen Miller. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtPexphANpU&t=71.8s)]
*  Stephen Miller, let's start with the peace agreement. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtPexphANpU&t=73.08s)]
*  Trust but verify, peace through strength, both in play. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtPexphANpU&t=75.8s)]
*  Donald Trump's doctrine consistent with his first term when he dropped the mother of all [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtPexphANpU&t=78.80000000000001s)]
*  bombs on Afghanistan, took out Soleimani and Baghdadi and Associates, and of course, beat [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtPexphANpU&t=83.56s)]
*  the ISIS caliphate. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtPexphANpU&t=88.72s)]
*  Now he has once again given the Iranians a chance for peace. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtPexphANpU&t=90.36s)]
*  Will they really take it? [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtPexphANpU&t=93.32000000000001s)]
*  Well, let's just take a moment to think about how historic this moment is and what President [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtPexphANpU&t=96.80000000000001s)]
*  Trump has achieved in this 12-day war. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtPexphANpU&t=100.96000000000001s)]
*  Reports going back to Bill Clinton have said it is the policy of the U.S. government not [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtPexphANpU&t=104.68s)]
*  to allow Iran to have a nuclear weapon. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtPexphANpU&t=109.56s)]
*  But under every president except Trump, Iran marched closer and closer to being able to [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtPexphANpU&t=112.48s)]
*  put onto a ballistic missile a nuclear warhead that could take out an entire city. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtPexphANpU&t=118.32000000000001s)]
*  That has been the direction Iran has been going in year after year. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtPexphANpU&t=125.12s)]
*  President Trump took action flawlessly through the United States military to obliterate Iran's [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtPexphANpU&t=129.96s)]
*  nuclear sites and to stop them through the use of military force from having a nuclear [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtPexphANpU&t=136.4s)]
*  weapon. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtPexphANpU&t=142.28s)]
*  It was a bold, courageous action, and it happened without a single leak, without a single solitary [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtPexphANpU&t=143.28s)]
*  service member losing their life. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtPexphANpU&t=150.36s)]
*  Everyone said, who was a critic of this action, that it would lead to World War III and instead [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtPexphANpU&t=154.36s)]
*  we have a ceasefire and instead we have the beginnings of a new era of stability and peace [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtPexphANpU&t=159.4s)]
*  and security in the Middle East. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtPexphANpU&t=167.12s)]
*  President Trump once again has demonstrated that he alone has the wisdom, the judgment, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtPexphANpU&t=169.36s)]
*  the strength and the courage to see this nation through the most dangerous challenges we face [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtPexphANpU&t=174.56s)]
*  around the world, Sean. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtPexphANpU&t=179.12s)]
*  It is amazing his persistence when it comes to the issue of peace, and all credit to the [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtPexphANpU&t=181.20000000000002s)]
*  president for that. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtPexphANpU&t=186.92000000000002s)]
*  Can we have peace with a regime that up to this point, now they are now, their whole [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtPexphANpU&t=189.12s)]
*  nuclear program has been obliterated, but their nuclear ambitions I'm sure have not [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtPexphANpU&t=194.4s)]
*  been. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtPexphANpU&t=199.72000000000003s)]
*  As Senator Graham said, he would like to hear them recognize Israel. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtPexphANpU&t=201.68s)]
*  That would show a level of seriousness in terms of a ceasefire. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtPexphANpU&t=205.24s)]
*  In that time, in other words, it won't buy them time to build up their ballistic missile [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtPexphANpU&t=208.60000000000002s)]
*  and instead of 2,000 pound bombs, they'll have 4,000 pound bombs. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtPexphANpU&t=214.12s)]
*  Do you think as part of this deal, I know that the secretary of state, I know Mideast [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtPexphANpU&t=221.12s)]
*  envoy Steve Witkoff, Marco Rubio, the two of them will be now in contact with the Iranians. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtPexphANpU&t=225.4s)]
*  Do you feel a level of confidence that they will agree to the inspections that would be [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtPexphANpU&t=230.96s)]
*  necessary to trust and verify? [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtPexphANpU&t=236.92000000000002s)]
*  Well, Sean, I think the most important point here is even more fundamental than that. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtPexphANpU&t=240.92s)]
*  The words are easy. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtPexphANpU&t=245.92s)]
*  We've had inspection regimes in Iran for years now. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtPexphANpU&t=247.67999999999998s)]
*  The lesson that the Iranian regime has learned from President Trump is the lesson of hard [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtPexphANpU&t=253.16s)]
*  power, Sean. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtPexphANpU&t=257.96s)]
*  President Trump gave them a 60-day deadline. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtPexphANpU&t=260.44s)]
*  The deadline was very clear. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtPexphANpU&t=263.5s)]
*  Make a deal with us or pay a price you cannot imagine. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtPexphANpU&t=265.59999999999997s)]
*  Look what's happened over the last 12 days. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtPexphANpU&t=269.56s)]
*  The leader of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard has been killed. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtPexphANpU&t=272.08s)]
*  The senior leadership in the government has been killed. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtPexphANpU&t=276.26s)]
*  Their entire upper leadership ranks have been executed. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtPexphANpU&t=278.96s)]
*  The entire infrastructure that allows them to create ballistic missiles has been wiped [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtPexphANpU&t=283.2s)]
*  out. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtPexphANpU&t=288.4s)]
*  Their air defenses have been eliminated and President Trump dropped 30,000 pound massive [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtPexphANpU&t=289.86s)]
*  penetrating bombs on Iran, wiping out their nuclear capabilities. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtPexphANpU&t=298.32s)]
*  What lesson has the regime learned from this? [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtPexphANpU&t=303.64s)]
*  When President Trump offers you an olive branch, you better take it because if you don't, what's [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtPexphANpU&t=306.84s)]
*  going to happen? [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtPexphANpU&t=311.76s)]
*  So, you know, we can talk about words and press releases and everything else. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtPexphANpU&t=312.76s)]
*  Sean, the lesson the world has learned is that President Trump talks softly and he carries [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtPexphANpU&t=315.76s)]
*  that will smack and destroy and annihilate any single effort to create a nuclear power [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtPexphANpU&t=324.78s)]
*  in this country that threatens American security. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtPexphANpU&t=332.82s)]
*  No ambiguity. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtPexphANpU&t=336.34s)]
*  I'm in full agreement with everything you said. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtPexphANpU&t=337.34s)]
*  Quickly, we have less than a minute. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtPexphANpU&t=339.46s)]
*  Your reaction, this court decision is massive, Steve. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtPexphANpU&t=341.46s)]
*  Yes, this is an incredible victory, the Supreme Court win. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtPexphANpU&t=345.53999999999996s)]
*  It allows President Trump, as the law has long said, but the courts have blocked, it [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtPexphANpU&t=350.4s)]
*  allows President Trump to send illegal aliens convicted of rape, murder, homicide, assault, [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtPexphANpU&t=355.23999999999995s)]
*  battery, crimes against children to any country around the world that is willing to accept [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtPexphANpU&t=362.12s)]
*  them. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtPexphANpU&t=367.08s)]
*  So whether that be South Sudan or whether it be Somalia or whether it be Ethiopia, any [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtPexphANpU&t=368.08s)]
*  country in the world that is willing to accept these monsters, we can get them out of our [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtPexphANpU&t=372.88s)]
*  country and be free of them forever. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtPexphANpU&t=377.0s)]
*  The only thing I have to share tonight, Sean, in a little bit of breaking news is that the [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtPexphANpU&t=379.48s)]
*  District Court judge in Boston has said he's going to defy the Supreme Court's ruling, [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtPexphANpU&t=382.74s)]
*  so expect fireworks tomorrow when we hold this judge accountable for refusing to obey [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtPexphANpU&t=387.64000000000004s)]
*  the Supreme Court. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtPexphANpU&t=391.82s)]
*  All right, Steve Miller, we always appreciate you being on. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtPexphANpU&t=392.82s)]
*  Thank you, sir. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtPexphANpU&t=396.16s)]
*  This was a big decision and a big win all the way across the board, but the real big [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtPexphANpU&t=397.64000000000004s)]
*  win is Iran's nuclear ambitions were obliterated on Saturday night. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtPexphANpU&t=401.24s)]
