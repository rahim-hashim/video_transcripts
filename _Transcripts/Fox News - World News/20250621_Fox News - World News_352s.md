# Iranian regime ‘less powerful’ than it was weeks ago, says former ambassador
**Fox News - World News:** [June 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Xp_7V5lvCg)
*  So where do we go from here? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Xp_7V5lvCg&t=0.0s)]
*  Let's ask former U.S. Ambassador to NATO, Kurt Volker. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Xp_7V5lvCg&t=2.2800000000000002s)]
*  Thank you for joining us on this Saturday morning. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Xp_7V5lvCg&t=6.84s)]
*  We greatly appreciate it. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Xp_7V5lvCg&t=9.28s)]
*  It's pretty clear that the situation continues to escalate right now. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Xp_7V5lvCg&t=11.4s)]
*  The Israeli military striking all across Iran from their nuclear sites to their ballistic [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Xp_7V5lvCg&t=15.06s)]
*  missile sites, military sites to individuals to going after commanders and scientists. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Xp_7V5lvCg&t=20.88s)]
*  Your thoughts on what's been struck and this ongoing force moving forward, really softening [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Xp_7V5lvCg&t=27.52s)]
*  things if you will, as they continue to hit their targets. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Xp_7V5lvCg&t=34.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Xp_7V5lvCg&t=37.68s)]
*  Well, I think we have to look at this in a couple of phases here. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Xp_7V5lvCg&t=38.68s)]
*  Before all this started in the last 10 days or so, Iran was very, very close to the ability [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Xp_7V5lvCg&t=42.24s)]
*  to produce a nuclear bomb and possibly even connect that to a missile to be able to deliver [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Xp_7V5lvCg&t=48.42s)]
*  it. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Xp_7V5lvCg&t=54.120000000000005s)]
*  That has already been set back dramatically. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Xp_7V5lvCg&t=55.279999999999994s)]
*  It's going to take them a long time to reconstitute any kind of nuclear weapons capability. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Xp_7V5lvCg&t=58.44s)]
*  Now what the Israelis are doing is dramatically weakening the rest of the Iranian military [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Xp_7V5lvCg&t=65.47999999999999s)]
*  forces, because remember, they pose a regional threat. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Xp_7V5lvCg&t=71.12s)]
*  They've supported their proxies like Hezbollah and Hamas and the Houthis over time. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Xp_7V5lvCg&t=74.0s)]
*  So this is an effort to really weaken the Iranian power structures so that they present [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Xp_7V5lvCg&t=78.44s)]
*  less of a threat in the future. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Xp_7V5lvCg&t=83.84s)]
*  There's nothing in this yet that prevents Iran from regrouping, even if it takes a few [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Xp_7V5lvCg&t=86.08s)]
*  years. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Xp_7V5lvCg&t=91.48s)]
*  But Israel is really trying to impose as much penalty on Iran as possible to set it back [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Xp_7V5lvCg&t=92.88000000000001s)]
*  as long as possible and to cause the regime to think, is it really worth going through [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Xp_7V5lvCg&t=98.92s)]
*  billions of dollars of expenses again only to have Israel destroy it again if they get [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Xp_7V5lvCg&t=104.60000000000001s)]
*  close? [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Xp_7V5lvCg&t=109.36s)]
*  When we talk about specifically the nuclear sites that have been hit, they've been talking [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Xp_7V5lvCg&t=110.52s)]
*  of the Iraq Heavy Water Reactor and the Markazi Process. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Xp_7V5lvCg&t=114.68s)]
*  There are a great number of different sites that have been struck related to their attempts [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Xp_7V5lvCg&t=117.84s)]
*  to gain this technology. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Xp_7V5lvCg&t=123.2s)]
*  You're talking about years potentially to regroup. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Xp_7V5lvCg&t=126.2s)]
*  What does it mean for the country right now as this is an effort to discourage them from [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Xp_7V5lvCg&t=128.96s)]
*  continuing this direction? [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Xp_7V5lvCg&t=133.84s)]
*  Right. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Xp_7V5lvCg&t=136.2s)]
*  Well, as you know, we have a radicalized Islamist regime in Iran, theocracy. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Xp_7V5lvCg&t=137.2s)]
*  They run a very harsh regime vis-a-vis the Iranian people. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Xp_7V5lvCg&t=145.16s)]
*  And there have been protests over decades by the Iranian people against the nature of [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Xp_7V5lvCg&t=148.16s)]
*  the regime there. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Xp_7V5lvCg&t=153.56s)]
*  But they have run the country with an iron grip. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Xp_7V5lvCg&t=154.88s)]
*  What Israel is doing is loosening that grip a little bit because they are weakening the [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Xp_7V5lvCg&t=158.06s)]
*  power structures of that government. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Xp_7V5lvCg&t=165.36s)]
*  Now, it is too early to say whether this creates an opening for the Iranian people to get control [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Xp_7V5lvCg&t=167.76000000000002s)]
*  of their own government. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Xp_7V5lvCg&t=174.12s)]
*  But that is clearly something in the back of people's minds, that the Iranian regime [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Xp_7V5lvCg&t=175.92000000000002s)]
*  is looking a lot less powerful than it looked a few weeks ago. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Xp_7V5lvCg&t=180.28s)]
*  And I think that is something that Israel is hoping for, and perhaps even the U.S. is [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Xp_7V5lvCg&t=184.44000000000003s)]
*  keeping an eye on at this stage. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Xp_7V5lvCg&t=188.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Xp_7V5lvCg&t=190.28000000000003s)]
*  I think you're raising a great point there. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Xp_7V5lvCg&t=191.28000000000003s)]
*  Mike Tobin was just reporting, showing some of the protesting in the streets that is occurring, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Xp_7V5lvCg&t=192.28s)]
*  anti-Israel protesting. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Xp_7V5lvCg&t=197.4s)]
*  But part of the goal also is to go after this internal security apparatus and to give the [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Xp_7V5lvCg&t=198.84s)]
*  Iranian people the power to communicate with the world, to use the Internet, to rise up, [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Xp_7V5lvCg&t=204.32s)]
*  if they so choose. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Xp_7V5lvCg&t=210.34s)]
*  Do you see that beginning? [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Xp_7V5lvCg&t=211.96s)]
*  We haven't seen it yet. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Xp_7V5lvCg&t=215.8s)]
*  I think there's a couple of factors here. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Xp_7V5lvCg&t=217.32s)]
*  One of them, the regime, is seriously trying to keep order and keep control in society. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Xp_7V5lvCg&t=219.35999999999999s)]
*  Those demonstrations that we saw the footage of, those were orchestrated by the regime [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Xp_7V5lvCg&t=226.0s)]
*  itself. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Xp_7V5lvCg&t=230.07999999999998s)]
*  They're not spontaneous, and they're not anything that reflects the overall will of the people. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Xp_7V5lvCg&t=231.07999999999998s)]
*  But at the same time, there is a rally around the flag effect for any country if they're [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Xp_7V5lvCg&t=237.84s)]
*  being attacked. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Xp_7V5lvCg&t=242.12s)]
*  They tend to want those attacks to stop. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Xp_7V5lvCg&t=244.4s)]
*  They tend to support any government that's going to defend them. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Xp_7V5lvCg&t=247.24s)]
*  So we see a bit of that as well. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Xp_7V5lvCg&t=250.34s)]
*  But there's nothing that's going to cause these young Iranians, and it's a very young [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Xp_7V5lvCg&t=252.48s)]
*  population, to believe that the theocracy in Iran is really the right leadership for [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Xp_7V5lvCg&t=256.16s)]
*  them. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Xp_7V5lvCg&t=261.82s)]
*  So we are not seeing it yet, but I think, as you say, weakening the security apparatus [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Xp_7V5lvCg&t=263.1s)]
*  and weakening the image of an indestructible Iranian state, that is quite important psychologically. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Xp_7V5lvCg&t=267.46s)]
*  And the final question, the president heading back to the White House, he'll be talking [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Xp_7V5lvCg&t=277.5s)]
*  about and weighing this decision that he said. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Xp_7V5lvCg&t=283.14s)]
*  He said it's a two-week timeframe. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Xp_7V5lvCg&t=285.21999999999997s)]
*  The United States reportedly considering potential strikes on the Fordow nuclear site. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Xp_7V5lvCg&t=287.5s)]
*  Your thoughts? [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Xp_7V5lvCg&t=292.41999999999996s)]
*  Well, as I look at President Trump, it seems to me that he really doesn't want to use [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Xp_7V5lvCg&t=293.41999999999996s)]
*  U.S. military force. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Xp_7V5lvCg&t=299.17999999999995s)]
*  He doesn't want to get the U.S. involved in another war anywhere in the world. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Xp_7V5lvCg&t=300.17999999999995s)]
*  But he also, I think, sees the situation that has developed as a result of Israel's preemptive [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Xp_7V5lvCg&t=305.04s)]
*  strikes. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Xp_7V5lvCg&t=311.44s)]
*  This is now a significant potential weakening of the regime, an opportunity to set back [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Xp_7V5lvCg&t=312.76s)]
*  Iran's nuclear weapons program by many years if we really go after that deep underground [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Xp_7V5lvCg&t=318.76s)]
*  Fordow facility. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Xp_7V5lvCg&t=325.48s)]
*  So I think he is really weighing the opportunity versus his instincts as to not to get involved. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Xp_7V5lvCg&t=326.94s)]
*  Kurt Volker, thank you very much for joining us and bringing us your expertise on this [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Xp_7V5lvCg&t=332.36s)]
*  Saturday morning. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Xp_7V5lvCg&t=336.8s)]

*  Thank you. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Xp_7V5lvCg&t=340.40000000000003s)]
