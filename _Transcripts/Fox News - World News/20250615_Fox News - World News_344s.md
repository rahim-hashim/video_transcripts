# Israeli ambassador to the UN warns of a ‘hot night’ in Israel
**Fox News - World News:** [June 15, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvjHe5Groug)
*  Joining us now for tonight's big close-up is Israeli Ambassador to the United Nations, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvjHe5Groug&t=0.0s)]
*  Danny Danon. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvjHe5Groug&t=5.28s)]
*  Mr. Ambassador, thank you for being here. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvjHe5Groug&t=6.28s)]
*  Let's pick up where Peter left off. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvjHe5Groug&t=8.44s)]
*  What does Israel hope will be coming out of the G7 meeting, and what's next in this war [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvjHe5Groug&t=10.36s)]
*  that seems to have started? [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvjHe5Groug&t=17.0s)]
*  Thank you for having me. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvjHe5Groug&t=18.64s)]
*  You know, we expect moral clarity. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvjHe5Groug&t=19.64s)]
*  Moral clarity means that the world will understand that we are actually doing the dirty work [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvjHe5Groug&t=21.8s)]
*  for the entire democracies all around the world. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvjHe5Groug&t=25.76s)]
*  For decades, Iran played around, that showed the path of deception, of lies. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvjHe5Groug&t=28.8s)]
*  And we decided that we are not taking the chances. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvjHe5Groug&t=33.88s)]
*  We believe the Iranians. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvjHe5Groug&t=35.96s)]
*  On Friday in the Security Council, I looked at the Iranian ambassador, and I told him, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvjHe5Groug&t=37.480000000000004s)]
*  I believe you. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvjHe5Groug&t=40.92s)]
*  When your leaders say that you want to exterminate the state of Israel, we believe you. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvjHe5Groug&t=42.08s)]
*  When you say you want to build a nuclear bomb, we believe you. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvjHe5Groug&t=46.82s)]
*  So we take it very seriously, the threat of Iran, and what we are doing now, we are eliminating [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvjHe5Groug&t=49.72s)]
*  the risk for Israel, but not only for Israel. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvjHe5Groug&t=55.36s)]
*  Today, those ballistic missiles are flying into Tel Aviv and Jerusalem. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvjHe5Groug&t=57.76s)]
*  They can reach New York City and Miami. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvjHe5Groug&t=61.599999999999994s)]
*  Give them a few months, they will have the technology and the ability to do that. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvjHe5Groug&t=64.03999999999999s)]
*  So we are preventing Iran from building not only a nuclear bomb, they are actually building [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvjHe5Groug&t=67.56s)]
*  a ballistic missile power which can compete with the U.S. and Russia combined. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvjHe5Groug&t=71.88s)]
*  That's what their intentions. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvjHe5Groug&t=77.36s)]
*  What we are doing now, we are blocking those ambitions. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvjHe5Groug&t=79.03999999999999s)]
*  Are you confident, though, that you're doing enough to make sure that Iran is isolated, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvjHe5Groug&t=82.3s)]
*  especially with the rest of the Middle East, that Iran is here and they're here alone? [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvjHe5Groug&t=86.72000000000001s)]
*  Well, I speak with many friends from the Gulf area. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvjHe5Groug&t=90.88000000000001s)]
*  They will not say it publicly, but they are very happy to see what we are doing now. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvjHe5Groug&t=93.80000000000001s)]
*  They feel safer when they see our aircraft flying over Tehran and targeting those military [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvjHe5Groug&t=97.96000000000001s)]
*  bases. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvjHe5Groug&t=104.0s)]
*  But look what happened yesterday. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvjHe5Groug&t=105.0s)]
*  We are targeting military bases, infrastructure of ballistic missiles and nuclear reactors, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvjHe5Groug&t=106.42000000000002s)]
*  and they are targeting our cities. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvjHe5Groug&t=111.86000000000001s)]
*  Unfortunately, last night was a very difficult night. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvjHe5Groug&t=114.64s)]
*  Ten people died because of those attacks. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvjHe5Groug&t=117.48s)]
*  And also tonight is going to be a hard night in Israel. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvjHe5Groug&t=119.88000000000001s)]
*  Ambassador, I want to ask you about the United Nations, because obviously you're the ambassador [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvjHe5Groug&t=123.04s)]
*  to the United Nations. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvjHe5Groug&t=127.36s)]
*  And that body is criticized by many for being sympathizers of Hamas. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvjHe5Groug&t=129.32s)]
*  They certainly, United Nations, they don't shy away from criticizing Israel. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvjHe5Groug&t=134.84s)]
*  We have something for you to watch. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvjHe5Groug&t=138.52s)]
*  We'll get your reaction. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvjHe5Groug&t=139.52s)]
*  Israel today is supporting war crimes, crimes against humanity, and deliberate undermining [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvjHe5Groug&t=142.36s)]
*  of global peace and security. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvjHe5Groug&t=150.64000000000001s)]
*  Dozens of children are dying of starvation. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvjHe5Groug&t=153.12s)]
*  The images of mothers embracing their motionless bodies, caressing their hair, talking to them, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvjHe5Groug&t=162.64s)]
*  apologizing to them. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvjHe5Groug&t=174.79999999999998s)]
*  Ambassador, we were taking a look at some of the resolutions coming out of the United [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvjHe5Groug&t=185.76s)]
*  Nations just last year. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvjHe5Groug&t=189.04s)]
*  Seventeen condemning Israel, and collectively only six condemning the rest of the world, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvjHe5Groug&t=190.92s)]
*  including North Korea, Iran, Syria, and others. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvjHe5Groug&t=196.88s)]
*  So what kind of support do you think Israel can expect from the United Nations in this war? [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvjHe5Groug&t=200.16s)]
*  Well, we saw a hypocrisy in action. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvjHe5Groug&t=205.39999999999998s)]
*  You know, October 7th happened 20 months ago. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvjHe5Groug&t=207.32s)]
*  The UN was not capable until today to pass one resolution condemning the atrocities of Hamas. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvjHe5Groug&t=210.2s)]
*  And this body was established 80 years ago after the Holocaust. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvjHe5Groug&t=216.32s)]
*  And they saw what happened. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvjHe5Groug&t=220.04s)]
*  They saw the footage of what happened to us on October 7th. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvjHe5Groug&t=221.04s)]
*  They were not capable to pass a resolution condemning Hamas. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvjHe5Groug&t=224.07999999999998s)]
*  It shows that you need leadership. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvjHe5Groug&t=227.04s)]
*  We are waiting for the new U.S. ambassador to come in very soon. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvjHe5Groug&t=229.6s)]
*  And I'm sure that together we will continue to fight back against the hypocrisy of the [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvjHe5Groug&t=232.79999999999998s)]
*  UN. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvjHe5Groug&t=236.56s)]
*  Ambassador, follow up on Lydia's question. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvjHe5Groug&t=237.56s)]
*  Iran is taking out civilians. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvjHe5Groug&t=240.76s)]
*  Israel is taking out military leadership and military sites. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvjHe5Groug&t=243.32s)]
*  Inside Israel, Iran is seen as a multi-headed beast, an octopus. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvjHe5Groug&t=248.04s)]
*  Hamas is an arm. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvjHe5Groug&t=252.04s)]
*  Hezbollah is an arm. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvjHe5Groug&t=253.28s)]
*  The head is now fighting civilians in Israel. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvjHe5Groug&t=254.35999999999999s)]
*  How does the United Nations escape that reality? [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvjHe5Groug&t=258.52s)]
*  Well, Doctor, you know, the UN, they tend to blame Israel for everything. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvjHe5Groug&t=262.36s)]
*  And that's what's happening now. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvjHe5Groug&t=268.08s)]
*  Instead of telling us, thank you very much for what you are doing now in Iran, taking [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvjHe5Groug&t=269.32s)]
*  care of the threat that they are blaming us. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvjHe5Groug&t=274.03999999999996s)]
*  They put an equation between Iran and Israel. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvjHe5Groug&t=276.47999999999996s)]
*  And you cannot make that equation. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvjHe5Groug&t=279.23999999999995s)]
*  That's a false equation. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvjHe5Groug&t=280.23999999999995s)]
*  But we will continue. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvjHe5Groug&t=282.44s)]
*  We are determined to make sure that the threat will not be there. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvjHe5Groug&t=283.44s)]
*  Prime Minister Netanyahu took a very bold decision. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvjHe5Groug&t=286.84s)]
*  You know, it's not easy for a prime minister of a tiny country. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvjHe5Groug&t=288.76s)]
*  Look at Israel. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvjHe5Groug&t=292.08s)]
*  Nine million people. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvjHe5Groug&t=293.08s)]
*  In Iran, you have 90 million people. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvjHe5Groug&t=294.08s)]
*  Look at the map. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvjHe5Groug&t=295.71999999999997s)]
*  Iran is bigger than Israel by 70 times. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvjHe5Groug&t=296.71999999999997s)]
*  But still, we are very determined to make sure that we can live peacefully, even if [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvjHe5Groug&t=300.64s)]
*  it means that now we are paying a heavy price. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvjHe5Groug&t=305.12s)]
*  Last question. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvjHe5Groug&t=307.8s)]
*  How does this end? [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvjHe5Groug&t=308.8s)]
*  Well, I believe it will end without the threat of Iran. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvjHe5Groug&t=309.8s)]
*  You know, for decades, people spoke about it. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvjHe5Groug&t=313.4s)]
*  The UN had deliberations around it. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvjHe5Groug&t=315.08s)]
*  JCPOA was not successful at the end. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvjHe5Groug&t=317.8s)]
*  We all know what happened with that agreement. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvjHe5Groug&t=320.24s)]
*  At the end of the day, Iran will not have the nuclear capability. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvjHe5Groug&t=322.2s)]
*  Mr. Ambassador, thank you for being here. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvjHe5Groug&t=325.32s)]
*  Israeli Ambassador Danny Danan. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvjHe5Groug&t=327.88s)]
*  We appreciate your time. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvjHe5Groug&t=329.32s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvjHe5Groug&t=330.32s)]
*  Very insightful. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvjHe5Groug&t=331.32s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvjHe5Groug&t=332.32s)]
