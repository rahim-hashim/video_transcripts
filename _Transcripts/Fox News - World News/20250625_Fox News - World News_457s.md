# Rubio torches 'leakers' who claim Iran strikes failed
**Fox News - World News:** [June 25, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uDtjsQdDdE)
*  You are a man of strength, but you're also a man of peace. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uDtjsQdDdE&t=0.0s)]
*  And the fact that you are now also successful in getting this ceasefire done between Israel [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uDtjsQdDdE&t=4.84s)]
*  and Iran, I really want to commend you for that. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uDtjsQdDdE&t=9.8s)]
*  NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte praising President Trump's diplomacy in the Middle [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uDtjsQdDdE&t=12.72s)]
*  East. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uDtjsQdDdE&t=16.56s)]
*  And that's the mood back home as well. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uDtjsQdDdE&t=17.56s)]
*  Georgia Congressman Buddy Carter, formerly nominating the president for the Nobel Peace [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uDtjsQdDdE&t=18.92s)]
*  Prize. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uDtjsQdDdE&t=23.0s)]
*  Carter saying Trump's leadership in striking Iran and brokering a ceasefire deserves recognition. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uDtjsQdDdE&t=24.0s)]
*  So we'll see how that goes. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uDtjsQdDdE&t=28.52s)]
*  And in the meantime, that ceasefire does appear to be holding after a pretty shaky start. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uDtjsQdDdE&t=30.0s)]
*  Israel and Iran are both keeping their powder dry, at least for now. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uDtjsQdDdE&t=34.24s)]
*  Mike Tobin is joining us live in Tel Aviv with the latest. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uDtjsQdDdE&t=37.92s)]
*  Hi Mike. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uDtjsQdDdE&t=40.400000000000006s)]
*  And Bill, you've got all sides in this conflict claiming victory at this point. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uDtjsQdDdE&t=41.400000000000006s)]
*  You've got President Trump in the Hague right now pushing back at the news agencies who [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uDtjsQdDdE&t=46.040000000000006s)]
*  have run reports that quoted an intelligence report suggesting that the U.S. damage or [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uDtjsQdDdE&t=49.84s)]
*  the damage done by the U.S. strikes is not as extensive as the president says they are. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uDtjsQdDdE&t=56.28s)]
*  The secretary of state is traveling with them criticizing these news agencies for running [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uDtjsQdDdE&t=60.160000000000004s)]
*  reports that were generated by a leak. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uDtjsQdDdE&t=64.72s)]
*  This is what a leaker is telling you the intelligence says. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uDtjsQdDdE&t=67.92s)]
*  That's the game these people play. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uDtjsQdDdE&t=70.28s)]
*  We dropped 12 of the strongest bombs on the planet right down the hole in two places. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uDtjsQdDdE&t=71.72s)]
*  Everything underneath that mountain is in bad shape. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uDtjsQdDdE&t=77.0s)]
*  Now anything in the world can be rebuilt. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uDtjsQdDdE&t=79.12s)]
*  But now we know where it is. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uDtjsQdDdE&t=81.5s)]
*  And if they try to rebuild it, we'll have options there as well. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uDtjsQdDdE&t=82.84s)]
*  But all this leaker stuff, these leakers are professional stabbers. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uDtjsQdDdE&t=85.14s)]
*  The IAEA chief Rafael Grossi says he wants to get inspectors on the ground to assess [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uDtjsQdDdE&t=91.82s)]
*  the damage, but he is in agreement with President Trump that Iran and its nuclear program are [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uDtjsQdDdE&t=96.1s)]
*  no longer the same. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uDtjsQdDdE&t=100.86s)]
*  Hardline supporters of Iran's government gathered to rally in Tehran. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uDtjsQdDdE&t=102.58s)]
*  Iran also executed three men they accused of spying for Israel. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uDtjsQdDdE&t=106.18s)]
*  They were convicted in an Iranian court of smuggling equipment used in an assassination. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uDtjsQdDdE&t=109.94s)]
*  Meantime, Iranian President Masoud Pesachian is claiming victory and publicly expressing [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uDtjsQdDdE&t=114.98s)]
*  a desire to work out differences with the United States. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uDtjsQdDdE&t=118.98s)]
*  Now the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is also claiming victory, saying that two [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uDtjsQdDdE&t=122.5s)]
*  existential threats to the Jewish state are now gone. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uDtjsQdDdE&t=126.94s)]
*  The ballistic missile arsenal of Iran and Iran's nuclear program. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uDtjsQdDdE&t=130.22s)]
*  Bill, back to you. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uDtjsQdDdE&t=133.74s)]
*  Hopefully the people in Israel can finally take a breath now that they don't have missiles [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uDtjsQdDdE&t=134.74s)]
*  coming in every day. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uDtjsQdDdE&t=137.34s)]
*  Mike Tobin live in Tel Aviv. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uDtjsQdDdE&t=138.34s)]
*  Thank you, Mike. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uDtjsQdDdE&t=139.94s)]
*  Let's bring in retired force serge general Joseph Fotele. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uDtjsQdDdE&t=140.94s)]
*  He's a former CENTCOM commander and it's so good to have you here today. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uDtjsQdDdE&t=143.54s)]
*  Yesterday afternoon, the IAEA director was on with Martha McCallum. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uDtjsQdDdE&t=147.29999999999998s)]
*  Take a listen to what he said. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uDtjsQdDdE&t=153.18s)]
*  I want to get your take. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uDtjsQdDdE&t=154.18s)]
*  What we see is a very important degree of damage in the three facilities. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uDtjsQdDdE&t=155.18s)]
*  Natanz, which was the first to be hit and sustained very, very serious damage in one [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uDtjsQdDdE&t=161.82s)]
*  important centrifuge holes where enrichment was being carried out. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uDtjsQdDdE&t=168.02s)]
*  Although no one has been there inside to see, of course, the conclusion is that the damage [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uDtjsQdDdE&t=173.74s)]
*  must be very, very, very important. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uDtjsQdDdE&t=181.78s)]
*  General, we can pull up the pictures here for the before and after and our audience [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uDtjsQdDdE&t=185.74s)]
*  is getting used to seeing these. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uDtjsQdDdE&t=189.74s)]
*  I think what the IAEA director was saying is that we don't necessarily know for sure, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uDtjsQdDdE&t=192.42000000000002s)]
*  but that he says that there has been a very important degree of damage. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uDtjsQdDdE&t=198.94s)]
*  What are you hearing or what do you know that can add to this conversation? [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uDtjsQdDdE&t=203.46s)]
*  Yeah, thanks, Dana. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uDtjsQdDdE&t=207.38s)]
*  It's great to be with you. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uDtjsQdDdE&t=209.70000000000002s)]
*  Well, I think your statement certainly is an important one and it certainly underscores [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uDtjsQdDdE&t=211.58s)]
*  the significance of our strike here and the fact that Iran's nuclear weapons capability [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uDtjsQdDdE&t=217.42s)]
*  is not the same today as it was just a week ago or just a few days ago. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uDtjsQdDdE&t=223.01999999999998s)]
*  So I think that's an important assessment. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uDtjsQdDdE&t=227.82s)]
*  Of course, he emphasized the importance of getting people on the ground to look at this. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uDtjsQdDdE&t=229.74s)]
*  I think the thing that's most important for people to appreciate is this battle damage [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uDtjsQdDdE&t=233.98s)]
*  assessment process that has now become kind of something common to talk about really is [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uDtjsQdDdE&t=238.1s)]
*  a process and it goes through certain phases. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uDtjsQdDdE&t=242.74s)]
*  It starts with very simple initial assessments and then it gets more into the detailed total [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uDtjsQdDdE&t=245.22s)]
*  system analysis. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uDtjsQdDdE&t=251.14s)]
*  And when we look at that, we do value looking at getting information from people that have [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uDtjsQdDdE&t=252.66s)]
*  been on the ground. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uDtjsQdDdE&t=257.26s)]
*  But we also look at other things like the effects of the Israeli strikes, for example, [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uDtjsQdDdE&t=257.9s)]
*  them going after things like the conversion plants or the manufacturing process. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uDtjsQdDdE&t=262.98s)]
*  These are all really important things that have to be worked in to the total system damage [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uDtjsQdDdE&t=268.46s)]
*  assessment here that really tells us what the long term impact of this is. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uDtjsQdDdE&t=274.1s)]
*  Yes, people are impatient, right? [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uDtjsQdDdE&t=278.42s)]
*  We are used to ordering from DoorDash and getting it 10 minutes later. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uDtjsQdDdE&t=280.38s)]
*  That's not how the intelligence will work. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uDtjsQdDdE&t=283.7s)]
*  If you had to guess how much time is needed in order to fully assess and get a good sense. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uDtjsQdDdE&t=285.98s)]
*  Well, it's going to be days to weeks, I think, in terms of this. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uDtjsQdDdE&t=292.98s)]
*  Again, as soon as people can get on the ground and we can, again, look at all the information [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uDtjsQdDdE&t=296.66s)]
*  that's being collected, then the intelligence community, the Pentagon will have the opportunity [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uDtjsQdDdE&t=303.38s)]
*  to make a better assessment, I think, about what the impacts are. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uDtjsQdDdE&t=307.65999999999997s)]
*  But I think it's very clear. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uDtjsQdDdE&t=315.26s)]
*  There's a significant amount of damage that has been done to the Iranian nuclear weapons [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uDtjsQdDdE&t=317.38s)]
*  program. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uDtjsQdDdE&t=321.94s)]
*  I don't think there's any ability to dispute that. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uDtjsQdDdE&t=322.34s)]
*  It's definitely different today than it was. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uDtjsQdDdE&t=325.94s)]
*  The Sancom Commander nominee who is going for the job. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uDtjsQdDdE&t=329.14s)]
*  We testified on Capitol Hill yesterday about Iran as a danger overall. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uDtjsQdDdE&t=332.78s)]
*  Watch. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uDtjsQdDdE&t=337.78s)]
*  I think we would all agree that Iran is the number one source of instability in the region, [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uDtjsQdDdE&t=339.26s)]
*  the number one source and sponsor of terror throughout the world. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uDtjsQdDdE&t=343.85999999999996s)]
*  At the strategic level, I think they've been weakened since the events of 7 October. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uDtjsQdDdE&t=348.38s)]
*  At the tactical level, I think they've been degraded, deterring Iran and its proxies. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uDtjsQdDdE&t=353.76s)]
*  I think that is a critical element of our national security. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uDtjsQdDdE&t=358.34s)]
*  We've got to be in a three-point stance, ready to go every single day. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uDtjsQdDdE&t=360.78s)]
*  Do you agree with that assessment, or would you have anything to add in terms of dangers [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uDtjsQdDdE&t=364.17999999999995s)]
*  in the region? [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uDtjsQdDdE&t=367.79999999999995s)]
*  I do agree with that assessment. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uDtjsQdDdE&t=369.61999999999995s)]
*  I think it's pretty accurate. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uDtjsQdDdE&t=371.09999999999997s)]
*  Certainly, Iran has suffered some significant strategic setbacks. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uDtjsQdDdE&t=373.46s)]
*  Their long-range standoff weapons or ballistic missiles have taken a beating over the last [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uDtjsQdDdE&t=378.73999999999995s)]
*  12 or 13 days. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uDtjsQdDdE&t=384.9s)]
*  their nuclear weapons program has been severely damaged. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uDtjsQdDdE&t=386.74s)]
*  Of course, the third leg of their strategy, the proxies, we've seen what's happened to [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uDtjsQdDdE&t=390.65999999999997s)]
*  Hezbollah, we've seen what's happened to Hamas. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uDtjsQdDdE&t=396.3s)]
*  We've done a lot of damage to the Houthis. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uDtjsQdDdE&t=399.06s)]
*  They really haven't responded in this situation. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uDtjsQdDdE&t=400.86s)]
*  We still have the Iranian militia groups in Iraq and in Syria, but they have not responded [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uDtjsQdDdE&t=403.38s)]
*  much. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uDtjsQdDdE&t=409.53999999999996s)]
*  They may in fact be deterred by the actions that have been taken by the Israelis and [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uDtjsQdDdE&t=410.54s)]
*  by the Americans over the last several days. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uDtjsQdDdE&t=416.14000000000004s)]
*  That said, they still have the ability to put boats out into the Straits of Hormuz. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uDtjsQdDdE&t=419.5s)]
*  They still have the ability to mine. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uDtjsQdDdE&t=424.66s)]
*  They still have likely sleeper cells or operatives that can do damage out there. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uDtjsQdDdE&t=426.42s)]
*  They have a drone and cyber capability. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uDtjsQdDdE&t=433.74s)]
*  I don't think you can count Iran out here. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uDtjsQdDdE&t=436.02000000000004s)]
*  Although they have, I think, been strategically set back in a number of ways. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uDtjsQdDdE&t=438.38s)]
*  General Votel, thank you for joining us today. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uDtjsQdDdE&t=442.94s)]
*  Good to be with you. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uDtjsQdDdE&t=445.14s)]
