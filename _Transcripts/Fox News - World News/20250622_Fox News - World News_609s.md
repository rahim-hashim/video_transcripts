# Sean Hannity: No president has ever been able to deal a blow like this
**Fox News - World News:** [June 22, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soBNZoTEvD0)
*  All right, well, let's bring in Sean Hannity, our friend. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soBNZoTEvD0&t=0.0s)]
*  He just spoke to President Trump last night, and he joins us now with more about that conversation. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soBNZoTEvD0&t=2.6s)]
*  Good morning, Sean. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soBNZoTEvD0&t=7.76s)]
*  What did the president tell you? [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soBNZoTEvD0&t=9.200000000000001s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soBNZoTEvD0&t=10.76s)]
*  Well, before I get to the president, I want to ... I really was paying very close attention [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soBNZoTEvD0&t=11.76s)]
*  to everything that Jennifer Griffin was reporting here. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soBNZoTEvD0&t=16.56s)]
*  The deception, the intelligence, the planning, the precision, the tomahawks, the B-2s, the [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soBNZoTEvD0&t=19.2s)]
*  bunker buster bombs. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soBNZoTEvD0&t=26.48s)]
*  If you just pause and think of the minutia, the level of detail, the precision, every [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soBNZoTEvD0&t=28.92s)]
*  American should be very proud today of every man and woman that works in our military and [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soBNZoTEvD0&t=35.92s)]
*  everybody that was part of the planning and operation that took place so successfully [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soBNZoTEvD0&t=41.6s)]
*  last night. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soBNZoTEvD0&t=47.08s)]
*  The fact that all of this went undetected, you can hear in the level of detail every [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soBNZoTEvD0&t=48.08s)]
*  single aspect of it, you hear danger. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soBNZoTEvD0&t=52.92s)]
*  This was something I was warning about, Rachel, last week, that there is no military effort [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soBNZoTEvD0&t=56.38s)]
*  that does not have danger associated with it. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soBNZoTEvD0&t=61.64s)]
*  I can add one little bit of context to a little ... I can't add to the specific detail that [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soBNZoTEvD0&t=64.86s)]
*  Jennifer went into, which was so comprehensive, and it should make, again, every American [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soBNZoTEvD0&t=71.4s)]
*  proud, but I can say they were really ... If you listen to the president and listen very [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soBNZoTEvD0&t=76.22s)]
*  closely to what he has been saying, Iran cannot have nuclear weapons. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soBNZoTEvD0&t=81.34s)]
*  He said last night, now you have another opportunity for peace. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soBNZoTEvD0&t=86.24000000000001s)]
*  You did not take the first opportunity. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soBNZoTEvD0&t=90.22s)]
*  Part two of our military operation is to protect American assets in the region. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soBNZoTEvD0&t=93.92s)]
*  That was well underway, under the radar, long before anybody even got there. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soBNZoTEvD0&t=100.22s)]
*  There were people that were being removed from the region, fortification of certain [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soBNZoTEvD0&t=106.06s)]
*  places were taking place, and I think the president was very clear that the consequences [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soBNZoTEvD0&t=111.1s)]
*  would be devastating and severe. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soBNZoTEvD0&t=116.46s)]
*  He said, we already took out the hard targets, and they are certainly vulnerable in terms [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soBNZoTEvD0&t=119.02s)]
*  of the entire economy of Iran as based on their selling of oil, so a lot of those oil [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soBNZoTEvD0&t=124.3s)]
*  refineries are in one particular area. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soBNZoTEvD0&t=132.82s)]
*  Their power grid could be taken out. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soBNZoTEvD0&t=136.06s)]
*  Compared to the operation last night, this would be a layup, and the president, he stated [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soBNZoTEvD0&t=138.46s)]
*  his objectives. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soBNZoTEvD0&t=144.01999999999998s)]
*  His objectives were fulfilled last night. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soBNZoTEvD0&t=145.66s)]
*  Now, the Israelis, they have a different objective because they are the ones that have been taking [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soBNZoTEvD0&t=148.01999999999998s)]
*  on through Iran directly and their proxies hundreds of thousands of missiles being fired [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soBNZoTEvD0&t=152.82s)]
*  into their towns, their communities, and their cities. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soBNZoTEvD0&t=158.14s)]
*  I would not be surprised at all if the Israelis decided at some point that they wanted to [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soBNZoTEvD0&t=162.22s)]
*  go after that target, but the president was clear in terms of what American interests [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soBNZoTEvD0&t=169.54s)]
*  were, America first, America's agenda, and he has been very, very consistent in terms [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soBNZoTEvD0&t=173.94s)]
*  of his ideology, philosophy, in terms of the national security of our country, and I think [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soBNZoTEvD0&t=179.54s)]
*  he shows that consistency here. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soBNZoTEvD0&t=186.46s)]
*  Yes, Sean, to your point, Peter Hexeth, Secretary Hexeth, saying today about President Trump, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soBNZoTEvD0&t=188.14s)]
*  quote, he seeks peace in Iran should take that path. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soBNZoTEvD0&t=193.85999999999999s)]
*  We have just a little bit of Hexeth's comments. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soBNZoTEvD0&t=198.14s)]
*  I'd like to play for you, Sean, and that is where he's making the point that basically [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soBNZoTEvD0&t=200.89999999999998s)]
*  only President Trump could have gotten this done. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soBNZoTEvD0&t=204.82s)]
*  Watch here. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soBNZoTEvD0&t=208.33999999999997s)]
*  Many presidents have dreamed of delivering the final blow to Iran's nuclear program, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soBNZoTEvD0&t=210.89999999999998s)]
*  and none could until President Trump. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soBNZoTEvD0&t=218.42s)]
*  The operation President Trump planned was bold and it was brilliant, showing the world [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soBNZoTEvD0&t=223.18s)]
*  that American deterrence is back. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soBNZoTEvD0&t=229.7s)]
*  When this president speaks, the world should listen, and the U.S. military, we can back [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soBNZoTEvD0&t=233.7s)]
*  it up. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soBNZoTEvD0&t=241.38s)]
*  Sean, your thoughts? [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soBNZoTEvD0&t=242.38s)]
*  Griff, by the way, good to see all of you. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soBNZoTEvD0&t=243.98s)]
*  I'm watching every weekend, so I feel like I'm just having coffee with my friends on [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soBNZoTEvD0&t=246.9s)]
*  the weekend. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soBNZoTEvD0&t=251.01999999999998s)]
*  But in all seriousness, you know, Pete is 1000% right. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soBNZoTEvD0&t=252.01999999999998s)]
*  I mean, we can take this back to 1979. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soBNZoTEvD0&t=255.82s)]
*  Griff, our mutual friend, Colonel Oliver North, actively involved in operations with Iran. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soBNZoTEvD0&t=259.02s)]
*  He went there. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soBNZoTEvD0&t=265.3s)]
*  He had a suicide pill with him. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soBNZoTEvD0&t=266.38s)]
*  No president has been able to deal a blow like this to the number one state sponsor [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soBNZoTEvD0&t=268.88s)]
*  of terror. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soBNZoTEvD0&t=273.92s)]
*  Here's the president's calculation. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soBNZoTEvD0&t=274.92s)]
*  It's not that complicated if you listen to what he says. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soBNZoTEvD0&t=276.64s)]
*  And I urge everybody to hear him when he speaks. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soBNZoTEvD0&t=279.84s)]
*  He says Iran cannot have a nuclear weapon. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soBNZoTEvD0&t=283.64s)]
*  If you go back in time, and we have, he's been saying that since 2011. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soBNZoTEvD0&t=286.18s)]
*  Okay, he has said it consistently. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soBNZoTEvD0&t=289.92s)]
*  He gave them a 60-day window. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soBNZoTEvD0&t=292.52s)]
*  And then he said, are you sure? [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soBNZoTEvD0&t=295.20000000000005s)]
*  Because it's going to be bad. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soBNZoTEvD0&t=297.28000000000003s)]
*  He gives them up to two more weeks, the day after. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soBNZoTEvD0&t=298.96000000000004s)]
*  That was Thursday. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soBNZoTEvD0&t=301.84000000000003s)]
*  On Friday, you have the Iranian foreign minister said, no, they're not going to be involved [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soBNZoTEvD0&t=302.84000000000003s)]
*  in any conversations. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soBNZoTEvD0&t=306.6s)]
*  And then last night happens. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soBNZoTEvD0&t=308.22s)]
*  But it is consistent with what the president has done. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soBNZoTEvD0&t=310.20000000000005s)]
*  I know a lot of people want to discuss and talk about or relitigate Iraq and Afghanistan. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soBNZoTEvD0&t=312.44s)]
*  Well, we can relitigate one part of Afghanistan, and that's when Donald Trump dropped the mother [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soBNZoTEvD0&t=317.88s)]
*  of all bombs on Afghanistan. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soBNZoTEvD0&t=323.54s)]
*  We can relitigate how to deal with Iran in the past. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soBNZoTEvD0&t=326.22s)]
*  And the Iranians could have learned something when General Soleimani was taken off that [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soBNZoTEvD0&t=329.72s)]
*  tarmac and that terror threat was removed. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soBNZoTEvD0&t=333.94s)]
*  We could have learned something when President Trump took out Baghdadi and associates. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soBNZoTEvD0&t=337.42s)]
*  And we really could have learned a lot if we watched President Trump. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soBNZoTEvD0&t=342.66s)]
*  Remember, under Obama and Biden, the ISIS caliphate built up. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soBNZoTEvD0&t=346.5s)]
*  It was a clear and present danger to the world. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soBNZoTEvD0&t=350.7s)]
*  And Donald Trump systematically wiped them out step by step. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soBNZoTEvD0&t=353.94s)]
*  He walked them back. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soBNZoTEvD0&t=357.65999999999997s)]
*  And the ISIS caliphate ceases to exist. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soBNZoTEvD0&t=359.26s)]
*  Now, what's fascinating is what's going to happen next. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soBNZoTEvD0&t=361.46s)]
*  Clearly, our military, our Pentagon is prepared for any possible retaliation. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soBNZoTEvD0&t=364.94s)]
*  But the message has been sent like the message was sent before last night. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soBNZoTEvD0&t=370.41999999999996s)]
*  The message before last night was you can't have a nuclear weapon. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soBNZoTEvD0&t=374.58s)]
*  Take a peaceful solution. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soBNZoTEvD0&t=378.34s)]
*  We are offering you a pathway towards such. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soBNZoTEvD0&t=380.02000000000004s)]
*  Part two of that is if you attack any assets of the United States of America in the region, [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soBNZoTEvD0&t=383.1s)]
*  we will overwhelmingly devastate you. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soBNZoTEvD0&t=389.22s)]
*  I would argue off the top of my head, probably the first two targets would be refineries, [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soBNZoTEvD0&t=392.38s)]
*  their electric grid that is run by gas. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soBNZoTEvD0&t=397.34000000000003s)]
*  And probably if we know, as the president had stated last week, where the supreme leader [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soBNZoTEvD0&t=400.5s)]
*  is the rest or the remaining leadership, because the Israelis had already wiped out most of [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soBNZoTEvD0&t=405.84000000000003s)]
*  it to begin with. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soBNZoTEvD0&t=410.64s)]
*  But a message has been sent to the world. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soBNZoTEvD0&t=412.6s)]
*  The Trump doctrine is very different, very unique than any other president in the history [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soBNZoTEvD0&t=414.72s)]
*  of this country. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soBNZoTEvD0&t=419.96000000000004s)]
*  And I think he has proven that you can successfully take out and neutralize threats in the world [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soBNZoTEvD0&t=421.56s)]
*  without getting involved in forever wars. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soBNZoTEvD0&t=428.64s)]
*  I think he's proven that once again. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soBNZoTEvD0&t=431.28000000000003s)]
*  It doesn't mean that there's still not date. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soBNZoTEvD0&t=433.32s)]
*  We're in danger. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soBNZoTEvD0&t=434.88s)]
*  You know, Joe Biden and Kamala allowed, you know, known terrorists into our country. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soBNZoTEvD0&t=436.71999999999997s)]
*  So we have to be on the watch right now. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soBNZoTEvD0&t=441.04s)]
*  You know, Sean, Pete Hegs said that Donald Trump or President Trump effectively obliterated [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soBNZoTEvD0&t=442.76s)]
*  Iran's nuclear nuclear ambitions. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soBNZoTEvD0&t=449.84s)]
*  And I think that that's fair to say we obviously we need to see more things that come out of [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soBNZoTEvD0&t=452.02s)]
*  the site and how much. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soBNZoTEvD0&t=458.36s)]
*  But it appears that that is what what has happened. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soBNZoTEvD0&t=459.92s)]
*  And that's a good thing. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soBNZoTEvD0&t=462.04s)]
*  I agree with you. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soBNZoTEvD0&t=463.15999999999997s)]
