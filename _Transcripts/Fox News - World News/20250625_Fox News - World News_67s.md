# Trump spars with 'fake news CNN' at NATO summit #foxnews #news #shorts
**Fox News - World News:** [June 25, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ85jC-7iAQ)
*  Oh, fake news, CNN? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ85jC-7iAQ&t=0.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah, here we go. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ85jC-7iAQ&t=1.8s)]
*  When did you hear this question? [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ85jC-7iAQ&t=4.0s)]
*  Thank you, sir. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ85jC-7iAQ&t=5.6000000000000005s)]
*  You should really say how great our soldiers and our warriors are. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ85jC-7iAQ&t=6.8s)]
*  I think everyone appreciates our soldiers and our warriors. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ85jC-7iAQ&t=10.5s)]
*  I do have two questions for you, Mr. President. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ85jC-7iAQ&t=12.700000000000001s)]
*  You just cited Israeli intelligence on these attacks. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ85jC-7iAQ&t=14.9s)]
*  Earlier, you said U.S. intelligence was inconclusive. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ85jC-7iAQ&t=18.8s)]
*  Are you relying on Israeli intelligence for your assessment of the impact of the strikes? [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ85jC-7iAQ&t=22.1s)]
*  No, no. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ85jC-7iAQ&t=26.6s)]
*  Also, Iran made the statement, and it's also, if you read the document that was given, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ85jC-7iAQ&t=27.6s)]
*  that Pete can talk about if you'd like, the document said it could be very severe damage, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ85jC-7iAQ&t=32.7s)]
*  but they didn't take that. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ85jC-7iAQ&t=38.2s)]
*  They said it could be limited or it could be very severe. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ85jC-7iAQ&t=39.800000000000004s)]
*  They really didn't know, other than to say it could be limited or it could be very, very [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ85jC-7iAQ&t=42.54s)]
*  severe. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ85jC-7iAQ&t=47.120000000000005s)]
*  And you didn't choose to put that because it was very early after. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ85jC-7iAQ&t=48.34s)]
*  Since then, we've collected additional intelligence. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ85jC-7iAQ&t=52.0s)]
*  We've also spoken to people who have seen the site, and the site is obliterated. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ85jC-7iAQ&t=54.74s)]
*  And we think everything nuclear is down there. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ85jC-7iAQ&t=60.480000000000004s)]
*  They didn't take it out. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ85jC-7iAQ&t=62.88s)]
