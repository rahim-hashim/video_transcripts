# Surge in antisemitic attacks a result of the 'brainwash' on campuses: Israeli consul general
**Fox News - World News:** [June 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JwNB_sQ_yeE)
*  The Egyptian national accused of using a makeshift flamethrower and molotov cocktails to attack pro-Israel marchers in Boulder, now facing 119 charges, after he was formally charged with a federal hate crime yesterday. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JwNB_sQ_yeE&t=0.0s)]
*  Here to discuss it is Consul General of Israel in New York, Ophira Okounis. Ophira, great to see you. I wish it was under different circumstances. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JwNB_sQ_yeE&t=13.0s)]
*  Sir, I want to take a look at this timeline of what we've been seeing here in the United States. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JwNB_sQ_yeE&t=22.0s)]
*  So, on April 13, arson attack on the Pennsylvania Governor, Josh Shapiro's residence, because he's Jewish. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JwNB_sQ_yeE&t=27.0s)]
*  May 21, Israeli embassy staffers murdered, executed in Washington, D.C. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JwNB_sQ_yeE&t=34.0s)]
*  And then on June 1, 15 injured in an attack on pro-Israel gathering in Boulder, Colorado. What is happening? [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JwNB_sQ_yeE&t=40.0s)]
*  This is a direct result of the brainwash in campuses and the universities from October 8, 2023. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JwNB_sQ_yeE&t=48.0s)]
*  One day after the Hamas, animals invaded to the state of Israel, attacked, murdered, butchered, pregnant women, Holocaust survivors, babies. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JwNB_sQ_yeE&t=60.0s)]
*  They killed babies by their own hands. And they are so rude people to attack Israel now just because we are defending ourselves. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JwNB_sQ_yeE&t=74.0s)]
*  So, the brainwash in the universities and the campuses since then, I think that now you reflect the results of this brainwash. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JwNB_sQ_yeE&t=85.0s)]
*  By the way, funded by Qataris money. Most of the mobs here in the streets of New York are actually supported by Qataris money. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JwNB_sQ_yeE&t=93.0s)]
*  Well, and Afir, you were talking about we were attacked, as you mentioned. You were attacked on October 7. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JwNB_sQ_yeE&t=103.0s)]
*  And what's the appropriate response, Afir, to a 9-11 type attack? Because Israel is a smaller population. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JwNB_sQ_yeE&t=108.0s)]
*  That would mean tens of thousands of people here in the United States if what happened on October 7 happened here. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JwNB_sQ_yeE&t=113.0s)]
*  So, what is the appropriate response to a 9-11 type attack? [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JwNB_sQ_yeE&t=118.0s)]
*  So, I will tell you. We don't want this war. I want that people will understand. Here in America and all around the world, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JwNB_sQ_yeE&t=121.0s)]
*  actually, there was a ceasefire until October 7 on 6th, 29 in the morning. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JwNB_sQ_yeE&t=127.0s)]
*  They attacked us, very, you know, like a very barbaric attack. And we are defending ourselves. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JwNB_sQ_yeE&t=134.0s)]
*  We cannot accept a situation that the Hamas animals, and I'm using the words animals because you need to see the horrific pictures from that day, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JwNB_sQ_yeE&t=142.0s)]
*  what they did to our people. So, we are defending ourselves right now. They are so rude. Now they are saying to Israel, stop the war. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JwNB_sQ_yeE&t=154.0s)]
*  We don't want the war. We want, first, two things I have to tell you. First of all, we want all the hostages in Israel, all of them. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JwNB_sQ_yeE&t=165.0s)]
*  And the second thing is to defeat Hamas. I'm trying to imagine a situation that people here will actually attack by another country or terror organization. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JwNB_sQ_yeE&t=174.0s)]
*  Sure, we've got to get going. But you're right. Two things. Return the hostages and, you know, Hamas has got to stop the attacks. We hear you. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JwNB_sQ_yeE&t=187.0s)]
*  Afir Akunas, thank you, sir. We appreciate your time. Thank you. And our hearts are with you. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JwNB_sQ_yeE&t=194.0s)]
