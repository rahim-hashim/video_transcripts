# Trump heated over Israel, Iran hours after ceasefire agreement reached
**Fox News - World News:** [June 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE)
*  So the President of the United States obviously very direct. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=0.0s)]
*  He's disappointed that the ceasefire was breached. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=3.34s)]
*  And it was, as far as I could tell, the ceasefire was breached by the Iranians. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=5.34s)]
*  And what Israel did was within their rights. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=10.14s)]
*  They had 12 hours before it ended. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=13.38s)]
*  They got some targets to finish up. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=15.1s)]
*  So I think the president said in the spirit of ceasefire, it could have leveled off a [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=17.1s)]
*  little. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=21.86s)]
*  But it doesn't seem like Israel actually violated the ceasefire. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=22.86s)]
*  But Iran, the IDF now will strike back, according to the defense minister, Israel Katz. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=26.16s)]
*  Well, I think what you're saying from this president is he likes being in the middle [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=32.4s)]
*  with conflicts. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=36.72s)]
*  He likes to be the negotiator there. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=38.32s)]
*  I think when it came down to the Iran situation, he was very clear they couldn't have a nuclear [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=40.24s)]
*  weapon. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=44.8s)]
*  But I think his point is, when I say ceasefire, don't wait up all the way until the moment [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=45.8s)]
*  until the clock runs out. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=52.24s)]
*  He didn't like seeing that as well. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=53.92s)]
*  He's clearly frustrated this morning. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=55.16s)]
*  He doesn't like the coverage. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=57.599999999999994s)]
*  He feels like that they're not celebrating our great military and the successful mission [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=58.599999999999994s)]
*  that they have from the other networks. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=64.03999999999999s)]
*  And I think he's right on that. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=65.96s)]
*  Well, I mean, it reminds me of Marco Rubio over the weekend was being interviewed by [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=66.96s)]
*  one of the networks. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=70.6s)]
*  And he said, I think I know more than you do. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=71.6s)]
*  Yeah, to Marco Rubio. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=73.36s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=74.36s)]
*  Because I have the intel. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=75.36s)]
*  He's the president of the United States. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=76.36s)]
*  He has the intel. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=77.36s)]
*  So it should give you peace of mind when you hear him say that the nuclear facilities that [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=78.36s)]
*  gone, obliterated under rocks, he says. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=83.92s)]
*  He said they are gone and Iran will never rebuild their nuclear facilities. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=86.36s)]
*  And he was thanking the B-2 pilots and wants apologies from other networks who were saying, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=91.56s)]
*  we're not sure if these nuclear sites were obliterated, but it should give you peace [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=96.44s)]
*  of mind when you hear our president say that they are, that the mission was successful. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=99.68s)]
*  But here's the question. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=103.32000000000001s)]
*  Where do you go from here? [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=104.32000000000001s)]
*  As Marco Vin wrote last night, he was upset by this. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=105.32000000000001s)]
*  He said we didn't give a lifeline to Hitler. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=107.88s)]
*  That's how bad these guys are. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=111.12s)]
*  They've lost their air force. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=113.24000000000001s)]
*  They have no ground to air protection. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=114.48s)]
*  China didn't step in. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=116.16000000000001s)]
*  Russia didn't step in. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=117.54s)]
*  Not a single Arab country stepped in. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=118.54s)]
*  The supreme Nazi is hiding in a bunker. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=120.32000000000001s)]
*  Much like Adolf Hitler. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=122.80000000000001s)]
*  Adolf Hitler wasn't thrown a lifeline. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=124.0s)]
*  He wasn't thrown a lifeline. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=125.96000000000001s)]
*  He was going to be killed. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=126.96000000000001s)]
*  So he committed suicide. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=128.52s)]
*  So that's what, even though the ceasefires to be lauded, if they stay in power, are we [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=130.08s)]
*  postponing another conflict? [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=135.78s)]
*  For example, are we going to lift the sanctions? [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=137.22s)]
*  If we lift the sanctions, they're going to get some money. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=139.51999999999998s)]
*  And if they get some money, are they not going to fund Hezbollah, Hamas, Islamic Jihad, the [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=141.51999999999998s)]
*  Houthis, again, foment terror, sleeper cells here? [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=146.72s)]
*  What did Iran say to make you think that they have anything but hatred for us and Israel? [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=150.79999999999998s)]
*  But isn't it up to the Iranian people to decide who their leader will be? [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=159.14s)]
*  I know that many of them are too scared to go up against the Ayatollah. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=162.16s)]
*  Well, I'm not saying that we should. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=165.35999999999999s)]
*  I'm just saying that if he stays in power, is our security in jeopardy? [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=168.2s)]
*  And does Israel's remain in jeopardy? [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=173.44s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=175.0s)]
*  He yells, death to America. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=176.0s)]
*  I think one of the complicated things is that this is a president that continues to say [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=177.0s)]
*  he wants to be the president of peace. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=181.51999999999998s)]
*  And Brian, we talked about this on your radio show. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=184.23999999999998s)]
*  It's hard to get peace with a group of people that have such a radical ideology that hate [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=187.22s)]
*  your very existence. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=192.64s)]
*  Just one side. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=193.64s)]
*  I mean, it's just the truth. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=194.64s)]
*  They don't want Israel to exist. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=197.12s)]
*  They don't want us to exist. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=198.36s)]
*  They hate the West. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=199.52s)]
*  And it's kind of hard to negotiate with people that believe that you're an infidel. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=201.28s)]
*  They don't have to tell you the truth. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=205.96s)]
*  And Dr. Inayshid, they've had their entire lives been told that. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=206.96s)]
*  But here's the great hope I have. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=209.56s)]
*  It is really one country that's a problem. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=211.44s)]
*  Syria, they're trying to rebuild. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=213.64000000000001s)]
*  We've released sanctions. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=215.52s)]
*  You know that in Syria they got huge billboards. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=216.52s)]
*  Thank you, President Trump. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=219.0s)]
*  So why? [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=220.6s)]
*  Because they're giving them a chance. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=221.6s)]
*  Egypt is not a problem. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=223.12s)]
*  Bahrain is not a problem. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=224.32s)]
*  Qatar is not a problem. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=225.6s)]
*  UAE is not a problem. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=226.6s)]
*  Saudi Arabia is not a problem. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=227.6s)]
*  What is the problem? [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=229.79999999999998s)]
*  It's that country. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=230.79999999999998s)]
*  And the question is, do you give them a lifeline? [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=231.79999999999998s)]
*  Because do they have a choice but to step down? [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=235.32s)]
*  The fact that the Ayatollah said we're going to give just a symbolic shot at the U.S. and [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=237.79999999999998s)]
*  then can we talk? [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=242.0s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely take advantage of it. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=243.0s)]
*  You know it's got to be included in that. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=244.4s)]
*  You got to be included in that. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=246.04s)]
*  You cannot fund the proxies. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=247.04s)]
*  You cannot have ballistic missiles. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=248.04s)]
*  You certainly can't have a nuclear program. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=249.6s)]
*  If something happens here with a sleeper cell, Iran's directly responsible. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=253.12s)]
*  They have to be aware that we know that. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=257.2s)]
*  The president on his way to Air Force One, he said to the reporters, as soon as I finish [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=259.04s)]
*  talking with you basically, it sounded like he's going to call Benjamin Netanyahu and [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=263.4s)]
*  try to work this out. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=267.48s)]
*  Alexandria Hoff is live at the White House with the latest. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=268.48s)]
*  Hey Alex. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=271.04s)]
*  Hey, good to be with you. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=272.04s)]
*  The president, he is angry. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=273.4s)]
*  He is mad. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=274.58s)]
*  He is mad at both sides here making that abundantly clear. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=275.58s)]
*  You heard the profanity that he had used. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=279.28s)]
*  He mused at one point that yes, there might have been some proxies, some tagger alongers [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=281.8s)]
*  on the Iranian side who might have not adhered to this ceasefire. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=287.04s)]
*  But either way, he is upset that Israel has reacted so quickly to this when he thought [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=291.6s)]
*  that this was really their opportunity, that he would come in and broker a ceasefire, which [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=295.54s)]
*  could still happen, as we know. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=300.72s)]
*  I mean, this could just be, as Mike Tobin was talking earlier, the kind of ping-ponging [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=302.40000000000003s)]
*  that can happen when there is a deadline on a ceasefire. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=306.88s)]
*  But either way, President Trump is highly frustrated. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=310.32s)]
*  He's frustrated and something I could sense was he expressed some frustration at some [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=313.11999999999995s)]
*  of the media portrayals of the effectiveness of Saturday's Operation Midnight Hammer in [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=317.2s)]
*  debilitating Iran's nuclear capabilities. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=322.52s)]
*  And he sees some of that as disrespectful to those B-2 pilots. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=325.79999999999995s)]
*  But I think he is also saying here that Iran and Israel are disrespecting the actions of [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=329.28s)]
*  those American heroes who had gone out there on that 30-plus hour mission to help accomplish [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=334.92s)]
*  what President Trump was optimistic last night that could happen. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=341.16s)]
*  There could be peace between countries that historically there is a chance there never [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=345.32s)]
*  could be in many ways. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=350.04s)]
*  But as you heard the president say, they've been fighting for so long that they are just [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=351.92s)]
*  in such a tornado of emotions with something like this that they can't stop themselves [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=356.6s)]
*  from continuing to fight. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=361.24s)]
*  So the president right now, he is heading to Amsterdam. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=362.6s)]
*  He left the White House here about a half hour ago now. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=365.64s)]
*  He's going to arrive in Amsterdam around 1 p.m. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=368.32s)]
*  This will be for the first NATO summit of his presidency. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=371.44s)]
*  I want to, though, get back a little bit into what is kind of leading up to all this, because [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=374.2s)]
*  there were some people who last week would have thought or this weekend thought, he might [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=378.76s)]
*  not even head on this trip now. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=383.12s)]
*  But he said that really he was optimistic last night. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=385.24s)]
*  So you have to look at these emotions from last night and then into this trip today. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=388.56s)]
*  It's a pretty long journey. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=392.28000000000003s)]
*  But he thought that this was an end to the 12-day war, as he had called it. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=393.44s)]
*  And if it was so and if it would work out as it should, he said it would be something [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=397.36s)]
*  saluted by the world. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=400.88s)]
*  And more has come into focus from yesterday afternoon until now in terms of Iran's retaliatory [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=403.16s)]
*  strike on the American air base in Qatar. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=407.32s)]
*  The administration and really the rest of the world considers this to be a show and [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=409.56s)]
*  a wink away from Iran to tell its people that they hit back at the U.S. without truly making [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=413.56s)]
*  impact. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=419.08s)]
*  I want to read a truth social now that the president, when he really kind of explained [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=420.12s)]
*  what was going on here, he said, quote, Iran has officially responded to our obliteration [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=423.71999999999997s)]
*  of their nuclear facilities with a very weak response. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=427.96s)]
*  I want to thank Iran for giving us early notice, which made it possible for no lives to be [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=430.84s)]
*  lost and nobody injured. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=435.59999999999997s)]
*  Now that Iran had launched at least 14 missiles toward that base, which were intercepted and [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=438.24s)]
*  destroyed by Qatar, one of them just didn't hit. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=442.56s)]
*  So not a bad exchange for the U.S., which, through Operation Midnight Hammer Saturday, [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=445.84s)]
*  was able to obliterate, according to the White House, Iran's nuclear capabilities. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=449.8s)]
*  So when it comes to the Hague and President Trump being at the NATO summit, I mean, this [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=454.96000000000004s)]
*  is going to be a I don't want to say tense. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=460.48s)]
*  Maybe I don't know if it's tense or as tense as it could have been. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=463.0s)]
*  But we have two wars still happening right now. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=465.84000000000003s)]
*  Israel, Iran, also Russia and Ukraine, both of them. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=468.72s)]
*  President Trump has been trying to be a brokering asset in both. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=472.28000000000003s)]
*  And it's the first NATO summit of his second term. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=476.40000000000003s)]
*  So he's going to arrive there tonight. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=479.20000000000005s)]
*  That's really going to get going tomorrow. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=481.48s)]
*  There is some positive news here on the defense spending side, because one of President Trump's [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=483.40000000000003s)]
*  goals going to the Hague was convincing allies to increase their defense spending to five [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=487.8s)]
*  percent to make this a pledge among allies. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=493.64000000000004s)]
*  What we're hearing right now that it appears that those member countries will be doing [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=496.88s)]
*  so, all of those members aside from Spain. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=500.88s)]
*  Guys, we'll send it back to you. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=503.08000000000004s)]
*  So, thank you. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=504.64000000000004s)]
*  Oh, go ahead. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=505.64000000000004s)]
*  No, no, real quick, Alex, because you were there. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=506.64000000000004s)]
*  The president was clearly angry. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=509.36s)]
*  Was it a question that was posed to the president or was he angry more about the conflict that [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=511.44s)]
*  was happening between Israel and Iran? [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=516.64s)]
*  Yeah, I don't think the question prompted the frustration and the anger there. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=519.76s)]
*  This was something he was ready to express. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=524.52s)]
*  I think whether the question was asked or not, he had posted on social media as well [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=526.12s)]
*  to Israel, do not drop those bombs. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=530.76s)]
*  Like this is up to you now. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=532.84s)]
*  You are the power force in this. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=534.12s)]
*  Hold back. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=536.4399999999999s)]
*  But was Israel responding? [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=538.12s)]
*  OK, so there's ceasefire. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=539.84s)]
*  And then was Israel just responding after they were attacked again by Iran? [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=542.12s)]
*  And yeah, that's how Israel is explaining it, that they're saying that Iran broke this [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=546.0400000000001s)]
*  ceasefire and that they have no choice but to respond. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=550.7600000000001s)]
*  And President Trump is saying you do. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=553.6s)]
*  Right. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=555.6400000000001s)]
*  Thanks so much, Alex. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=556.6400000000001s)]
*  Here's the exact truth social post. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=557.6400000000001s)]
*  Israel, do not drop those bombs. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=559.6800000000001s)]
*  If you do, it is a major violation. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=561.32s)]
*  Bring your pilots home now, Donald Trump. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=563.72s)]
*  So just get this clear. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=567.16s)]
*  He did not like the pace of the bombing as Israel likely finish off as many targets as [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=568.8399999999999s)]
*  possible by 4 a.m. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=573.9399999999999s)]
*  But it was Iran that broke the ceasefire deadline. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=575.88s)]
*  Now it's Israel that's answering back. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=579.4399999999999s)]
*  And they said, Israel, catch, we're hitting back. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=582.16s)]
*  So to me, this could be a skirmish. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=585.48s)]
*  But Iran didn't clarify. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=587.74s)]
*  Iran said we didn't do it. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=588.74s)]
*  Believe me, one thing Israel is good at is picking out who's bombing them because they [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=591.0799999999999s)]
*  have so much practice. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=594.4399999999999s)]
*  They would know for sure if this was a Houthi. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=595.92s)]
*  They know the direction it was coming. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=597.52s)]
*  It obviously, it seems to us from the outside, seems like a mistake on Iran's part, one that [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=599.16s)]
*  necessarily wasn't green lighted by the headquarters to me because there's no benefit from them [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=603.9399999999999s)]
*  violating the ceasefire. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=608.56s)]
*  They need it much more than Iran needs. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=610.42s)]
*  Israel needs it. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=612.5999999999999s)]
*  And the other thing is, I actually don't think they, I think if Israel had their choice, [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=613.5999999999999s)]
*  they'd never be fighting. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=617.56s)]
*  It's not two people who forgot what they're fighting about. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=619.0799999999999s)]
*  country that made it their mission to destroy another country. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=623.16s)]
*  And that country is fed up and they'll wipe. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=626.16s)]
*  They'd said, we are going to take you on and we're going to take out your surrogates first. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=628.8399999999999s)]
*  They did that. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=633.56s)]
*  They're taking them on. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=634.64s)]
*  And while they were on a respirator, they got a ceasefire. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=635.92s)]
*  So they got their oxygen masks. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=639.04s)]
*  So let's get the read from the ground. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=640.64s)]
*  I mean, this is all moving very quickly. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=642.8s)]
*  Mike Tobin joins us live from Israel with the latest. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=645.12s)]
*  Mike, what are you learning about this? [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=647.4399999999999s)]
*  Is there any response from the Israelis based on the president's comments just recently [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=649.8s)]
*  the top of the hour? [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=654.68s)]
*  Well let's look back at the president's comments as we saw this flurry of airstrikes followed [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=657.4s)]
*  by a missile strikes here in Israel. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=662.52s)]
*  Some of those missile strikes and the lead up to the ceasefire deadly. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=665.14s)]
*  We had somewhat of a benign airstrikes missile strike that violated the ceasefire. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=669.1999999999999s)]
*  And one thing they've resulted in is a very frustrated president of the United States. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=673.9599999999999s)]
*  I'm not happy with them. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=680.5999999999999s)]
*  I'm not happy with Iran either. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=682.16s)]
*  But I'm really unhappy if Israel is going out this morning because the one rocket that [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=684.12s)]
*  didn't land that was shot, perhaps by mistake that didn't land. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=688.64s)]
*  I'm not happy about that. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=692.76s)]
*  Israel says it was actually two rockets and infuriated defense minister Israel Katz said [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=696.4799999999999s)]
*  the following. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=701.3599999999999s)]
*  I've instructed the IDF to respond forcefully to Iran's violation of the ceasefire with [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=702.3599999999999s)]
*  high intensity strikes of regime targets. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=707.3199999999999s)]
*  So a clear indication that Israel is intending to retaliate today. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=710.8399999999999s)]
*  Now the destruction that you see behind me this came right at the end as the ceasefire [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=714.52s)]
*  was supposed to take hold. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=719.6s)]
*  A massive missile that came from Iran. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=721.1999999999999s)]
*  If you look over my shoulder here you can see the impact site where the base of that [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=723.68s)]
*  ladder is hooked into this apartment building. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=727.56s)]
*  There was a family that was sheltered or that was in their bomb shelter. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=730.62s)]
*  They took a direct hit. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=734.56s)]
*  Bomb shelters do a good job protecting people in the blast radius but the people cannot [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=737.0400000000001s)]
*  survive when they take a direct hit from some of these massive warheads that we have seen [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=741.5200000000001s)]
*  the Iranians pull out of their arsenal. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=745.44s)]
*  Now Israel did fire back at a couple of the missile launchers. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=748.8800000000001s)]
*  One of the things a police spokesman noted here today is that Israel fires back at military [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=752.96s)]
*  targets Iran has been firing at the civilian population. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=758.24s)]
*  These are civilian neighborhoods. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=763.5600000000001s)]
*  There's no army base right around us in the immediate vicinity. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=764.92s)]
*  There's no sensitive security site. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=768.24s)]
*  They're hitting hospitals, places of worship. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=770.76s)]
*  Beersheba which is an area that has a mixed community of both Muslims and Jews. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=772.92s)]
*  These targets have no direct religion in their crosshair. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=777.56s)]
*  The only thing in their crosshair is our civilians. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=781.4s)]
*  So we have four people who were killed at this location. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=786.64s)]
*  26 people wounded. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=789.6s)]
*  The extent of their injuries really varies. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=791.48s)]
*  Aggravating situation with the two missiles that came in after the ceasefire and you have [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=795.0s)]
*  a very aggravated president of the United States trying to calm the two parties down. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=799.0400000000001s)]
*  Guys back to you. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=803.48s)]
*  So Mike there were fatalities in this missile strike right? [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=804.48s)]
*  From Iran. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=808.6s)]
*  There were fatalities in the missile strike behind me from Iran. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=809.6s)]
*  Four of them. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=813.72s)]
*  26 injuries. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=814.72s)]
*  Keep in mind this is a missile strike that came in really as the ceasefire was about [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=815.84s)]
*  to take hold. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=820.8000000000001s)]
*  We often see these flurries of activities right before a ceasefire. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=821.82s)]
*  This was an impact from that. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=826.24s)]
*  Don't confuse this with the two missiles that came in about four hours after the ceasefire. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=828.1600000000001s)]
*  Okay gotcha. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=832.96s)]
*  And they know that they're seeing the Houthi rebels long-range missiles and Iran. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=834.76s)]
*  There's never been much confusion about that right? [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=840.88s)]
*  When the Houthis fire comes up the Red Sea you can see it. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=845.2s)]
*  They're detected in the Israeli town of Alat right down there in the south and that's usually [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=847.36s)]
*  where the interception will occur. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=851.1600000000001s)]
*  A lot of these Iranian missiles have gone into the north. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=853.48s)]
*  There's the off chance that someone sympathetic to Hezbollah could have fired it in the north [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=856.2800000000001s)]
*  but we would know that at this point. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=860.32s)]
*  There would be indications of that effect. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=863.08s)]
*  Alright Mike. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=864.88s)]
*  So it's definitely been confirmed it was from Iran. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=865.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=867.36s)]
*  Thank you Mike. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=868.36s)]
*  I think Israel's strong response had to do with four other people dying. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=869.76s)]
*  Four civilians dying and that's why they continue to rain. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=875.76s)]
*  I think it's them saying there's a ceasefire. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=879.48s)]
*  You didn't adhere to it so we're going to get you back. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=882.6800000000001s)]
*  The loss of life happened before the ceasefire. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=886.2s)]
*  And I think their response is like we're going to go right up to the end of the line of this. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=889.96s)]
*  I will say this Steve Woodcoff just canceled so we're not going to have him on later. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=894.2s)]
*  One of the stories was that Hamas and Israel were going to meet in Qatar. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=899.8000000000001s)]
*  Because you forget about that. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=904.12s)]
*  He goes if Iran can settle down we'll do that. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=905.5600000000001s)]
*  So a lot of moving parts today and enough for the mediator to have to cancel with us. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlLK8ogJYAE&t=907.88s)]
