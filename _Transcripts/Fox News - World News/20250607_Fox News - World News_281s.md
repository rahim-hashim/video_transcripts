# ‘CRITICAL’ QUESTION: Why should Americans care about Iran and nuclear weapons?
**Fox News - World News:** [June 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuIQqbBVKyY)
*  Welcome back America. Well, yes or no America should Iran have a nuclear bomb. We actually [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuIQqbBVKyY&t=0.0s)]
*  have people in this country who aren't that worried about it. In fact, they're more worried [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuIQqbBVKyY&t=7.28s)]
*  about people who say Iran should not have a nuclear bomb by hook or by crook. Insanity, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuIQqbBVKyY&t=11.34s)]
*  in my view. We have with us Victoria Koch. She's with the Heritage Foundation, Vice President [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuIQqbBVKyY&t=17.36s)]
*  for National Security. She also served as President Trump's national security, deputy [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuIQqbBVKyY&t=22.02s)]
*  national security advisor. It on his first term and served as the top national security advisor [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuIQqbBVKyY&t=28.02s)]
*  to Ted Cruz has a very powerful resume. Victoria Koch, if Iran gets a nuclear weapon, why does [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuIQqbBVKyY&t=33.58s)]
*  it endanger the lives of American citizens directly, putting aside every other country, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuIQqbBVKyY&t=42.94s)]
*  Americans? Well, good to be with you, Mark. And that's really the critical question here is why [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuIQqbBVKyY&t=47.980000000000004s)]
*  should America care about this issue? And President Trump has been very clear that he will [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuIQqbBVKyY&t=53.339999999999996s)]
*  not tolerate a nuclear weapon in the hands of the Iranian regime. And the answer to why he [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuIQqbBVKyY&t=58.3s)]
*  won't tolerate that is because it does pose a direct threat to the United States. Iran has [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuIQqbBVKyY&t=65.06s)]
*  been chanting death to America and death to Israel for almost 50 years now. And the Supreme [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuIQqbBVKyY&t=70.78s)]
*  Leader has said that that's not just a slogan, that's a policy. And he is responsible for the [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuIQqbBVKyY&t=75.58s)]
*  deaths of Americans in Beirut, in Iraq, in Latin America, I mean, and in the October 7th attacks. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuIQqbBVKyY&t=80.86s)]
*  I mean, the attacks on Israel, but also America have been relentless. And at the same time, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuIQqbBVKyY&t=88.3s)]
*  Iran has been deploying increasingly sophisticated weapons systems over the decades this regime has [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuIQqbBVKyY&t=93.94s)]
*  been in power. And so I think that they have been willing to do that. They've been willing to pour [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuIQqbBVKyY&t=101.1s)]
*  resources into developing a delivery mechanism in the form of an intercontinental ballistic missile. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuIQqbBVKyY&t=107.26s)]
*  Then they could use it. They could provide it to a terrorist proxy. What if Hamas had had a [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuIQqbBVKyY&t=114.14s)]
*  backpack bomb on October 7th? What would that have looked like for the American citizens caught up [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuIQqbBVKyY&t=119.62s)]
*  in that? And God forbid they were able to reach the continental United States. That's why the [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuIQqbBVKyY&t=125.06s)]
*  Golden Dome that the president has proposed is so important. But in the meantime, the best path is [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuIQqbBVKyY&t=130.74s)]
*  to prevent them from getting a bomb in the first place. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuIQqbBVKyY&t=135.58s)]
*  And let's say they chose not to use a bomb right away. Could they not blackmail us? In other words, they [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuIQqbBVKyY&t=137.82000000000002s)]
*  promote acts of terrorism. Their economy gets stronger and stronger. They're able to sell their oil on the [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuIQqbBVKyY&t=143.14000000000001s)]
*  open market. We would lift the sanctions as part of some deal, perhaps. And they could fund much more [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuIQqbBVKyY&t=148.5s)]
*  terrorism. We have people in this country and that country that talk about ceasefire. So Hamas would [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuIQqbBVKyY&t=154.34s)]
*  live, Hezbollah would survive, the Houthis would be shooting missiles, Iran would be well on its way. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuIQqbBVKyY&t=159.02s)]
*  And have a nuclear weapon. And what would this do to United States policy, whether it's economic [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuIQqbBVKyY&t=165.26s)]
*  policy, geopolitical policy, the movement of our ships as an example, and the constant blackmail and threats [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuIQqbBVKyY&t=171.66s)]
*  of the American people? [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuIQqbBVKyY&t=179.82s)]
*  Now, it would be a disaster in the Middle East, yes, but more globally. And the connection here, I think, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuIQqbBVKyY&t=180.9s)]
*  is really critical for your audience is the connection between Iran and China. Because what we've had over [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuIQqbBVKyY&t=186.42s)]
*  the course of the Biden administration was, yes, the establishment of the Partnership Without Limits [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuIQqbBVKyY&t=191.98s)]
*  between Russia and China in March of 2022. But the previous year, the first year of the Biden [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuIQqbBVKyY&t=196.78s)]
*  administration, we had a major deal inked between China and Iran, which they have expanded. So [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuIQqbBVKyY&t=203.5s)]
*  they've China is essentially controlling both Russia and Iran economically. So they're going to do [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuIQqbBVKyY&t=209.01999999999998s)]
*  China's bidding. So if even if they're just at a nuclear threshold state, Iran is essentially a surrogate [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuIQqbBVKyY&t=216.06s)]
*  for China doing their dirty work in the region to undermine us. Yes, indeed. But then also Israel, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuIQqbBVKyY&t=222.66s)]
*  Saudi, our other regional allies, and put them on the path potentially for nuclear weapons to defend [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuIQqbBVKyY&t=229.58s)]
*  themselves against Iran. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuIQqbBVKyY&t=236.18s)]
*  What do you say to those? You know, look, there's a lot of reprobates out there. So I'm trying to address [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuIQqbBVKyY&t=237.38s)]
*  some of the some of the lies they put out there. What do you say to those who say, yeah, we heard all this [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuIQqbBVKyY&t=242.14000000000001s)]
*  before with Iraq, the weapons of mass destruction, we shouldn't believe the Australian intelligence, the [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuIQqbBVKyY&t=247.7s)]
*  American intelligence, the United Nations, the IAEA, the rest of the Europeans, the Israeli [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuIQqbBVKyY&t=252.82s)]
*  intelligence, they're all liars. They're all wrong. They're always wrong. They just want to drag us [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuIQqbBVKyY&t=258.18s)]
*  into a war. When we come back, Victoria Coats, how do we respond to that? We'll be right back. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuIQqbBVKyY&t=262.22s)]
