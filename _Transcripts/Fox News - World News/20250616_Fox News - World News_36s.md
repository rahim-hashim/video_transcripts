# Trump: Iran is not winning this war #shorts #world #news #trump #iran #israel #usa #war #middleeast
**Fox News - World News:** [June 16, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EWyxA6Ms78)
*  Have you heard any signals or seen any messages from intermediaries that Iran wishes to de-escalate the conflict? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EWyxA6Ms78&t=0.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EWyxA6Ms78&t=7.0s)]
*  What have you heard from the Iranians? [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EWyxA6Ms78&t=8.0s)]
*  They'd like to talk, but they should have done that before. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EWyxA6Ms78&t=11.0s)]
*  I had 60 days and they had 60 days, and on the 61st day I said, we don't have a deal. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EWyxA6Ms78&t=15.0s)]
*  They have to make a deal. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EWyxA6Ms78&t=21.0s)]
*  And it's painful for both parties, but I'd say Iran is not winning this war. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EWyxA6Ms78&t=23.0s)]
*  And they should talk, and they should talk immediately before it's too late. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EWyxA6Ms78&t=29.0s)]
