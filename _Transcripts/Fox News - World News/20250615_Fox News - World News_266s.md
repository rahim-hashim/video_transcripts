# ‘THERE IS HOPE’: GOP lawmaker praises Trump’s peace efforts amid Israel-Iran conflict
**Fox News - World News:** [June 15, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-2XJLEsbbE)
*  We're back with a Fox News alert. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-2XJLEsbbE&t=0.0s)]
*  Israelis combing through the devastation after the Iran terror regime targets their neighborhoods [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-2XJLEsbbE&t=10.96s)]
*  with deadly missiles while warning that they're just getting started. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-2XJLEsbbE&t=15.88s)]
*  Our next guest knows all about the Middle East war on terror. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-2XJLEsbbE&t=19.96s)]
*  Senator Joni Ernst served in the Army National Guard during the Iraq war and she joins us [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-2XJLEsbbE&t=23.8s)]
*  now. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-2XJLEsbbE&t=28.32s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-2XJLEsbbE&t=29.76s)]
*  Thank you, Joey. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-2XJLEsbbE&t=30.76s)]
*  It's great to be here. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-2XJLEsbbE&t=31.76s)]
*  What a great day for a birthday. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-2XJLEsbbE&t=32.76s)]
*  Yeah, happy birthday to the Army. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-2XJLEsbbE&t=33.76s)]
*  Yes, thank you. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-2XJLEsbbE&t=34.76s)]
*  And then turning to what's happening in Israel, what are your thoughts? [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-2XJLEsbbE&t=35.76s)]
*  So obviously Israel has every right to defend itself. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-2XJLEsbbE&t=38.2s)]
*  We know through intelligence that Iran was intent on developing nuclear capabilities. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-2XJLEsbbE&t=42.36s)]
*  They have a ballistic missile program. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-2XJLEsbbE&t=49.0s)]
*  And we also know that those nefarious intentions by Iran are not just focused on Israel, but [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-2XJLEsbbE&t=51.6s)]
*  their Arab neighbors in the Middle East as well as the United States. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-2XJLEsbbE&t=58.8s)]
*  You don't ever hear a chant, death to Israel, without hearing death to America coming out [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-2XJLEsbbE&t=64.12s)]
*  of Iran. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-2XJLEsbbE&t=70.48s)]
*  So we stand by Israel. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-2XJLEsbbE&t=71.48s)]
*  We stand by their actions. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-2XJLEsbbE&t=73.86s)]
*  We want peace, of course, that would be the ultimate goal. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-2XJLEsbbE&t=75.94s)]
*  But sometimes in order to achieve peace, you have to really flex your muscles and show [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-2XJLEsbbE&t=79.88s)]
*  a little strength. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-2XJLEsbbE&t=84.52s)]
*  So Donald Trump has flexed his diplomatic muscles. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-2XJLEsbbE&t=85.52s)]
*  He did that for 60 days trying to get the Iranians to the negotiating table. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-2XJLEsbbE&t=88.56s)]
*  Even after these strikes have happened, Donald Trump saying, hey, we can still negotiate, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-2XJLEsbbE&t=93.19999999999999s)]
*  hoping that that will happen. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-2XJLEsbbE&t=98.75999999999999s)]
*  How hopeful are you? [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-2XJLEsbbE&t=100.19999999999999s)]
*  Because I always think war is a sign of failure, failure of diplomacy, right? [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-2XJLEsbbE&t=101.19999999999999s)]
*  It just didn't work this time. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-2XJLEsbbE&t=106.16s)]
*  Do you think there's still hope even after these strikes? [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-2XJLEsbbE&t=107.75999999999999s)]
*  Well, I would say that there is hope. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-2XJLEsbbE&t=109.92s)]
*  And God bless President Trump for doing what he is doing. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-2XJLEsbbE&t=112.24s)]
*  Our president is strong and he has tried to bring peace not just to the Middle East, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-2XJLEsbbE&t=117.36s)]
*  but to the world as well. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-2XJLEsbbE&t=123.4s)]
*  And that should always be the goal. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-2XJLEsbbE&t=125.2s)]
*  And we know that the president will continue to push for that. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-2XJLEsbbE&t=127.72s)]
*  Now will Iran come to the table? [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-2XJLEsbbE&t=132.16s)]
*  That's yet to be seen. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-2XJLEsbbE&t=134.76s)]
*  I'm always very skeptical when it comes to the Iranians. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-2XJLEsbbE&t=136.07999999999998s)]
*  Of course, we know through the previous nuclear agreement that was done under President Obama [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-2XJLEsbbE&t=140.56s)]
*  that they continue to enrich uranium. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-2XJLEsbbE&t=145.92000000000002s)]
*  They didn't abide by the agreements of the JCPOA. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-2XJLEsbbE&t=148.68s)]
*  Do we expect that they will do anything different? [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-2XJLEsbbE&t=152.96s)]
*  I don't. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-2XJLEsbbE&t=155.56s)]
*  I think history has proven time and again that they will try and subvert our goals. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-2XJLEsbbE&t=156.56s)]
*  They'll try and go after Israel. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-2XJLEsbbE&t=162.84s)]
*  But yes, should we continue to encourage them to come to the table? [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-2XJLEsbbE&t=165.52s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-2XJLEsbbE&t=169.84s)]
*  If anyone can do it, it will be President. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-2XJLEsbbE&t=170.84s)]
*  Agreed. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-2XJLEsbbE&t=173.16000000000003s)]
*  Agreed, Senator. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-2XJLEsbbE&t=174.16000000000003s)]
*  Today's a special day, 250th birthday of the United States Army, which I know is very special [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-2XJLEsbbE&t=175.52s)]
*  to you. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-2XJLEsbbE&t=180.56s)]
*  You served in the Army. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-2XJLEsbbE&t=181.56s)]
*  What does this day mean for you? [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-2XJLEsbbE&t=183.32s)]
*  Well, one, it is a wonderful birthday for our Army. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-2XJLEsbbE&t=185.48s)]
*  We have an incredible legacy throughout the past two and a half centuries of defending [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-2XJLEsbbE&t=190.51999999999998s)]
*  our nation. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-2XJLEsbbE&t=195.32s)]
*  But it's also a special time to really celebrate the men and women that choose to wear the [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-2XJLEsbbE&t=196.8s)]
*  flag of our great United States. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-2XJLEsbbE&t=202.86s)]
*  These are incredible, brave individuals that will come forward and say, I love my country. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-2XJLEsbbE&t=205.54000000000002s)]
*  I will put my country above myself and do what it takes to do to make sure that our [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-2XJLEsbbE&t=211.18s)]
*  values and freedoms remain intact. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-2XJLEsbbE&t=216.38000000000002s)]
*  So it is an incredible day for a birthday to celebrate an incredible legacy over the [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-2XJLEsbbE&t=219.26000000000002s)]
*  last two and a half centuries. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-2XJLEsbbE&t=225.94000000000003s)]
*  Senator, thank you for your service. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-2XJLEsbbE&t=227.62s)]
*  And we're here and excited to celebrate. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-2XJLEsbbE&t=229.74s)]
*  We're celebrating the Army, President Trump's birthday, and the birthday of our flag. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-2XJLEsbbE&t=232.1s)]
*  It couldn't be a better birthday. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-2XJLEsbbE&t=235.1s)]
*  And thank you for being here with us. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-2XJLEsbbE&t=237.06s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-2XJLEsbbE&t=238.06s)]
