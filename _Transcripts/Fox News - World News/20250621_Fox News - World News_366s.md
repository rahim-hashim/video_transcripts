# ‘No cave in the world deep enough’: Former Top Gun instructor on Iran strike
**Fox News - World News:** [June 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMarijerif4)
*  Yeah, we're back with this Fox News alert [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMarijerif4&t=0.0s)]
*  We're learning more about the b2 stealth bomber and its bunker buster bombs the u.s [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMarijerif4&t=1.8s)]
*  Would use to hit Iran's nuclear facilities. All right. Let's start joy with the b2 right? [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMarijerif4&t=6.74s)]
*  This is the only stealth bombers the only plane that can carry this [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMarijerif4&t=12.18s)]
*  30,000 pound massive ordinance penetrator the mop as they call the bunker buster and you can see just how big it is [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMarijerif4&t=17.02s)]
*  You've got [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMarijerif4&t=24.78s)]
*  172 foot wingspan and if anyone's been to an air show and seen this it's quite an impressive thing can fly up to [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMarijerif4&t=26.46s)]
*  50,000 altitude [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMarijerif4&t=34.22s)]
*  Capable of midair refueling. Yeah, and so it's you can also use a b52 [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMarijerif4&t=35.7s)]
*  But this is the preferred aircraft because of its stealth because this aircraft won't be seen coming [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMarijerif4&t=41.28s)]
*  All right, let's move here to the next thing and that is of course it deploys the GB you 57 bomb [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMarijerif4&t=47.5s)]
*  That's the bunker buster you can see here and we're understanding that the b2s can carry two [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMarijerif4&t=53.76s)]
*  Possibly three of these yeah [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMarijerif4&t=59.92s)]
*  I want to just point out real quick why it's important to use a stealth bomber to do this a GBU stands for guided bomb [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMarijerif4&t=61.8s)]
*  Unit which means that you have [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMarijerif4&t=67.67999999999999s)]
*  Majority payload and all it has in it is it has some fins and stabilizers that can be controlled with GPS and it's the gravity [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMarijerif4&t=69.6s)]
*  A trajectory while it falls [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMarijerif4&t=77.03999999999999s)]
*  It doesn't propel itself if it had a propulsion system on it [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMarijerif4&t=78.56s)]
*  Then it would be a guided missile and the fact that it's a guided bomb means that the b50 or the b2 has to get [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMarijerif4&t=81.48s)]
*  a little bit closer to its target then shooting a guided missile from [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMarijerif4&t=86.56s)]
*  2,000 miles away so that stealth factor is really important for this bomb is actually not super advanced technology [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMarijerif4&t=91.72s)]
*  A guided bomb was that first iteration of what we now have hypersonic guided missiles [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMarijerif4&t=98.48s)]
*  So it's really interesting as an EOD tech you learn the characteristics of ordnance [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMarijerif4&t=104.12s)]
*  Another thing a guided bomb has is it doesn't have to have another 20 feet of rocket propulsion fuel [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMarijerif4&t=108.44000000000001s)]
*  You can have a bigger payload in your bomb well [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMarijerif4&t=114.84s)]
*  And you know that's fascinating you raised that point Joey [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMarijerif4&t=118.02000000000001s)]
*  It's so important because I understand the military planners from there thinking about it. They start with the target [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMarijerif4&t=120.04s)]
*  Yeah, then they work backwards [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMarijerif4&t=125.36000000000001s)]
*  So I'm just abilities do take us to how this is gonna go just to the point you were saying the drop in the trajectory [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMarijerif4&t=126.88000000000001s)]
*  As it's got to go through not one, but two layers [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMarijerif4&t=132.72s)]
*  Yeah, so what we're looking at here is we're being told this is I think anywhere from just off 200 to 300 feet in depth [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMarijerif4&t=136.60000000000002s)]
*  There are all kind of reports out there of a thousand foot, but I think that's more propaganda [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMarijerif4&t=142.20000000000002s)]
*  So what you end up doing is if you saw the movie the latest Top Gun movie [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMarijerif4&t=146.16000000000003s)]
*  Eerily enough this is that plot kind of coming to fruition in real life. It's not just one bomb [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMarijerif4&t=151.08s)]
*  It'll be a bomb after a bomb to get through that penetration and just lastly [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMarijerif4&t=156.36s)]
*  That's what you're talking about [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMarijerif4&t=161.0s)]
*  In a trade up to 200 feet below the surface and then of course [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMarijerif4&t=162.35999999999999s)]
*  We'll see it try and put the second one in there and go down in there [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMarijerif4&t=166.79999999999998s)]
*  Let's bring in David Burke our Top Gun and former instructor retired US Marine Corps officer now David [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMarijerif4&t=170.95999999999998s)]
*  I don't know how well we did that but you know this better than anybody [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMarijerif4&t=177.95999999999998s)]
*  Talk to us about you know questions over whether or not this can successfully be done [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMarijerif4&t=181.56s)]
*  Joey Jones just crushed that explanation you guys hit the nail on the head so really well done [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMarijerif4&t=187.48000000000002s)]
*  This absolutely can be done [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMarijerif4&t=193.0s)]
*  There is not a cave in the world deep enough to defend itself against the American military if it needs to hit it and you describe [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMarijerif4&t=194.60000000000002s)]
*  The weapon system and the aircraft and the mating of that exactly right now [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMarijerif4&t=200.44s)]
*  This is a hard problem to solve but it is absolutely a solvable problem with this system [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMarijerif4&t=204.84s)]
*  David when we talk about blast radius frag radius the the overall footprint one of these bombs can have once it gets into the ground [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMarijerif4&t=209.16000000000003s)]
*  How precise does it have to be in other words if it lands 50 feet from the target is it still effective? [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMarijerif4&t=215.56s)]
*  Yeah, 50 feet would be a pretty big miss for a weapon like this [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMarijerif4&t=223.32s)]
*  Just like you described that guided bomb unit has a really precise GPS system in the nose [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMarijerif4&t=226.36s)]
*  It's gonna get within a few feet maybe a few meters of its target and penetrate really deep [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMarijerif4&t=231.16s)]
*  It's that penetration that's gonna cause the problem so it's gonna hit the target pretty much exactly where it wants [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMarijerif4&t=235.4s)]
*  Yeah, you know David when you were just talking about that I brought up [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMarijerif4&t=240.44s)]
*  Another shot here, which is the approximate penetrative power and it looks like you know with a 30,000 [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMarijerif4&t=243.56s)]
*  Uh pound bomb you want to come in at about a 45 degree angle. What can you tell us more about that? [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMarijerif4&t=249.96s)]
*  Yeah, that's exactly right and like you alluded to the bomb is a big this is a massive piece of equipment 30,000 pounds [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMarijerif4&t=257.4s)]
*  But only around five to six thousand pounds of explosive most of that is the casing to do that penetration at that angle [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMarijerif4&t=264.04s)]
*  And it is all calculated calculated through a process we call weapon hearing which is figuring out the right point the right angle [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMarijerif4&t=270.6s)]
*  How far deep needs to go and then of course like you described do we put a second bomb behind that to open that initial penetration? [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMarijerif4&t=276.6s)]
*  And detonate and really do the damage we need to that target David if this is used [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMarijerif4&t=282.6s)]
*  We don't use them very often. I know the moab was used back in 2017 for the first time [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMarijerif4&t=286.44s)]
*  Is there an example of using these in the past? Is there any precedent whatsoever? [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMarijerif4&t=291.4s)]
*  This would be an unprecedented use of that weapon in this situation from a penetration standpoint [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMarijerif4&t=296.36s)]
*  We know the aircraft works. We know the weapon works. We have not done this in combat [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMarijerif4&t=301.48s)]
*  But I can guarantee you and I think you know this our aircraft and our pilots and the systems have been trained to and practiced [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMarijerif4&t=305.64s)]
*  Absolutely. Yeah years. They're ready for this mission. Well and david that was my final question in the few seconds [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMarijerif4&t=312.52000000000004s)]
*  We've got left. What's going through the minds of these pilots? [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMarijerif4&t=318.52000000000004s)]
*  They're waiting for the word I can promise you they are prepared [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMarijerif4&t=322.68s)]
*  They're ready to go they get that alert to launch and they are completely capable of ready to and ready to go at a moment's notice [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMarijerif4&t=325.88s)]
*  They're just ready for the execution now david real quick answer. You've got the air force the navy who has the best fighter pilots [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMarijerif4&t=332.2s)]
*  The marine corps there we go [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMarijerif4&t=339.24s)]
*  There's gonna be debate about that online david burke. Thank you for taking the time to be here [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMarijerif4&t=342.03999999999996s)]
