# WATCH: Iran launches attack on US base in Qatar in wake of strikes
**Fox News - World News:** [June 23, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPCY75K_ibc)
*  Let's now switch to Israel. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPCY75K_ibc&t=0.0s)]
*  Go to our chief foreign correspondent, Trey Yanks. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPCY75K_ibc&t=1.84s)]
*  He's live in Tel Aviv with the latest not only from Israel, but what do you make of [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPCY75K_ibc&t=3.6s)]
*  the fact that this appeared to be a pretty limited response, Trey? [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPCY75K_ibc&t=7.4s)]
*  Yeah, John, good afternoon. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPCY75K_ibc&t=11.72s)]
*  We're getting more information from regional sources right now on this Iranian attack targeting [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPCY75K_ibc&t=13.76s)]
*  the Al-Alyodide air base just outside of Doha, Qatar. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPCY75K_ibc&t=18.32s)]
*  The latest information that we have, according to the Qatari Foreign Ministry, they say these [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPCY75K_ibc&t=22.62s)]
*  missiles were intercepted over the Qatari capital of Doha. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPCY75K_ibc&t=27.4s)]
*  They say there are no injuries on the ground, and the Qataris are condemning this attack [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPCY75K_ibc&t=31.56s)]
*  launched by Iran. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPCY75K_ibc&t=36.28s)]
*  This is significant, but not unexpected. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPCY75K_ibc&t=38.18s)]
*  The distance between Qatar and Iran is just over 100 nautical miles, and this is a large [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPCY75K_ibc&t=40.6s)]
*  base, the largest American base in the region, and it had largely been evacuated, according [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPCY75K_ibc&t=47.16s)]
*  to one source that we spoke with before this attack took place. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPCY75K_ibc&t=52.68s)]
*  The Americans understood that Qatar, Kuwait, and Bahrain could be on the top target list [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPCY75K_ibc&t=56.24s)]
*  for the Iranians in any sort of response following those strikes that were ordered by President [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPCY75K_ibc&t=61.6s)]
*  Trump to go after Iranian nuclear facilities over the weekend. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPCY75K_ibc&t=66.16s)]
*  We're working to get some confirmation about reports that American bases in Iraq may have [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPCY75K_ibc&t=70.08s)]
*  been targeted, but again, the information that we have about the Gulf is significant. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPCY75K_ibc&t=75.12s)]
*  There are air defense systems in Qatar, both the THAAD missile defense system and the Patriot [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPCY75K_ibc&t=80.4s)]
*  and according to some initial video that we reviewed from sources in Doha, it looks like [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPCY75K_ibc&t=85.8s)]
*  if not all, but the majority of these incoming missiles were shot down overhead. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPCY75K_ibc&t=90.44s)]
*  In terms of what led up to this, we know earlier today the U.S. embassy in Doha sent out an [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPCY75K_ibc&t=95.64s)]
*  alert to American citizens in Qatar to shelter in place. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPCY75K_ibc&t=101.08000000000001s)]
*  Shortly after that, the airspace over this country was closed. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPCY75K_ibc&t=105.44s)]
*  You could see on flight radar maps a number of flights diverting to other regional airports. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPCY75K_ibc&t=108.94s)]
*  And again, that condemnation coming in from the Qataris. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPCY75K_ibc&t=114.44s)]
*  We're also monitoring Iranian state media at this hour who says that they launched this [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPCY75K_ibc&t=117.24s)]
*  attack calling it the Annunciation of Victory. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPCY75K_ibc&t=121.7s)]
*  Iranian state media also saying their military says this was a devastating and powerful attack. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPCY75K_ibc&t=125.16s)]
*  This is not unexpected propaganda to receive from the regime in Tehran, but again, an indication [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPCY75K_ibc&t=130.94s)]
*  that the Iranians are looking to save face following the U.S. strike that went after [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPCY75K_ibc&t=136.66s)]
*  their nuclear facilities over the weekend. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPCY75K_ibc&t=141.57999999999998s)]
*  Other regional countries, including Kuwait, Bahrain and the UAE, do remain on high alert [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPCY75K_ibc&t=144.26s)]
*  at this hour over concern that there could be further attacks on U.S. interests in the [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPCY75K_ibc&t=149.14s)]
*  region. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPCY75K_ibc&t=154.29999999999998s)]
*  Of course, the Fifth Fleet in Bahrain. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPCY75K_ibc&t=155.29999999999998s)]
*  There are also thousands of American forces in Kuwait. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPCY75K_ibc&t=156.85999999999999s)]
*  And then the possibility that Iraq could be targeted as well. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPCY75K_ibc&t=159.89999999999998s)]
*  I can take you back to 2020 when the Americans ordered that drone strike against Qasem Soleimani [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPCY75K_ibc&t=163.34s)]
*  outside of Baghdad's international airport. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPCY75K_ibc&t=168.45999999999998s)]
*  The Iranians responded then with 13 ballistic missiles against the Ain al-Assad air base [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPCY75K_ibc&t=170.72s)]
*  in western Iraq. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPCY75K_ibc&t=175.84s)]
*  And so, of course, missile defense systems across the region remain on high alert. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPCY75K_ibc&t=177.0s)]
*  Again, the Americans knew this was a possibility and largely evacuated much of their personnel [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPCY75K_ibc&t=181.0s)]
*  from these areas. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPCY75K_ibc&t=186.24s)]
*  John, Sandra? [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPCY75K_ibc&t=187.24s)]
*  All right. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPCY75K_ibc&t=188.24s)]
*  Just going through the Qatar response here, Qatar is saying it reserves the right to respond [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPCY75K_ibc&t=189.24s)]
*  after this Iranian attack. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPCY75K_ibc&t=192.96s)]
*  As John just reported, Qatar is saying no casualties from that attack at the U.S. military [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPCY75K_ibc&t=195.04s)]
*  base. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPCY75K_ibc&t=199.24s)]
*  Thank goodness. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPCY75K_ibc&t=200.76000000000002s)]
*  And the top security body there, Iran's top security body there, is saying armed forces [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPCY75K_ibc&t=201.76000000000002s)]
*  used the same number of bombs that the U.S. had used in attacking Iran's nuclear facilities. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPCY75K_ibc&t=206.88s)]
*  That is per the latest statement that we've been digesting, Trey. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPCY75K_ibc&t=213.02s)]
*  Please do weigh in on that. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPCY75K_ibc&t=216.48000000000002s)]
*  As John and I were just discussing, is what we're seeing is this evidence of diminished [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPCY75K_ibc&t=218.24s)]
*  capabilities on the part of Iran? [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPCY75K_ibc&t=223.56s)]
*  Look, the types of missiles that the Iranians are likely using against American interests [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPCY75K_ibc&t=226.48000000000002s)]
*  in Qatar, as Jennifer noted, are some from their shorter-range arsenal, cruise missiles [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPCY75K_ibc&t=232.20000000000002s)]
*  or possibly medium-range ballistic missiles, but not the same missiles that they were using [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPCY75K_ibc&t=237.56s)]
*  over the past 11 days to target major Israeli population centers. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPCY75K_ibc&t=242.20000000000002s)]
*  A Qatari source just sending me another statement that I do want to just read here live from [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPCY75K_ibc&t=246.56s)]
*  a spokesman for Qatar's foreign minister, saying, we reaffirm that dialogue is the only [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPCY75K_ibc&t=251.70000000000002s)]
*  way to overcome the current crisis and ensure the security in the region and the peace of [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPCY75K_ibc&t=256.04s)]
*  its people remains. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPCY75K_ibc&t=261.74s)]
*  And so the Qataris still, amid all of this encouraging diplomacy and dialogue in the [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPCY75K_ibc&t=263.12s)]
*  region, they have been one of the leaders in the Middle East over the past more than [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPCY75K_ibc&t=268.96000000000004s)]
*  600 days trying to de-escalate regional tension, bring all parties to the table and ultimately [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPCY75K_ibc&t=273.32000000000005s)]
*  find some sort of off-ramp ceasefire agreements or at least temporary understandings. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPCY75K_ibc&t=278.52000000000004s)]
*  As this war develops between Israel and Iran, there is concern that this could spiral and [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPCY75K_ibc&t=285.22s)]
*  continue because we heard from President Trump directly, we heard from Secretary of Defense [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPCY75K_ibc&t=290.94s)]
*  Pete Hegseth that any attack on American interests in the region would be met with a response. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPCY75K_ibc&t=295.16s)]
*  Everyone from American officials to current and former Israeli officials warned Iran against [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPCY75K_ibc&t=300.84000000000003s)]
*  such an attack taking place. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPCY75K_ibc&t=305.32s)]
*  Now, while this is limited in nature, it certainly does bring this entire conflict into a new [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPCY75K_ibc&t=306.82s)]
*  chapter and raises questions about how the Americans might respond to this direct attack [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPCY75K_ibc&t=311.8s)]
*  on their largest military base in the Middle East. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPCY75K_ibc&t=317.16s)]
*  This is a base that normally houses around 10,000 U.S. personnel. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPCY75K_ibc&t=320.04s)]
*  We have reported from the Al-Aldi base just outside of Doha, it's about a 30-minute drive [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPCY75K_ibc&t=323.68s)]
*  from the U.S. embassy in the Qatari capital, and it's a place where there is a lot of coordination [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPCY75K_ibc&t=329.52000000000004s)]
*  for U.S. central command. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPCY75K_ibc&t=334.56s)]
*  You might remember back in 2021 when those evacuation flights were taking place, many [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPCY75K_ibc&t=336.24s)]
*  of them were landing from Kabul, Afghanistan to Doha, Qatar at this air base. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPCY75K_ibc&t=340.28000000000003s)]
*  And so it's a base that was built in the late 90s, it cost around a billion dollars to build, [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPCY75K_ibc&t=345.72s)]
*  and it is still owned by the Qataris, but it is again the largest American base in the [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPCY75K_ibc&t=350.72s)]
*  region and there is close coordination for U.S. central command done out of this base. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPCY75K_ibc&t=354.76s)]
*  It was largely evacuated before this took place, and again, according to a spokesman [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPCY75K_ibc&t=359.76s)]
*  for Qatar's foreign ministry, no one was injured in this missile strike launched by Iran. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPCY75K_ibc&t=363.96000000000004s)]
*  But again, this shows that the Iranians are willing to respond directly to American interests [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPCY75K_ibc&t=369.18s)]
*  in the region, and even before the war between Israel and Iran erupted 11 days ago with this [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPCY75K_ibc&t=373.66s)]
*  Israeli strike starting against the top IRGC officials, Iranian nuclear scientists, and [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPCY75K_ibc&t=379.5s)]
*  of course Iran's nuclear program, the United States was preparing for this possibility. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPCY75K_ibc&t=385.18s)]
*  You might remember about two weeks ago, President Trump ordered a partial evacuation of the [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPCY75K_ibc&t=389.9s)]
*  U.S. embassy in Baghdad. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPCY75K_ibc&t=394.78000000000003s)]
*  There was a voluntary evacuation for the dependents of U.S. embassy personnel and military [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPCY75K_ibc&t=396.38s)]
*  spouses and children in places like Bahrain and Kuwait. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPCY75K_ibc&t=402.42s)]
*  The United States understood that as a war would develop between Israel and Iran, that [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPCY75K_ibc&t=405.5s)]
*  U.S. interests in the region could come under attack, and of course with those U.S. strikes [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPCY75K_ibc&t=410.86s)]
*  against the Iranian nuclear facilities, those three facilities over the weekend, the officials [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPCY75K_ibc&t=415.46s)]
*  here have been bracing for such a response. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPCY75K_ibc&t=420.88s)]
*  Israeli officials, though, remain on high alert, understanding that this is certainly [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPCY75K_ibc&t=424.02s)]
*  not the end of Iranian response as it relates to Israel. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPCY75K_ibc&t=427.5s)]
*  But as for American forces in the region, again, the latest information that we can [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPCY75K_ibc&t=431.02s)]
*  report attributable to Qatari officials is that there were no injuries in these strikes [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPCY75K_ibc&t=434.85999999999996s)]
*  that took place just earlier this hour. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPCY75K_ibc&t=439.78s)]
*  And there is initial reporting coming in right now from the New York Times indicating that [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPCY75K_ibc&t=443.15999999999997s)]
*  Iran coordinated the attacks with the American air base in Qatar, and Qatari officials gave [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPCY75K_ibc&t=447.53999999999996s)]
*  advance notice that the attacks were coming to minimize the casualties. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPCY75K_ibc&t=453.26s)]
*  Again, that information attributable to the New York Times, but this is not surprising [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPCY75K_ibc&t=456.86s)]
*  because they did a very similar coordination back in 2020 in response to the killing of [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPCY75K_ibc&t=461.14s)]
*  Qasem Soleimani, that drone strike that President Trump ordered. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPCY75K_ibc&t=465.97999999999996s)]
*  This was meant to contain possible escalation in the region. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPCY75K_ibc&t=469.24s)]
*  And so we'll work on matching that reporting from the New York Times, but it would not [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPCY75K_ibc&t=472.58s)]
*  be surprising that the Iranians wanted to coordinate their response as to not drag more [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPCY75K_ibc&t=475.97999999999996s)]
*  officials and militaries in the region into the current war that is escalating between [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPCY75K_ibc&t=481.03999999999996s)]
*  Israel and Iran. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPCY75K_ibc&t=485.28s)]
*  Guys? [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPCY75K_ibc&t=486.56s)]
*  You know, as you're on the air trade, you probably can't see it, we're getting some [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPCY75K_ibc&t=487.56s)]
*  pretty spectacular footage of the missile intercepts there. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPCY75K_ibc&t=489.67999999999995s)]
*  We don't know if it was all just American Patriot missiles or if there were other anti-missile [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPCY75K_ibc&t=493.0s)]
*  devices that were set up into the sky as well, but it's looking very much like Israel did [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPCY75K_ibc&t=497.08s)]
*  over the last couple of weeks. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPCY75K_ibc&t=501.84s)]
*  Apparently, the Iranians have given this a name, Operation Fatah's Blessing, against [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPCY75K_ibc&t=503.44s)]
*  the American Al-Udeid air base in Qatar. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPCY75K_ibc&t=509.0s)]
*  This question to you. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPCY75K_ibc&t=512.44s)]
*  So we saw the response at the Al-Assad air base and somewhere up to 17 missiles fell [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPCY75K_ibc&t=514.2s)]
*  on the Al-Assad air base. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPCY75K_ibc&t=520.6800000000001s)]
*  The fact that this was very limited, Iran says we matched the number of missiles to [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPCY75K_ibc&t=522.64s)]
*  the number of bombs that were dropped on Iran. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPCY75K_ibc&t=527.2s)]
*  We had a number of six given to us by the Israelis, which would be far below the number [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPCY75K_ibc&t=530.0s)]
*  of bombs that were dropped on Iran. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPCY75K_ibc&t=533.6s)]
*  Does this suggest that this is merely a symbolic response so that the Iranian regime can say [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPCY75K_ibc&t=536.88s)]
*  we punched America in the nose, whereas really, I mean, they didn't even ruffle a hair on [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPCY75K_ibc&t=543.44s)]
*  our forehead? [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPCY75K_ibc&t=547.88s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPCY75K_ibc&t=548.88s)]
*  And they do this often to try and contain possible escalation in the region. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPCY75K_ibc&t=551.5600000000001s)]
*  We were on the ground in Baghdad, Iraq when that other ballistic missile attack took place [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPCY75K_ibc&t=556.5600000000001s)]
*  back in 2020. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPCY75K_ibc&t=560.1s)]
*  And there was an understanding that American interests could be moved. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPCY75K_ibc&t=561.74s)]
*  There was a warning to U.S. troops to prepare to get into shelters. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPCY75K_ibc&t=564.86s)]
*  There were a lot of minor injuries for forces then from the blast of those missiles back [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPCY75K_ibc&t=568.66s)]
*  in 2020. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPCY75K_ibc&t=574.02s)]
*  But this coordination does take place to try and contain escalation. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPCY75K_ibc&t=575.38s)]
*  And in terms of Iran's capabilities across the region, it's important to remember that [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPCY75K_ibc&t=579.7s)]
*  Iran still, despite the fact that Israel and the United States have gone after Iranian [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPCY75K_ibc&t=583.9s)]
*  interests within their own country and the Israelis have gone after these ballistic missile [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPCY75K_ibc&t=589.1800000000001s)]
*  launching positions and other IRGC capabilities, weapon storage facilities, for example, the [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPCY75K_ibc&t=593.34s)]
*  Iranians still have the ability to operate from other countries. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPCY75K_ibc&t=599.0200000000001s)]
*  They can through their proxies. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPCY75K_ibc&t=603.1s)]
*  These Iran-backed Iraqi and Syrian Shia militias launch limited attacks with missiles and rockets [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPCY75K_ibc&t=604.6s)]
*  toward American interests in the region. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPCY75K_ibc&t=610.5s)]
*  And there are no reports indicating that that has taken place. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPCY75K_ibc&t=613.1s)]
*  And so Iran still has the ability to ratchet up the pressure against American interests [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPCY75K_ibc&t=616.2800000000001s)]
*  in the Middle East. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPCY75K_ibc&t=620.9s)]
*  But it appears here they are trying to coordinate some possible response as to not drag the [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPCY75K_ibc&t=621.98s)]
*  United States more directly into the fight. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPCY75K_ibc&t=626.88s)]
*  There's an understanding that the Americans have a capacity and they have weapons that [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPCY75K_ibc&t=629.3s)]
*  the Israelis do not have and a willingness, if American forces or interests in the region [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPCY75K_ibc&t=634.02s)]
*  come under attack, to get more directly involved in the fight. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPCY75K_ibc&t=638.3s)]
*  And the regime in Tehran has been extremely weakened following the 11-day campaign that [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPCY75K_ibc&t=642.02s)]
*  Israelis have launched not only against their nuclear facilities but also against top IRGC officials. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPCY75K_ibc&t=647.2199999999999s)]
*  Remember in that opening wave, the Israelis took out nearly the entire chain of command [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPCY75K_ibc&t=652.9s)]
*  for the IRGC Air Force commanders in the Iranian capital of Tehran. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPCY75K_ibc&t=657.8599999999999s)]
*  We've spoken with top Israeli intelligence officials who have described to Fox News how [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPCY75K_ibc&t=663.02s)]
*  they are systematically hunting down Iranian officials. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPCY75K_ibc&t=667.62s)]
*  And this gives you a sense of how their military chain of command has been decimated over the [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPCY75K_ibc&t=671.9399999999999s)]
*  past week and a half. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPCY75K_ibc&t=676.72s)]
*  And so they're still able to coordinate this response. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPCY75K_ibc&t=678.1s)]
*  There is an understanding that this is a very large country, more than 90 million people [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPCY75K_ibc&t=681.12s)]
*  in Iran. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPCY75K_ibc&t=684.98s)]
*  And so of course they knew that if there was going to be a regional war, it would come [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPCY75K_ibc&t=686.1600000000001s)]
*  in waves. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPCY75K_ibc&t=690.88s)]
*  And so they have capabilities. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPCY75K_ibc&t=691.96s)]
*  They still can target U.S. interests in the region. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPCY75K_ibc&t=693.3000000000001s)]
*  But again, it appears today that they've tried to limit this with just targeting initially [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPCY75K_ibc&t=696.0s)]
*  this U.S. base just outside of Doha, Qatar. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPCY75K_ibc&t=700.4200000000001s)]
*  And according to reports, coordinate their response as to not drag the United States [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPCY75K_ibc&t=704.02s)]
*  into the war more directly. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPCY75K_ibc&t=709.0799999999999s)]
*  Guys. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPCY75K_ibc&t=710.5799999999999s)]
*  All right. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPCY75K_ibc&t=711.5799999999999s)]
*  Trey also just want to get this in here. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPCY75K_ibc&t=712.5799999999999s)]
*  Bahrain now says it has shut down airspace temporarily amid fears of retaliation by Iran [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPCY75K_ibc&t=713.86s)]
*  against these U.S. attacks. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPCY75K_ibc&t=720.66s)]
*  Also Rich Edson reporting for us has just informed us that President Trump is not yet [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPCY75K_ibc&t=723.1s)]
*  in that situation, the situation room for that security meeting. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPCY75K_ibc&t=729.34s)]
*  So we do anticipate that is still happening, but we haven't gotten yet word that he has [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPCY75K_ibc&t=734.36s)]
*  entered that meeting. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPCY75K_ibc&t=738.2800000000001s)]
*  Trey we'll get back to you very shortly. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPCY75K_ibc&t=740.2800000000001s)]
