# Trump is giving Iran an 'out': Hoffman
**Fox News - World News:** [June 16, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mH99D8GhLP8)
*  Iranian missile strikes killing at least eight and injuring more than 70 people in central Israel overnight. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mH99D8GhLP8&t=0.0s)]
*  And several buildings also suffered major damage. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mH99D8GhLP8&t=6.0s)]
*  Madeline Rivera joins us now with more. Maddie. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mH99D8GhLP8&t=9.0s)]
*  Good morning, Carly and Todd. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mH99D8GhLP8&t=11.0s)]
*  The number of casualties could change as search and rescue teams continue to look for more victims. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mH99D8GhLP8&t=13.0s)]
*  The fighting, though, shows no signs of slowing down. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mH99D8GhLP8&t=18.0s)]
*  Sirens rung out in Israel overnight as the military says a missile was launched from Yemen. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mH99D8GhLP8&t=21.0s)]
*  The Israeli Air Force says it also hit command centers belonging to the Quds Force of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mH99D8GhLP8&t=27.0s)]
*  U.S. Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee says the U.S. Embassy in Israel and Consulate will remain closed today because a shelter in place is still in effect. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mH99D8GhLP8&t=33.0s)]
*  Huckabee says there was some minor damage to the property because of shock waves from a nearby blast, but he says no U.S. Embassy staff are hurt. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mH99D8GhLP8&t=42.0s)]
*  Brett Baer asked Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu if a regime change is part of Israel's strategy in attacking Iran. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mH99D8GhLP8&t=50.0s)]
*  Here's Netanyahu's response. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mH99D8GhLP8&t=57.0s)]
*  Could certainly be the result because the Iran regime is very weak. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mH99D8GhLP8&t=59.0s)]
*  I think it's basically left with two things. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mH99D8GhLP8&t=63.0s)]
*  It's plans to have atomic bombs and ballistic missiles. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mH99D8GhLP8&t=65.0s)]
*  That's basically what Iran has. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mH99D8GhLP8&t=69.0s)]
*  We decided to act because we had to, we saw enough uranium and rich uranium for nine bombs. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mH99D8GhLP8&t=71.0s)]
*  And all they had to do was weaponize them. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mH99D8GhLP8&t=78.0s)]
*  Still, President Trump is hopeful Iran and Israel can strike some sort of agreement. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mH99D8GhLP8&t=80.0s)]
*  Well, I hope there's going to be a deal. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mH99D8GhLP8&t=86.0s)]
*  I think it's time for a deal and we'll see what happens. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mH99D8GhLP8&t=88.0s)]
*  But sometimes they have to fight it out. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mH99D8GhLP8&t=91.0s)]
*  But we're going to see what happens. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mH99D8GhLP8&t=94.0s)]
*  I think there's a good chance there'll be a deal. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mH99D8GhLP8&t=96.0s)]
*  And the president is in Canada today for the G7 summit where world leaders will likely talk about this fighting. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mH99D8GhLP8&t=98.0s)]
*  Carly and Todd, back to you. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mH99D8GhLP8&t=105.0s)]
*  All right, Madeline Rivera, live for us. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mH99D8GhLP8&t=106.0s)]
*  Maddie, thank you. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mH99D8GhLP8&t=107.0s)]
*  Let's bring in Fox News contributor and former CIA Station Chief Dan Hoffman. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mH99D8GhLP8&t=108.0s)]
*  Dan, good morning to you. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mH99D8GhLP8&t=112.0s)]
*  So the latest analysis out of the Institute for the Study of War talks about the number of senior Iranian military officials who've been killed so far. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mH99D8GhLP8&t=113.0s)]
*  These are some of the people who have the most influence in shaping Iranian military strategy, and many of them have been eliminated, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mH99D8GhLP8&t=122.0s)]
*  which, Dan, has got to be a crucial factor to weigh as this war continues to play out. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mH99D8GhLP8&t=128.0s)]
*  Yeah, I think there are two critical points to be made there about Israel's targeting of Iran's military officials. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mH99D8GhLP8&t=136.0s)]
*  First is that Israel is degrading Iran's ability to wage war, but also Israel has not targeted Iran's civilian leadership. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mH99D8GhLP8&t=142.0s)]
*  And I think Israel is making the point that if Iran wants to swivel their course in foreign policy to a new direction, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mH99D8GhLP8&t=151.0s)]
*  a less aggressive one to negotiate in good faith on the nuclear program, then Israel would be open to that. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mH99D8GhLP8&t=158.0s)]
*  Meantime, the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, also on with Brett yesterday, was a groundbreaking interview, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mH99D8GhLP8&t=163.0s)]
*  a lot of news made in that interview. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mH99D8GhLP8&t=170.0s)]
*  He warns that Iranians could soon attack the U.S. Listen to this. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mH99D8GhLP8&t=172.0s)]
*  Our intel shows that they intend to give these nuclear weapons to their Houthi proxies and others. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mH99D8GhLP8&t=176.0s)]
*  And that's nuclear terrorism on a global scale. It threatens everyone. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mH99D8GhLP8&t=183.0s)]
*  And the last thing is they have plans to develop intercontinental ballistic missiles right now, 8,000 kilometers, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mH99D8GhLP8&t=188.0s)]
*  very soon, just at a little distance, and they can reach the eastern seaboard of the United States. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mH99D8GhLP8&t=194.0s)]
*  Iran in the coming years. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mH99D8GhLP8&t=205.0s)]
*  Listen, that's certainly a concern similar to North Korea's development of an intercontinental ballistic missile [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mH99D8GhLP8&t=206.0s)]
*  armed with a nuclear weapon with an eye towards deterring the United States from being involved in the Korean Peninsula, [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mH99D8GhLP8&t=213.0s)]
*  just as Iran might seem to seek that same sort of power and control over the United States [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mH99D8GhLP8&t=220.0s)]
*  and deterring us from being involved in the Middle East. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mH99D8GhLP8&t=226.0s)]
*  So look, these are key issues for the United States intelligence community on which to focus. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mH99D8GhLP8&t=229.0s)]
*  I'm not sure about Iran's plans to give any nuclear material to the Houthis, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mH99D8GhLP8&t=234.0s)]
*  but Iran's nuclear program and their ballistic missile program and their support to proxy terrorists [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mH99D8GhLP8&t=238.0s)]
*  is a threat to U.S. national security in the region and beyond. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mH99D8GhLP8&t=243.0s)]
*  What about President Trump's part in all this, Dan, in this reporting that he prevented an Israeli plan [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mH99D8GhLP8&t=247.0s)]
*  to assassinate the supreme leader? What is your view on this? [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mH99D8GhLP8&t=253.0s)]
*  An Israeli plan to assassinate the supreme leader. What do you think the president's calculation is there? [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mH99D8GhLP8&t=256.0s)]
*  Well, I think President Trump has made it clear that the avenue for peace is open, [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mH99D8GhLP8&t=263.0s)]
*  that the United States is ready to negotiate when Iran is willing to do so in good faith. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mH99D8GhLP8&t=268.0s)]
*  The president gave Iran 60 days to do so, and Iran did not negotiate in good faith. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mH99D8GhLP8&t=273.0s)]
*  They were very openly defiant and concealed their uranium enrichment from the IAEA, which censored them. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mH99D8GhLP8&t=278.0s)]
*  Look, the president is giving Iran an out here, and the question for the Iranians is whether they might have to drink from the poison chalice, [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mH99D8GhLP8&t=285.0s)]
*  as Ayatollah Khomeini said in 1988 at the end of their war with Iraq, to resolve that war [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mH99D8GhLP8&t=293.0s)]
*  and enter into diplomatic negotiations because they had no choice. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mH99D8GhLP8&t=300.0s)]
*  That may be where Iran is headed in this case, and President Trump is certainly willing to entertain that option [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mH99D8GhLP8&t=304.0s)]
*  as a means to end this war in the Middle East. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mH99D8GhLP8&t=310.0s)]
*  And that revelation that President Trump apparently vetoed a plan to kill the Iranian supreme leader [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mH99D8GhLP8&t=313.0s)]
*  is even more notable in the fact that Iran has repeatedly tried to kill President Trump, [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mH99D8GhLP8&t=319.0s)]
*  which is something that Benjamin Netanyahu spoke about yesterday. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mH99D8GhLP8&t=325.0s)]
*  Let's get into that, Dan, because to me that was one of the other things that came out of this interview that was a little bit surprising. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mH99D8GhLP8&t=328.0s)]
*  So I want to lean on your intel expertise here. Were you surprised when Netanyahu said Iran tried to assassinate Trump twice, [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mH99D8GhLP8&t=333.0s)]
*  especially that inference, that implication, without saying it in so many words, that Butler and the golf course attempts were connected to Iran? [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mH99D8GhLP8&t=341.0s)]
*  Yeah, it was for sure Iran military, their Iran Revolutionary Guard Corps. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mH99D8GhLP8&t=350.0s)]
*  There's shades here of post-World War II when the United States allowed the Emperor of Japan to remain in power [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mH99D8GhLP8&t=357.0s)]
*  as a means of solidifying post-war peace. And the potential for the Ayatollah to deliver that is certainly not one that the Trump administration would want to exclude. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mH99D8GhLP8&t=364.0s)]
*  Hence the decision, at least on the part of President Trump as far as we know, to encourage Israel not to launch that sort of a strike. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mH99D8GhLP8&t=374.0s)]
*  Well, we are now in day four, and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said yesterday that they are going to be at this for as long as it takes. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mH99D8GhLP8&t=383.0s)]
*  Dan, thank you for joining us. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mH99D8GhLP8&t=391.0s)]
