# BREAKING: Israel intercepts Iranian missiles over Tel Aviv
**Fox News - World News:** [June 13, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8)
*  Ben, we're getting some live activity as you can see the skies lighting up there in Jerusalem. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=0.0s)]
*  Trey? [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=4.5s)]
*  Yes, Sandra, we are seeing what appear to be some interceptor rounds coming off from [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=5.5s)]
*  the sea, which means some of that missile fire certainly has started. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=12.72s)]
*  As I talk to you here, we're just going to put on some protective gear, and my cameraman [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=17.18s)]
*  Yaniv is going to follow some of these small dots of light that you see in the sky. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=21.3s)]
*  Remember, we do expect any sort of defensive response to be paired not only with Israeli [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=25.9s)]
*  systems but also American systems, but this is an indication that that missile fire is [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=31.02s)]
*  imminent. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=36.42s)]
*  Sandra? [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=37.42s)]
*  John? [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=38.42s)]
*  We know this is happening after the IDF, as we were just discussing, Trey, just a short [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=39.42s)]
*  while ago identified these missiles launched from Iran towards the territory of the state [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=41.86s)]
*  of Israel. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=46.66s)]
*  The defense systems are operating to intercept that threat. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=47.9s)]
*  We know that, as you are doing now, public's been instructed to enter a protected space, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=50.62s)]
*  and we will remain there until further notice. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=54.98s)]
*  Trey, we're just getting a first-hand look at what you are going through just to deliver [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=56.98s)]
*  the news from Tel Aviv at this hour. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=61.3s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=64.46s)]
*  And look, Sandra and John, when we talk about these missile attacks, we have seen them before. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=67.34s)]
*  You might remember last year, on April 1st, the Israelis targeted the Iranian consulate [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=71.4s)]
*  in Damascus, Syria, and they killed a top official from the IRGC. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=77.86s)]
*  Twelve days later, the Iranians responded with missiles and drones toward this country. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=81.66s)]
*  There was a similar attack against Israel in October of 2024, and during that attack, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=86.66s)]
*  we were in the northern city of Haifa, and you could see the incoming Iranian ballistic [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=93.36s)]
*  missiles over Syrian airspace as some of them were intercepted. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=97.6s)]
*  And just stay with me here. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=102.9s)]
*  I just want to talk to my crew very quickly to ensure we know what's happening, but just [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=104.82s)]
*  to give you a sense of how quickly these things happen, the Israelis do get an alert ahead [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=109.94s)]
*  of time, and an official told me just before we got on air here that the top spokesman [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=113.74000000000001s)]
*  for the Israeli military, and I'm just going to step out of the frame here, Yaneb, off [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=119.30000000000001s)]
*  in the distance, look at the skyline, and you're going to see this is likely Israel's [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=123.34s)]
*  Aero Defense System, or David's Sling. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=128.94s)]
*  These are live images coming to you right now as Israel works to intercept incoming [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=132.46s)]
*  ballistic missile fire. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=138.42s)]
*  This is a very fluid situation, so stay with us here, and I'm just going to toss it back [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=141.42s)]
*  to you for ten seconds as I talk to the crew. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=145.68s)]
*  I want to make sure everyone is prepared in case we need to move quickly. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=148.18s)]
*  Trey, do what you have to do. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=150.94s)]
*  We'll check back in with you in a moment. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=152.42s)]
*  Get back to Ben Hall. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=154.72s)]
*  Ben, your thoughts. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=155.72s)]
*  Well, Sandra, remember that we saw some of these similar attacks last year when the Iranians [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=157.46s)]
*  fired about 200 missiles at Israel. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=164.94s)]
*  In that case, the Iron Dome and the other air defense systems shot down all of them, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=167.58s)]
*  except about, I believe, it was 60 of them. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=172.02s)]
*  Now, at that point, the air defense systems were able to handle it, but Iran has thousands [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=174.54000000000002s)]
*  of ballistic missiles. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=180.3s)]
*  The thinking is if they want to overwhelm those air defense systems, then they would [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=182.38000000000002s)]
*  fire them in much bigger bursts. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=185.62s)]
*  We don't yet know how many have been fired at this point, but that is the only way that [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=187.82000000000002s)]
*  the Iranians will be able to get around the Israeli air defense system. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=191.66000000000003s)]
*  We have to see what's happening at the moment. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=195.58s)]
*  Ben, this is happening at the moment. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=198.1s)]
*  This is a live shot. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=199.1s)]
*  You can see the skies lighting up there. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=200.1s)]
*  Trey, if you're in a safe position to do so, please do tell us what you're seeing and hearing. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=202.42000000000002s)]
*  Yes, Sandra, this is a significant attack, the attack the Israelis have been preparing [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=208.62s)]
*  for in response. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=214.46s)]
*  Air raid sirens are now starting to sound across Tel Aviv, an indication. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=216.34s)]
*  And I can see interceptors coming off from all directions. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=222.3s)]
*  We don't know exactly how many missiles have been fired by the Iranians, but this is Israel's [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=227.06s)]
*  second largest city, a population of 300,000 people. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=232.66s)]
*  And right now they are headed and you're seeing an interception right there up to the sky, [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=237.02s)]
*  Yaneve. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=242.34s)]
*  Just stay with us. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=243.34s)]
*  We're going to, we just need to be calculated here. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=244.98000000000002s)]
*  We're good here and we are going to. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=248.1s)]
*  Okay. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=250.46s)]
*  Okay, so right now what we are seeing, Sandra, is Israel's missile defense systems, likely [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=251.86s)]
*  along with American systems, working to intercept incoming ballistic missile fire. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=257.46000000000004s)]
*  This is the attack that the Israeli army warned about. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=263.94s)]
*  We spoke with officials before we started this live report and they said they actually [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=267.3s)]
*  had to cut short a statement by Israel's top spokesman because they got some information [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=271.76s)]
*  that this attack was about to be underway. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=278.0s)]
*  These sirens that you hear off in the distance again are used to warn the population to get [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=281.4s)]
*  into shelters. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=285.64s)]
*  And we're just going to wait and see what information we can gather about this. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=288.56s)]
*  And we have a statement right now, Sandra, from the IDF and I'm just going to read it [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=293.32s)]
*  to you in real time. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=296.35999999999996s)]
*  A short while ago sirens sounded in several areas across Israel following the identification [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=297.91999999999996s)]
*  of missiles from Iran toward the state of Israel. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=303.84s)]
*  The public is asked to follow the instructions of the Home Front Command. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=307.12s)]
*  At this time, the Israeli Air Force is operating to intercept and strike where necessary to [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=310.8s)]
*  eliminate the threat. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=316.36s)]
*  It's essential to continue following the instructions of the Home Front Command. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=319.12s)]
*  And so again, the Israelis are operating in real time not only to strike the missile launching [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=323.14s)]
*  positions inside of Iran, but also to shoot down any of that fire. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=328.38s)]
*  They will use the defense systems on the ground, but also fighter jets if there are any sort [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=333.15999999999997s)]
*  of drones that are flying toward Israel to try to distract the air defense systems. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=337.96s)]
*  But it gives you a sense. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=342.8s)]
*  Okay, and I'm going to have my cameraman go back to the skyline here and you're going [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=343.8s)]
*  to see more interceptor rounds coming off over Tel Aviv. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=347.36s)]
*  The Iranians are targeting major population centers in Israel, again in response to the [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=351.03999999999996s)]
*  operation overnight that took out a number of IRGC officials. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=358.32s)]
*  And we can see flashes in the skies over Tel Aviv. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=364.64s)]
*  Just pull out of this shot here a little bit, Genevieve, and I'm just going to talk to my [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=369.0s)]
*  cameraman while we're talking here. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=371.78s)]
*  So there are some interceptors, there are interceptors coming in off the sea, and you're [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=373.6s)]
*  going to see some in the skyline. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=377.84s)]
*  There's a missile and it is headed down. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=379.9s)]
*  So some of this I can already see, John and Sandra, is not being intercepted. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=381.76s)]
*  We just saw one of the missiles. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=385.2s)]
*  Okay, and there's an interception right over Tel Aviv. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=386.88s)]
*  Pull out here, Genevieve, and you're going to see the trail. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=391.52000000000004s)]
*  Just listen here. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=396.76000000000005s)]
*  Okay, this is some short-range systems. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=406.6s)]
*  Stay here, Genevieve. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=408.84000000000003s)]
*  Pull out a little bit. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=410.64000000000004s)]
*  Okay, there's just a massive amount of fire coming to Tel Aviv right now. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=412.40000000000003s)]
*  Genevieve, get ready to pull it off the sticks. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=416.6s)]
*  Get off the sticks. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=424.56s)]
*  All right, let's go. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=425.56s)]
*  Time to go. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=426.56s)]
*  Okay. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=427.56s)]
*  Guys, come on. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=428.56s)]
*  Everyone move. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=432.88s)]
*  Everyone move now. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=433.88s)]
*  Stay with us. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=434.88s)]
*  Stay with us. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=435.88s)]
*  Pick up the gear. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=436.88s)]
*  Let's go. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=437.88s)]
*  All right, so there you can see, I mean, this has happened again. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=438.88s)]
*  We've seen this before, but this is a barrage of missiles, the likes of which we maybe did [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=445.16s)]
*  not see the last time. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=450.24s)]
*  And the other unknown, Sandra, is as Iron Dome and David Sling and the Arrow system [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=451.72s)]
*  and the Terminal High Altitude Air Defense systems are all going off at the same time, [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=456.24s)]
*  it seems here. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=460.32s)]
*  The last time this happened, there was a coordinated defense between Israel, the United States, [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=461.72s)]
*  and other countries, including Jordan, to intercept these with aircraft as well. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=467.2s)]
*  Trey, I mean, it's unbelievable to see what we're seeing going on in the skies above [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=472.12s)]
*  Tel Aviv right now. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=476.56s)]
*  Yeah, John, Sandra, you saw those live images. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=478.28s)]
*  Israel is under a massive ballistic missile barrage. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=483.6s)]
*  I have reported here for nearly seven years and never seen such an attack against an Israeli [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=487.2s)]
*  city. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=492.48s)]
*  The amount of air defense that you saw going off there, it's unprecedented. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=493.48s)]
*  It appears that they are targeting some of the centrally located positions in Tel Aviv. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=499.08000000000004s)]
*  Remember, Israel's Ministry of Defense, the Kiryat, their version of the Pentagon, is [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=503.84000000000003s)]
*  located just a couple miles from here. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=508.36s)]
*  The fact that they had to start using those short-range missile defense systems indicates [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=511.88s)]
*  that this is a direct attack on Israel's second-largest city. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=516.52s)]
*  We don't know what's happening in other areas, and we have to wait and gather more information [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=522.04s)]
*  to get a full understanding of what was targeted. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=527.04s)]
*  But from what we could see and what you saw in those live images, massive explosions rocking [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=529.92s)]
*  the skyline, you could hear the explosions, flashes of light in Tel Aviv. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=535.28s)]
*  That's when we made the decision to get a little bit more cover, because this is an [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=540.32s)]
*  unprecedented moment for Israel. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=545.08s)]
*  Again, the Iranians right now are responding to the ongoing waves of strikes that are taking [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=547.24s)]
*  place, targeting not only their nuclear facilities but also top IRGC officials, including the [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=552.28s)]
*  leader of the IRGC, Hussein Salami. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=558.4s)]
*  And we can expect more Israeli strikes in response to this. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=563.16s)]
*  Just given how intense the fire, almost certainly American defense systems were involved in [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=566.92s)]
*  this. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=570.9599999999999s)]
*  We do not know if anything has been hit, but in the distance we could see some of those [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=571.9599999999999s)]
*  ballistic missiles slipping past air defense and slamming into the ground. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=575.8s)]
*  It's unclear at this point what they were able to hit. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=579.6s)]
*  So Trey, per a military official directly to Fox News, just want to reiterate to our [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=582.4s)]
*  audience, dozens of Iranian ballistic missiles are en route to Israel. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=587.36s)]
*  The people of Israel have been instructed to remain in bomb shelters until further [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=591.6s)]
*  notice. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=596.08s)]
*  Based on the activity we just saw there, Trey, one might think there's more coming. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=597.08s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=603.0s)]
*  This is a country that is prepared for the possibility of days of missile attacks coming [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=605.64s)]
*  from the Iranian regime. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=610.62s)]
*  Even last night when Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke, he talked about [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=611.78s)]
*  the fact that Israelis would have to stay in shelters much longer than they had to [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=616.56s)]
*  during previous rounds. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=621.52s)]
*  And I just want to check my phone here as we're talking. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=622.52s)]
*  As you noted, dozens of Iranian ballistic missiles being fired and reports of an impact [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=625.64s)]
*  in Tel Aviv. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=631.92s)]
*  Again, people are in shelters, but these shelters, known as mamads here that are attached to [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=633.92s)]
*  apartments and houses, are meant for rockets coming from places like the Gaza Strip. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=638.5s)]
*  Guys, come back. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=646.4s)]
*  Stay with us, guys. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=649.28s)]
*  There's an impact site very close to here. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=652.28s)]
*  Just stay with us. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=654.24s)]
*  Talk to me, John. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=655.74s)]
*  Sandra, I'm with you. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=656.74s)]
*  Yep, we're here. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=657.74s)]
*  So we can see that some smoke is rising from an area of downtown Tel Aviv. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=658.74s)]
*  We saw a missile impact there. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=662.64s)]
*  We don't know if it was a missile that came in unintercepted or if it was the remnants [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=664.36s)]
*  of a missile that was intercepted that landed. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=668.8000000000001s)]
*  But you can see a lot of smoke there, Trey, rising from downtown Tel Aviv. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=670.8000000000001s)]
*  And guys, I just want to caution here. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=676.2800000000001s)]
*  We don't know at this point what was hit. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=678.2800000000001s)]
*  And we can't even confirm this impact. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=682.22s)]
*  There are initial reports of an impact. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=684.72s)]
*  But the air defense systems that were working were also working from that very area in [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=686.84s)]
*  the heart of Israel's second largest city. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=691.9599999999999s)]
*  And so we often see smoke like that following air defense systems being active. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=694.5s)]
*  We simply don't know what was hit and what part of the city it was hit in. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=699.9s)]
*  And we'll continue to gather that information. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=704.6s)]
*  But as we talk here, and I'm going to just look at my phone for a moment because I'm [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=706.92s)]
*  seeing if any of our military sources have texted me about what's happening. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=709.86s)]
*  But as we move forward, the Israelis are preparing for it. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=715.4s)]
*  If I could just jump in here for a second, Trey. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=717.8s)]
*  As you were moving inside with your crew, we did see an impact and an explosion in that [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=719.36s)]
*  area where the smoke is rising from now with a remote camera. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=724.1999999999999s)]
*  So it does look like there was some sort of missile impact. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=729.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=732.6s)]
*  And look, this area of Tel Aviv is very densely populated right next to a main highway that [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=734.84s)]
*  moves along. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=741.56s)]
*  I'm being very careful. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=742.92s)]
*  We're getting some information in, but I just can't confirm it in real time. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=745.24s)]
*  And so I'm being very careful with what I tell you, given how sensitive this is. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=748.0s)]
*  What I can say, just according to the couple text messages I just read from Israeli security [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=752.6800000000001s)]
*  sources, this is a very significant attack and emergency crews are responding, ensuring [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=757.24s)]
*  that no one was injured and checking different areas of Tel Aviv. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=763.6400000000001s)]
*  I do want to just review what we saw when we started this hit out on this balcony, John [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=768.48s)]
*  and Sandra. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=772.6800000000001s)]
*  We saw Israel's missile defense systems active from all directions. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=774.4399999999999s)]
*  And the fact that these close range systems in Tel Aviv were active so close to where [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=777.76s)]
*  we were, intercepting missiles just over this city, it's an indication once again that Israel [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=781.92s)]
*  has the capability to shoot down some of this incoming fire, but not all of it. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=787.0s)]
*  And that is part of the concern as this story develops and as the Israelis continue to strike [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=792.28s)]
*  Iran. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=797.92s)]
*  They can hit many of these launching positions, but the Iranians have thousands of ballistic [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=798.92s)]
*  missiles that they could use against Israel. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=803.22s)]
*  And as we heard in that statement that we got from an Iranian official coming from Iran's [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=806.22s)]
*  supreme leader, they are preparing for war with Israel. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=810.8000000000001s)]
*  And Israeli officials are not yet calling it a war, but what we are looking at is days [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=815.62s)]
*  of conflict ahead. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=820.0600000000001s)]
*  The city is very quiet right now because people are still in bomb shelters. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=822.46s)]
*  This is a country that has experienced these types of missile attacks before. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=826.94s)]
*  And when we look back to the October 2024 missile attack that was conducted by the [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=831.22s)]
*  Iranians, there were around 300 ballistic missiles that were fired at this country. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=835.46s)]
*  And initially some of the officials that we talked to, and it's why I'm being very careful [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=840.26s)]
*  with what I'm saying here, they told us that many of them were intercepted. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=843.6600000000001s)]
*  It was very successful. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=848.14s)]
*  The reality was videos started to come out showing that Israeli bases took significant [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=849.6600000000001s)]
*  damage because these missiles are traveling so fast and there's only a limited amount [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=854.22s)]
*  of air defense capability on the ground here. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=859.4200000000001s)]
*  And remember, that was a missile attack that was in response to the killing of the leader [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=862.3000000000001s)]
*  of Hezbollah, Hassan Nasrallah, and Hamas leadership, including Ismael Khania in the [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=867.02s)]
*  Iranian capital of Tehran. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=872.46s)]
*  What we saw overnight, it's hard to even put into words how much more significant it is. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=874.62s)]
*  What we're looking at right now is the big conflict that everyone discussed for decades, [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=880.74s)]
*  a possibility between Israel and Iran. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=885.58s)]
*  The Israelis took out the entirety of Iran's IRGC Air Force leadership. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=888.22s)]
*  Again, as we can report from sources that we've talked to in the Israeli security establishment, [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=892.62s)]
*  that was a surprise attack. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=899.3s)]
*  They got these officials to a meeting point in Iran and kept them there before killing [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=900.9s)]
*  all of them. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=904.82s)]
*  They killed the head of the IRGC. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=905.82s)]
*  They killed Iran's top nuclear scientist. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=907.42s)]
*  They have damaged both the Natanz facility and other enrichment facilities in Iran. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=909.64s)]
*  They have targeted missile production sites. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=914.98s)]
*  They have targeted launching positions. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=917.16s)]
*  And the Israelis are continuing to strike Iran as we speak. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=919.16s)]
*  And so it places what is happening right now in such a larger frame. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=922.88s)]
*  The one thing that we should note here, and this is very important when we look at the [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=928.0s)]
*  context of the current ballistic missile attack that just took place against Israel and the [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=930.64s)]
*  ongoing conflict between officials here that are now conducting an ongoing operation against [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=935.1s)]
*  Iran and the Iranians, is that Iran no longer has the strength of its proxies, like Hezbollah [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=942.56s)]
*  in southern Lebanon and the Houthis in Yemen. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=948.16s)]
*  Now, the Houthis have still been able to maintain a ballistic missile capability. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=951.1999999999999s)]
*  Earlier today, they fired a ballistic missile at Israel, and it actually landed outside [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=955.28s)]
*  the West Bank city of Hebron. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=960.04s)]
*  But they are able to fire in very small moments. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=962.36s)]
*  They're not able to launch large barrages. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=964.9599999999999s)]
*  Hezbollah was long considered the biggest threat to Israel in a possible conflict with [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=967.28s)]
*  Iran, but as we know, the Israelis methodically took out the leadership of Hezbollah from [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=971.48s)]
*  Hassan Nasrallah to members of the Radwan forces. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=976.76s)]
*  We were with Israeli forces on the ground in southern Lebanon as they cleared out the [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=980.2s)]
*  villages and the rocket launching positions along the border. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=983.6800000000001s)]
*  And they've gone off after the precision missile components and sites in Lebanon, in the capital [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=986.92s)]
*  of Beirut. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=992.3s)]
*  And so Israel's main focus right now is defending not about attacks from places like Gaza or [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=993.52s)]
*  Lebanon or Yemen, but directly from Iranian territory. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=998.52s)]
*  And we know that they have the ability to strike major population centers. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=1002.22s)]
*  We're getting in some new information now from the top spokesman for the medics in Tel [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=1006.28s)]
*  Aviv. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=1012.28s)]
*  And they say that following the recent red alert sirens, no calls have been received [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=1013.48s)]
*  for emergency dispatch at this time. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=1017.5600000000001s)]
*  So it's an indication that despite the fact we saw some of those missiles landing inside [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=1019.64s)]
*  Israel and those interceptions overhead that certainly create significant shrapnel that [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=1025.36s)]
*  rains down on the population below. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=1029.8s)]
*  At this point, initial reports indicate there are no injuries. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=1032.0s)]
*  Again, this is very preliminary information. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=1035.3999999999999s)]
*  And as we talk here again, I'm just checking through the different sources that we're getting [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=1038.24s)]
*  information from. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=1044.72s)]
*  And I again, just want to be very careful about what I report live here because we're [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=1045.88s)]
*  getting a lot of different information and we need to confirm it in real time. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=1049.5s)]
*  John Sandor. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=1052.48s)]
*  Well, that certainly would be extraordinary, Trey, if you don't have any injuries. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=1053.48s)]
*  We saw at least three impacts. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=1057.68s)]
*  Looks like a couple were from damaged missiles that had been intercepted and then one seemed [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=1059.96s)]
*  to come in full force and the smoke hanging over Tel Aviv. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=1064.5200000000002s)]
*  But if indeed this is the beginning of war between Israel and Iran, it would seem to [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=1068.14s)]
*  me that it's going to look very different depending on which country you're in. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=1074.42s)]
*  Iran has no other capability, it would seem, other than to throw these ballistic missiles [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=1077.8200000000002s)]
*  into Israel. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=1083.94s)]
*  Meantime, Israel is capable of widely penetrating Iran's airspace, launching pinprick attacks [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=1084.94s)]
*  to take out its infrastructure. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=1091.8200000000002s)]
*  And so Iran's got to be worried that while it may be able to lob missiles at Israel and [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=1094.2600000000002s)]
*  get the odd impact as we saw here tonight, Israel can hit where it wants, when it wants [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=1099.22s)]
*  and who it wants. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=1104.6200000000001s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=1105.6200000000001s)]
*  And look, the other part of all of this, and I think it's something we have to talk about, [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=1109.06s)]
*  it's the American forces and the bases and embassies across the region. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=1113.5s)]
*  And we saw earlier in the week a decision that was made by the Americans to partially [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=1116.7s)]
*  evacuate the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=1121.38s)]
*  All non-essential personnel told to leave. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=1124.74s)]
*  In other embassies and U.S. missions in places like Bahrain and Kuwait, there was a voluntary [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=1127.58s)]
*  evacuation order for the family members of embassy staff and military forces in these [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=1132.82s)]
*  areas. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=1139.62s)]
*  The concern is that not only will Iran try to target Israeli population centers like [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=1141.26s)]
*  Tel Aviv and Jerusalem, but that the Iranians will try to target U.S. bases and U.S. forces [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=1146.34s)]
*  in the Middle East. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=1153.22s)]
*  And I think back to January of 2020, I was in Baghdad, Iraq, reporting following the [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=1154.8999999999999s)]
*  drone strike that was ordered by President Trump to kill top Iranian general Qasem Soleimani. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=1160.9399999999998s)]
*  And at the time, the Iranians responded with 13 ballistic missiles, and they soared through [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=1166.78s)]
*  the skies of Iraq and targeted Western Iraq at a base called Ayn al-Assad. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=1171.22s)]
*  There is concern that something like this could happen in the hours and days ahead as [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=1175.86s)]
*  the Iranians respond to the Israeli strikes. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=1179.6599999999999s)]
*  Alright, Trey, we're going to let you catch your breath, check in on your sources. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=1181.98s)]
*  We'll check back in with you shortly. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgfHDJpEgM8&t=1186.18s)]
