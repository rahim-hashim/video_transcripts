# BREAKING: Sirens sound off as Tel Aviv braces for incoming missiles
**Fox News - World News:** [June 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ep9Rlu6R_D0)
*  Let's go back to Trey Yanks. They now have sirens in Tel Aviv. Trey, what are you hearing? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ep9Rlu6R_D0&t=0.0s)]
*  Yeah, Trey, it's right now air raid sirens are sounding across Tel Aviv amid incoming ballistic [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ep9Rlu6R_D0&t=5.2s)]
*  missile fire. We've not yet seen any of Israel's air defense systems active, but we're going to [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ep9Rlu6R_D0&t=11.120000000000001s)]
*  wait and see what happens here. There are sirens, according to the initial alerts, sounding across [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ep9Rlu6R_D0&t=17.04s)]
*  the entirety of central Israel, all the way from Haifa in the north to the Negev desert in the south. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ep9Rlu6R_D0&t=22.48s)]
*  We also understand at this moment this alert has gone out to everyone in this part of the country, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ep9Rlu6R_D0&t=30.24s)]
*  sending millions of people into bomb shelters, many people trying to get underground. There are [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ep9Rlu6R_D0&t=36.16s)]
*  a few cars out on the road right now, but you remember we talked about those emergency orders [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ep9Rlu6R_D0&t=41.36s)]
*  that went into effect from Israel's home front command just before this missile attack took place. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ep9Rlu6R_D0&t=45.92s)]
*  Again, we don't yet see any air defense systems that are active over the city at this moment. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ep9Rlu6R_D0&t=53.92s)]
*  But we're certainly waiting to see how this develops. This is the initial Iranian response [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ep9Rlu6R_D0&t=60.0s)]
*  to the American strikes that took place overnight targeting the country's nuclear facilities. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ep9Rlu6R_D0&t=65.2s)]
*  There are also initial reports of air raid sirens sounding in Jordan as these missiles fly over that [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ep9Rlu6R_D0&t=71.12s)]
*  country toward Israel. And so, again, this is a very common occurrence over the past nine days [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ep9Rlu6R_D0&t=77.2s)]
*  here, Trace, as these sirens will sound. Interceptors. Yep. All right. And so we're [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ep9Rlu6R_D0&t=84.48s)]
*  going to get inside here. Stay with us, Trace. Get in. Move with me. We're with you. We're still [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ep9Rlu6R_D0&t=92.48s)]
*  with you, Trace. So we saw at least one interceptor over the city, Trace, an indication that the air [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ep9Rlu6R_D0&t=98.64s)]
*  defense systems are active over Tel Aviv. And this is, like Aaron said, the initial response. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ep9Rlu6R_D0&t=107.28s)]
*  And in the distance, we can hear two booms. And likely these are the interceptions that [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ep9Rlu6R_D0&t=116.0s)]
*  are taking place over the city. Trace. The sirens, Trace, the fact that they have stopped, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ep9Rlu6R_D0&t=122.08s)]
*  is it because they are intermittent? It's not consistent? Or is it something else? [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ep9Rlu6R_D0&t=128.08s)]
*  Generally, these sirens will go on for a period of time, then they'll stop. The threat is not over, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ep9Rlu6R_D0&t=133.68s)]
*  though, when the sirens end. That's very important to note. In the past, we have seen these sirens [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ep9Rlu6R_D0&t=142.16s)]
*  stop. And a few moments later, a loud explosion or a missile slipping past the air defense systems. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ep9Rlu6R_D0&t=146.8s)]
*  These are the same sirens that sound when there's incoming rocket fire from Gaza or missile fire [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ep9Rlu6R_D0&t=152.4s)]
*  from Lebanon. What's different with these ballistic missiles, they have such a large payload that when [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ep9Rlu6R_D0&t=157.28s)]
*  they are actually striking the ground, the destruction goes for blocks. We've been to many [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ep9Rlu6R_D0&t=163.04s)]
*  of these locations, and we've seen the aftermath of these ballistic missile strikes from the Iranian [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ep9Rlu6R_D0&t=167.76s)]
*  regime. And so far, two dozen people have been killed in Israel, civilians who have been targeted [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ep9Rlu6R_D0&t=172.88s)]
*  in these Iranian strikes. And so again, this is likely just the initial wave of an Iranian response. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ep9Rlu6R_D0&t=178.32s)]
*  They're trying to put up some sort of response to these strikes overnight. But certainly, given the [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ep9Rlu6R_D0&t=184.16s)]
*  fact that so many of these launchers have been destroyed, these ballistic missile launchers [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ep9Rlu6R_D0&t=190.0s)]
*  by IDF strikes, it is unlikely that they're able to fire in waves like they did at the very beginning [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ep9Rlu6R_D0&t=194.32s)]
*  of this conflict between Israel and Iran. Tracy. Stay safe, take cover. We'll bring you back on as [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ep9Rlu6R_D0&t=200.32s)]
*  soon as we give the all clear. Thank you for your reporting. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ep9Rlu6R_D0&t=205.92s)]
