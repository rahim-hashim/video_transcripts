*  Iran has proven its ability to strike strategic targets with accuracy. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efqjBcyHkXE&t=0.0s)]
*  This was a deliberate act. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efqjBcyHkXE&t=6.0s)]
*  It is a blatant violation of international law, a war crime, and a calculated attempt to murder the most vulnerable. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efqjBcyHkXE&t=9.0s)]
*  Let this Council understand what that missile really signified. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efqjBcyHkXE&t=19.0s)]

*  That if Iran will target a hospital with a ballistic missile, it will target anyone, anywhere, with anything they have. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efqjBcyHkXE&t=26.0s)]
*  Today it was Be'er Sheva. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efqjBcyHkXE&t=37.0s)]
*  Tomorrow it could be Brussels. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efqjBcyHkXE&t=40.0s)]
*  Soon it could be Boston. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efqjBcyHkXE&t=43.0s)]
