# Keane: We are 'on the cusp' of ending Iran's 'malign and aggressive behavior' in region
**Fox News - World News:** [June 22, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zv7hzq095uA)
*  We want to bring in now our Fox News senior strategic analyst retired four-star general Jack Keene joining us now here in the studio [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zv7hzq095uA&t=0.0s)]
*  general that remarkable press conference the [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zv7hzq095uA&t=7.88s)]
*  Tactics use the deception in the fact that we got in [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zv7hzq095uA&t=11.92s)]
*  Flawlessly struck our targets as according to secretary Hicks said the peers [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zv7hzq095uA&t=15.84s)]
*  We've hit every intended target objective and yet got out without a single shot being fired at us. Yeah [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zv7hzq095uA&t=20.34s)]
*  well, first of all [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zv7hzq095uA&t=26.8s)]
*  We got a congratulations to our troops in that execution and the complexity of operation is obvious and and also let's commend the president [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zv7hzq095uA&t=28.8s)]
*  United States [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zv7hzq095uA&t=36.72s)]
*  He showed enormous strategic patience in trying to work this with the Iranian so that they would dismantle their nuclear enterprise [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zv7hzq095uA&t=37.36s)]
*  But at the end of the day we had to help the Israelis dismantle it. That's the facts on the ground [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zv7hzq095uA&t=44.24s)]
*  I think the operation had four major characteristics of it to help it be successful [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zv7hzq095uA&t=49.84s)]
*  One was the operational security of the operation and that is really tough to maintain in our open [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zv7hzq095uA&t=54.36000000000001s)]
*  Democratic society that we have and we know that things do have a tendency to leak out everything leaks in Washington [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zv7hzq095uA&t=61.0s)]
*  And then everybody, you know, listen for the last week or two has been focused on this operation and yet it didn't leak [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zv7hzq095uA&t=67.16s)]
*  the deception helped [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zv7hzq095uA&t=74.80000000000001s)]
*  considerably in that in terms of the missile [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zv7hzq095uA&t=77.16s)]
*  I mean that the planes flying initially west but the actual planes flew east to the target [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zv7hzq095uA&t=80.48s)]
*  I think the president contributed to the deception operation as well when he said well [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zv7hzq095uA&t=86.82s)]
*  I'm going to make a decision in a couple of weeks. The truth of the matter was the decision was already made or made very close [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zv7hzq095uA&t=91.82s)]
*  To that statement he made and everybody was thinking there was time here and then [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zv7hzq095uA&t=98.92s)]
*  Characteristic of military operations when we're going after something that we have to destroy to ensure that we use overwhelming force [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zv7hzq095uA&t=104.66s)]
*  And you saw that most everyone was saying two to three of these [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zv7hzq095uA&t=111.88s)]
*  MOPs were going to be used 14. Yeah multiple [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zv7hzq095uA&t=116.62s)]
*  aircraft to deliver all of those and then the additional missiles and [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zv7hzq095uA&t=121.3s)]
*  Taking down three targets that the Israelis wanted help on not just one [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zv7hzq095uA&t=125.18s)]
*  And then the thing that was emphasized is the flawless execution [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zv7hzq095uA&t=129.07999999999998s)]
*  And I think the audience had a complexity [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zv7hzq095uA&t=133.98s)]
*  Got a feel for the complexity of military operations and I really applaud the chairman [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zv7hzq095uA&t=136.85999999999999s)]
*  Providing those details and I want to tell you what you folks have been doing here on Fox and Friends weekend [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zv7hzq095uA&t=142.06s)]
*  Since this got started about three or four hours ago is really outstanding. Well done [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zv7hzq095uA&t=147.3s)]
*  Well, thank you general and having you here is so beneficial because you understand these and I think the real question general is okay [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zv7hzq095uA&t=152.1s)]
*  So what now are the strategic implications of this strike? [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zv7hzq095uA&t=159.62s)]
*  We obviously didn't get much BDA battle damage assessment from the Pentagon briefing. It's gonna take some time. We'll learn that but just [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zv7hzq095uA&t=163.26s)]
*  Initially, what do you see as the strategic? Yeah, that's a great question [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zv7hzq095uA&t=169.94s)]
*  You know there there it's pretty significant opportunity actually [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zv7hzq095uA&t=173.7s)]
*  Obviously the threat of nuclear weapons being used against Israel the United States is as Iran has threatened or Europe which would clearly be in [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zv7hzq095uA&t=178.34s)]
*  range of their ballistic missiles [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zv7hzq095uA&t=186.1s)]
*  That is about off the table [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zv7hzq095uA&t=188.22s)]
*  The second thing is and this is serious [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zv7hzq095uA&t=190.58s)]
*  No nuclear arms race in the Middle East as a result of Iran acquiring a nuclear weapon [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zv7hzq095uA&t=193.62s)]
*  Which would have happened the Arabs are not going to say this publicly [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zv7hzq095uA&t=199.26s)]
*  but they are relieved as about what has just happened here and the other thing is we are on the cusp of [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zv7hzq095uA&t=203.42s)]
*  Actually ending Iran's malign and aggressive behavior in the region grip that has existed for [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zv7hzq095uA&t=213.22s)]
*  45 years and you have outlined the killing of Americans from 1983 all the way up to [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zv7hzq095uA&t=219.66000000000003s)]
*  350 attacks [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zv7hzq095uA&t=227.62s)]
*  That Iran delivered on US bases in Iraq and Syria during the four years of the Biden administration [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zv7hzq095uA&t=229.14000000000001s)]
*  And not one time did they ever accept General Corrilla's recommendation to strike Iran to stop that from happening? [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zv7hzq095uA&t=235.38000000000002s)]
*  and so the implications here are very serious in terms of the [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zv7hzq095uA&t=242.62s)]
*  opportunities for peace and stability [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zv7hzq095uA&t=248.06s)]
*  Iran is isolated in a way that we've never seen in the 45 years [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zv7hzq095uA&t=250.70000000000002s)]
*  The proxies have not supported them at all think of that Iran is on its heels [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zv7hzq095uA&t=255.38000000000002s)]
*  their very survival is in question as a regime and as a [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zv7hzq095uA&t=261.98s)]
*  Military organization as the IRGC controlling the proxies and support in the region all of that is on the table [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zv7hzq095uA&t=267.1s)]
*  None of them have coming to their assistance the Hezbollah was organized principally to defend Iran against an attack from Israel [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zv7hzq095uA&t=273.66s)]
*  Billions of dollars spent on 150,000 missiles. I've talked to the Israelis and said what is going on with Hezbollah? [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zv7hzq095uA&t=281.5s)]
*  Why haven't they fired? [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zv7hzq095uA&t=288.02000000000004s)]
*  Do they have any missiles? Yes answer they have sir. They have thousands of missiles left [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zv7hzq095uA&t=289.98s)]
*  Why haven't they fought he said sir their will is broken and they can see what is happening to Iran [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zv7hzq095uA&t=294.8s)]
*  Why are they going to risk all now the Israelis will come back at them when they believe Iran is close to being finished? [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zv7hzq095uA&t=302.08s)]
*  Yeah, this is a man and then the isolation. Where is Russia in China Griff? [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zv7hzq095uA&t=310.28s)]
*  Yeah, this axis has been formed those four nations China Russia Iran North Korea [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zv7hzq095uA&t=314.36s)]
*  Where are they having provided no military assistance to Iran whatsoever? [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zv7hzq095uA&t=321.26s)]
*  Huge opportunity here to move forward and take advantage of it in terms of peace and stability in the region [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zv7hzq095uA&t=325.65999999999997s)]
*  Well, you know you mentioned Russia in China, you know, the The Wall Street Journal has an editorial early this morning [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zv7hzq095uA&t=332.09999999999997s)]
*  Mr. Trump meets the moment and it's really talking about [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zv7hzq095uA&t=337.73999999999995s)]
*  American deterrence being back and you know, you saw the greatest military the world's ever seen on display [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zv7hzq095uA&t=342.21999999999997s)]
*  Flawlessly in the last 24 hours. What message does that send are we is America once again? [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zv7hzq095uA&t=350.14s)]
*  a global leader in terms of deterrence [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zv7hzq095uA&t=358.14s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely, you know when President Trump came back into office the major geopolitical change that he was coping with and it is [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zv7hzq095uA&t=361.53999999999996s)]
*  China Russia Iran and North Korea forming an alliance together to cooperate because they saw opportunity they believed [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zv7hzq095uA&t=371.26s)]
*  That American leadership under the former president was weak and they could take advantage of that weakness [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zv7hzq095uA&t=378.18s)]
*  It's not isolated that Putin went into Ukraine [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zv7hzq095uA&t=384.34000000000003s)]
*  It's not isolated that Iran operationalizes all of its proxies to once and for all go after Israel and bring that country down and [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zv7hzq095uA&t=387.46000000000004s)]
*  President Xi is preparing for war and he keeps threatening war and during those previous four years the intimidation and coercion on his part [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zv7hzq095uA&t=396.70000000000005s)]
*  In the Pacific has accelerated [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zv7hzq095uA&t=404.42s)]
*  dramatically [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zv7hzq095uA&t=407.78s)]
*  This operation by itself, even though it's limited in terms of what we are doing and certainly limited in terms of what our [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zv7hzq095uA&t=408.82s)]
*  Geopolitical objectives here. We're not going to invade around. We're not going to occupy it [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zv7hzq095uA&t=417.14s)]
*  We're certainly not going to do any nation-building [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zv7hzq095uA&t=420.54s)]
*  We just want them to stop and I think we'll achieve that what a message this sends to our allies and partners [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zv7hzq095uA&t=422.26s)]
*  Around the world certainly the Arabs in the region, but also Taiwan the Europeans, etc [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zv7hzq095uA&t=429.02s)]
*  Watching this what really they see it [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zv7hzq095uA&t=434.74s)]
*  They're seeing the president of the United States [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zv7hzq095uA&t=437.18s)]
*  come to the assistance of a partner an ally who needs our help and [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zv7hzq095uA&t=439.65999999999997s)]
*  Who is being challenged in their very existence and the United States has their back and has stepped up and used force [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zv7hzq095uA&t=444.58s)]
*  What that is what is being seen our adversaries see and you said it [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zv7hzq095uA&t=451.78s)]
*  The return of American global leadership [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zv7hzq095uA&t=457.3s)]
*  in a way that they can no longer take advantage of like they have been doing for the past four years and [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zv7hzq095uA&t=461.26000000000005s)]
*  They've been getting away with it and we all have seen it. So this is a step in the right direction [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zv7hzq095uA&t=468.06s)]
*  I mean, it's not a father completed that's it, but they will change their assessments as [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zv7hzq095uA&t=473.62s)]
*  A result of I believe when President Trump got elected [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zv7hzq095uA&t=478.74s)]
*  They had to rethink what's gonna happen here in terms of what we have on a table and what are our objectives [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zv7hzq095uA&t=482.26000000000005s)]
*  Now they have to make another assessment back on the face on the fact that [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zv7hzq095uA&t=488.02000000000004s)]
*  President Trump has used force to eliminate a nuclear threat to Israel to the region to the world writ large and they are [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zv7hzq095uA&t=492.70000000000005s)]
*  Unnoticed as a result of it on notice general [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zv7hzq095uA&t=501.34000000000003s)]
*  Let me ask you really now as we wait to see if Iran will strike will they hit one of our bases? [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zv7hzq095uA&t=503.98s)]
*  Al-assad in Iraq will they go after Bahrain? What do you anticipate will be the response? I don't [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zv7hzq095uA&t=511.42s)]
*  We don't know so it's their choice to make [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zv7hzq095uA&t=518.26s)]
*  But I'm confident the message that has been delivered to Iran that we are conducted a limited one-off [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zv7hzq095uA&t=522.46s)]
*  airstrike in support of Israel's operation [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zv7hzq095uA&t=529.14s)]
*  We are not going to war with you [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zv7hzq095uA&t=531.94s)]
*  If you retaliate against us and hurt people at our bases or our capabilities at those bases [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zv7hzq095uA&t=534.94s)]
*  Then you're gonna have to deal with massive consequences as a result of that action [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zv7hzq095uA&t=542.34s)]
*  I believe based on where Iran is and yet so much back on their heels their [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zv7hzq095uA&t=547.5400000000001s)]
*  Military leadership has been decapitated their civilian leadership is in hiding [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zv7hzq095uA&t=553.74s)]
*  Buried under the ground and [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zv7hzq095uA&t=559.74s)]
*  The psychological emotional impact that that would have on that person in terms of what is happening to them and what they're used to having [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zv7hzq095uA&t=562.14s)]
*  In their normal everyday life will take its toll. I think they will recognize that they cannot afford [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zv7hzq095uA&t=569.3000000000001s)]
*  to do [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zv7hzq095uA&t=576.9s)]
*  What people are suggesting a massive strike on the United States which would result in our significant overwhelming response? [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zv7hzq095uA&t=578.4200000000001s)]
*  And that would put their regime survival at risk not in terms of us bringing down the regime [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zv7hzq095uA&t=585.58s)]
*  But in terms of them being so politically weakened as a result of everything they care about being destroyed [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zv7hzq095uA&t=591.7s)]
*  That people will look for opportunities to take that regime over. Well, and obviously we saw Iran [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zv7hzq095uA&t=598.78s)]
*  Responded after we took out Soleimani so we can expect maybe something will come but you know, I'll tell you general I spent [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zv7hzq095uA&t=605.58s)]
*  Weeks months over the last four years out in places like the San Diego sector. I encountered English-speaking Iranians [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zv7hzq095uA&t=613.7s)]
*  Syrians my colleague Bill Mollusk and I did too [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zv7hzq095uA&t=622.34s)]
*  I now am talking to some DHS sources worrying about you know [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zv7hzq095uA&t=624.76s)]
*  Is there a threat of a cell or someone being activated or even a smaller? [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zv7hzq095uA&t=629.18s)]
*  individualized [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zv7hzq095uA&t=634.98s)]
*  Motivated person to try and strike us here at home [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zv7hzq095uA&t=636.9s)]
*  Yeah [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zv7hzq095uA&t=640.38s)]
*  The FBI has some concerns about that and obviously senator cotton who's ahead of the [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zv7hzq095uA&t=641.6999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, the Senate Intelligence Committee has mentioned that so I'm assuming that that threat is real [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zv7hzq095uA&t=647.26s)]
*  But I also have a lot of confidence in our counterintelligence capability one [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zv7hzq095uA&t=653.1s)]
*  the fact that they're recognizing that threat does exist means that they're onto something and [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zv7hzq095uA&t=657.8399999999999s)]
*  The fact that they revealed it to the American people was interesting in of itself [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zv7hzq095uA&t=663.02s)]
*  so I have confidence in that system and [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zv7hzq095uA&t=667.38s)]
*  And hopefully that they'll be able to prevent anything like that from happen [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zv7hzq095uA&t=670.26s)]
*  I think the more realistic thing that would happen is some kind of missile retaliation by the Iranians [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zv7hzq095uA&t=674.94s)]
*  Yeah, and we probably can expect that I want to bring you back to that just a little bit because you know general there's so much of [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zv7hzq095uA&t=681.1800000000001s)]
*  discussion in this about well [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zv7hzq095uA&t=687.82s)]
*  There is legitimate questions and concerns of being drawn into something else to remember of what happened in Iraq and in [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zv7hzq095uA&t=690.5s)]
*  Afghanistan, but it seems to me that the intelligence this time is clear and it's against an [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zv7hzq095uA&t=698.0400000000001s)]
*  Enemy you're dealing with an enemy who is the undisputed number one? [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zv7hzq095uA&t=705.84s)]
*  Global, you know to hair terrorist on the globe [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zv7hzq095uA&t=710.7600000000001s)]
*  And so they've been chanting as we pointed out for four and a half decades death to America and killing Americans [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zv7hzq095uA&t=713.2s)]
*  But now we have the IAEA [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zv7hzq095uA&t=718.96s)]
*  Intelligence it came out in this May 31 report where the first time in 20 years [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zv7hzq095uA&t=721.72s)]
*  inspectors [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zv7hzq095uA&t=726.6999999999999s)]
*  Still in Iran under the non-nuclear proliferation treaty remember JCPOA went away [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zv7hzq095uA&t=727.8199999999999s)]
*  But the inspectors did say on their limited knowledge [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zv7hzq095uA&t=733.3s)]
*  They say that that we had literally enrichment happening up to well [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zv7hzq095uA&t=736.74s)]
*  Here's what they say they say the fact that Iran is the only [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zv7hzq095uA&t=741.78s)]
*  Non-nuclear weapon state in the world that is producing and accumulating uranium enriched to 60% [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zv7hzq095uA&t=744.6999999999999s)]
*  Remains a serious concern for viewers 20% is what you need perhaps for energy [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zv7hzq095uA&t=751.5400000000001s)]
*  60% is a short distance from the 90% weapons grade and they end the report this way general [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zv7hzq095uA&t=757.0600000000001s)]
*  Unless and until Iran assists the agency in resolving the outstanding issues [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zv7hzq095uA&t=762.98s)]
*  The agency will not be in a position to provide assurance that Iran's nuclear program is [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zv7hzq095uA&t=767.1400000000001s)]
*  exclusively [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zv7hzq095uA&t=773.5s)]
*  Peaceful it seems that that's gonna be a part of what woke us up about it [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zv7hzq095uA&t=774.62s)]
*  Well, I think that in [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zv7hzq095uA&t=780.22s)]
*  Israel's intelligence as well. I think some of the statements that came out of our intelligence [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zv7hzq095uA&t=782.2600000000001s)]
*  Services about they haven't made a decision is absolutely ludicrous [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zv7hzq095uA&t=787.7800000000001s)]
*  You know based on the fact that they also would make that there are two weeks from being able to assemble [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zv7hzq095uA&t=791.4200000000001s)]
*  The enough enriched uranium to weaponize it and make it into a weapon [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zv7hzq095uA&t=798.3800000000001s)]
*  well [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zv7hzq095uA&t=803.3800000000001s)]
*  Isn't that I haven't they already made a decision to do that and so I [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zv7hzq095uA&t=804.58s)]
*  Totally discount the conclusion that a decision hasn't been made because if they made the decision today two weeks from now [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zv7hzq095uA&t=809.5400000000001s)]
*  They would have what they they wanted and we wouldn't even notice it [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zv7hzq095uA&t=816.0600000000001s)]
*  It would be the same thing that happened in North Korea [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zv7hzq095uA&t=820.22s)]
*  When they did it it going back to the escalation thing and I know some of your colleagues are concerned about this [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zv7hzq095uA&t=822.58s)]
*  when a president is considering what he did here today and he knows that the enemy has a vote and [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zv7hzq095uA&t=828.58s)]
*  That they can come back and escalate as a result of it and then and then our leaders walk the president through [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zv7hzq095uA&t=835.54s)]
*  the options that we have based on size scale and impact of the enemy's escalation and we have [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zv7hzq095uA&t=842.42s)]
*  options and we walk him through all of that and [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zv7hzq095uA&t=849.82s)]
*  Obviously there can be a walk up the escalation ladder, which is the concern that people have but you have to ask this [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zv7hzq095uA&t=854.0600000000001s)]
*  fundamental question [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zv7hzq095uA&t=861.62s)]
*  Obama and Biden were both paralyzed by the fear of adverse consequence the fear of escalation and what it would imply and [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zv7hzq095uA&t=864.38s)]
*  It paralyzed them this president is not paralyzed him and the reason is he'll ask the next question [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zv7hzq095uA&t=872.18s)]
*  When they take them through the escalation. Well, what is the impact of us doing nothing? [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zv7hzq095uA&t=879.5s)]
*  Take me through what is what is the impact of doing nothing? [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zv7hzq095uA&t=885.78s)]
*  And that is what leads you to overcome your fear [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zv7hzq095uA&t=890.06s)]
*  which is a natural human experience when you're dealing with these and your president of the United States and you have [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zv7hzq095uA&t=894.1s)]
*  People's lives at risk literally based on on your decision here [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zv7hzq095uA&t=900.98s)]
*  but when you ask that question and you [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zv7hzq095uA&t=905.22s)]
*  Get the response and the danger it meant to Israel the danger to the American people writ large and the danger [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zv7hzq095uA&t=907.66s)]
*  It meant to the Europeans our soldiers are in uniform and we're expecting them to take risk [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zv7hzq095uA&t=914.46s)]
*  They have come forward and and put their life on the line to defend this country. They are a small population [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zv7hzq095uA&t=920.58s)]
*  Resenting the strong values that we have and we are asking them to accept that risk [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zv7hzq095uA&t=927.62s)]
*  So we can protect the American people and the state of Israel and they will willingly accept that risk and our [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zv7hzq095uA&t=933.02s)]
*  appreciation and admiration for those pilots and those [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zv7hzq095uA&t=940.14s)]
*  Sailors and everybody out there in this operation general Jack Heen [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zv7hzq095uA&t=943.58s)]
