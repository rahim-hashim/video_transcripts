# Pentagon releases footage of bunker-buster test
**Fox News - World News:** [June 26, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fukWxTloXac)
*  We're going to send it out to Alexandria Hoff live at the White House. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fukWxTloXac&t=0.0s)]
*  Alex, good morning to you. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fukWxTloXac&t=2.84s)]
*  ALEXANDRIA HOFF, White House Press Secretary, National Security Council, USA, Good Morning [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fukWxTloXac&t=3.84s)]
*  to you. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fukWxTloXac&t=4.84s)]
*  Good morning to you, Bill. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fukWxTloXac&t=5.84s)]
*  Yes, this briefing that we had just seen, this was the Pentagon's moment to tell the [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fukWxTloXac&t=6.84s)]
*  story of this mission, explain what the weapons used are capable of, and, in doing so, counterreports [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fukWxTloXac&t=8.64s)]
*  that had drawn into question the effectiveness of this mission. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fukWxTloXac&t=15.44s)]
*  General Cain explained a little bit more about how all of this went down and the intricacies [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fukWxTloXac&t=19.72s)]
*  of Operation Midnight Hammer. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fukWxTloXac&t=24.400000000000002s)]
*  Listen. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fukWxTloXac&t=26.2s)]
*  The primary kill mechanism in the mission space was a mix of overpressure and blast [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fukWxTloXac&t=27.52s)]
*  ripping through the open tunnels and destroying critical hardware. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fukWxTloXac&t=33.04s)]
*  The majority of the damage we assessed based on our extensive modeling was a blast layer [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fukWxTloXac&t=37.0s)]
*  combined with the impulse extending from the shock. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fukWxTloXac&t=43.16s)]
*  Imagine what this looks like six times over. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fukWxTloXac&t=47.8s)]
*  So he says everything worked as planned. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fukWxTloXac&t=51.96s)]
*  All of these weapons performed as they were expected to on an operation that really was [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fukWxTloXac&t=54.44s)]
*  15 years in the making, because, as General Cain explained, there had been somebody, two [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fukWxTloXac&t=59.4s)]
*  individuals actually, in the intelligence community watching Fordow specifically as [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fukWxTloXac&t=63.36s)]
*  a site suspected of nuclear enrichment this entire time and looking what kind of weapon [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fukWxTloXac&t=68.48s)]
*  would be needed to destroy this. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fukWxTloXac&t=73.75999999999999s)]
*  It was explained to us that, and to all press that were there, that an attack on a mountainside-covered [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fukWxTloXac&t=75.48s)]
*  nuclear site really would require the kind of weaponry that would first blast open the [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fukWxTloXac&t=80.8s)]
*  cap that they have. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fukWxTloXac&t=86.12s)]
*  That is what happened. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fukWxTloXac&t=87.12s)]
*  The rest went down into the ground, 1,000 feet per second, I believe the general said, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fukWxTloXac&t=88.12s)]
*  exploding in that mission space where really the hub of Iran's nuclear capabilities. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fukWxTloXac&t=93.2s)]
*  Weapon number six then was their cover just in case one of those jets or weapons did not [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fukWxTloXac&t=98.6s)]
*  work. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fukWxTloXac&t=102.32s)]
*  General Cain's saying today it's really not his job to assess the aftermath, but he knows [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fukWxTloXac&t=103.32s)]
*  everything worked as it should. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fukWxTloXac&t=108.44s)]
*  The Joint Force does not do BDA. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fukWxTloXac&t=111.47999999999999s)]
*  By design, we don't grade our own homework. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fukWxTloXac&t=115.24s)]
*  The intelligence community does. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fukWxTloXac&t=117.96s)]
*  But here's what we know following the attacks and the strikes on Fordow. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fukWxTloXac&t=120.32s)]
*  First, that the weapons were built, tested, and loaded properly. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fukWxTloXac&t=124.52s)]
*  Two, the weapons were released on speed and on parameters. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fukWxTloXac&t=129.8s)]
*  Three, the weapons all guided to their intended targets and to their intended aim points. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fukWxTloXac&t=135.20000000000002s)]
*  Four, the weapons functioned as designed, meaning they exploded. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fukWxTloXac&t=140.84s)]
*  All right, so something the White House is now looking into is the way that they share [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fukWxTloXac&t=147.4s)]
*  information with members of Congress. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fukWxTloXac&t=150.28s)]
*  There's clearly an indication there that they feel like that some of this leaked initial [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fukWxTloXac&t=152.56s)]
*  assessment might have come from that direction. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fukWxTloXac&t=156.08s)]
*  The White House, also, you know, officials in law enforcement, federal law enforcement [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fukWxTloXac&t=159.24s)]
*  are looking into potential charges for whoever this leak is found to have been. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fukWxTloXac&t=163.56s)]
*  This was early information, they said, and that reporting the administration feels kind [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fukWxTloXac&t=168.16s)]
*  of lacked the full scope of that anyway. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fukWxTloXac&t=172.64000000000001s)]
*  They found that to be reckless and an insult to the pilots and all of those who bravely [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fukWxTloXac&t=174.8s)]
*  contributed to Operation Midnight Hammer. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fukWxTloXac&t=180.56s)]
*  You know, Jennifer Griffin, our Jennifer Griffin, did ask an important question during this [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fukWxTloXac&t=183.44s)]
*  briefing today. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fukWxTloXac&t=186.68s)]
*  She asked about certain imagery that was captured that showed Iranian trucks. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fukWxTloXac&t=188.06s)]
*  I think she said that had been seen on site one day, gone the next. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fukWxTloXac&t=192.95999999999998s)]
*  That kind of contributes to this idea that Iran might have been moving their enriched [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fukWxTloXac&t=197.67999999999998s)]
*  uranium in the days prior to this attack. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fukWxTloXac&t=201.56s)]
*  Secretary Hegseth, when asked about that, said that they are still looking at understanding [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fukWxTloXac&t=205.07999999999998s)]
*  where all the pieces were at what time. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fukWxTloXac&t=209.48s)]
*  Guys. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fukWxTloXac&t=211.48s)]
*  All right, Alex Hoff, with a great wrap up of what we just saw this morning. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fukWxTloXac&t=212.48s)]
