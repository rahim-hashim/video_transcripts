# ‘9 atom bombs’ worth of materials: Israel hits ‘heart’ of Iran’s nuclear program
**Fox News - World News:** [June 12, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2c3UzK-o3M)
*  In Tel Aviv, on what is now early morning in Israel, Trey. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2c3UzK-o3M&t=0.0s)]
*  Yeah, Trey, good evening. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2c3UzK-o3M&t=5.0s)]
*  Overnight, Israel launched a series of strikes, according to the IDF, using dozens of fighter [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2c3UzK-o3M&t=7.6000000000000005s)]
*  jets to target different positions across Iran, not only hitting the country's nuclear [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2c3UzK-o3M&t=12.84s)]
*  program and their ballistic missile supply, but also targeting individual leadership, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2c3UzK-o3M&t=18.76s)]
*  including the head of the IRGC, Hussein Salami. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2c3UzK-o3M&t=25.080000000000002s)]
*  This is the top military general in all of Iran, and according to Iranian state media, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2c3UzK-o3M&t=29.18s)]
*  he is dead. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2c3UzK-o3M&t=34.5s)]
*  There is currently a state of emergency declared across the entirety of Israel, as this country [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2c3UzK-o3M&t=35.78s)]
*  braces for an expected Iranian response. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2c3UzK-o3M&t=40.96s)]
*  I spoke tonight with an Israeli source who discussed what took place earlier in the evening. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2c3UzK-o3M&t=44.7s)]
*  This source said Israel was able to surprise Iran. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2c3UzK-o3M&t=50.3s)]
*  Israel managed to hit several targets in the heart of Tehran and to eliminate multiple [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2c3UzK-o3M&t=53.5s)]
*  senior Iranian regime leaders simultaneously in different spots. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2c3UzK-o3M&t=58.06s)]
*  Now, at this hour, there are reports of additional explosions taking place in the Iranian capital [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2c3UzK-o3M&t=62.7s)]
*  of Tehran, an indication that the Israelis are continuing those waves of strikes. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2c3UzK-o3M&t=68.74000000000001s)]
*  But again, the question now is how will the Iranians respond? [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2c3UzK-o3M&t=74.74000000000001s)]
*  Israel has a variety of air defense systems, from David's Sling to the Arrow 2 and 3 systems. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2c3UzK-o3M&t=79.18s)]
*  They also have Patriot missile defense systems and a THAAD system supplied by the United [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2c3UzK-o3M&t=84.62s)]
*  States. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2c3UzK-o3M&t=89.5s)]
*  But as we saw during an Iranian missile attack back in October that included hundreds of [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2c3UzK-o3M&t=90.5s)]
*  ballistic missiles, this is not a perfect system. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2c3UzK-o3M&t=95.22s)]
*  And it's part of the reason that Israel's Home Front Command, the branch of the military [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2c3UzK-o3M&t=98.10000000000001s)]
*  responsible for communicating with civilians, has ordered everyone in this country to stay [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2c3UzK-o3M&t=102.06s)]
*  close to bomb shelters. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2c3UzK-o3M&t=107.06s)]
*  This is not a question of if Iran will respond, but rather when and where. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2c3UzK-o3M&t=108.62s)]
*  We do expect the targets to be extensive, but Israel has prepared for this for not only [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2c3UzK-o3M&t=113.7s)]
*  months but years. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2c3UzK-o3M&t=118.86s)]
*  This was something that the Israelis said would have to happen if Iran's nuclear program [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2c3UzK-o3M&t=120.42s)]
*  continued to advance toward a nuclear weapon. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2c3UzK-o3M&t=126.22s)]
*  We know President Trump tried to pursue as many diplomatic opportunities as possible. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2c3UzK-o3M&t=129.35999999999999s)]
*  His Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, going back and forth to the region in Oman and Europe [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2c3UzK-o3M&t=134.26s)]
*  five separate times, meeting with Iranian counterparts, trying to get together some [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2c3UzK-o3M&t=139.46s)]
*  sort of agreement. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2c3UzK-o3M&t=143.46s)]
*  But the Israelis said that they were too close to a nuclear weapon, according to sources [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2c3UzK-o3M&t=144.72s)]
*  that we have talked to. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2c3UzK-o3M&t=148.8s)]
*  And again, the decision was made tonight to strike Iranian nuclear facilities. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2c3UzK-o3M&t=150.18s)]
*  The latest information that we have, the Israeli cabinet met tonight. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2c3UzK-o3M&t=154.86s)]
*  Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu addressed the nation about what is taking [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2c3UzK-o3M&t=158.66s)]
*  place. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2c3UzK-o3M&t=162.94s)]
*  But we do not expect this to be over in a short period of time. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2c3UzK-o3M&t=163.94s)]
*  This is likely going to take a matter of weeks before it is complete, and we do expect Iranian [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2c3UzK-o3M&t=166.70000000000002s)]
*  missiles to target Israeli cities in possibly the hours or days ahead. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2c3UzK-o3M&t=172.06s)]
*  Trey. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2c3UzK-o3M&t=176.78s)]
*  Trey Yanks, live for us in Tel Aviv. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2c3UzK-o3M&t=177.78s)]
*  Trey, we will get back to you as the news comes in. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2c3UzK-o3M&t=179.74s)]
*  We appreciate it. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2c3UzK-o3M&t=182.62s)]
