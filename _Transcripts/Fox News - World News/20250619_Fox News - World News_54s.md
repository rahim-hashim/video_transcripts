**Fox News - World News:** [June 19, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CXH2VCzQfo)
*  President Trump's timeline as he decides to strike or not to strike, I am continually [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CXH2VCzQfo&t=0.0s)]
*  directed to his comments yesterday on the South Lawn where he says the next week could [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CXH2VCzQfo&t=6.8s)]
*  be very big, maybe less. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CXH2VCzQfo&t=10.64s)]
*  Back to you. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CXH2VCzQfo&t=12.44s)]
*  So do we know if he's made a decision? [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CXH2VCzQfo&t=13.44s)]
*  Wall Street Journal saying he has on whether or not to engage, but he has not given the [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CXH2VCzQfo&t=14.72s)]
*  final orders. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CXH2VCzQfo&t=19.080000000000002s)]
*  AP saying that he doesn't want to carry out a strike, but suggesting that he stands ready [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CXH2VCzQfo&t=20.080000000000002s)]
*  to act. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CXH2VCzQfo&t=24.32s)]
*  Have you heard him say, I have made a decision? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CXH2VCzQfo&t=25.46s)]
*  No, he said that he has not made a decision and that he likes to make the decisions at [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CXH2VCzQfo&t=28.92s)]
*  the last possible second. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CXH2VCzQfo&t=33.120000000000005s)]
*  When we checked in on that Wall Street Journal story, which is well-sourced, I was told by [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CXH2VCzQfo&t=34.68s)]
*  a White House official that all options remain on the table. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CXH2VCzQfo&t=40.2s)]
*  So when President Trump says nobody knows what he is going to do, he wants the whole [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CXH2VCzQfo&t=43.68s)]
*  world guessing. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CXH2VCzQfo&t=49.84s)]
