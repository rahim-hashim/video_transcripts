# This will change EVERYTHING: Gingrich
**Fox News - World News:** [June 18, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klowmPzQkiw)
*  with Reaction, Fox News contributor, former speaker of the House, Newt Gingrich. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klowmPzQkiw&t=0.0s)]
*  It's obvious—I mean, in so many ways, he's given them every opportunity to peacefully [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klowmPzQkiw&t=5.08s)]
*  get out of what is their own demise and destruction. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klowmPzQkiw&t=11.22s)]
*  Can you believe in such a short period of time the Israelis dominate the airwaves, the [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klowmPzQkiw&t=14.08s)]
*  skies of Iran, in such a short period of time? [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klowmPzQkiw&t=21.04s)]
*  I mean, they could deliver one devastating blow after another. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klowmPzQkiw&t=24.6s)]
*  The question is, this one facility, the Fordow facility, and whether or not the United States [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klowmPzQkiw&t=28.5s)]
*  will take them out with Bunker Busters. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klowmPzQkiw&t=34.9s)]
*  Your thoughts tonight? [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klowmPzQkiw&t=37.3s)]
*  Well, when historians look back and say, did Donald Trump really make a difference, think [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klowmPzQkiw&t=38.3s)]
*  about this. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klowmPzQkiw&t=46.82s)]
*  The original Ayatollah Khomeini first started calling us the Great Satan in 1978. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klowmPzQkiw&t=49.66s)]
*  And then mobbers began chanting, Death to America, in 1979, when they seized illegally [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klowmPzQkiw&t=56.06s)]
*  the American embassy. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klowmPzQkiw&t=62.46s)]
*  They have been taunting us, attacking us, harassing us all these years through all these [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klowmPzQkiw&t=63.940000000000005s)]
*  presidents. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klowmPzQkiw&t=70.34s)]
*  And finally, they have collided with Donald J. Trump, and he's crossed the line. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klowmPzQkiw&t=71.62s)]
*  He and Netanyahu are partners, much like Reagan and Margaret Thatcher were partners. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klowmPzQkiw&t=76.88s)]
*  And the two of them are going to change history decisively. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klowmPzQkiw&t=83.02s)]
*  I believe they're going to break the mullahs and the regime, create a new Iran, which will, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klowmPzQkiw&t=86.02s)]
*  in a decade, be dramatically more prosperous, be a neighbor, be accepted, be part of the [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klowmPzQkiw&t=92.34s)]
*  region. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klowmPzQkiw&t=97.94s)]
*  This would not have happened with anyone except Donald J. Trump. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klowmPzQkiw&t=99.08s)]
*  It's obvious. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klowmPzQkiw&t=103.97999999999999s)]
*  This guy has the guts. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klowmPzQkiw&t=105.02s)]
*  He has the understanding. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klowmPzQkiw&t=106.46s)]
*  He actually follows the logic. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klowmPzQkiw&t=108.06s)]
*  If you don't want a nuclear Iran, then you've got to stop the mullahs, because as long as [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klowmPzQkiw&t=109.9s)]
*  they're there, there's going to be a nuclear Iran. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klowmPzQkiw&t=116.22s)]
*  And he's prepared to do whatever it takes to stop them. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klowmPzQkiw&t=119.7s)]
*  This will not be a forever war. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klowmPzQkiw&t=123.3s)]
*  This will be a brief, brutal, direct use of American power to end the regime and end the [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klowmPzQkiw&t=125.26s)]
*  threat and make both the world and the Middle East safer. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klowmPzQkiw&t=133.22s)]
*  You know, I'm trying to understand. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klowmPzQkiw&t=138.14000000000001s)]
*  Now, I showed the polls, the overwhelming number of Americans, Democrats, Republicans, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klowmPzQkiw&t=140.14000000000001s)]
*  independents, support the president. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klowmPzQkiw&t=145.58s)]
*  I mean, the poll with Robert Cahaly and Matt Towery in particular—we can put it up, but [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klowmPzQkiw&t=147.34s)]
*  we can find it—you know, asked a very pointed question, by any means necessary, and 75 percent [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klowmPzQkiw&t=151.82s)]
*  of respondents said, yeah, Donald Trump should use any means necessary to take it out. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klowmPzQkiw&t=159.02s)]
*  And, you know, what's amazing to me is people talk about, you know, Donald Trump wanting [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klowmPzQkiw&t=164.14000000000001s)]
*  a forever war. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klowmPzQkiw&t=169.34s)]
*  Well, he didn't have a forever war when he took out Soleimani or Baghdadian associates. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klowmPzQkiw&t=170.34s)]
*  He didn't have a forever war when he beat the ISIS caliphate. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klowmPzQkiw&t=175.54000000000002s)]
*  He just kicked the living hell out of him, won, and turned around and went home. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klowmPzQkiw&t=179.34s)]
*  And in this case, it would be take out the Fordow nuclear site and, from that point on, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klowmPzQkiw&t=183.62s)]
*  protect our assets in the region and let the Israelis do whatever they need to do, considering [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klowmPzQkiw&t=189.38s)]
*  they've been the victim of the vast majority of those missiles being fired into their country [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klowmPzQkiw&t=193.9s)]
*  by Iran and by their proxies. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klowmPzQkiw&t=198.62s)]
*  Look, if we finish crushing the Revolutionary Guard, my hunch is that the army will side [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klowmPzQkiw&t=202.62s)]
*  with the people, and they will take over the country, liberate it, and move towards a prosperous, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klowmPzQkiw&t=208.38000000000002s)]
*  peaceful Iran that we can live with. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klowmPzQkiw&t=214.26000000000002s)]
*  And there are an enormous number of Iranian Americans who are very successful, who are [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klowmPzQkiw&t=216.98000000000002s)]
*  prepared to go back and help rebuild their country once the dictatorship is gone. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klowmPzQkiw&t=222.18s)]
*  But nobody should kid themselves. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klowmPzQkiw&t=227.58s)]
*  This is a decisive moment in world history. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klowmPzQkiw&t=229.82000000000002s)]
*  This is going to change not just the region, but, you know, what happened was the American [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klowmPzQkiw&t=232.54000000000002s)]
*  people since 1978 have had these people chanting death to America. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klowmPzQkiw&t=237.4s)]
*  They watched missiles hitting Tel Aviv, and the average American says to themselves, if [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klowmPzQkiw&t=242.5s)]
*  any one of those missiles had been nuclear, the entire city would have been annihilated [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klowmPzQkiw&t=246.92s)]
*  and a million people would be dead. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klowmPzQkiw&t=252.51999999999998s)]
*  Now, at that point, you say to yourself, are you prepared to take the risk of allowing [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klowmPzQkiw&t=254.28s)]
*  these madmen to get nuclear weapons? [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klowmPzQkiw&t=259.68s)]
*  And as you saw in the polling data, Democrats, independents, Republicans all came back and [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klowmPzQkiw&t=262.4s)]
*  said no, this is the moment, get rid of them. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klowmPzQkiw&t=266.59999999999997s)]
*  And luckily for us, we have in President Trump somebody with the guts, the toughness and [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klowmPzQkiw&t=270.44s)]
*  determination to actually follow through. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klowmPzQkiw&t=275.44s)]
*  Let me get your final comment. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klowmPzQkiw&t=278.92s)]
*  I only have less than a minute. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klowmPzQkiw&t=280.6s)]
*  Donald Trump puts on social media warning the people in Tehran to leave. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klowmPzQkiw&t=283.64s)]
*  And not only are they leaving, they are leaving in massive, massive numbers. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klowmPzQkiw&t=289.8s)]
*  You can't even get out of there fast enough. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klowmPzQkiw&t=295.8s)]
*  Pretty amazing sight, isn't it? [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klowmPzQkiw&t=298.92s)]
*  It is a moment that is going to change history, not only in Iran, but the message to Putin, [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klowmPzQkiw&t=303.04s)]
*  the message to Xi Jinping, the message to every would-be aggressor in the world is there [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klowmPzQkiw&t=309.48s)]
*  is a new sheriff in town and he is serious. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klowmPzQkiw&t=313.96s)]
*  The Trump doctrine is clear. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klowmPzQkiw&t=318.52s)]
*  It really is. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klowmPzQkiw&t=320.28s)]
*  The guy that took out Soleimani, the guy that took out Baghdadi and Associates, the guy [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klowmPzQkiw&t=321.72s)]
*  that took out the caliphate, doesn't believe in forever wars, but he's not an isolationist [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klowmPzQkiw&t=327.18s)]
*  either and he applies common sense in taking out Iran and their nuclear sites before they [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klowmPzQkiw&t=332.94s)]
*  get them and terrorize the world. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klowmPzQkiw&t=339.22s)]
*  That to me is simple common sense. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klowmPzQkiw&t=341.94s)]
*  Newt Gingrich, we appreciate your time. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klowmPzQkiw&t=344.06s)]
