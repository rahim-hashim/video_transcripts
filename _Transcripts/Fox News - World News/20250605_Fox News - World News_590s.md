# Trump announces trade agreement with China: 'We have the deal'
**Fox News - World News:** [June 05, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYGAIZXc2jM)
*  You've been watching the public portion of President Trump's meeting with Chancellor Mers of Germany [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYGAIZXc2jM&t=0.0s)]
*  There are some news items that came out of this three that come to mind and we'll go through them number one [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYGAIZXc2jM&t=5.76s)]
*  The tweet this morning that came out from the president about his conversation with Chinese President Xi Jinping [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYGAIZXc2jM&t=11.32s)]
*  Referred to the intricacies of our recently made and agreed to trade deal [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYGAIZXc2jM&t=17.12s)]
*  Well, he underscored that and said that there's a good deal [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYGAIZXc2jM&t=22.080000000000002s)]
*  That's been made and we just need to all make sure we understand it [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYGAIZXc2jM&t=25.88s)]
*  That would be huge news for the market and for tariffs in general [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYGAIZXc2jM&t=28.84s)]
*  Secondly the back-and-forth with Elon Musk in the last 48 hours [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYGAIZXc2jM&t=32.68s)]
*  Elon Musk has put out 70 plus tweets about the big beautiful bill in his time in the administration [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYGAIZXc2jM&t=36.0s)]
*  President Trump for the first time on camera addressed that directly [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYGAIZXc2jM&t=41.64s)]
*  He said he was disappointed and the critiques from Elon Musk said he was well versed in the intricacies of the bill [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYGAIZXc2jM&t=45.239999999999995s)]
*  And then the line out of that meeting was Elon and I had a great relationship [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYGAIZXc2jM&t=51.48s)]
*  I don't know if we will have one anymore [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYGAIZXc2jM&t=55.64s)]
*  Elon Musk has been tweeting back in real time saying some positive things about President Trump praising him for pooling federal funding for the [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYGAIZXc2jM&t=58.24s)]
*  California high-speed rail but also [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYGAIZXc2jM&t=66.0s)]
*  Emphasizing his critiques of the big beautiful bill [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYGAIZXc2jM&t=69.08s)]
*  So a little back and forth there and then finally on why Egypt was scrapped from that travel ban list President Trump said [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYGAIZXc2jM&t=71.6s)]
*  We deal with them closely and Egypt has things under control [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYGAIZXc2jM&t=78.16s)]
*  There's a lot more and we will get to all of it here on outnumbered. Hello everyone [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYGAIZXc2jM&t=81.48s)]
*  I'm Kaylee McEnany and I'm here with my co-host Emily Campagno also joining us [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYGAIZXc2jM&t=85.44s)]
*  Rosanna Scotto Fox 5 anchor and host of the underground economy on Fox Nation [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYGAIZXc2jM&t=89.24s)]
*  Kennedy host of the Kennedy saves the world podcast and David Webb Fox News contributor [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYGAIZXc2jM&t=94.88s)]
*  Well, let's start here with the China news. This is a huge deal for the market for everyone. Really? [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYGAIZXc2jM&t=101.03999999999999s)]
*  Let's listen to what the president said [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYGAIZXc2jM&t=106.16000000000001s)]
*  We have a deal with China as you know, but we were straightening out some of the points having to do mostly with rare earth [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYGAIZXc2jM&t=108.56s)]
*  Magnets and some other things those reduced trade tariff rates. They remain in effect. Do we have we have the deal? [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYGAIZXc2jM&t=118.08000000000001s)]
*  I mean, we've had a deal we announced the deal and [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYGAIZXc2jM&t=124.56s)]
*  Will be I guess you could say I wouldn't even say finalizing it up Scott [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYGAIZXc2jM&t=127.48s)]
*  I would say we have a deal and we're gonna just make sure that everybody understands what the deal is [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYGAIZXc2jM&t=132.04s)]
*  By the way, he invited me to China and I invited him here. We've both accepted [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYGAIZXc2jM&t=136.23999999999998s)]
*  so I'll be going there with the First Lady at a certain point and [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYGAIZXc2jM&t=140.72s)]
*  He'll be coming here. Hopefully with the First Lady of China. I [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYGAIZXc2jM&t=144.88s)]
*  Mean Emily we discussed on this couch Scott Besson said all these other tariffs were pursuant to putting the pressure on China [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYGAIZXc2jM&t=149.56s)]
*  So if indeed there is a deal that comes in short order this this would be a massive win for the Trump administration [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYGAIZXc2jM&t=156.95999999999998s)]
*  And we know that Trump at 10 45 a.m [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYGAIZXc2jM&t=162.07999999999998s)]
*  This morning put out the truth social talking about this call and remember this is on the heels of an hour and 15 minute call [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYGAIZXc2jM&t=164.23999999999998s)]
*  He had with Vladimir Putin yesterday now today [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYGAIZXc2jM&t=169.84s)]
*  He has an hour and a half call with President Xi and I think it's interesting to note too [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYGAIZXc2jM&t=171.79999999999998s)]
*  But he says the conversation was totally focused on trade. Nothing was discussed [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYGAIZXc2jM&t=175.35999999999999s)]
*  he said concerning Russia Ukraine or Iran and as we talked about his [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYGAIZXc2jM&t=180.88s)]
*  Emissaries will meet with President Xi's emissaries to discuss out the details as he said [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYGAIZXc2jM&t=186.2s)]
*  We'll learn them in a moment or coming shortly [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYGAIZXc2jM&t=190.6s)]
*  But I think it's really important to note that I think [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYGAIZXc2jM&t=193.32s)]
*  Oftentimes especially in the mainstream media everything is either siloed when it shouldn't be or totally fuddled together when it shouldn't be and here [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYGAIZXc2jM&t=195.96s)]
*  These were two leaders talking only about trade without the sort of encroachment of these other highly important topics [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYGAIZXc2jM&t=203.12s)]
*  Especially as we learned with the Chancellor tomorrow D-Day anniversary [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYGAIZXc2jM&t=210.0s)]
*  Like there's a lot going on globally that our president is involved in but for that moment [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYGAIZXc2jM&t=212.84s)]
*  It was very targeted to the benefit of us and for all of those naysayers who said it wouldn't happen [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYGAIZXc2jM&t=217.4s)]
*  Well, there you go. It's it would be a big deal, especially as we get those details [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYGAIZXc2jM&t=222.20000000000002s)]
*  And you know, there's an irony here [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYGAIZXc2jM&t=226.68s)]
*  Everyone's looking at MERS and President Trump [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYGAIZXc2jM&t=228.32s)]
*  But really a lot of people are thinking about the richest man in the world Elon Musk and the most powerful man [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYGAIZXc2jM&t=230.16s)]
*  President Trump in the back and forth there. Let's listen to what President Trump said about Elon Musk [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYGAIZXc2jM&t=234.96s)]
*  And you know, he lines upset because we took the EV mandate and you know, which was a lot of money for [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYGAIZXc2jM&t=240.68s)]
*  electric vehicles and [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYGAIZXc2jM&t=246.84s)]
*  You know, they're having a hard time the electric vehicles and they want us to pay [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYGAIZXc2jM&t=249.12s)]
*  billions of dollars in subsidy and you know, I [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYGAIZXc2jM&t=253.35999999999999s)]
*  Elon knew this from the beginning look Elon and I had a great relationship. I [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYGAIZXc2jM&t=258.08s)]
*  Don't know if we're well anymore [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYGAIZXc2jM&t=264.71999999999997s)]
*  Kennedy so here are some of the [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYGAIZXc2jM&t=267.36s)]
*  Tweets that came in real time as the president was saying that Elon Musk tweeted out whatever keep the EV solar [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYGAIZXc2jM&t=269.71999999999997s)]
*  Incentive cuts in the bill, even though no oil and gas subsidies are touched very unfair but ditch the mountain of disgusting pork [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYGAIZXc2jM&t=276.03999999999996s)]
*  He said he also though said this sensible move by President Trump on high-speed rail [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYGAIZXc2jM&t=281.91999999999996s)]
*  So he was praising President Trump too as this was being discussed in the Oval Office [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYGAIZXc2jM&t=288.44s)]
*  Yes [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYGAIZXc2jM&t=292.88s)]
*  and you know, there are a lot of people who despise Elon Musk who hopes that he takes the bait and you know turns this into [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYGAIZXc2jM&t=293.32s)]
*  An actual fight and you know, but Elon Musk is not Omarosa like he's not going to [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYGAIZXc2jM&t=300.08s)]
*  Leave this relationship and throw a tantrum. He said what he had to say, you know [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYGAIZXc2jM&t=306.44s)]
*  Philosophically he comes from a very sound position where he wants to limit the size and scope of government [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYGAIZXc2jM&t=311.36s)]
*  He wants to do the necessary cutting [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYGAIZXc2jM&t=317.06s)]
*  He hopes that Congress is going to follow suit and codify some of the Doge cuts [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYGAIZXc2jM&t=319.24s)]
*  Beyond the nine billion dollar rescission package and it looks like they're not going to they're going to make things bigger and his point is [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYGAIZXc2jM&t=323.52000000000004s)]
*  You can either have a big bill or a beautiful bill [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYGAIZXc2jM&t=331.04s)]
*  But if it's big it's ugly and he says slim and beautiful is the way to go [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYGAIZXc2jM&t=333.74s)]
*  I think that they will probably mend fences. It may not be the coziest relationship [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYGAIZXc2jM&t=337.76s)]
*  I don't think Elon's gonna be the little spoon anymore when they snuggle [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYGAIZXc2jM&t=342.8s)]
*  But I you know, he has enough self-interest here that that he will smooth things over with the president [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYGAIZXc2jM&t=346.46000000000004s)]
*  Trump has a lot of good lines, but Elon Musk is not Omarosa is most definitely the light of the day Kennedy [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYGAIZXc2jM&t=352.88s)]
*  I also want to play with the president said about the auto pen investigation that was announced last night [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYGAIZXc2jM&t=358.72s)]
*  And here's what he said on it today [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYGAIZXc2jM&t=364.32s)]
*  Your predecessor dismissed your auto pen investigation said he made all the decisions during his presidency [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYGAIZXc2jM&t=367.36s)]
*  I'm curious a reaction to his dismissal. Well, look to the auto pen. I think is the big scandal [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYGAIZXc2jM&t=372.92s)]
*  I think the biggest scandal of the last many years is the auto pen and who's using it? [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYGAIZXc2jM&t=377.72s)]
*  I happen to think I know okay, because I'm here and I'm not a big auto pen person fortunate. I'm glad I'm very glad [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYGAIZXc2jM&t=383.24s)]
*  It's an easy way out [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYGAIZXc2jM&t=390.32000000000005s)]
*  but it's [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYGAIZXc2jM&t=391.84000000000003s)]
*  It's very bad thing very dangerous. Look he was never for open borders. He was never for transgender for everybody [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYGAIZXc2jM&t=393.68s)]
*  He was never for men playing in women's sports [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYGAIZXc2jM&t=400.16s)]
*  I mean he changed I mean all of these things that that changed so radically. I don't think he had any idea that [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYGAIZXc2jM&t=403.24s)]
*  What was frankly I said it during the debate and I say it now [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYGAIZXc2jM&t=409.40000000000003s)]
*  He didn't have much of an idea what was going on. Mr. Forza. You shouldn't be I mean essentially whoever used the auto pen was the president [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYGAIZXc2jM&t=413.36s)]
*  And that is wrong. It's illegal. It's so bad and it's so disrespectful to our country [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYGAIZXc2jM&t=421.84000000000003s)]
*  You know David he went on to say that Biden was not for open borders or trans men and women's sports [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYGAIZXc2jM&t=429.56s)]
*  And I think that's the crux of this. Yeah, the auto pen is part of it [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYGAIZXc2jM&t=434.76s)]
*  We know auto pens are used by every president [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYGAIZXc2jM&t=437.8s)]
*  But if he wanted a closed border, which is essentially what we read in much of the reporting [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYGAIZXc2jM&t=439.84s)]
*  He he wanted a crackdown and someone said where did the plan go? [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYGAIZXc2jM&t=445.56s)]
*  That's the big question whether it was done by auto pen or not [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYGAIZXc2jM&t=449.04s)]
*  The question is whether Biden never told the truth or not in all the years whether he wanted open borders closed border security [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYGAIZXc2jM&t=453.15999999999997s)]
*  We've seen this from Democrats from Obama from others statements in time Clinton and others, but the actions are different the [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYGAIZXc2jM&t=459.92s)]
*  Actions taken are what matter here whether by Biden or the cadre in the White House [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYGAIZXc2jM&t=468.0s)]
*  The fact is those millions that poured across the border the visa overstays the northern border [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYGAIZXc2jM&t=473.96s)]
*  Those that were smuggled in in other ways by the way even from the Bahamas into the Florida area [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYGAIZXc2jM&t=480.16s)]
*  That's big on human trafficking with all the boats going back and forth when you look at all of that [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYGAIZXc2jM&t=485.16s)]
*  That was the result of actions. They did or did not take and that's important because they caused this by the way [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYGAIZXc2jM&t=490.0s)]
*  I now have a new word fuddled [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYGAIZXc2jM&t=497.12s)]
*  Omarosa line was great. I have never used fuddled in my life [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYGAIZXc2jM&t=500.44s)]
*  Emily [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYGAIZXc2jM&t=504.24s)]
*  Name it a word I self identify it as a word Rosanna [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYGAIZXc2jM&t=506.44s)]
*  You know I the auto pen investigation is interesting [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYGAIZXc2jM&t=510.12s)]
*  We know that's happening at DOJ, but that's that's 80% of it [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYGAIZXc2jM&t=513.16s)]
*  I would say because that definitely is how the executive orders and much of policy got manifested [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYGAIZXc2jM&t=516.48s)]
*  But there's another 20% of this and I think it's the most important part and that's Afghanistan decision-making [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYGAIZXc2jM&t=520.64s)]
*  And there wouldn't have been an auto pen used there [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYGAIZXc2jM&t=525.4s)]
