# 'ONCE AND FOR ALL': Former Israeli PM urges end of Iran's missile programs
**Fox News - World News:** [June 19, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwH761wjcPY)
*  and former Israeli Prime Minister, Neftali Bennett. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwH761wjcPY&t=0.0s)]
*  Former Prime Minister, thank you very much for joining us. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwH761wjcPY&t=3.24s)]
*  Just off the top here, your thoughts as this town [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwH761wjcPY&t=5.76s)]
*  in New Jersey waits to welcome home, Edan Alexander. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwH761wjcPY&t=8.76s)]
*  Edan is the son of every one of us [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwH761wjcPY&t=14.120000000000001s)]
*  and we all felt terrible that he was in captivity, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwH761wjcPY&t=17.28s)]
*  a hostage, but we also have to remember [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwH761wjcPY&t=22.400000000000002s)]
*  there are still dozens of hostages in those dark tunnels [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwH761wjcPY&t=24.64s)]
*  of Hamas and we have to bring them home. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwH761wjcPY&t=30.32s)]
*  Absolutely, and there are also families [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwH761wjcPY&t=34.08s)]
*  who did not have the experience, sadly, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwH761wjcPY&t=36.72s)]
*  of having their loved one come home. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwH761wjcPY&t=39.68s)]
*  I wanna ask you, President Trump today saying [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwH761wjcPY&t=42.0s)]
*  that he will make a decision in the next two weeks [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwH761wjcPY&t=44.04s)]
*  about whether or not to use potentially American weapons [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwH761wjcPY&t=47.28s)]
*  to strike Fordo and other potential installations in Iran. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwH761wjcPY&t=51.44s)]
*  Your thoughts on that, your reaction to that, sir. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwH761wjcPY&t=55.68s)]
*  Well, look, Israel is carrying on. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwH761wjcPY&t=59.24s)]
*  We started this attack in order to once and for all [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwH761wjcPY&t=62.34s)]
*  dismantle Iran's nuclear program, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwH761wjcPY&t=67.48s)]
*  dismantle its ballistic missile program [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwH761wjcPY&t=70.24000000000001s)]
*  and stop them from the whole terror apparatus they have. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwH761wjcPY&t=73.4s)]
*  So we're fighting the fight, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwH761wjcPY&t=77.92s)]
*  we're taking it on our shoulders [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwH761wjcPY&t=79.2s)]
*  and we're taking the full brunt for it. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwH761wjcPY&t=81.2s)]
*  We have about 30 Israelis that were killed. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwH761wjcPY&t=83.36s)]
*  We're getting rockets and missiles every day, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwH761wjcPY&t=87.2s)]
*  but I will tell you that we're resolute. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwH761wjcPY&t=90.88000000000001s)]
*  I think America will gain a lot from what we're doing [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwH761wjcPY&t=93.58s)]
*  because Iran throughout the years was a big enemy to America. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwH761wjcPY&t=98.82000000000001s)]
*  It kidnapped the people at the embassy, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwH761wjcPY&t=103.12s)]
*  it killed the Marines in the barracks in the 80s. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwH761wjcPY&t=107.56s)]
*  Iran killed hundreds of American soldiers in Iraq, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwH761wjcPY&t=112.24000000000001s)]
*  using the side bombs and it tried to kill President Trump, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwH761wjcPY&t=117.92s)]
*  but we're fighting right now for ourselves [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwH761wjcPY&t=122.52000000000001s)]
*  and for the world and we're proud to do it. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwH761wjcPY&t=125.36000000000001s)]
*  Do you think that Israel could dismantle Fordo [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwH761wjcPY&t=127.60000000000001s)]
*  with its own strategies, with its own abilities if need be? [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwH761wjcPY&t=131.8s)]
*  Look, it's tough. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwH761wjcPY&t=138.52s)]
*  It is underground, but as the war progresses, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwH761wjcPY&t=140.34s)]
*  new opportunities develop and I believe [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwH761wjcPY&t=144.64s)]
*  that we will have to complete the war [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwH761wjcPY&t=147.55999999999997s)]
*  only after dismantling the entire nuclear program [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwH761wjcPY&t=151.27999999999997s)]
*  because just imagine if Iran had now the 10 nuclear warheads [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwH761wjcPY&t=155.55999999999997s)]
*  it already almost achieved. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwH761wjcPY&t=161.64s)]
*  And instead of shooting these ballistic missiles [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwH761wjcPY&t=164.11999999999998s)]
*  with regular warheads, there were 10 nuclear warheads [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwH761wjcPY&t=167.38s)]
*  hitting Israel, hitting Europe [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwH761wjcPY&t=170.95999999999998s)]
*  and potentially in the future hitting America. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwH761wjcPY&t=172.8s)]
*  This is a huge threat to the world [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwH761wjcPY&t=175.24s)]
*  and Israel is taking the responsibility [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwH761wjcPY&t=178.12s)]
*  to remove this threat from the world. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwH761wjcPY&t=180.88000000000002s)]
*  All right, I hope we can continue our conversation. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwH761wjcPY&t=182.72s)]
*  Natalia Bennett, thank you. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwH761wjcPY&t=185.68s)]
*  I hope you'll come back. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwH761wjcPY&t=187.02s)]
*  We have a lot to talk about with regard [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwH761wjcPY&t=187.92000000000002s)]
*  to these negotiations that may be happening. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwH761wjcPY&t=189.36s)]
*  Hey everyone, I'm Emily Campagno. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwH761wjcPY&t=191.72000000000003s)]
