# Gutfeld: Crazy adores crazy
**Fox News - World News:** [June 03, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMZYq-4mOTI)
*  So remember when the left was all in on climate change? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMZYq-4mOTI&t=0.0s)]
*  Every conversation was about melting ice caps, heat waves, [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMZYq-4mOTI&t=3.64s)]
*  and floods. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMZYq-4mOTI&t=7.08s)]
*  Though to be fair, we were the first to report [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMZYq-4mOTI&t=8.28s)]
*  on the environmental impact of farting cows. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMZYq-4mOTI&t=10.32s)]
*  But then after October 7th, suddenly climate [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMZYq-4mOTI&t=16.28s)]
*  took a backseat to free Palestine signs [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMZYq-4mOTI&t=20.6s)]
*  and spray painting Zionists go home. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMZYq-4mOTI&t=23.72s)]
*  They went from save the whales to f***ing Jews [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMZYq-4mOTI&t=26.28s)]
*  without missing a beat. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMZYq-4mOTI&t=29.34s)]
*  Which brings us to Greta Thunberg. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMZYq-4mOTI&t=32.46s)]
*  She's 22 now, or as Hamas calls it, a cougar. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMZYq-4mOTI&t=35.1s)]
*  And she's literally on a boat bound for the Middle East [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMZYq-4mOTI&t=45.5s)]
*  called the Freedom Float Tilla. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMZYq-4mOTI&t=47.78s)]
*  It's a lot like the love boat, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMZYq-4mOTI&t=49.879999999999995s)]
*  except Isaac is making Molotov cocktails. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMZYq-4mOTI&t=51.1s)]
*  Poor Isaac. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMZYq-4mOTI&t=56.74s)]
*  Yeah, so yeah, that'll work. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMZYq-4mOTI&t=57.7s)]
*  Because if there's one thing the IDF fears, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMZYq-4mOTI&t=59.26s)]
*  it's a humorless Scandinavian with a bowl cut [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMZYq-4mOTI&t=61.5s)]
*  and crazy eyes. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMZYq-4mOTI&t=64.02s)]
*  Then again, she might be the only person [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMZYq-4mOTI&t=65.9s)]
*  to unite the region, you know, against Greta Thunberg. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMZYq-4mOTI&t=67.22s)]
*  Hell, her presence might even get Hamas to kill themselves. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMZYq-4mOTI&t=71.06s)]
*  But for those of you who once put this loon on a pedestal, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMZYq-4mOTI&t=75.12s)]
*  who cried at her UN speeches, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMZYq-4mOTI&t=77.7s)]
*  who reposted her dramatic Instagram videos, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMZYq-4mOTI&t=79.92s)]
*  well, you got suckered. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMZYq-4mOTI&t=83.28s)]
*  You fell for it harder than Joe Biden on a flight of stairs. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMZYq-4mOTI&t=84.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMZYq-4mOTI&t=89.26s)]
*  Turns out she really is a mentally unwell theater kid [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMZYq-4mOTI&t=91.94000000000001s)]
*  with a deep need for validation. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMZYq-4mOTI&t=94.74000000000001s)]
*  She went from being the mascot for climate alarmism [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMZYq-4mOTI&t=96.74000000000001s)]
*  to the poster child for Gaza Virtue Signaling, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMZYq-4mOTI&t=99.5s)]
*  with God knows what in between. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMZYq-4mOTI&t=102.52000000000001s)]
*  You know, why couldn't she just do [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMZYq-4mOTI&t=104.30000000000001s)]
*  what an American teenage girl does, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMZYq-4mOTI&t=105.46000000000001s)]
*  who needs attention, and date a black guy? [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMZYq-4mOTI&t=107.54s)]
*  All right, let's do it. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMZYq-4mOTI&t=110.26s)]
*  Say. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMZYq-4mOTI&t=111.72s)]
*  It happens. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMZYq-4mOTI&t=114.42s)]
*  It does. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMZYq-4mOTI&t=115.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMZYq-4mOTI&t=116.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMZYq-4mOTI&t=117.54s)]
*  Ridiculous. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMZYq-4mOTI&t=118.36s)]
*  Ha ha ha ha. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMZYq-4mOTI&t=119.2s)]
*  But she's the perfect shill, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMZYq-4mOTI&t=120.2s)]
*  loud, resentful, and spoiled by the culture she hates. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMZYq-4mOTI&t=122.08s)]
*  But if you called out her BS, all the left went nuts. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMZYq-4mOTI&t=126.36s)]
*  You monster, she's just a child. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMZYq-4mOTI&t=129.04s)]
*  They act like you barged into a Shriners hospital [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMZYq-4mOTI&t=131.4s)]
*  and made the kids do keg stands. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMZYq-4mOTI&t=133.88s)]
*  But Greta is really just a hood ornament [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMZYq-4mOTI&t=137.24s)]
*  for a generation of screwed up libs. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMZYq-4mOTI&t=138.96s)]
*  One study from 2022 shows that just 20% of them [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMZYq-4mOTI&t=141.36s)]
*  say they have excellent mental health. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMZYq-4mOTI&t=145.14s)]
*  45% say they have poor mental health. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMZYq-4mOTI&t=147.48s)]
*  No wonder they look up to Greta. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMZYq-4mOTI&t=150.2s)]
*  Crazy adores crazy. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMZYq-4mOTI&t=151.92s)]
*  That's why Kanye West has a Larry Kudlow tattoo. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMZYq-4mOTI&t=154.12s)]
*  But it's the promiscuity of activism [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMZYq-4mOTI&t=159.96s)]
*  that reveals the narcissism behind it. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMZYq-4mOTI&t=162.56s)]
*  It shows that your beliefs are as shallow [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMZYq-4mOTI&t=165.44s)]
*  as your need for attention. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMZYq-4mOTI&t=167.32s)]
*  It's never been about the issue, it's about her, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMZYq-4mOTI&t=169.12s)]
*  and what does she gain from it? [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMZYq-4mOTI&t=171.36s)]
*  Magazine covers, awards, travel perks, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMZYq-4mOTI&t=173.2s)]
*  and outstanding ovations from jet setting elites. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMZYq-4mOTI&t=176.04s)]
*  Usually to get that many goodies with no skills, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMZYq-4mOTI&t=179.28s)]
*  you need the last name, Biden. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMZYq-4mOTI&t=181.95999999999998s)]
*  She's a scammer who gamed the system [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMZYq-4mOTI&t=185.32s)]
*  by exploiting the elite's addiction to easy virtue. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMZYq-4mOTI&t=187.72s)]
*  Salute her sanctimony and it rubs off on you. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMZYq-4mOTI&t=191.54s)]
*  So now she's off to Gaz Gaza, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMZYq-4mOTI&t=194.84s)]
*  and what of her hometown, Sweden? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMZYq-4mOTI&t=197.32s)]
*  The formerly safe country [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMZYq-4mOTI&t=199.72s)]
*  that's now one of Europe's most violent, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMZYq-4mOTI&t=201.28s)]
*  thanks to an influx of migrants [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMZYq-4mOTI&t=203.2s)]
*  who have more in common with Hamas than they do ABBA. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMZYq-4mOTI&t=204.92s)]
*  Of course, she won't change anything, [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMZYq-4mOTI&t=209.6s)]
*  but the media will call her brave. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMZYq-4mOTI&t=210.89999999999998s)]
*  For like them, she's an affluent white female liberal [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMZYq-4mOTI&t=212.95999999999998s)]
*  and awful, which means people like her [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMZYq-4mOTI&t=216.07999999999998s)]
*  never really go away. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMZYq-4mOTI&t=218.51999999999998s)]
*  As long as our pathetic media rewards theatrical outrage, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMZYq-4mOTI&t=220.72s)]
*  you'll always have ego-mad actors [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMZYq-4mOTI&t=223.67999999999998s)]
*  flocking to it like moths to a flame. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMZYq-4mOTI&t=225.48s)]
*  And if you think that's bad, or you think she's bad, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMZYq-4mOTI&t=228.23999999999998s)]
*  just wait, we're churning out Gretas on every campus [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMZYq-4mOTI&t=231.11999999999998s)]
*  incentivizing their unhinged self-importance with attention. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMZYq-4mOTI&t=234.68s)]
*  One month it's climate, next it's Gaza, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMZYq-4mOTI&t=238.68s)]
*  then it's Elon back to Gaza and orgy for the offended. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMZYq-4mOTI&t=241.12s)]
*  So when Greta finally docks and the cameras start rolling, [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMZYq-4mOTI&t=245.1s)]
*  just remember, this isn't about peace, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMZYq-4mOTI&t=247.8s)]
*  it's about performance. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMZYq-4mOTI&t=249.86s)]
*  The Palestinians are just bit players [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMZYq-4mOTI&t=251.56s)]
*  in Greta's movie about herself. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMZYq-4mOTI&t=253.44s)]
*  Just like every single activist at Columbia or Harvard, [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMZYq-4mOTI&t=255.86s)]
*  activism is their drug. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMZYq-4mOTI&t=259.44s)]
*  They do a lot of damage to others [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMZYq-4mOTI&t=261.5s)]
*  to make themselves feel good. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMZYq-4mOTI&t=263.28s)]
*  Let's welcome our tonight's guest. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMZYq-4mOTI&t=265.96s)]
*  When he says he had a great night's sleep, [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMZYq-4mOTI&t=268.5s)]
*  he's referring to the great he slept on. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMZYq-4mOTI&t=273.88s)]
*  Studio TSC.com, Michael Loftus. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMZYq-4mOTI&t=277.08s)]
*  He used to wrestle as Kane and now drives liberals insane. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMZYq-4mOTI&t=282.11999999999995s)]
*  Mayor of Knox County, Tennessee, Glenn Jacobs. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMZYq-4mOTI&t=286.2s)]
*  She exposed teens to Bush, the band and the president. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMZYq-4mOTI&t=293.44s)]
*  Host them, Kennedy Saves the World podcast, Kennedy. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMZYq-4mOTI&t=297.84s)]
*  And that's not a five person sleeping bag, [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMZYq-4mOTI&t=304.2s)]
*  it's one of his gloves. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMZYq-4mOTI&t=307.28s)]
*  New York Times bestselling author, comedian [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMZYq-4mOTI&t=308.84s)]
*  and former NWA world champion, Tyrus. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMZYq-4mOTI&t=310.28s)]
*  Michael, as someone with severe mental issues, [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMZYq-4mOTI&t=312.34s)]
*  are you surprised that nearly half of libs [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMZYq-4mOTI&t=323.58s)]
*  also have poor mental health? [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMZYq-4mOTI&t=326.03999999999996s)]
*  What? [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMZYq-4mOTI&t=329.78s)]
*  No, let him go, it's fine. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMZYq-4mOTI&t=330.62s)]
*  I'm surprised that that many had it together [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMZYq-4mOTI&t=334.78s)]
*  long enough to answer the questions on the survey [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMZYq-4mOTI&t=338.1s)]
*  because a truly crazy person, they'll just start, you know, [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMZYq-4mOTI&t=342.94s)]

*  Yes. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMZYq-4mOTI&t=350.46000000000004s)]
*  How are the beans there? [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMZYq-4mOTI&t=351.78000000000003s)]
*  They're delightful. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMZYq-4mOTI&t=353.1s)]
*  Room temperature, bring your own opener. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMZYq-4mOTI&t=354.5s)]
*  Yes. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMZYq-4mOTI&t=357.02000000000004s)]
*  I think that's what Greta Thunberg is gonna sneak into Gaza. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMZYq-4mOTI&t=359.5s)]

*  Yes. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMZYq-4mOTI&t=389.26000000000005s)]

*  I'm not a military expert, [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMZYq-4mOTI&t=402.9s)]
*  but maybe you don't do a press conference [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMZYq-4mOTI&t=404.7s)]
*  about your secret mission. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMZYq-4mOTI&t=406.94s)]
*  We're gonna get on a sailboat [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMZYq-4mOTI&t=410.18s)]
*  with five cans of how dare you stew. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMZYq-4mOTI&t=411.66s)]
*  So glad. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMZYq-4mOTI&t=416.62s)]

*  It seems like it's more about her. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMZYq-4mOTI&t=421.22s)]
*  Well, I certainly hope she gets there in a hurry, [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMZYq-4mOTI&t=423.3s)]
*  her little raft, [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMZYq-4mOTI&t=425.18s)]
*  before global warming causes the oceans to rise [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMZYq-4mOTI&t=426.66s)]
*  and the whole thing's flooded anyway. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMZYq-4mOTI&t=430.22s)]
*  So yeah, obviously she is a attention seeking young lady [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMZYq-4mOTI&t=432.66s)]
*  who has some issues and shame on the media and the left [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMZYq-4mOTI&t=438.66s)]
*  for exploiting that for their outrage of the month. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMZYq-4mOTI&t=442.74s)]
*  These are serious issues [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMZYq-4mOTI&t=446.94s)]
*  no matter where you come down on them. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMZYq-4mOTI&t=448.34000000000003s)]
*  They're serious issues and they deserve to be treated [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMZYq-4mOTI&t=450.26s)]
*  with adult discussions, [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMZYq-4mOTI&t=453.54s)]
*  not like gossip at a pajama party. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMZYq-4mOTI&t=455.06s)]
*  Yeah, you know, it is like mutually beneficial to both. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMZYq-4mOTI&t=457.3s)]
*  The media gets the story, she gets the attention. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMZYq-4mOTI&t=460.58000000000004s)]

*  You know that, but that's like Kennedy, huh? [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMZYq-4mOTI&t=465.1s)]
*  So I lived through the nineties, Greg. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMZYq-4mOTI&t=467.66s)]
*  You don't have to tell me about working each other. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMZYq-4mOTI&t=469.82000000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMZYq-4mOTI&t=472.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMZYq-4mOTI&t=473.06s)]
*  Warren G and Kurt Loder, [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMZYq-4mOTI&t=475.42s)]

*  Yes, we would have. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMZYq-4mOTI&t=485.14s)]
*  Isn't it she kind of just, [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMZYq-4mOTI&t=486.41999999999996s)]
*  didn't like the rest of the campus just catch up with her? [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMZYq-4mOTI&t=488.09999999999997s)]
*  Yes, and they're all awful and annoying and sick [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMZYq-4mOTI&t=490.85999999999996s)]
*  and they've made college almost completely worthless. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMZYq-4mOTI&t=494.5s)]
*  Unless you're going to a big state school in the South, [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMZYq-4mOTI&t=497.65999999999997s)]
*  you know, or parts of the Midwest, [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMZYq-4mOTI&t=501.7s)]
*  it is totally a worthless experience [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMZYq-4mOTI&t=503.65999999999997s)]
*  because of virtue signals like her. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMZYq-4mOTI&t=507.17999999999995s)]
*  And it is, you are absolutely right. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMZYq-4mOTI&t=510.26s)]
*  It is a mental illness, [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMZYq-4mOTI&t=512.42s)]
*  but the problem is they don't want to get better. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMZYq-4mOTI&t=513.62s)]
*  And they also cheapen actual mental illness [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMZYq-4mOTI&t=516.3s)]
*  and people who suffer with maladies [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMZYq-4mOTI&t=519.3399999999999s)]
*  that they are trying desperately to treat and to overcome, [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMZYq-4mOTI&t=522.2199999999999s)]
*  they don't want to overcome. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMZYq-4mOTI&t=525.38s)]
*  I mean, this is an entire generation of people [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMZYq-4mOTI&t=526.6999999999999s)]
*  who just want to talk about their feelings [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMZYq-4mOTI&t=528.74s)]
*  and their grievances until they metastasize [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMZYq-4mOTI&t=530.9399999999999s)]
*  into this pint-sized narcissist [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMZYq-4mOTI&t=534.5s)]
*  who made the mistake of watching Emily in Paris [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMZYq-4mOTI&t=536.9399999999999s)]
*  and cut herself bangs. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMZYq-4mOTI&t=539.42s)]
*  I know. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMZYq-4mOTI&t=541.0999999999999s)]
*  She's going to be the greatest disservant here. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMZYq-4mOTI&t=541.94s)]
*  Awful. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMZYq-4mOTI&t=544.0200000000001s)]
*  But I love how she wants to crush Zionism. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMZYq-4mOTI&t=544.86s)]
*  It's like, I'm surprised she's not doing [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMZYq-4mOTI&t=551.86s)]
*  the Cory Booker Nazi salute with language like that. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMZYq-4mOTI&t=554.2600000000001s)]
*  That's so true. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMZYq-4mOTI&t=557.1s)]
*  Tyrus, it is funny how the media just basically [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMZYq-4mOTI&t=559.22s)]
*  doesn't care that she might be being exploited [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMZYq-4mOTI&t=563.1800000000001s)]
*  or that she's quote neurodivergent. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMZYq-4mOTI&t=565.58s)]
*  They don't care until you criticize her, [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMZYq-4mOTI&t=567.62s)]
*  then they bring it up. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMZYq-4mOTI&t=570.0600000000001s)]
*  Well, I always, whenever I see child actors [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMZYq-4mOTI&t=571.3399999999999s)]
*  that go awry, I always wonder about the parents. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMZYq-4mOTI&t=574.8199999999999s)]
*  So I wonder how much money her parents made [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMZYq-4mOTI&t=579.42s)]
*  at the expense of their child. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMZYq-4mOTI&t=581.02s)]
*  And it's also weird, I don't know if it's a thing [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMZYq-4mOTI&t=582.06s)]
*  with being like, let's be fair, she wasn't like a cutie. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMZYq-4mOTI&t=585.18s)]

*  I'm just being real. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMZYq-4mOTI&t=593.74s)]
*  If you have a cute daughter and she cries, [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMZYq-4mOTI&t=595.5s)]
*  you melt as a father. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMZYq-4mOTI&t=598.54s)]
*  When you have one that's, you're kinda like suck it up. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMZYq-4mOTI&t=600.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMZYq-4mOTI&t=603.2199999999999s)]

*  and they all seem to end up kinda looking [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMZYq-4mOTI&t=625.54s)]
*  like a caring-ish person. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMZYq-4mOTI&t=627.62s)]
*  With the bangs, I wasn't even, maybe she transitioned. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMZYq-4mOTI&t=630.02s)]
*  Maybe it should be sir. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMZYq-4mOTI&t=632.82s)]

*  You have a boner for her. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMZYq-4mOTI&t=664.3s)]
*  I happen to think that she's an intriguing individual. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMZYq-4mOTI&t=665.86s)]
*  You always talk about her speeches are riveting [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMZYq-4mOTI&t=673.58s)]
*  and you would love to sit down and have dialogue. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMZYq-4mOTI&t=675.78s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMZYq-4mOTI&t=677.62s)]
