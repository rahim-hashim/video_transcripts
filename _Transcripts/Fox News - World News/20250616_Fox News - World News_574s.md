# 8 killed, dozens hurt in new Iranian attacks on Israel
**Fox News - World News:** [June 16, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJ_WhDt2hnk)
*  You're looking live at Tel Aviv, Israel, where at least eight people were killed and dozens [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJ_WhDt2hnk&t=0.0s)]
*  were injured in an early morning missile attack from Iran. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJ_WhDt2hnk&t=5.88s)]
*  In just four days of fighting, Iran has launched over 300 missiles towards the Jewish state. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJ_WhDt2hnk&t=9.76s)]
*  Many of them have targeted major civilian areas. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJ_WhDt2hnk&t=14.8s)]
*  We know a five-year-old was lost. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJ_WhDt2hnk&t=18.080000000000002s)]
*  There was a Holocaust survivor targeting civilian areas. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJ_WhDt2hnk&t=19.8s)]
*  Let that sink in. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJ_WhDt2hnk&t=24.04s)]
*  Now dramatic video captured the moment of impact in Tel Aviv just this morning. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJ_WhDt2hnk&t=25.72s)]
*  Well, hello everyone. This is Outnumbered. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJ_WhDt2hnk&t=51.2s)]
*  I'm Kaylee McAdeney here with my co-hosts Emily Campagno and Harris Faulkner. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJ_WhDt2hnk&t=52.64s)]
*  Also joining us, Nicole Parker, Fox News contributor and former FBI special agent, and Jeremy Hunt, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJ_WhDt2hnk&t=56.96s)]
*  veterans on duty chairman and former Army intelligence captain. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJ_WhDt2hnk&t=62.44s)]
*  But first, let's go live to Mike Tobin, who's in Tel Aviv. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJ_WhDt2hnk&t=67.32s)]
*  What's going on, Mike? [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJ_WhDt2hnk&t=70.52s)]
*  Well, Kaylee, I can tell you that Tel Aviv, usually a bustling city, is relatively quiet [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJ_WhDt2hnk&t=71.52s)]
*  right now as most people are electing to stay home close to their bomb shelters in anticipation [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJ_WhDt2hnk&t=76.96000000000001s)]
*  of another evening of ballistic missile attacks from Iran. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJ_WhDt2hnk&t=82.2s)]
*  As you mentioned, eight people were killed by the most recent attacks here in Israel. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJ_WhDt2hnk&t=85.80000000000001s)]
*  Hundreds have been injured and rescuers are still on the scene of some of the strike sites [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJ_WhDt2hnk&t=91.48s)]
*  combing through the rubble with the potential of finding survivors trapped in the rubble. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJ_WhDt2hnk&t=95.32000000000001s)]
*  Now the damage from the strikes includes the U.S. consulate just a short distance from [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJ_WhDt2hnk&t=100.68s)]
*  where I am here in Tel Aviv. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJ_WhDt2hnk&t=104.76s)]
*  The U.S. ambassador, Mike Huckabee, says the damage to the consulate was minor, no personnel [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJ_WhDt2hnk&t=106.84s)]
*  were injured. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJ_WhDt2hnk&t=111.56s)]
*  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu toured the Tal Naf air base in central Israel. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJ_WhDt2hnk&t=112.44s)]
*  He boasted to troops that Israel has destroyed Iran's air defenses and fighter jets can [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJ_WhDt2hnk&t=117.64s)]
*  operate at will from Western Iran to Tehran. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJ_WhDt2hnk&t=122.44s)]
*  The Israeli Air Force controls the skies over Tehran. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJ_WhDt2hnk&t=125.56s)]
*  This changes the entire campaign. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJ_WhDt2hnk&t=131.8s)]
*  We are on the way to achieving our two goals, eliminating the nuclear threat [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJ_WhDt2hnk&t=134.44s)]
*  and eliminating the missile threat. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJ_WhDt2hnk&t=139.48s)]
*  of Iran's missile launchers and their missile launching capability. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJ_WhDt2hnk&t=169.48s)]
*  Kayleigh? [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJ_WhDt2hnk&t=173.32s)]
*  Thank you, Mike. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJ_WhDt2hnk&t=174.6s)]
*  Keep us updated. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJ_WhDt2hnk&t=175.16s)]
*  Now President Trump is revealing where exactly the United States stands in the conflict [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJ_WhDt2hnk&t=177.16s)]
*  between Israel and Iran. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJ_WhDt2hnk&t=181.79999999999998s)]
*  During an interview with ABC News, Trump reiterated that the U.S. is not currently involved, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJ_WhDt2hnk&t=183.88s)]
*  but he did say, quote, it's possible we could get involved. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJ_WhDt2hnk&t=189.23999999999998s)]
*  President Trump was asked about that reporting last hour and some additional reporting that [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJ_WhDt2hnk&t=193.23999999999998s)]
*  came from the Wall Street Journal. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJ_WhDt2hnk&t=198.04s)]
*  Here's what he said. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJ_WhDt2hnk&t=199.23999999999998s)]
*  What would it take for the U.S. to get involved in this conflict militarily? [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJ_WhDt2hnk&t=201.56s)]
*  I don't want to talk about that. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJ_WhDt2hnk&t=206.35999999999999s)]
*  Intelligence support are you providing Israel? [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJ_WhDt2hnk&t=210.04s)]
*  We've always supported Israel. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJ_WhDt2hnk&t=213.79999999999998s)]
*  We have for a long period of time, strongly, and Israel is doing very well right now. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJ_WhDt2hnk&t=215.48s)]
*  Meanwhile, U.S. officials are telling Fox News that President Trump blocked an Israeli [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJ_WhDt2hnk&t=221.95999999999998s)]
*  plan to assassinate Iran's supreme leader despite Iran's repeated attempts to assassinate [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJ_WhDt2hnk&t=226.20000000000002s)]
*  President Trump in just the past year. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJ_WhDt2hnk&t=232.36s)]
*  Now Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu claims President Trump is Iran's top target [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJ_WhDt2hnk&t=235.32s)]
*  in the world. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJ_WhDt2hnk&t=240.36s)]
*  Here's what he told Bret Baer on special reports. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJ_WhDt2hnk&t=241.4s)]
*  You just said Iran tried to assassinate President Trump twice. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJ_WhDt2hnk&t=244.68s)]
*  Do you have intel that the assassination attempts on President Trump were directly from Iran? [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJ_WhDt2hnk&t=249.32s)]
*  Yes, through proxies. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJ_WhDt2hnk&t=253.96s)]
*  Through their intel, yes. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJ_WhDt2hnk&t=257.08s)]
*  They want to kill him. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJ_WhDt2hnk&t=258.2s)]
*  Look, he's enemy number one. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJ_WhDt2hnk&t=259.24s)]
*  He killed Qassem Soleimani. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJ_WhDt2hnk&t=260.6s)]
*  He made it very clear, including now, you cannot have a nuclear weapon, which means [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJ_WhDt2hnk&t=262.76s)]
*  you cannot enrich. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJ_WhDt2hnk&t=267.16s)]
*  He's been very forceful. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJ_WhDt2hnk&t=268.36s)]
*  So for them, he's enemy number one. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJ_WhDt2hnk&t=269.4s)]
*  So Jeremy, I want to lay out where we are. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJ_WhDt2hnk&t=274.52s)]
*  Last night, there were some U.S. assets that all began moving east. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJ_WhDt2hnk&t=276.36s)]
*  I was closely tracking them on these national security accounts. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJ_WhDt2hnk&t=280.04s)]
*  There's been a ton of reporting that has come out. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJ_WhDt2hnk&t=283.72s)]
*  And we can now confirm this is Liz Frieden, our producer. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJ_WhDt2hnk&t=285.8s)]
*  The U.S. Air Force is moving a large number of refueling tanker aircrafts to Europe. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJ_WhDt2hnk&t=288.6s)]
*  In order to be closer to the Middle East, a U.S. official confirmed this to Fox News. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJ_WhDt2hnk&t=293.24s)]
*  This will provide—this is key. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJ_WhDt2hnk&t=297.88s)]
*  This was being reported by Reuters. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJ_WhDt2hnk&t=299.8s)]
*  Now we can confirm more options for President Trump. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJ_WhDt2hnk&t=301.48s)]
*  A lot of people asking what those options are could be supporting Israel defensively, [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJ_WhDt2hnk&t=305.64s)]
*  could be something greater. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJ_WhDt2hnk&t=310.92s)]
*  I want to pull up a picture of Fordow. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJ_WhDt2hnk&t=312.12s)]
*  This is the nuclear site that's been much discussed. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJ_WhDt2hnk&t=313.88s)]
*  Those nuclear weapons buried about a half mile down. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJ_WhDt2hnk&t=316.44s)]
*  Israel lacks the capability to take them out without U.S. bunker busters. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJ_WhDt2hnk&t=319.64s)]
*  So the question is, is this among the options? [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJ_WhDt2hnk&t=324.6s)]
*  Perhaps. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJ_WhDt2hnk&t=327.8s)]
*  And I think it's great how President Trump is laying out all the options there. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJ_WhDt2hnk&t=328.28000000000003s)]
*  So we have freedom to decide how we want to—how—what involvement looks like. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJ_WhDt2hnk&t=332.28000000000003s)]
*  I'll say this. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJ_WhDt2hnk&t=336.44s)]
*  Israel is doing a great service for the United States. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJ_WhDt2hnk&t=337.4s)]
*  Without question. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJ_WhDt2hnk&t=339.72s)]
*  Iran is the leading state sponsor of terrorism. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJ_WhDt2hnk&t=341.4s)]
*  They export their radical ideology all around the world. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJ_WhDt2hnk&t=343.4s)]
*  They have their proxies that have attacked American troops. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJ_WhDt2hnk&t=345.96s)]
*  They chant death to America. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJ_WhDt2hnk&t=350.28s)]
*  They've had apparently assassination attempts on President Trump's life. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJ_WhDt2hnk&t=351.79999999999995s)]
*  I mean, they hate us. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJ_WhDt2hnk&t=354.91999999999996s)]
*  They hate what we stand for. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJ_WhDt2hnk&t=356.2s)]
*  And so for Israel to be in a position where they're weakening that regime, [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJ_WhDt2hnk&t=357.4s)]
*  this is a good day for America. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJ_WhDt2hnk&t=361.15999999999997s)]
*  And so I think it's important that President Trump is looking at all those options. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJ_WhDt2hnk&t=362.67999999999995s)]
*  Look, I'll say, just as an intel officer, it is remarkable what Israel has done. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJ_WhDt2hnk&t=365.56s)]
*  You look at the drone facility that they had within the border of Iran, [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJ_WhDt2hnk&t=370.68s)]
*  and were able to unleash all these drones to attack Iran's air defense assets. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJ_WhDt2hnk&t=374.92s)]
*  Truly, it took years to do that. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJ_WhDt2hnk&t=381.32s)]
*  Very similar to what we saw in Ukraine, for example, [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJ_WhDt2hnk&t=383.15999999999997s)]
*  where Ukraine used the same kind of idea where this operation had drones all in Russia, [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJ_WhDt2hnk&t=385.88s)]
*  literally attacking their assets. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJ_WhDt2hnk&t=391.48s)]
*  This is a remarkable feat. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJ_WhDt2hnk&t=393.56s)]
*  And I think Israel should be applauded for that, [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJ_WhDt2hnk&t=395.24s)]
*  and America should support in a way that is best for our interests. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJ_WhDt2hnk&t=397.0s)]
*  And I think there's a clear case to be made there. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJ_WhDt2hnk&t=400.36s)]
*  And about an hour and a half ago, the Wall Street Journal reported this. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJ_WhDt2hnk&t=402.12s)]
*  A battered Iran signals it wants to de-escalate hostilities with Israel and negotiate. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJ_WhDt2hnk&t=405.88s)]
*  Messages passed by Tehran through intermediaries seek a return to talks [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJ_WhDt2hnk&t=411.32s)]
*  if the U.S. stays out of the fight. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJ_WhDt2hnk&t=416.44s)]
*  It bears mentioning they were given 60 days to negotiate. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJ_WhDt2hnk&t=419.40000000000003s)]
*  They didn't do that. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJ_WhDt2hnk&t=422.68s)]
*  Some would argue they've been given decades to negotiate. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJ_WhDt2hnk&t=423.64s)]
*  Instead, they shouted, death to America. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJ_WhDt2hnk&t=426.04s)]
*  During the Faulkner focus, President Trump was asked directly about that report. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJ_WhDt2hnk&t=428.52000000000004s)]
*  Let's listen to what he said. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJ_WhDt2hnk&t=431.72s)]
*  Hey, Harris, we don't have it, but I do have it written here. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJ_WhDt2hnk&t=437.56s)]
*  They like to talk, but they should have done that before. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJ_WhDt2hnk&t=439.8s)]
*  They should have done that before. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJ_WhDt2hnk&t=443.08000000000004s)]
*  They should have spoken immediately. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJ_WhDt2hnk&t=444.36s)]
*  But at the back end, he said, they should speak with us now. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJ_WhDt2hnk&t=445.72s)]
*  Yeah. He said, look, they had 60 days. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJ_WhDt2hnk&t=449.08000000000004s)]
*  I waited until the 60th day to pull that. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJ_WhDt2hnk&t=451.40000000000003s)]
*  And he did say, now is the time, because they're out of time at this point. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJ_WhDt2hnk&t=454.91999999999996s)]
*  He said, Iran is not winning this war. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJ_WhDt2hnk&t=459.96s)]
*  And you were asking before about what our involvement could look like. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJ_WhDt2hnk&t=462.68s)]
*  We're already involved with intelligence. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJ_WhDt2hnk&t=466.44s)]
*  I mean, he's talked about it. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJ_WhDt2hnk&t=468.44s)]
*  Others have talked about it. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJ_WhDt2hnk&t=469.64s)]
*  But the aspect of us going in, the president was asked about in that news conference. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJ_WhDt2hnk&t=471.79999999999995s)]
*  He said, uh-uh, I'm not going to talk about that right now. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJ_WhDt2hnk&t=477.32s)]
*  And we might have gotten more from him had the Canadian Prime Minister, [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJ_WhDt2hnk&t=479.4s)]
*  Mark Carney, not thought that it was his birthday today and that he could get away [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJ_WhDt2hnk&t=483.16s)]
*  with cutting off the president of the United States with every reporter asking about that [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJ_WhDt2hnk&t=486.44s)]
*  situation and him making world news. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJ_WhDt2hnk&t=490.28000000000003s)]
*  So he might have gone on about this. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJ_WhDt2hnk&t=492.52000000000004s)]
*  He did mention an Iranian friend who has not come out to help, and that's Putin. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJ_WhDt2hnk&t=494.76000000000005s)]
*  And he said, oh, it would have been good to have a G8 with perhaps Putin back in there. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJ_WhDt2hnk&t=499.88s)]
*  Well, I'm thinking big picture. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJ_WhDt2hnk&t=504.84000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, you could have talked with him about potentially being part of an equation at this point, [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJ_WhDt2hnk&t=506.04s)]
*  because you're looking for all players. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJ_WhDt2hnk&t=510.92s)]
*  I don't think Putin's going to help Iran any other way unless it's at a table. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJ_WhDt2hnk&t=512.76s)]
*  Certainly not going to fight for them. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJ_WhDt2hnk&t=516.28s)]
*  He doesn't even fight for his own people. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJ_WhDt2hnk&t=517.4799999999999s)]
*  No, he does not. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJ_WhDt2hnk&t=519.16s)]
*  Of that we know. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJ_WhDt2hnk&t=520.04s)]
*  All right, well, we're getting stunning new video. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJ_WhDt2hnk&t=521.0799999999999s)]
*  Iran's state media was live on air. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJ_WhDt2hnk&t=522.8399999999999s)]
*  You won't believe this. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJ_WhDt2hnk&t=525.4799999999999s)]
*  I couldn't believe it when I watched it. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJ_WhDt2hnk&t=526.28s)]
*  Live on air. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJ_WhDt2hnk&t=528.28s)]
*  This is Iranian state media. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJ_WhDt2hnk&t=528.8399999999999s)]
*  And then Israel hits. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJ_WhDt2hnk&t=530.92s)]
*  Watch this. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJ_WhDt2hnk&t=532.1999999999999s)]
*  I mean, Emily, if you didn't think Iran was on their heels, apparently they are. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJ_WhDt2hnk&t=543.4s)]
*  A terrifyingly visceral clip to watch, right? [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJ_WhDt2hnk&t=551.7199999999999s)]
*  And especially, look, that's a human that we're watching there. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJ_WhDt2hnk&t=555.0799999999999s)]
*  But the reality is a lot of humans in Iran are being suffocated and held at the hands [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJ_WhDt2hnk&t=557.7199999999999s)]
*  of the Islamic Republic. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJ_WhDt2hnk&t=562.52s)]
