# 'RIGHT CALL': Trump receives support from Republicans after striking Iran
**Fox News - World News:** [June 22, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxCiixISZi0)
*  We're here to break down reactions from the White House and globally. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxCiixISZi0&t=0.0s)]
*  Let's bring in Fox News correspondent, Chandley Painter. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxCiixISZi0&t=3.68s)]
*  Chandley? [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxCiixISZi0&t=7.5200000000000005s)]
*  Historic moment. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxCiixISZi0&t=10.78s)]
*  President Trump took to the podium just hours ago to address the nation, touting the U.S. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxCiixISZi0&t=11.78s)]
*  bombing of three Iranian nuclear sites as a quote, very successful strike and a turning [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxCiixISZi0&t=15.76s)]
*  point in the conflict, saying Iran must now make peace. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxCiixISZi0&t=20.92s)]
*  There's no military in the world that could have done what we did tonight, not even close. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxCiixISZi0&t=26.08s)]
*  There has never been a military that could do what took place just a little while ago. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxCiixISZi0&t=30.72s)]
*  We are also seeing mixed reactions from leaders across the globe and here at home who are [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxCiixISZi0&t=36.879999999999995s)]
*  now speaking out as they weigh the impact of these strikes. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxCiixISZi0&t=41.54s)]
*  First, at the United Nations, the secretary general of the U.N. quickly condemned the [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxCiixISZi0&t=45.08s)]
*  attack and urged diplomacy, saying this quote, this is a dangerous escalation in a region [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxCiixISZi0&t=50.08s)]
*  already on the edge and a direct threat to international peace and security. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxCiixISZi0&t=55.48s)]
*  Likewise, officials from several Latin American countries like Venezuela, Cuba and Mexico [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxCiixISZi0&t=60.599999999999994s)]
*  have also condemned the operation. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxCiixISZi0&t=65.36s)]
*  While here at home, key Republican leaders in Washington, like House Speaker Mike Johnson, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxCiixISZi0&t=68.03999999999999s)]
*  Senators Tim Scott, Lindsey Graham, Ted Cruz, all backing Trump's military action. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxCiixISZi0&t=72.88s)]
*  Senator Graham posting this in part, quote, this was the right call. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxCiixISZi0&t=78.28s)]
*  The regime deserves it. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxCiixISZi0&t=81.72s)]
*  We have the best air force in the world. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxCiixISZi0&t=83.4s)]
*  Senator Cruz reacted with this in part, quote, the prospect of the Iranian regime acquiring [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxCiixISZi0&t=86.16000000000001s)]
*  nuclear weapons represents the most acute immediate threat to America and our allies. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxCiixISZi0&t=90.66000000000001s)]
*  When the Ayatollah chants death to America, he means it. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxCiixISZi0&t=96.06s)]
*  Now on the other side of the aisle, as you can imagine, some Democrats are saying the [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxCiixISZi0&t=99.44s)]
*  U.S. strikes in Iran are unconstitutional, including House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxCiixISZi0&t=102.56s)]
*  posting in part, quote, President Trump misled the country about his intentions, failed to [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxCiixISZi0&t=107.4s)]
*  seek congressional authorization for the use of military force. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxCiixISZi0&t=112.42s)]
*  And Congresswoman Alexandria Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez reacted with this. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxCiixISZi0&t=117.14s)]
*  The president's disastrous decision to bomb Iran without authorization is a grave violation [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxCiixISZi0&t=122.22s)]
*  of the Constitution and congressional war powers. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxCiixISZi0&t=127.34s)]
*  He has impulsively risked launching a war that may ensnare us for generations. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxCiixISZi0&t=130.1s)]
*  She says it is absolutely and clearly grounds for impeachment. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxCiixISZi0&t=135.7s)]
*  It's also being reported that some countries like South Korea are actually convening emergency [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxCiixISZi0&t=139.34s)]
*  meetings to assess the broader implications and how Iran is starting to retaliate. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxCiixISZi0&t=143.1s)]
*  Benjamin. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxCiixISZi0&t=149.02s)]
*  Yeah, Chandli, thank you very much. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxCiixISZi0&t=150.02s)]
*  Keep us updated to how other countries respond. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxCiixISZi0&t=152.7s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxCiixISZi0&t=155.1s)]
