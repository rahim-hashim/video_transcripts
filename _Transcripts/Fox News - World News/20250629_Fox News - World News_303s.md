# A look at the ‘number of cards’ Trump hasn’t played against Iran
**Fox News - World News:** [June 29, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ihF6OLvsGY)
*  How will you know if he tries to start things up again? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ihF6OLvsGY&t=0.0s)]
*  Because Iran just said that they are halting cooperation with the U.N. nuclear watchdog. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ihF6OLvsGY&t=4.32s)]
*  The last thing they're going to be doing right now, for a period of time at least, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ihF6OLvsGY&t=10.76s)]
*  is nuclear. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ihF6OLvsGY&t=14.040000000000001s)]
*  They've had it. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ihF6OLvsGY&t=15.040000000000001s)]
*  They've been trying it for 25 years. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ihF6OLvsGY&t=16.56s)]
*  The last thing they're going to do is nuclear. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ihF6OLvsGY&t=18.82s)]
*  We had to hit them, though. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ihF6OLvsGY&t=20.6s)]
*  They were close to getting a nuclear bomb. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ihF6OLvsGY&t=21.6s)]
*  President Trump warns that more strikes on Iran are possible if intelligence suggests [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ihF6OLvsGY&t=24.72s)]
*  Tehran resumes its nuclear program. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ihF6OLvsGY&t=29.64s)]
*  Meanwhile, the president's nominee to lead central command is warning about the lingering [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ihF6OLvsGY&t=32.32s)]
*  threats from Iran's proxy groups. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ihF6OLvsGY&t=37.04s)]
*  I would agree that proxies are significantly degraded, particularly Hamas and Hezbollah. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ihF6OLvsGY&t=40.76s)]
*  If confirmed, it would be a priority of mine to deter conflict through both the deterrence [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ihF6OLvsGY&t=47.0s)]
*  of Iran and those proxies. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ihF6OLvsGY&t=51.4s)]
*  I think we're going to have to continue to watch them very closely. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ihF6OLvsGY&t=53.04s)]
*  Of those two proxies have been degraded, we still have the Iranian-aligned militia [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ihF6OLvsGY&t=56.12s)]
*  groups that are out there, as well as the Houthis, currently in a ceasefire with us. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ihF6OLvsGY&t=60.08s)]
*  Let's bring in Jim Hanson, U.S. Army Special Forces veteran. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ihF6OLvsGY&t=66.72s)]
*  Jim, how convinced are you that the strikes of a week ago on the Iranian nuclear sites, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ihF6OLvsGY&t=70.67999999999999s)]
*  that those strikes were effective? [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ihF6OLvsGY&t=77.24s)]
*  I think the strikes were effective in degrading the Iranian nuclear program, the actual operational [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ihF6OLvsGY&t=80.52s)]
*  part of it to rubble and tons of rubble on top of it. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ihF6OLvsGY&t=86.16000000000001s)]
*  The problem is the knowledge still exists and the will still exists. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ihF6OLvsGY&t=91.0s)]
*  And we're not dealing with rational actors in the Islamic Republic. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ihF6OLvsGY&t=95.4s)]
*  They're kind of an apocalyptic death cult sect of Islam. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ihF6OLvsGY&t=99.12s)]
*  So I don't think we can expect them to react in the way you would expect someone else to. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ihF6OLvsGY&t=103.08000000000001s)]
*  And now President Trump has to deal with a situation where we want to deter them from [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ihF6OLvsGY&t=107.80000000000001s)]
*  continuing that. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ihF6OLvsGY&t=112.84s)]
*  The advantage he has is he's now shown he's willing to use the full might and power of [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ihF6OLvsGY&t=114.36s)]
*  the United States to accomplish it if they go ahead and push back. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ihF6OLvsGY&t=118.55999999999999s)]
*  You say the knowledge is there, but Israel took out something like nine of the top nuclear [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ihF6OLvsGY&t=122.47999999999999s)]
*  scientists in Iran before the attacks. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ihF6OLvsGY&t=127.44s)]
*  That has to decimate the ability that they have to rebuild, doesn't it? [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ihF6OLvsGY&t=131.79999999999998s)]
*  Oh, absolutely. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ihF6OLvsGY&t=137.04s)]
*  And that's one of the good, you know, the advantages the Israelis' considerable intelligence [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ihF6OLvsGY&t=138.35999999999999s)]
*  into the program was. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ihF6OLvsGY&t=143.04s)]
*  They knew where the scientists were. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ihF6OLvsGY&t=144.51999999999998s)]
*  They knew where the IRGC generals were and they knew where the facilities were. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ihF6OLvsGY&t=146.0s)]
*  So that has made it much more difficult from a technical scientific perspective. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ihF6OLvsGY&t=150.56s)]
*  Again, the will and the interest because they used that nuclear program to elevate what [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ihF6OLvsGY&t=155.28s)]
*  is a normal power towards an aspirational nuclear power, which put them higher on the [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ihF6OLvsGY&t=161.64s)]
*  global food chain. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ihF6OLvsGY&t=167.64s)]
*  So now they no longer have that. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ihF6OLvsGY&t=169.16s)]
*  And that puts them at a disadvantage in trying to throw their weight around in the region. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ihF6OLvsGY&t=171.20000000000002s)]
*  But unless we or the IAEA or somebody can get in there and look at what remains inside [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ihF6OLvsGY&t=175.32s)]
*  of Fordow, how are we ever going to know how much damage was actually done to this program? [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ihF6OLvsGY&t=182.36s)]
*  I think that's the next challenge President Trump and the international community faces. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ihF6OLvsGY&t=189.64000000000001s)]
*  The Iranians have to allow someone in there to both look at the damage to what was there [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ihF6OLvsGY&t=194.08s)]
*  and take account for the nuclear material that may still exist and any pieces of their [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ihF6OLvsGY&t=199.8s)]
*  program that still exist. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ihF6OLvsGY&t=204.72s)]
*  If they don't do that, President Trump can go back to maximum pressure. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ihF6OLvsGY&t=206.36s)]
*  And he has a number of cards he hasn't played in that regard. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ihF6OLvsGY&t=210.68s)]
*  He could pull them from the international banking system. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ihF6OLvsGY&t=213.24s)]
*  He could shut down their ports. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ihF6OLvsGY&t=215.84s)]
*  He could do a number of things before he even has to get back to threatening to bomb some [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ihF6OLvsGY&t=217.48000000000002s)]
*  of their other facilities. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ihF6OLvsGY&t=221.32s)]
*  The Iranian people, obviously, are suffering under this Ayatollah-led government. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ihF6OLvsGY&t=224.28s)]
*  What do you think are the chances that they rise up and force some kind of a change? [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ihF6OLvsGY&t=232.8s)]
*  Right now we haven't seen that much in the way of protests and active uprising against [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ihF6OLvsGY&t=240.04000000000002s)]
*  the government. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ihF6OLvsGY&t=245.20000000000002s)]
*  But what this has done, it has shaken to the core the indomitable belief of the people [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ihF6OLvsGY&t=246.20000000000002s)]
*  that the tyrants in Tehran controlled that country. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ihF6OLvsGY&t=252.12s)]
*  So it's been undercut. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ihF6OLvsGY&t=255.88s)]
*  And I think slowly you're going to see the Iranian people decide that maybe they want [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ihF6OLvsGY&t=257.56s)]
*  a better way of life. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ihF6OLvsGY&t=262.4s)]
*  And that requires a government that doesn't want to spend all their resources and all [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ihF6OLvsGY&t=263.8s)]
*  their energy towards a goal of becoming a nuclear power and maybe wants to build a better [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ihF6OLvsGY&t=268.15999999999997s)]
*  life for them. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ihF6OLvsGY&t=274.36s)]
*  So I think long term, and this may be even medium term, that government is in grave danger [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ihF6OLvsGY&t=275.36s)]
*  of being taken down from inside. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ihF6OLvsGY&t=280.96000000000004s)]
*  All right. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ihF6OLvsGY&t=283.36s)]
*  Jim Hansen, a U.S. Army Special Forces veteran. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ihF6OLvsGY&t=284.36s)]
*  Jim, thank you. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ihF6OLvsGY&t=287.04s)]
*  Good to be with you. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ihF6OLvsGY&t=290.04s)]
