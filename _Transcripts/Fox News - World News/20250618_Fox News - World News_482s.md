# Iran's supreme leader fires back after Trump's threat: 'The battle begins'
**Fox News - World News:** [June 18, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1JP4THN20E)
*  first. Let's go right to Mike Tobin with the latest on the ground in Tel Aviv, Mike. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1JP4THN20E&t=0.0s)]
*  Hey there, Todd. The Iranian ballistic missile attacks continued here in central Israel [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1JP4THN20E&t=6.6000000000000005s)]
*  overnight. There were two separate attacks that came just after midnight local time that [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1JP4THN20E&t=11.44s)]
*  caused people here in Tel Aviv in particular to scramble for the bomb shelters. The [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1JP4THN20E&t=17.12s)]
*  missile defense systems did their jobs. Multiple explosions in the skies over [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1JP4THN20E&t=20.48s)]
*  Tel Aviv. Several missiles did reach the ground. A parking lot was hit. No reports [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1JP4THN20E&t=24.16s)]
*  of injuries. Israeli warplanes were active last night. The idea says some 50 fighter jets took [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1JP4THN20E&t=28.32s)]
*  to the air and hit some 20 targets in Iran overnight. The targets include sites that [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1JP4THN20E&t=33.84s)]
*  produce raw materials and components for missiles. Israel sent warnings into southwest [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1JP4THN20E&t=38.24s)]
*  Tehran for people to evacuate before targets were struck there. We've struck deep, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1JP4THN20E&t=43.120000000000005s)]
*  hitting Iran's nuclear ballistic and command capabilities. The Iranian regime has spent [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1JP4THN20E&t=49.760000000000005s)]
*  years getting closer to a nuclear weapon. They have spent billions building a ballistic missile [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1JP4THN20E&t=56.08s)]
*  program. Our mission is clear, to remove the threat at its source. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1JP4THN20E&t=61.28s)]
*  The U.S. embassy in Jerusalem announced it is closing during this stage of the conflict. This [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1JP4THN20E&t=70.4s)]
*  follows damage to the U.S. consulate in Tel Aviv caused by a missile impact. No injuries resulting [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1JP4THN20E&t=75.28s)]
*  from that. It is also in step with most of the businesses in Israel, closing while the missile [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1JP4THN20E&t=80.24000000000001s)]
*  attacks continue. President Trump and Iran's leader traded shots over social media. President [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1JP4THN20E&t=85.2s)]
*  Trump posting unconditional surrender, implying that is meant for the Grand Ayatollah. Khamenei, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1JP4THN20E&t=91.28s)]
*  for his part, posted the battle begins six days into this stage of the conflict. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1JP4THN20E&t=96.88s)]
*  Mike, for so long, Iran has used its terror proxies, Hezbollah and the Houthis, to do their [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1JP4THN20E&t=103.68s)]
*  dirty work. Have those groups said anything about jumping into this and helping Iran out now? [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1JP4THN20E&t=109.36s)]
*  Well, the Houthis have fired several missiles in the direction of Israel at this point. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1JP4THN20E&t=117.2s)]
*  We have out of Lebanon words, certainly that the president, Joseph Aoun, is encouraging Hezbollah [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1JP4THN20E&t=122.32s)]
*  to stay out of the fight. Keep in mind that Hezbollah has been badly weakened since this war began [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1JP4THN20E&t=128.96s)]
*  following October 7th. The people of Lebanon have endured now 4,000 people who have been killed [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1JP4THN20E&t=135.6s)]
*  during this stage of the conflict and $11 billion in damage. So you can see why Lebanon's [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1JP4THN20E&t=142.07999999999998s)]
*  president is encouraging Hezbollah to stay out of it. Yeah, what a difference a pager attack makes. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1JP4THN20E&t=147.35999999999999s)]
*  Mike Tobin live for us in Tel Aviv. Mike, thank you so much. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1JP4THN20E&t=152.56s)]
*  Let's go now to former Assistant Secretary of State Brian Hook. Brian, good morning to you. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1JP4THN20E&t=156.64s)]
*  Thank you so much for joining us. What options do President Trump have on the table right now? [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1JP4THN20E&t=159.84s)]
*  Well, I think the president's chief focus, based on what he said, is the diplomatic track, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1JP4THN20E&t=166.07999999999998s)]
*  which he has been pursuing with Steve Witkoff after many rounds of talks with the Iranian regime [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1JP4THN20E&t=172.07999999999998s)]
*  to try to reach a diplomatic solution to this urgent problem of Iran's nuclear program. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1JP4THN20E&t=178.56s)]
*  But the Iranians have been playing cat and mouse diplomacy for quite some time now, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1JP4THN20E&t=184.72s)]
*  and I think patience is wearing thin with this sort of tactic, which is a hallmark of the [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1JP4THN20E&t=189.92s)]
*  Iranian regime. As President Trump said in the first term, Iran has never won a war [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1JP4THN20E&t=195.12s)]
*  and never lost a negotiation. This is what Iran is good at. But I think after all these rounds of [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1JP4THN20E&t=201.20000000000002s)]
*  inconclusive talk and Israel being so successful at degrading Iran's nuclear and military [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1JP4THN20E&t=207.6s)]
*  capabilities, the United States now has to take a serious look at what to do to strengthen [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1JP4THN20E&t=214.96s)]
*  the diplomatic track through the military option. Okay, let's pick it up there. The [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1JP4THN20E&t=222.64s)]
*  prevailing wisdom is that there would not be boots on the ground in any Iranian war. Assuming you [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1JP4THN20E&t=227.51999999999998s)]
*  agree with that, as President Trump makes this calculus as to whether or not we're going to join [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1JP4THN20E&t=234.39999999999998s)]
*  this war or not and how we would join it, what are the cons to joining if American boots would [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1JP4THN20E&t=239.51999999999998s)]
*  not be on the ground and presumably if our first salvo in joining this war is the bunker buster bomb? [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1JP4THN20E&t=245.76000000000002s)]
*  Well, the president has a good group of people around him advising him on a range of options. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1JP4THN20E&t=256.32s)]
*  So far, America's involvement in this conflict has been on the defensive side, [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1JP4THN20E&t=261.84000000000003s)]
*  helping Israel defend itself from the Iranian missile attacks that were described earlier. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1JP4THN20E&t=268.64s)]
*  And so I think now the president clearly giving an option for the Iranian leader to come [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1JP4THN20E&t=275.76s)]
*  and sort this out peacefully. There are a range of offensive options that I think are before the [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1JP4THN20E&t=283.68s)]
*  president, and he's weighing those, you know, based on circumstances on the ground. But that can [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1JP4THN20E&t=291.52s)]
*  confuse that can be helping with refueling missions. It can involve joint strikes with the Israelis, [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1JP4THN20E&t=296.32s)]
*  and it also can involve an American bomber taking out the nuclear facility in Iran, [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1JP4THN20E&t=303.44s)]
*  which is the most significant of all of the nuclear facilities in Fordow. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1JP4THN20E&t=310.88s)]
*  Yeah. And, Brian, if the Iranian nuclear threat is eliminated, [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1JP4THN20E&t=315.92s)]
*  what message does that send to Vladimir Putin and Xi Jinping? [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1JP4THN20E&t=320.0s)]
*  I think it strengthens President Trump's hand globally in other conflicts. If [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1JP4THN20E&t=325.84s)]
*  if he is successful, either through a peaceful route, which I think is the preferred route, [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1JP4THN20E&t=333.2s)]
*  or something more kinetic, if he were to be successful in taking out this decades-long [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1JP4THN20E&t=338.8s)]
*  problem of the Iranian nuclear program, I do think it would strengthen his hand globally. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1JP4THN20E&t=345.36s)]
*  Obviously, this is enormously complicated, the sort of the factors and the decisions that are [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1JP4THN20E&t=351.04s)]
*  before the president. But Iran now has enough enriched uranium for many nuclear weapons, [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1JP4THN20E&t=356.56s)]
*  and so it is becoming a mounting threat that Israel has done a terrific job at degrading, [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1JP4THN20E&t=364.32s)]
*  but is not yet eliminated. If Iran finally realizes that it is losing, but still refuses to [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1JP4THN20E&t=370.96s)]
*  surrender unconditionally, as Donald Trump has asked, what's the worst it could do at this point? [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1JP4THN20E&t=379.04s)]
*  In other words, if it wanted to go out in a blaze of glory. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1JP4THN20E&t=386.15999999999997s)]
*  I think that option set is shrinking. Iran has the largest missile inventory of any country [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1JP4THN20E&t=391.68s)]
*  in the Middle East, but Israel has taken out so many of its missile launchers. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1JP4THN20E&t=398.4s)]
*  And there's this huge imbalance that Iran, it was a vulnerability that the Israelis have exploited [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1JP4THN20E&t=405.03999999999996s)]
*  with the Iranian regime, that they have more missiles than they have launchers. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1JP4THN20E&t=410.16s)]
*  It's quite a lopsided ratio. Israel has now taken out anywhere between a third and a half [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1JP4THN20E&t=416.08000000000004s)]
*  of these missile launchers. And as you've seen, night after night, the number of strikes conducted [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1JP4THN20E&t=422.32000000000005s)]
*  by Iran has gone down fairly dramatically. And this has allowed Israel to achieve dominance [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1JP4THN20E&t=427.12s)]
*  over the skies of Iran, where they can fly as they wish. So that is a huge accomplishment. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1JP4THN20E&t=436.0s)]
*  Israel did in 72 hours what President Putin in Russia still has not done over three and a half [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1JP4THN20E&t=442.08000000000004s)]
*  years in Ukraine to achieve aerial dominance. So the conditions are much more favorable than [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1JP4THN20E&t=448.56s)]
*  they were just a few days ago. Yeah, and I'm hearing that the ease with which Israel was [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1JP4THN20E&t=454.56s)]
*  able to control Iranian airspace even surprised some officials within Israel. So it's 5 o' 8 [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1JP4THN20E&t=458.16s)]
*  in the morning on the East Coast. We will see what today brings for the region and the whole world. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1JP4THN20E&t=464.24s)]
