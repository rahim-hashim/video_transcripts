*  Good morning Mike. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxPMZ0F71YA&t=29.08s)]
*  Good morning Ainsley. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxPMZ0F71YA&t=30.08s)]
*  Now this is a nightly routine but people here in central Israel were sent running for the [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxPMZ0F71YA&t=32.32s)]
*  bomb shelters in the middle of the night with more Iranian ballistic missile attacks. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxPMZ0F71YA&t=35.839999999999996s)]
*  Two attacks came just after midnight local time. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxPMZ0F71YA&t=41.08s)]
*  The IDFs of some 30 launches of missiles were detected. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxPMZ0F71YA&t=44.36s)]
*  The missile defense systems did their job. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxPMZ0F71YA&t=47.32s)]
*  We heard multiple explosions in the sky over Tel Aviv. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxPMZ0F71YA&t=49.44s)]
*  The IDF says that several missiles did get through resulting in damage but no injury. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxPMZ0F71YA&t=52.04s)]
*  A remarkable video from the sky over Jerusalem as a ballistic missile re-enters the atmosphere [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxPMZ0F71YA&t=57.52s)]
*  creating a fireball in the sky. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxPMZ0F71YA&t=62.88s)]
*  The IDF says no injuries as a result of that missile either. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxPMZ0F71YA&t=65.12s)]
*  The IDF confirms one of the drones is down. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxPMZ0F71YA&t=69.32000000000001s)]
*  Iran claims to have shot it down. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxPMZ0F71YA&t=71.88s)]
*  Israel says no one was hurt and the wreckage of the drone will not provide an information [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxPMZ0F71YA&t=73.4s)]
*  breach to the Iranians. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxPMZ0F71YA&t=77.24000000000001s)]
*  Iran's supreme leader said a message over Iranian TV. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxPMZ0F71YA&t=79.60000000000001s)]
*  He refused President Trump's demand for unconditional surrender and threatened irreparable consequences [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxPMZ0F71YA&t=82.28s)]
*  if the US gets directly involved. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxPMZ0F71YA&t=88.24s)]
*  That was a threat echoed by a top Iranian diplomat. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxPMZ0F71YA&t=90.8s)]
*  We are totally ready to give appropriate response. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxPMZ0F71YA&t=95.72s)]
*  We will start responding to United States. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxPMZ0F71YA&t=102.4s)]
*  Israeli fighter jets were busy in the skies over Iran last night. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxPMZ0F71YA&t=108.76s)]
*  They hit five attack helicopters that were on the ground according to the IDF as well [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxPMZ0F71YA&t=112.08s)]
*  as hitting production sites and launchers for ballistic missiles. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxPMZ0F71YA&t=116.6s)]
*  Also hit some key nuclear enrichment sites on the ground in Tehran. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxPMZ0F71YA&t=120.48s)]
*  The Israeli Air Force now boasts air superiority over Iran saying that they have badly degraded [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxPMZ0F71YA&t=125.36s)]
*  the air defenses to such an extent they can fly over Iran without much risk of being shot [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxPMZ0F71YA&t=131.72s)]
*  down. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxPMZ0F71YA&t=136.32s)]
*  Guys, back to you. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxPMZ0F71YA&t=137.32s)]
*  So with the Ayatollah's statements, does that make one think that we should worry about [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxPMZ0F71YA&t=138.76s)]
*  our assets in the region, Michael? [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxPMZ0F71YA&t=145.51999999999998s)]
*  Well you do see some repositioning of the missile launchers from Iran, which is not [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxPMZ0F71YA&t=149.76s)]
*  entirely clear if they are repositioning to aim at US bases, say in Iraq or some other [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxPMZ0F71YA&t=156.28s)]
*  locations. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxPMZ0F71YA&t=162.56s)]
*  But clearly they are making those threats and US forces are on alert because of those [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxPMZ0F71YA&t=163.88s)]
*  threats. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxPMZ0F71YA&t=169.68s)]
*  Mike, where are those bases in the Middle East? [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxPMZ0F71YA&t=170.68s)]
*  Well you have bases in Iraq in particular, you have naval assets in the region, you have [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxPMZ0F71YA&t=175.48s)]
*  US forces that have been in Syria. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxPMZ0F71YA&t=179.79999999999998s)]
*  You have somewhat around 40,000 troops that are based in the region here in Ainsley. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxPMZ0F71YA&t=183.0s)]
*  And then you got Qatar too. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxPMZ0F71YA&t=187.96s)]
*  Mike, just to be clear, the Supreme Leader hasn't offered any type of recommendation [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxPMZ0F71YA&t=189.48000000000002s)]
*  of peace or to get back to the negotiating table to try to convince the President that [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxPMZ0F71YA&t=195.68s)]
*  he doesn't want a nuclear weapon, right? [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxPMZ0F71YA&t=200.8s)]
*  Well you have heard some Iranian representatives say that they are interested in a return to [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxPMZ0F71YA&t=204.48000000000002s)]
*  the negotiating table, but the Supreme Leader, you get more of this bombastic type statements [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxPMZ0F71YA&t=208.48000000000002s)]
*  coming out of him. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxPMZ0F71YA&t=213.60000000000002s)]
*  Can you imagine the first time he leaves the country it will be in exile? [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxPMZ0F71YA&t=214.60000000000002s)]
*  There is talk that he could move to Russia. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxPMZ0F71YA&t=217.79999999999998s)]
*  Any word on that? [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxPMZ0F71YA&t=221.44s)]
*  No word on that. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxPMZ0F71YA&t=224.95999999999998s)]
*  Okay, go get him Mike, thanks. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxPMZ0F71YA&t=225.95999999999998s)]
*  Mike, you called him Michael earlier, what do you prefer, Mike or Michael? [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxPMZ0F71YA&t=227.92s)]
*  Michael, do you want to weigh in? [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxPMZ0F71YA&t=231.28s)]
*  I think I'm more of a Mike. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxPMZ0F71YA&t=233.6s)]
*  His mom is the only one allowed to call him Michael when he's in trouble. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxPMZ0F71YA&t=234.6s)]
*  Did not know that. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxPMZ0F71YA&t=239.6s)]
*  Thanks Mike so much. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxPMZ0F71YA&t=240.6s)]
*  Thank you Mike. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxPMZ0F71YA&t=241.6s)]
*  I'm going to handle this in the break. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxPMZ0F71YA&t=242.6s)]
*  Just shocked me when you said it. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxPMZ0F71YA&t=245.6s)]
*  It was on my brain too. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxPMZ0F71YA&t=246.6s)]
*  Yeah, we share everything with you, the audience. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxPMZ0F71YA&t=247.6s)]
*  There's nothing you don't know. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxPMZ0F71YA&t=250.28s)]
*  We're pretty open. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxPMZ0F71YA&t=251.28s)]
*  We're pretty open. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxPMZ0F71YA&t=252.28s)]
*  Alright, now to another alert. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxPMZ0F71YA&t=253.28s)]
*  The Trump administration is weighing options about how to respond to this growing conflict [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxPMZ0F71YA&t=254.68s)]
*  and this is expected to come up at the Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's Senate hearing in [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxPMZ0F71YA&t=259.6s)]
*  just over an hour. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxPMZ0F71YA&t=265.2s)]
*  Peter Ducey is live at the White House with all the details for us. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxPMZ0F71YA&t=266.96s)]
*  Hey Peter. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxPMZ0F71YA&t=269.4s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxPMZ0F71YA&t=270.4s)]
*  The Ayatollah is saying that he's not going to surrender even though President Trump has [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxPMZ0F71YA&t=271.4s)]
*  stated that the Pentagon has him and it's crosshairs. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxPMZ0F71YA&t=275.4s)]
*  The president says, we know exactly where the so-called supreme leader is hiding. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxPMZ0F71YA&t=278.44s)]
*  He is an easy target, but it's safe there. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxPMZ0F71YA&t=282.59999999999997s)]
*  We are not going to take him out, kill, at least not for now. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxPMZ0F71YA&t=285.03999999999996s)]
*  But we don't want missiles shot at civilians or American soldiers. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxPMZ0F71YA&t=288.32s)]
*  Our patience is wearing thin. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxPMZ0F71YA&t=291.47999999999996s)]
*  Thank you for your attention to this matter. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxPMZ0F71YA&t=293.12s)]
*  President Trump could order American forces to join the Israeli fight against Iran within [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxPMZ0F71YA&t=295.59999999999997s)]
*  the next 24 to 48 hours according to a report by ABC News. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxPMZ0F71YA&t=299.15999999999997s)]
*  President Trump had a call with Bibi Netanyahu after a classified situation room meeting [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxPMZ0F71YA&t=303.66s)]
*  about next steps and the Vice President, J.D. Vance, has a message for people who can't [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxPMZ0F71YA&t=308.02000000000004s)]
*  believe President Trump would even think about joining this war. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxPMZ0F71YA&t=313.1s)]
*  He is saying, I wanted to address some things directly on the Iran issue. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxPMZ0F71YA&t=315.86s)]
*  First, POTUS has been amazingly consistent over 10 years that Iran cannot have a nuclear [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxPMZ0F71YA&t=319.82000000000005s)]
*  weapon. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxPMZ0F71YA&t=325.34000000000003s)]
*  Second, I've seen a lot of confusion over the issue of civilian nuclear power and uranium [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxPMZ0F71YA&t=326.34000000000003s)]
*  enrichment. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxPMZ0F71YA&t=330.18s)]
*  These are distinct issues. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxPMZ0F71YA&t=331.18s)]
*  Iran could have had civilian nuclear power without enrichment, but Iran rejected that. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxPMZ0F71YA&t=333.06s)]
*  And of course, people are right to be worried about foreign entanglement after the last [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxPMZ0F71YA&t=338.58s)]
*  25 years of idiotic foreign policy. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxPMZ0F71YA&t=341.94s)]
*  There is a bulletin crossing the wires right now that says, this is citing Russian state [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxPMZ0F71YA&t=345.7s)]
*  news that Vladimir Putin reiterates his readiness to mediate between Iran and Israel. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxPMZ0F71YA&t=350.58s)]
*  We know the Iranians have been backchanneling to the U.S. that they do want to talk soon. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxPMZ0F71YA&t=357.08s)]
*  We don't yet know if President Trump would bless Vladimir Putin as the peacemaker. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxPMZ0F71YA&t=362.2s)]
*  Back to you. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxPMZ0F71YA&t=367.47999999999996s)]
*  One of the problems, Peter, is that the Israeli-Russia relationship has really soured when weapons [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxPMZ0F71YA&t=368.47999999999996s)]
*  turned up with Hamas and Hezbollah in those systems, and they were not a supporter during [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxPMZ0F71YA&t=374.36s)]
*  this conflict since October 7th. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxPMZ0F71YA&t=379.96s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxPMZ0F71YA&t=383.4s)]
*  And the rest of the world does not look at Vladimir Putin as somebody who can bring peace. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxPMZ0F71YA&t=384.48s)]
*  They look at him as an aggressor who started a war in Ukraine and won't end it, even though [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxPMZ0F71YA&t=390.28s)]
*  President Trump has been trying to get him to end it for the last 150 days or so. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxPMZ0F71YA&t=394.56s)]
*  And so it's very, very difficult. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxPMZ0F71YA&t=398.52s)]
*  It doesn't, it almost seems like that's too easy and that this is going to be something [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxPMZ0F71YA&t=401.71999999999997s)]
*  where third parties, fourth parties, Middle Eastern partners are the ones who are negotiating [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxPMZ0F71YA&t=406.46s)]
*  this to end it, no matter what happens. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxPMZ0F71YA&t=411.97999999999996s)]
*  My favorite part about this whole thing, Peter, is that the president of, President Putin [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxPMZ0F71YA&t=414.76000000000005s)]
*  offered to the president to help negotiate this, to be a part of, and the president was [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxPMZ0F71YA&t=420.6s)]
*  like, don't you have another war that you should be doing peace yourself? [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxPMZ0F71YA&t=424.52000000000004s)]

*  Matthew Wiz. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxPMZ0F71YA&t=459.6s)]
*  Buckley joins us now. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxPMZ0F71YA&t=460.6s)]
*  Matt, great to see you. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxPMZ0F71YA&t=462.24s)]
*  Your thoughts about what our role should be to take out Fordo. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxPMZ0F71YA&t=464.12s)]
*  Well, good morning, Brian. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxPMZ0F71YA&t=468.92s)]
*  Thank you for having me. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxPMZ0F71YA&t=471.84000000000003s)]
*  This is literally a once in a lifetime opportunity. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxPMZ0F71YA&t=472.84000000000003s)]
*  I am not a big fan of forever wars, Iraq, Afghanistan, some of our other skirmishes, [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxPMZ0F71YA&t=475.24s)]
*  but this is literally a once in a lifetime opportunity. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxPMZ0F71YA&t=481.38s)]
*  In Iraq and Afghanistan, we didn't have an ally that went in and completely decimated [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxPMZ0F71YA&t=484.64s)]
*  the enemy and softened up the battlefield. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxPMZ0F71YA&t=490.32s)]
*  Iran is blind right now. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxPMZ0F71YA&t=494.03999999999996s)]
*  They have no integrated air defense system. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxPMZ0F71YA&t=495.03999999999996s)]
*  All of their sites are more or less open. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxPMZ0F71YA&t=498.11999999999995s)]
*  And Israel has absolute air dominance. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxPMZ0F71YA&t=501.0s)]
*  So if the president chooses, this is a once in a lifetime opportunity to potentially change [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxPMZ0F71YA&t=503.59999999999997s)]
*  the course of history. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxPMZ0F71YA&t=508.79999999999995s)]
*  You're a Navy fighter pilot, unlike the Air Force fighter pilot that would fly the B-2s [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxPMZ0F71YA&t=509.79999999999995s)]
*  or the B-52 or the C-130. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxPMZ0F71YA&t=514.6s)]
*  Do you believe that this could be a mission that could be completed and Fordo could be [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxPMZ0F71YA&t=517.52s)]
*  destroyed from what you know the Bunker Buster and Busters can do? [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxPMZ0F71YA&t=521.8s)]
*  100%, Brian, this is exactly what this weapon was designed for, to penetrate deep into the [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxPMZ0F71YA&t=527.1999999999999s)]
*  ground. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxPMZ0F71YA&t=535.12s)]
*  Not to get too technical, but these bombs have different types of fuses and sensors [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxPMZ0F71YA&t=536.12s)]
*  on them to literally go through different layers, whether it's ground or concrete. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxPMZ0F71YA&t=541.12s)]
*  You just kind of program that into the weapon. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxPMZ0F71YA&t=545.72s)]
*  And once it reaches its designed or what you said into that bomb, it's going to explode. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxPMZ0F71YA&t=548.08s)]
*  So fairly certain the Israelis have done a decent job of softening up that target, opening [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxPMZ0F71YA&t=553.44s)]
*  up maybe a little bit of a hole for this for this Moab to come in. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxPMZ0F71YA&t=558.84s)]
*  How many do you think we'll need? [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxPMZ0F71YA&t=562.84s)]
*  Don't want to get too much into that. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxPMZ0F71YA&t=566.44s)]
*  Let's just say these will get the job done. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxPMZ0F71YA&t=568.16s)]
*  The current chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Raisin Kane, he's an old buddy [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxPMZ0F71YA&t=574.8s)]
*  of mine. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxPMZ0F71YA&t=579.64s)]
*  One of the reasons President Trump really liked General Kane is because during his first [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxPMZ0F71YA&t=580.64s)]
*  term he employed one of these massive weapons to take out a mountain of bad guys in Afghanistan. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxPMZ0F71YA&t=585.12s)]
*  Trump kind of said, well, why haven't we done this up to this point? [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxPMZ0F71YA&t=593.12s)]
*  I think Raisin kind of just shrugged his shoulders and looked at some of the higher ranking folks. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxPMZ0F71YA&t=597.6s)]
*  So one of the reasons I think General Kane is in place today is because he has the skill [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxPMZ0F71YA&t=601.4s)]
*  set and the wherewithal to potentially employ these weapons if the president decides to [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxPMZ0F71YA&t=605.88s)]
*  do so. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxPMZ0F71YA&t=611.52s)]
*  And the president doesn't want to cease fire. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxPMZ0F71YA&t=612.52s)]
*  He wants a surrender. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxPMZ0F71YA&t=613.68s)]
*  So let me ask you something. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxPMZ0F71YA&t=615.68s)]
*  People watching at home go, well, you know, what is our problem with Iran? [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxPMZ0F71YA&t=617.0s)]
*  Maybe we just don't understand the culture. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxPMZ0F71YA&t=620.32s)]
*  Do you have a different perspective? [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxPMZ0F71YA&t=623.6800000000001s)]
*  These folks really need to study their history a little bit better. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxPMZ0F71YA&t=627.72s)]
*  I was a teenager when they killed 241 U.S. Marines. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxPMZ0F71YA&t=630.48s)]
*  Along the way they attacked the Qobar Towers in Saudi Arabia, I believe, and 19 airmen [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxPMZ0F71YA&t=637.5600000000001s)]
*  And then as much as 608 Marines and soldiers were killed by Iranians during operations [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxPMZ0F71YA&t=644.72s)]
*  in Iraq. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxPMZ0F71YA&t=653.72s)]
*  I don't know what further justification you would need. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxPMZ0F71YA&t=654.72s)]
*  You would need they have killed our Marines. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxPMZ0F71YA&t=657.64s)]
*  They've killed our soldiers for decades and we've never laid a glove on them. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxPMZ0F71YA&t=660.16s)]
*  And Iran has put, you told the Taliban, we'll give you a thousand dollars for every American [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxPMZ0F71YA&t=665.16s)]
*  soldier you killed. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxPMZ0F71YA&t=669.48s)]
*  And 17% of all deaths in Iraq of American soldiers were directly at the hands of Iran, [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxPMZ0F71YA&t=671.32s)]
*  at minimum. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxPMZ0F71YA&t=678.84s)]
*  So I hear you. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxPMZ0F71YA&t=679.84s)]
*  They have been a problem. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxPMZ0F71YA&t=681.0s)]
*  And Israel is doing the Western world a favor and we could finish the job. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxPMZ0F71YA&t=682.88s)]
*  And I hope we choose to do it. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxPMZ0F71YA&t=687.24s)]
*  And thanks so much for your perspective. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxPMZ0F71YA&t=689.0s)]
*  I appreciate it. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxPMZ0F71YA&t=690.0s)]
