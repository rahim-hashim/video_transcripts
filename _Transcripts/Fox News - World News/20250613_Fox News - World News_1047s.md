# This looks like an 'all-out war' between Israel and Iran: Dan Hoffman
**Fox News - World News:** [June 13, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKuu20qlOcU)
*  We begin this morning with a Fox News alert. Overnight Israel launching sweeping strikes [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKuu20qlOcU&t=0.0s)]
*  against Iran, targeting its nuclear facilities, military sites and top commanders. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKuu20qlOcU&t=5.72s)]
*  Several Iranian military leaders and nuclear scientists believe to be dead and right now [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKuu20qlOcU&t=12.0s)]
*  Israel is beginning to intercept drones sent from Iran in retaliation. But Israel says [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKuu20qlOcU&t=16.28s)]
*  this is just the beginning of their operation. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKuu20qlOcU&t=22.28s)]
*  Israel will never allow those who call for our annihilation to develop the means to [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKuu20qlOcU&t=25.52s)]
*  achieve that goal. Tonight Israel backs those words with action. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKuu20qlOcU&t=30.52s)]
*  You are watching a special 4 a.m. edition of Fox and Friends First on this Friday morning. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKuu20qlOcU&t=36.56s)]
*  I'm Carly Schimditz. And I'm Todd Pairo. Alex Hogan, live in Israel, joins us now with [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKuu20qlOcU&t=40.980000000000004s)]
*  the very latest. Alex. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKuu20qlOcU&t=45.96s)]
*  Hi Carly and Todd. Israel says that it has identified as many as a hundred drones launched [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKuu20qlOcU&t=48.56s)]
*  by Iran heading toward Israeli airspace. And Israel says that it has started to at least [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKuu20qlOcU&t=54.72s)]
*  attempt to shoot down some of those drones over Syrian airspace as Jordan is attempting [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKuu20qlOcU&t=60.04s)]
*  to take down some of the drones that are above its airspace. At the same time, we just got [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKuu20qlOcU&t=65.64s)]
*  this new alert from Israel's Home Command urging people that they do not need to stay [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKuu20qlOcU&t=70.36s)]
*  as close to shelters as they had been in the previous hours, indicating that Israel and [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKuu20qlOcU&t=75.36s)]
*  the Israeli Defense Force believe at this point that they will be able to take out the [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKuu20qlOcU&t=79.96s)]
*  incoming threat as we await what could be these waves of drones sent over any time this [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKuu20qlOcU&t=84.72s)]
*  hour. All of this follows what happened earlier this morning when Israel says it targeted [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKuu20qlOcU&t=90.5s)]
*  the heart of Iran's nuclear capabilities in an operation it calls Rising Lion. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKuu20qlOcU&t=95.28s)]
*  The Jewish state refuses to be a victim of a nuclear holocaust perpetrated by the Iranian [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKuu20qlOcU&t=103.03999999999999s)]
*  regime. I've made it clear time and again, Israel will never allow those who call for [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKuu20qlOcU&t=108.92s)]
*  our annihilation to develop the means to achieve that goal. When someone comes to kill you, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKuu20qlOcU&t=114.68s)]
*  rise and act first. This is exactly what Israel has done today. We have risen like lions to [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKuu20qlOcU&t=120.44s)]
*  defend ourselves. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKuu20qlOcU&t=127.2s)]
*  Israel says it used more than 200 fighter jets to hit over 100 targets across Iran. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKuu20qlOcU&t=130.84s)]
*  In Iran, multiple explosions were heard near the Netan's nuclear power facility. There [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKuu20qlOcU&t=136.24s)]
*  are reports this morning that that center has been completely destroyed, although the [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKuu20qlOcU&t=140.62s)]
*  International Atomic Energy Agency says that there has been no increase in the radiation [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKuu20qlOcU&t=144.64000000000001s)]
*  levels at that facility. Fires broke out across Iran. Iranian state media today say that three [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKuu20qlOcU&t=149.26000000000002s)]
*  military commanders in the Iranian regime were killed. Six nuclear scientists were also [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKuu20qlOcU&t=154.44s)]
*  killed. And Washington quickly responding, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio saying, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKuu20qlOcU&t=159.46s)]
*  We are not involved in strikes against Iran and our top priority is protecting American [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKuu20qlOcU&t=164.96s)]
*  forces in the region. And President Trump also telling our Brett Bear, quote, Iran cannot [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKuu20qlOcU&t=169.92s)]
*  have a nuclear bomb and we are hoping to get back to the negotiation table. We will see [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKuu20qlOcU&t=175.36s)]
*  there are several people in leadership that will not be coming back. It was around three [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKuu20qlOcU&t=180.24s)]
*  a.m. this morning when sirens blared across Israel, waking up millions of people telling [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKuu20qlOcU&t=184.6s)]
*  them to get into shelters as quickly as possible. The defense minister quickly declared a special [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKuu20qlOcU&t=190.38s)]
*  state of emergency after this elaborate strike, again, anticipating that there would be this [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKuu20qlOcU&t=195.34s)]
*  Iranian attack. The idea is also mobilizing thousands of troops as well as reservists [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKuu20qlOcU&t=201.01999999999998s)]
*  because of this incoming strike that we are expecting. But there is, of course, that caution [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKuu20qlOcU&t=207.7s)]
*  that we are hearing from Home Front Command that people can stay a little bit further [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKuu20qlOcU&t=213.82s)]
*  away from shelters, not gathering in any public places. It is a weekend. Normally we would see [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKuu20qlOcU&t=218.22s)]
*  this area, Carly and Todd, packed with people. No one is here except for people who have been [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKuu20qlOcU&t=222.74s)]
*  going out to get groceries and stock up on water. Carly Todd. Getting all the essentials. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKuu20qlOcU&t=227.94s)]
*  And Alex, it is welcome news that you just reported that Israel does think that they can [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKuu20qlOcU&t=232.46s)]
*  take out those 100 drones that Iran launched towards Israel so that people can potentially [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKuu20qlOcU&t=236.26s)]
*  move about more freely than what they may have previously expected today. But the Israeli people, [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKuu20qlOcU&t=243.34s)]
*  Alex, as you know, they've been through so much this war in Gaza now over 600 days old. So now [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKuu20qlOcU&t=249.34s)]
*  that you're on the ground in Israel, what can you tell us about how this strike is being received [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKuu20qlOcU&t=256.62s)]
*  by the Israeli people? Well, this came as quite a shock. Of course, people who have lived here, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKuu20qlOcU&t=262.46s)]
*  people who are from here, they are used to going to the shelters. They are used to hearing the [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKuu20qlOcU&t=269.46s)]
*  sounds of sirens, getting those alerts that we receive on our phones, telling us exactly what is [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKuu20qlOcU&t=274.38s)]
*  happening and who is launching a strike, whether that is coming from Hamas, if it was Hezbollah [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKuu20qlOcU&t=279.97999999999996s)]
*  previously before the ceasefire up in the north or the Houthis in Yemen. When people went to the [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKuu20qlOcU&t=286.38s)]
*  shelters this morning, it wasn't until later that they received the notification from the government [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKuu20qlOcU&t=290.85999999999996s)]
*  that this was in fact in anticipation of an Iranian response after their preemptive strike. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKuu20qlOcU&t=295.82s)]
*  So there is a level of exhaustion that people are feeling after being at war for so long and now [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKuu20qlOcU&t=302.21999999999997s)]
*  seeing something potentially escalate. There's also the feeling at the same time among Israelis [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKuu20qlOcU&t=309.1s)]
*  that they believe that this needed to happen to prevent Iran from developing their nuclear [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKuu20qlOcU&t=314.62s)]
*  capabilities even further. Of course, this also comes at the same time as we were expecting to [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKuu20qlOcU&t=318.86s)]
*  see more negotiations take place. Of course, those will not be taking place in the same way [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKuu20qlOcU&t=323.34s)]
*  that there had been hopes that they would diplomatically. Of course, we expect to see [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKuu20qlOcU&t=328.21999999999997s)]
*  more conversations to try to bring people back to the negotiation table and bring down the [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKuu20qlOcU&t=333.5s)]
*  temperature here in the Middle East. Israel wouldn't have attacked if they didn't feel like [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKuu20qlOcU&t=338.53999999999996s)]
*  the time is now and that is why we are seeing the events unfolding as we did overnight. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKuu20qlOcU&t=342.21999999999997s)]
*  Alex Hogan live for us in Tel Aviv. Alex, thank you. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKuu20qlOcU&t=347.5s)]
*  Thanks. Let's bring in Fox News contributor and former CIA Station Chief Dan Hoffman. Dan, [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKuu20qlOcU&t=350.7s)]
*  it appears that the Intel that went into planning this seems to be on par with those pager strikes. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKuu20qlOcU&t=357.5s)]
*  In other words, very targeted, very specific. A lot of work went into it prior to the ultimate [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKuu20qlOcU&t=363.66s)]
*  strikes. What are you hearing from your sources in the Intel community as to how Israel pulled this off? [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKuu20qlOcU&t=369.58s)]
*  Now, it's an extraordinary intelligence success where Israel was able to fuse their intelligence [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKuu20qlOcU&t=375.5s)]
*  collection and operations on the ground with military operations to target Iran's nuclear [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKuu20qlOcU&t=382.53999999999996s)]
*  facilities, as well as the means that Iran would use to conduct retaliatory operations against [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKuu20qlOcU&t=388.62s)]
*  Israel. Again, this is what Israel is known for and the country wouldn't exist if they didn't [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKuu20qlOcU&t=394.7s)]
*  have this incredibly sophisticated intelligence capability. It's an extraordinary success [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKuu20qlOcU&t=400.54s)]
*  and it's an ongoing success. Israeli operatives are on the ground inside Iran conducting [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKuu20qlOcU&t=405.74s)]
*  covert operations even as we speak. What will the outcome, Dan, of this be? Will this end the evil [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKuu20qlOcU&t=411.02000000000004s)]
*  that is the Iranian revolution that started in 1979? Do you think that this could lead to regime [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKuu20qlOcU&t=416.46000000000004s)]
*  change or will when the dust settles, will the region remain largely the same? [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKuu20qlOcU&t=422.46000000000004s)]
*  Well, that's certainly a question that is worth asking. At this point, the other more immediate [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKuu20qlOcU&t=426.94s)]
*  questions are whether Israel has taken out enough of Iran's nuclear program. We've been tracking [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKuu20qlOcU&t=435.9s)]
*  Israeli strikes on Natanz as well as Iraq and potentially Isfahan, but it's Fordo, the underground [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKuu20qlOcU&t=441.66s)]
*  facility that I think we need to be focused on as well. I'm sure there will be questions in the [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKuu20qlOcU&t=450.14s)]
*  coming hours today about whether Israel has been able successfully to target that site. Doing so [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKuu20qlOcU&t=454.86s)]
*  through the air, very difficult, but Israel might have been using covert operations [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKuu20qlOcU&t=460.7s)]
*  as well. As for long-term regime change, it's certainly possible, but I think at this point, [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKuu20qlOcU&t=465.58000000000004s)]
*  we've got to be focused on what looks like an all-out war between these two countries. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKuu20qlOcU&t=472.14s)]
*  Yeah, and to that point, the IAEA says there's no increased radiation levels at the Natanz [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKuu20qlOcU&t=476.62s)]
*  nuclear site after Israel bombed it. Iranian authorities, though, Dan, have also informed the [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKuu20qlOcU&t=484.06s)]
*  IAEA that the country's Bushehr nuclear power plant hasn't been targeted. So with that in mind, [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKuu20qlOcU&t=489.74s)]
*  it does seem like there could potentially still be enriched uranium in Iran, and if that's the case, [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKuu20qlOcU&t=498.7s)]
*  what do they do with it? Yeah, the Bushehr facility is a civilian facility that the [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKuu20qlOcU&t=504.54s)]
*  Russians helped to build, and that is the question. Iran is in violation. The IAEA said [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKuu20qlOcU&t=513.82s)]
*  that Iran was in violation of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. They've got over 400 [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKuu20qlOcU&t=520.3000000000001s)]
*  kilograms of enriched uranium. No country would have that if they didn't want to develop a nuclear [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKuu20qlOcU&t=525.1s)]
*  program, and so that is going to be a key issue for Israel and for the international community writ [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKuu20qlOcU&t=529.6600000000001s)]
*  large to verify that Iran no longer has a nuclear capability, and that's what this war is all about [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKuu20qlOcU&t=535.9000000000001s)]
*  for Israel. Carly asked the question, or at least highlighted Alex Hogan speaking about the question [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKuu20qlOcU&t=543.26s)]
*  of why now? We've been talking about Iran potentially weaponizing a nuclear weapon for years now, [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKuu20qlOcU&t=547.98s)]
*  and based upon your sources in the intel community, because I know you're still really tapped into [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKuu20qlOcU&t=557.98s)]
*  these folks, was the worry, or can you presume that the worry was from Israel, that Iran did get [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKuu20qlOcU&t=563.26s)]
*  really close or acquired that capability to arm a nuclear weapon that could bring massive death [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKuu20qlOcU&t=571.26s)]
*  and destruction to Israel? Look, Iran is a nuclear threshold state, and so there's a confluence, [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKuu20qlOcU&t=578.38s)]
*  I think, of events here that we've seen. The United States gave Iran every opportunity to [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKuu20qlOcU&t=586.86s)]
*  negotiate a way out of this crisis. President Trump had said that he had a roughly two-month [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKuu20qlOcU&t=591.5s)]
*  deadline and negotiations had taken place, but it was quite clear that Iran was playing for time [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKuu20qlOcU&t=596.86s)]
*  and was defiantly opposing any real resolution to this growing crisis. The United States, [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKuu20qlOcU&t=602.62s)]
*  I think, was willing to eliminate the sanctions, the onerous sanctions that have crippled Iran's [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKuu20qlOcU&t=609.34s)]
*  economy in return for Iran giving up their nuclear program, and they never would do that. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKuu20qlOcU&t=614.78s)]
*  Simultaneously, Israel had taken out Iran's air defenses April a year ago and has decimated [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKuu20qlOcU&t=619.42s)]
*  Iran's proxy terrorists, which is a means for Iran to mount retaliatory operations, and so I think [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKuu20qlOcU&t=625.34s)]
*  Israel assessed that this was the last, last best chance to eliminate Iran's nuclear program. This [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKuu20qlOcU&t=631.02s)]
*  is not something that Israel wanted to do, but I don't think they felt like they had any other [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKuu20qlOcU&t=637.58s)]
*  choice, that this was an existential threat to Israel. And if you look at some of the strikes [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKuu20qlOcU&t=642.7800000000001s)]
*  that Israel has launched on Iran, it's not just against Iran's nuclear program, it's against their [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKuu20qlOcU&t=647.26s)]
*  missile capability, their nuclear scientists, as well as the head of the IRGC, Hossein Salami. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKuu20qlOcU&t=651.98s)]
*  These are, it's just an extraordinary wave of strikes designed to decimate Iran's, not just [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKuu20qlOcU&t=658.38s)]
*  their nuclear capability, but also their military writ large. Yeah, Benjamin Netanyahu said in his [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKuu20qlOcU&t=663.74s)]
*  address last night, imagine 10,000 tons of TNT landing on a country the size of New Jersey. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKuu20qlOcU&t=668.7s)]
*  This is an intolerable threat and it must be stopped, which is exactly what they're aiming [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKuu20qlOcU&t=673.9s)]
*  to do in this operation they've dubbed Operation Rising Lion that is expected to last for the next [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKuu20qlOcU&t=679.34s)]
*  two weeks. Dan, thank you so much for joining us this morning. Thanks, have a good morning. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKuu20qlOcU&t=684.3000000000001s)]
*  All right, let's bring in Chief Editor for the Middle East Forum, Jim Hanson. Jim, good morning [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKuu20qlOcU&t=690.46s)]
*  to you. What is your assessment of the success of this Israeli strike? [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKuu20qlOcU&t=694.7s)]
*  It's amazing from my perspective. I don't see how you can look at the amount of damage they've done, [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKuu20qlOcU&t=700.86s)]
*  the decapitation strikes to their military, taking out a lot of the air defenses so they can do [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKuu20qlOcU&t=707.3399999999999s)]
*  follow-on missions, and apparently no losses of aircraft or anything on their side. It's a long [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKuu20qlOcU&t=713.5799999999999s)]
*  way from a finished game, but this is one heck of a start for Israel to take out the most dangerous [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKuu20qlOcU&t=721.1s)]
*  enemy in that region. Jim, is the Ayatollah next on the target list to really facilitate regime change? [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKuu20qlOcU&t=727.74s)]
*  I think he has always been on the target list, and I'm sure they went at him last night. And [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKuu20qlOcU&t=733.82s)]
*  I don't know that he's been seen, so I'm sure if he's alive, he's hiding, he may be dead, [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKuu20qlOcU&t=741.58s)]
*  and he may be a follow-on target. I think what Israel needs to look at right now is how much [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKuu20qlOcU&t=747.0200000000001s)]
*  damage they've done, and they'll get a good look at that during the daylight hours now, [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKuu20qlOcU&t=752.62s)]
*  pick their next targets, and go ahead and ensure that whatever Iran does, it remains asymmetric. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKuu20qlOcU&t=756.78s)]
*  Iran's not an expeditionary military, so they can attack via what's left of their proxies after [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKuu20qlOcU&t=764.78s)]
*  Israel took out most of them, but there's not a lot they can do as far as rolling tanks or anything [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKuu20qlOcU&t=771.74s)]
*  like that. It'll be terrorist attacks, missile strikes, and drones. Yeah, the supreme leader [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKuu20qlOcU&t=776.9399999999999s)]
*  promising a harsh punishment for the attack, but again, we don't know if that came from [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKuu20qlOcU&t=781.34s)]
*  a proxy or somebody else writing that kind of statement. Yeah, and you know, I was wondering, [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKuu20qlOcU&t=785.34s)]
*  Jim, you know, we've seen a lot of, over the past few years, protests inside Iran, people inside [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKuu20qlOcU&t=788.5400000000001s)]
*  Iran who also want regime change. So how do you think the Iranian people right now are viewing [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKuu20qlOcU&t=796.0600000000001s)]
*  this strike that took out some military sites and military commanders as well? [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKuu20qlOcU&t=801.74s)]
*  The Iranian people do not like their leadership. The amount of support is less than 20 to 25% [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKuu20qlOcU&t=806.46s)]
*  for the regime. The rest of the Iranian people understand that the Islamic Republic, the ayatollahs [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKuu20qlOcU&t=816.46s)]
*  have left them behind the rest of the free world. So they wouldn't mind at all to have a change in [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKuu20qlOcU&t=823.34s)]
*  government. Now, can they get that together based on this and in the chaos that comes? [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKuu20qlOcU&t=830.0600000000001s)]
*  That's possible, and I hope it does happen. I hope they do change their government. The other [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKuu20qlOcU&t=834.94s)]
*  thing that could happen is a succession battle. The supreme leader, if he's alive, is very old [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKuu20qlOcU&t=840.3000000000001s)]
*  and feeble. He's going to die. There's already jockeying for position among the people who think [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKuu20qlOcU&t=847.58s)]
*  they want to succeed him. If they start scrapping and the Iranian people get their game together, [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKuu20qlOcU&t=852.62s)]
*  we all might be better off with anyone but them in charge in that country. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKuu20qlOcU&t=858.5400000000001s)]
*  I'm glad you opened the door to jockeying a position because yes, they may be happening [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKuu20qlOcU&t=862.78s)]
*  with regard to the ultimate leader of Iran, but it's also potential for happening with who's in [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKuu20qlOcU&t=866.06s)]
*  charge of the IRGC because as we've reported, Salami, who replaced Qasem Soleimani, was killed [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKuu20qlOcU&t=871.74s)]
*  last night. So one, is there a name that you are looking for to step up and take that position? [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKuu20qlOcU&t=877.5s)]
*  But a follow-on question is who wants that position at this point knowing that the Israelis just [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKuu20qlOcU&t=883.5799999999999s)]
*  wiped out basically the top four, who wants to step up and take that position next? [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKuu20qlOcU&t=890.3s)]
*  Yeah, you look at Hezbollah's leadership chart with all those Xs over the people who were [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKuu20qlOcU&t=896.9399999999999s)]
*  running that operation, they're all dead. It's like the joke used to be that you don't want to [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKuu20qlOcU&t=901.9s)]
*  be the number two guy for al-Qaeda in Iraq because we kept killing him. I don't know that anybody [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKuu20qlOcU&t=906.78s)]
*  wants it and we heard that there was a strike on a meeting of IRGC leadership. So we don't even [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKuu20qlOcU&t=911.8199999999999s)]
*  know who's left, which would be phenomenal. The more of them who are dead, the less capable the [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKuu20qlOcU&t=917.5s)]
*  rest will be. And the response from Iran will be, because of that, more splintered and less [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKuu20qlOcU&t=922.3s)]
*  dangerous. So we're nowhere near out of the woods. This is just the opening salvo in what will be a [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKuu20qlOcU&t=928.22s)]
*  couple weeks of battle, but it's not going to be a war. It's not going to be a ground war. It's not [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKuu20qlOcU&t=934.46s)]
*  going to be a forever war or any of those things. And at this point, the U.S. is not involved and I [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKuu20qlOcU&t=939.26s)]
*  think Israel is handling its business quite well. Yeah, I mean, it is really brilliant on the part [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKuu20qlOcU&t=945.18s)]
*  of the Israelis, if you think about it, Jim, because they didn't just target the nuclear [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKuu20qlOcU&t=949.26s)]
*  sites or the missiles. It also seems like they, and they pre-planned this, took out the people who [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKuu20qlOcU&t=952.54s)]
*  would have the power to call for retaliation in an orderly manner. So clear chaos inside Iran and [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKuu20qlOcU&t=957.7399999999999s)]
*  we're going to wait to see what that retaliation looks like. Do you think that this is the most [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKuu20qlOcU&t=965.26s)]
*  significant move, Jim, that Israel has made since October 7th? [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKuu20qlOcU&t=969.82s)]
*  By far. This was always the existential threat because this was not just a threat to Israel, [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKuu20qlOcU&t=975.58s)]
*  as some people like to pretend. Having an apocalyptic death cult like the Islamic Republic, [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKuu20qlOcU&t=981.1800000000001s)]
*  Ayatollahs, in control of nuclear weapons was intolerable for the free world. So they could [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKuu20qlOcU&t=987.6600000000001s)]
*  have hit Israel, they could have hit us, they could have just basically, any nuclear detonation [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKuu20qlOcU&t=994.7s)]
*  anywhere throws the world into chaos. So yes, Israel has done the world a favor. We're a safer [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKuu20qlOcU&t=1000.3000000000001s)]
*  place right now, even with the chaos and the danger that's going to come because of this, [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKuu20qlOcU&t=1005.9000000000001s)]
*  just by having slowed this down. And they're not going to be able to rebuild it because as soon as [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKuu20qlOcU&t=1012.0600000000001s)]
*  they start rebuilding, Israel will have more bombs and we'll take them out again if they have to. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKuu20qlOcU&t=1017.1800000000001s)]
*  Yeah, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu yesterday said, remember, Iran calls Israel [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKuu20qlOcU&t=1021.42s)]
*  the small Satan, it calls America the great Satan, which was a very good reminder on the part of the [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKuu20qlOcU&t=1025.6599999999999s)]
*  prime minister. Jim Hansen live for us this morning. Thank you so much. Good to be with you. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKuu20qlOcU&t=1031.34s)]
