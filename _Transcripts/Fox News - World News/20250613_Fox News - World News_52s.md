# Trump reveals if he knew of Israel’s strikes on Iran beforehand #foxnews #news #shorts #usa #trump
**Fox News - World News:** [June 13, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXNDqk11XY4)
*  The conversation happening right now in the Situation Room with the National Security [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXNDqk11XY4&t=0.0s)]
*  Council, again, that is closed door. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXNDqk11XY4&t=3.44s)]
*  You never know, though, at this point who, what foreign leaders could be calling into [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXNDqk11XY4&t=5.28s)]
*  a meeting like that. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXNDqk11XY4&t=9.16s)]
*  Again, the White House has been emphasizing that this was unilateral action taken by Israel, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXNDqk11XY4&t=10.44s)]
*  that the U.S. was not involved in these strikes against Iran. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXNDqk11XY4&t=15.8s)]
*  But as you mentioned, yesterday, the president told Prep Bear that he was aware, though, ahead [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXNDqk11XY4&t=19.240000000000002s)]
*  of time that these strikes would happen. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXNDqk11XY4&t=22.56s)]
*  American staff and families were moved out of the region earlier this week. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXNDqk11XY4&t=24.84s)]
*  And again, prior to these attacks, President Trump made clear that he was hoping such an [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXNDqk11XY4&t=28.400000000000002s)]
*  action could be avoided as to potentially not derail nuclear talks set for this weekend. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXNDqk11XY4&t=31.6s)]
*  A U.S. official just told Fox News that, quote, we still hope to have talks. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXNDqk11XY4&t=36.800000000000004s)]
*  It's unclear if Iran is going to show up to that table. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXNDqk11XY4&t=41.24s)]
*  With that, the president stressed yesterday, simply put, that Iran cannot have a nuclear [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXNDqk11XY4&t=44.68000000000001s)]
*  weapon. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXNDqk11XY4&t=48.88s)]
