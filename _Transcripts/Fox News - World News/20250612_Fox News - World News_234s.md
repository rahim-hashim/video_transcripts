# BREAKING: Iranian official killed in strike, Iran state media says
**Fox News - World News:** [June 12, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rV7JgcdznxE)
*  Standing by at the White House tonight, Peter. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rV7JgcdznxE&t=0.0s)]
*  Clearly, through Secretary of State Marco Rubio's statement, the White House saying [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rV7JgcdznxE&t=2.88s)]
*  they are not part of tonight's military action. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rV7JgcdznxE&t=8.120000000000001s)]
*  However, we do know that the president has been a steadfast, strong supporter ally of [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rV7JgcdznxE&t=10.48s)]
*  Israel and has stated many times he will continue to be. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rV7JgcdznxE&t=17.240000000000002s)]
*  Sean, earlier today, I had a chance to talk to President Trump in the East Room about [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rV7JgcdznxE&t=21.28s)]
*  I asked him basically, are you trying to talk Benjamin Netanyahu out of strikes on Iran, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rV7JgcdznxE&t=26.52s)]
*  or do you want to keep a nuclear weapon out of the Iranians' hands so bad that you would [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rV7JgcdznxE&t=32.2s)]
*  just say, it's not our war, and let him do his thing? [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rV7JgcdznxE&t=37.74s)]
*  President Trump's answer was a little bit longer than what I'm going to cliff-snow it [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rV7JgcdznxE&t=41.44s)]
*  as, but he said Iran just cannot be allowed to get a nuclear weapon. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rV7JgcdznxE&t=45.2s)]
*  I'm just off the phone with some senior staff. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rV7JgcdznxE&t=49.68s)]
*  President Trump, I'm told, is in the West Wing talking to his senior staff, and he is [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rV7JgcdznxE&t=53.84s)]
*  watching the news from the region about what is going on. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rV7JgcdznxE&t=57.56s)]
*  And it's kind of an interesting place to be right now, the White House, because when [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rV7JgcdznxE&t=61.96s)]
*  most of the folks were leaving here around 6 o'clock after the nightly newscasts, there [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rV7JgcdznxE&t=66.92s)]
*  was a congressional picnic that was starting on the lawn. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rV7JgcdznxE&t=71.92s)]
*  As I was walking back in through the gates, Pennsylvania Avenue is now completely closed. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rV7JgcdznxE&t=75.1s)]
*  There are Secret Service patrolling. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rV7JgcdznxE&t=80.0s)]
*  They're keeping people pretty far back, which is something that they do when there [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rV7JgcdznxE&t=81.36s)]
*  are big international incidents. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rV7JgcdznxE&t=84.36s)]
*  There are heightened tensions. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rV7JgcdznxE&t=85.76s)]
*  They just want to make sure that they have this area secure. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rV7JgcdznxE&t=86.76s)]
*  But there are some guests from the congressional picnic still leaving, as President Trump is [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rV7JgcdznxE&t=91.0s)]
*  in the West Wing trying to figure out what exactly is going on. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rV7JgcdznxE&t=95.48s)]
*  He told me earlier today that Israel did not tell them anything specifically that led to [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rV7JgcdznxE&t=100.16s)]
*  the evacuation of American military family dependents in the Middle East. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rV7JgcdznxE&t=107.08s)]
*  But we know that they had some kind of a tip, whether or not the Israelis told us directly [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rV7JgcdznxE&t=113.08s)]
*  or our own intelligence in the region tipped us off. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rV7JgcdznxE&t=118.2s)]
*  They didn't do that for no reason, because it was a huge operation that a lot of people [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rV7JgcdznxE&t=123.08s)]
*  thought was going to go for a couple more days, but it really only went about 24, 36 [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rV7JgcdznxE&t=127.84s)]
*  hours. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rV7JgcdznxE&t=133.24s)]
*  If I may interrupt you. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rV7JgcdznxE&t=134.28s)]
*  Yes, something else. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rV7JgcdznxE&t=135.28s)]
*  Iranian state media now has confirmed what we reported earlier, that we weren't able [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rV7JgcdznxE&t=136.28s)]
*  to confirm, that the Iranian Revolutionary Guard chief has been killed in a strike. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rV7JgcdznxE&t=142.84s)]
*  It shows you the depth of the intelligence that the Israelis have. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rV7JgcdznxE&t=149.0s)]
*  Pretty amazing. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rV7JgcdznxE&t=153.4s)]
*  But you're saying that the president is in the White House, is watching this unfold live [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rV7JgcdznxE&t=154.74s)]
*  tonight, correct? [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rV7JgcdznxE&t=158.96s)]
*  Yes, and as I was walking up the driveway, I don't have a clear view right now, but [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rV7JgcdznxE&t=159.96s)]
*  there was still a Marine, as of about five minutes ago, a Marine sentry posted outside [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rV7JgcdznxE&t=163.84s)]
*  the West Wing gates, which means that the president is either at the Oval Office desk [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rV7JgcdznxE&t=167.56s)]
*  or in the Situation Room with his team there. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rV7JgcdznxE&t=171.68s)]
*  And just something that I would say about the first 140 days or so being here with Trump [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rV7JgcdznxE&t=175.28s)]
*  for his second term, he's been very, very focused on keeping America out of new wars. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rV7JgcdznxE&t=179.96s)]
*  And when you talk to him about Ukraine, you talk to him about Gaza, he emphasizes that [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rV7JgcdznxE&t=186.68s)]
*  is not America's war. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rV7JgcdznxE&t=191.16000000000003s)]
*  He wants to work hard to try to end them, but it is not America's war. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rV7JgcdznxE&t=192.48s)]
*  Listen, Peter, he's done everything humanly possible, along with Steve Wittkopf, to give [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rV7JgcdznxE&t=196.04s)]
*  an off-ramp to the Iranians. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rV7JgcdznxE&t=201.44s)]
*  They chose not to take it, and they got very arrogant about it. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rV7JgcdznxE&t=203.2s)]
*  And this is the inevitable result. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rV7JgcdznxE&t=207.48s)]
*  You don't get to be the number one state sponsor of terror and provide all the weaponry [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rV7JgcdznxE&t=209.2s)]
*  to be fired into Israel and then not expect Israel to take your word seriously that you [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rV7JgcdznxE&t=213.92s)]
*  want to wipe them off the map. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rV7JgcdznxE&t=218.52s)]
*  Peter Ducey at the White House tonight. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rV7JgcdznxE&t=220.12s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rV7JgcdznxE&t=221.56s)]
