# Pentagon holds briefing after US strikes Iran nuclear sites
**Fox News - World News:** [June 22, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E)
*  Well, thank you for joining us this morning. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=30.0s)]
*  Last night on President Trump's orders, U.S. Central Command conducted a precision strike [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=33.44s)]
*  in the middle of the night against three nuclear facilities in Iran, Fordow, Natanz, and Asfahan, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=38.72s)]
*  in order to destroy or severely degrade Iran's nuclear program. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=46.24s)]
*  And as the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs will demonstrate, it was an incredible and overwhelming [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=51.28s)]
*  success. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=58.82s)]
*  The order we received from our Commander-in-Chief was focused, it was powerful, and it was clear. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=60.58s)]
*  We devastated the Iranian nuclear program. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=68.52s)]
*  But it's worth noting the operation did not target Iranian troops or the Iranian people. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=73.26s)]
*  For the entirety of his time in office, President Trump has consistently stated for over 10 [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=79.3s)]
*  that Iran must not get a nuclear weapon full stop. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=85.46s)]
*  Thanks to President Trump's bold and visionary leadership and his commitment to peace through [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=91.53999999999999s)]
*  strength, Iran's nuclear ambitions have been obliterated. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=96.02s)]
*  Many presidents have dreamed of delivering the final blow to Iran's nuclear program. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=102.06s)]
*  And none could. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=108.94s)]
*  Until President Trump. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=111.38s)]
*  The operation President Trump planned was bold and it was brilliant, showing the world [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=114.46s)]
*  that American deterrence is back. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=120.97999999999999s)]
*  When this president speaks, the world should listen. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=124.84s)]
*  And the U.S. military? [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=129.85999999999999s)]
*  We can back it up. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=132.12s)]
*  The most powerful military the world has ever known. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=134.01999999999998s)]
*  No other country on planet Earth could have conducted the operation that the chairman [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=138.02s)]
*  is going to outline this morning. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=142.62s)]
*  Not even close. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=144.94s)]
*  Just like Soleimani found out in the first term, Iran found out when POTUS says 60 days [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=148.5s)]
*  that he seeks peace and negotiation, he means 60 days of peace and negotiation. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=155.22s)]
*  Otherwise that nuclear program, that nuclear capability will not exist. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=161.82000000000002s)]
*  He meant it. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=167.64s)]
*  This is not the previous administration. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=169.35999999999999s)]
*  The President Trump said no nukes. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=173.55999999999997s)]
*  He seeks peace and Iran should take that path. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=177.92s)]
*  He sent out a truth last night saying this. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=184.04s)]
*  Any retaliation by Iran against the United States of America will be met with force far [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=188.76s)]
*  greater than what was witnessed tonight. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=195.24s)]
*  Signed the President of the United States, Donald J. Trump. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=199.48000000000002s)]
*  Iran would be smart to heed those words. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=203.44s)]
*  He said it before and he means it. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=207.72s)]
*  I want to give recognition to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the Joint Staff, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=210.60000000000002s)]
*  General Eric Carilla at CENTCOM who did a phenomenal job, he and his staff, all of CENTCOM. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=216.4s)]
*  Across the board, this was a joint effort and across the Pentagon effort. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=224.4s)]
*  I want to recognize the pilots who flew those bombers, who flew those fighters, who flew [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=230.4s)]
*  those refuelers, warriors. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=237.92s)]
*  I want to recognize the sailors on those destroyers, in those subs, on those carriers, warriors, [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=241.16s)]
*  all of them. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=247.64s)]
*  I want to recognize our soldiers doing air defense, base defense, QRF, warriors, all [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=249.04000000000002s)]
*  of them. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=255.28s)]
*  Every American involved in this operation performed flawlessly. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=256.28000000000003s)]
*  And I want to give recognition to our allies in Israel as well. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=262.28000000000003s)]
*  This is a plan that took months and weeks of positioning and preparation so that we [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=267.68s)]
*  could be ready when the President of the United States called. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=272.72s)]
*  It took a great deal of precision, it involved misdirection, and the highest of operational [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=277.88s)]
*  security. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=285.96s)]
*  Our B-2s went in and out of downtown Tehran, not Tehran, excuse me, of these nuclear sites, [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=287.88s)]
*  in and out and back without the world knowing at all. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=294.04s)]
*  In that way it was historic. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=298.64s)]
*  A strike that included the longest B-2 Spirit bomber mission since 2001 and the first operational [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=300.76s)]
*  employment of the MOP, a massive ordnance penetrator. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=306.12s)]
*  The mission demonstrated to the world the level of joint and allied integration that [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=311.0s)]
*  speak to the strength of our alliance and our joint forces. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=316.04s)]
*  As President Trump has stated, the United States does not seek war. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=320.16s)]
*  But let me be clear, we will act swiftly and decisively when our people, our partners, [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=324.4s)]
*  or our interests are threatened. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=332.0s)]
*  Everyone should listen to the President of the United States and know that he means it, [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=335.40000000000003s)]
*  every word. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=338.36s)]
*  I want to give congratulations to our Commander in Chief. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=339.36s)]
*  It was an honor to watch him lead last night and throughout, and to our great American [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=342.2s)]
*  warriors on this successful operation. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=347.04s)]
*  God bless our troops, God bless America, and we give glory to God for his providence and [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=351.08000000000004s)]
*  continue to ask for his protection. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=357.82s)]
*  I turn it over now to the Chairman for specifics. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=361.68s)]
*  Thank you, Mr. Secretary. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=365.24s)]
*  Thanks for recognizing all of our folks out there doing our nation's work. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=366.24s)]
*  Nice to see everybody on this early Sunday morning. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=372.24s)]
*  Last night on the President's orders, U.S. Central Command, under the command of General [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=375.52000000000004s)]
*  Eric Carilla, executed Operation Midnight Hammer, a deliberate and precise strike against three [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=379.48s)]
*  Iranian nuclear facilities. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=386.32000000000005s)]
*  This was a complex and high-risk mission carried out with exceptional skill and discipline [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=388.96000000000004s)]
*  by our Joint Force. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=394.36s)]
*  I want to thank every service member, planner, operator that made this mission possible. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=395.92s)]
*  Their actions reflect the highest standards of the United States Armed Forces. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=401.76s)]
*  This operation was designed to severely degrade Iran's nuclear weapons infrastructure. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=406.72s)]
*  It was planned and executed across multiple domains and theaters with coordination that [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=412.18s)]
*  reflects our ability to project power globally with speed and precision at the time and place [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=418.8s)]
*  of our nation's choosing. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=425.24s)]
*  This was a highly classified mission with very few people in Washington knowing the [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=427.2s)]
*  timing or nature of this plan. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=431.8s)]
*  I'll refer you to the graphic on the side as I walk you through some of the operational [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=434.4s)]
*  details. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=439.24s)]
*  At midnight Friday into Saturday morning, a large B-2 strike package comprised of bombers [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=441.2s)]
*  launched from the continental United States. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=447.16s)]
*  As part of the plan to maintain tactical surprise, part of the package proceeded to the west [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=449.68s)]
*  and into the Pacific as a decoy, a deception effort known only to an extremely small number [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=455.2s)]
*  of planners and key leaders here in Washington and in Tampa. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=462.76s)]
*  The main strike package comprised of seven B-2 Spirit bombers, each with two crew members, [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=467.32s)]
*  proceeded quietly to the east with minimal communications. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=473.44s)]
*  Throughout the 18-hour flight into the target area, the aircraft completed multiple in-flight [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=478.96s)]
*  refuelings. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=484.28s)]
*  Once over land, the B-2s linked up with escort and support aircraft in a complex, tightly [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=486.32s)]
*  timed maneuver requiring exact synchronization across multiple platforms in a narrow piece [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=493.32s)]
*  of airspace, all done with minimal communications. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=499.92s)]
*  This type of integration is exactly what our joint force does better than anyone else in [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=505.28000000000003s)]
*  the world. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=511.54s)]
*  At approximately 5 p.m. Eastern Standard Time last night and just prior to the strike package [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=513.08s)]
*  entering Iran, a U.S. submarine in the Central Command area of responsibility launched more [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=519.4s)]
*  than two dozen Tomahawk land attack cruise missiles against key surface infrastructure [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=525.48s)]
*  targets at Esfahan. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=531.36s)]
*  As the Operation Midnight Hammer strike package entered Iranian airspace, the U.S. employed [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=533.76s)]
*  several deception tactics, including decoys, as the fourth and fifth generation aircraft [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=539.64s)]
*  pushed out in front of the strike package at high altitude and high speed, sweeping [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=547.08s)]
*  in front of the package for enemy fighters and surface-to-air missile threats. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=553.2s)]
*  The strike package was supported by U.S. Strategic Command, U.S. Transportation Command, U.S. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=558.96s)]
*  Cyber Command, U.S. Space Command, U.S. Space Force, and U.S. European Command. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=565.96s)]
*  As the strike package approached Fordow and Natanz, the U.S. Protection package employed [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=574.32s)]
*  high-speed suppression weapons to ensure safe passage of the strike package, with fighter [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=581.48s)]
*  assets employing preemptive suppressing fires against any potential Iranian surface-to-air [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=587.36s)]

*  At approximately 6.40 p.m. Eastern Standard Time, 2.10 a.m. Iran time, the lead B-2 aircraft [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=602.96s)]
*  dropped two GBU-57 massive ordnance penetrator weapons on the first of several aim points [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=611.7600000000001s)]
*  at Fordow. As the President stated last night, the remaining bombers then hit their targets [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=619.5200000000001s)]
*  as well, with a total of 14 MOPs dropped against two nuclear target areas. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=625.36s)]
*  All three Iranian nuclear infrastructure targets were struck between 6.40 p.m. and 7.05 p.m. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=633.2s)]
*  Eastern Time, with the Tomahawk missiles being the last to strike at Esfahan to ensure [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=641.32s)]
*  we retain the element of surprise throughout the operation. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=651.72s)]
*  Following weapons release, the Midnight Hammer Strike Package exited Iranian airspace and [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=657.2800000000001s)]
*  the package began its return home. We are unaware of any shots fired at the package [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=663.08s)]
*  on the way out. Iran's fighters did not fly, and it appears that Iran's surface-to-air [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=670.88s)]
*  missile systems did not see us. Throughout the mission, we retained the element of surprise. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=679.08s)]
*  In total, U.S. forces employed approximately 75 precision-guided weapons during this operation. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=687.8000000000001s)]
*  This included, as the President stated last night, 14 30,000-pound GBU-57 massive ordnance [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=694.28s)]
*  penetrators, marking the first-ever operational use of this weapon. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=701.9599999999999s)]
*  I know that battle damage is of great interest. Final battle damage will take some time, but [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=708.04s)]
*  initial battle damage assessments indicate that all three sites sustained extremely severe [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=713.36s)]
*  damage and destruction. More than 125 U.S. aircraft participated in this mission, including [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=718.8s)]
*  B-2 stealth bombers, multiple flights of fourth and fifth generation fighters, dozens and [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=728.0799999999999s)]
*  dozens of air refueling tankers, a guided missile submarine, and a full array of intelligence, [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=735.4399999999999s)]
*  surveillance, and reconnaissance aircraft, as well as hundreds of maintenance and operational [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=742.9200000000001s)]
*  professionals. As the Secretary said, this was the largest B-2 operational strike in [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=748.6s)]
*  U.S. history and the second-longest B-2 mission ever flown, exceeded only by those in the [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=756.08s)]
*  days following 9-11. Well prior to the strike, General Corrilla [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=763.8000000000001s)]
*  elevated force protection measures across the region, especially in Iraq, Syria, and [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=769.68s)]
*  the Gulf. Our forces remain on high alert and are fully postured to respond to any Iranian [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=775.16s)]
*  retaliation or proxy attacks, which would be an incredibly poor choice. We will defend [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=782.8399999999999s)]
*  ourselves. The safety of our service members and civilians remains our highest priority. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=791.4399999999999s)]
*  This mission demonstrates the unmatched reach, coordination, and capability of the United [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=799.44s)]
*  States military. In just a matter of weeks, this went from strategic planning to global [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=805.2800000000001s)]
*  execution. This operation underscores the unmatched capabilities and global reach of [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=811.2s)]
*  the United States military. As the President clearly said last night, no other military [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=818.0400000000001s)]
*  in the world could have done this. I join the President and the Secretary in being incredibly [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=826.04s)]
*  proud of the air crews, naval forces, cyber operators, planners and support teams, and [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=831.9399999999999s)]
*  commanders who made this mission possible. It is their skill, discipline, and teamwork [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=838.3399999999999s)]
*  that makes this operation possible. I am particularly proud of our discipline related to operational [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=844.88s)]
*  security, something that was of great concern to the President, the Secretary, General Corilla, [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=852.36s)]
*  and me, and we will continue to focus on this. As we stand here this morning, many assets [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=859.12s)]
*  are still airborne and we have hundreds deployed. I ask that we keep our war fighters on their [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=865.68s)]
*  way home and our deployed service member in our thoughts. Our joint force remains ready [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=871.36s)]
*  to defend the United States, our troops, and our interests in the region. Thank you very [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=877.84s)]
*  much. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=883.0400000000001s)]
*  We will take a few questions. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=883.6800000000001s)]
*  So, is regime change off the table, Mr. Secretary? And to the Chairman, you said the battle damage [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=887.64s)]
*  assessment is still ongoing, but do you believe that some nuclear capability in Iran remains? [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=896.1600000000001s)]
*  This mission was not and has not been about regime change. The President authorized a [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=903.92s)]
*  precision operation to neutralize the threats to our national interests posed by the Iranian [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=909.92s)]
*  nuclear program and the collective self-defense of our troops and our ally Israel. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=916.52s)]
*  Thanks for your question. I think BDA is still pending and it would be way too early for [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=925.16s)]
*  me to comment on what may or may not still be there, but thanks for the question. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=929.68s)]
*  Excuse me, Mr. Secretary, can you tell me, was there a particular moment when the President [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=936.68s)]
*  decided to pull the trigger on this operation where he said, now, rather than being something [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=942.28s)]
*  in the holster, now we're going to pull the trigger on it? [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=948.12s)]
*  I would just say having the opportunity to witness his leadership, he was fully committed [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=950.4799999999999s)]
*  to the peace process, wanted a negotiated outcome, gave Iran every single opportunity [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=956.32s)]
*  and unfortunately was met by stonewalling, which is why he gave them plenty of time to [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=962.86s)]
*  continue to come to the table and give up enrichment, give up the nuclear program. But [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=967.9200000000001s)]
*  there was a, I won't say the particular moment, there was certainly a moment in time where [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=972.5200000000001s)]
*  he realized that it had to be a certain action taken in order to minimize the threat to us [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=975.6800000000001s)]
*  and our troops. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=981.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=983.68s)]
*  General, you say that General Karell had increased force protection in Iraq, Syria, and Gulf [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=984.68s)]
*  and those areas. Were they given any advance warning the attacks were coming? And also, [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=990.36s)]
*  Mr. Secretary, when were congressional leaders notified, how long before the attacks took [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=996.6s)]
*  place? [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=1001.8s)]
*  Sir, to your first question, you know, the risk has clearly been rising over the last [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=1002.8s)]
*  few weeks in the region. Based on that and not a particular awareness of this operation, [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=1008.6s)]
*  we've made smart decisions to minimize the risk to U.S. forces in the region. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=1015.6s)]
*  No advance warning? [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=1020.72s)]
*  No, sir. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=1021.72s)]
*  And congressional? [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=1022.72s)]
*  They were notified after the planes were safely out. We complied with the notification requirements [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=1025.8s)]
*  of the War Powers Act. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=1032.16s)]
*  After the attacks, they were notified? [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=1033.16s)]
*  They were immediately thereafter. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=1034.6399999999999s)]
*  Yes. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=1036.6399999999999s)]
*  Thank you, Mr. Secretary. Two quick questions. Do you believe you completely destroyed Iranian [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=1037.76s)]
*  nuclear program? And how about Iranian ballistic missiles? Your ally, Israel, always saying [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=1045.8400000000001s)]
*  that is biggest threat. And second question is very important. What will be your next [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=1053.92s)]
*  step if Iran or militias under Iranian influence in the region attack U.S. interests or allies [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=1061.48s)]
*  in the region? [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=1071.4s)]
*  And you can chime in on this too, Mr. Chairman. The battle damage assessment is ongoing, but [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=1073.72s)]
*  our initial assessment, as the chairman said, is that all of our precision munitions struck [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=1078.5600000000002s)]
*  where we wanted them to strike and had the desired effect, which means especially in [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=1083.3200000000002s)]
*  Fordow, which was the primary target here, we believe we achieved destruction of capabilities [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=1088.36s)]
*  there. Ultimately, wherever it may be, whether it's in Iraq or Syria or bases in the Gulf, [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=1093.44s)]
*  as the president said it would be a very bad idea for Iran or its proxies to attempt to [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=1101.3999999999999s)]
*  attack American forces. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=1108.48s)]
*  Yes. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=1110.48s)]
*  Thank you, Mr. Secretary. Regarding retaliations, Iran and North Korea are cooperating on nuclear [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=1111.48s)]
*  and missile development. Do you think there is a possibility that Iran, North Korea, and [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=1120.84s)]
*  other forces such as China will join forces to retaliate against the United States? [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=1128.68s)]
*  Well, unfortunately, because of the policies under the previous administration, we drove [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=1135.68s)]
*  those countries together, and ultimately that creates a challenging environment. For this [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=1143.24s)]
*  particular operation, the focus is on Iran and Iranian nuclear capabilities. That's our [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=1151.16s)]
*  focus here is to not just say that they can't have, but President Trump has said for over [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=1155.28s)]
*  20 years, frankly, Iran cannot have a nuclear weapon, and ultimately he decided this is [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=1160.88s)]
*  the moment, given their stonewalling, when direct military action had to be taken to [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=1166.3600000000001s)]
*  prevent that from happening. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=1171.88s)]
*  Yes. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=1173.3600000000001s)]
*  Thank you very much. General Kaine, I understand OBSAC. I respect OBSAC. Can you say at all [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=1174.3600000000001s)]
*  what security procedures are being taken to protect U.S. troops in Iraq and elsewhere [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=1181.3600000000001s)]
*  in the Middle East? And Secretary Hegseth, as a global war on terrorism veteran, what [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=1186.24s)]
*  do you say to veterans who may be concerned the U.S. is getting into another open-ended [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=1191.92s)]
*  war in the Middle East over weapons of mass destruction? [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=1196.32s)]
*  Thanks, sir, for the question. I won't comment on what force protection measures are being [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=1200.32s)]
*  taken in the region. What I will say is we're being proactive and not reactive, and being [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=1205.88s)]
*  very thoughtful about ensuring that we do all that we can to protect our forces out [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=1213.3600000000001s)]
*  there. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=1217.5600000000002s)]
*  And I would just say, as the President has directed and made clear, this is most certainly [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=1218.4s)]
*  not open-ended. It doesn't mean it limits our ability to respond. We will respond if [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=1223.24s)]
*  necessary. The most powerful military in the world is postured and prepared to defend our [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=1229.44s)]
*  people. But what the President gave us, as I said, was a focused, powerful, and clear [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=1233.6000000000001s)]
*  mission on the destruction of Iranian nuclear capabilities. Those were the targets. That's [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=1239.76s)]
*  what was struck. That was overwhelming. That's what was overwhelming. That's what the Iranian [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=1245.2s)]
*  regime needs to understand. As the President put out last night, he wants peace. There [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=1249.72s)]
*  needs to be a negotiated settlement here. We ultimately demonstrated that Iran cannot [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=1254.68s)]
*  have a nuclear capability. That is a very clear mission set on this operation. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=1259.68s)]
*  Yes. Hold on. Yes, right there. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=1265.68s)]
*  Thank you, Mr. Secretary. Question for the Secretary and the Chairman. How is this strike [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=1268.68s)]
*  coordinated with the Israelis on a strategic level militarily and on a tactical level? [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=1276.8s)]
*  Was there any direct Israeli military participation in this operation? [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=1284.4s)]
*  Well, I would say certainly Israel had an incredible military success, especially at [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=1290.4s)]
*  the beginning and ongoing, in degrading Iranian capabilities, degrading Iranian launchers, [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=1299.0800000000002s)]
*  MRVMs. It's been incredible to watch what our ally Israel has been able to do. And there [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=1305.76s)]
*  certainly have been conversations. I mean, General Karila at CENTCOM has worked closely [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=1311.48s)]
*  in the defense of Israel for many years. And part of this operation was the defense [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=1315.92s)]
*  of Israel and the ongoing defense of Israel. But as it pertains to this strike, this was [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=1321.2s)]
*  U.S.-operated and U.S.-led. We took advantage of some of the preparatory [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=1326.68s)]
*  work that's been done over the past week and a half in terms of axis of approach. I won't [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=1331.0800000000002s)]
*  get into the particulars, but as the Secretary said, it was a U.S. strike. We made sure we [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=1337.04s)]
*  were not in the same piece of airspace and sky. Aside from that, that was the extent [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=1344.1599999999999s)]
*  of it. We'll take a couple more. Yeah, right there. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=1348.56s)]
*  Question, Secretary. First, are you concerned whatsoever now about the reaction from U.S. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=1352.6s)]
*  allies given the strike, particularly those in the Gulf? And to the Chairman, if I may, [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=1357.1599999999999s)]
*  I understand you don't want to speak to specific assets, enforcement protection measures, but [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=1362.12s)]
*  do you anticipate at least having to bring in any further assets from other theaters [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=1366.36s)]
*  to aid in force protection over the coming days? [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=1370.68s)]
*  We certainly understand the challenges of allies in the region, and we have been respectful [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=1375.3600000000001s)]
*  and working in collaboration with them as it pertains to basing and sensitivities there. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=1379.96s)]
*  Ultimately, they've got a lot of assets and people in those locations also where American [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=1386.24s)]
*  troops are co-located. So that's a consideration of ours. We've been in close consultation [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=1390.92s)]
*  with them, and we appreciate the support that we have got. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=1395.3200000000002s)]
*  Thanks for the question on sort of the global picture. And as you know, that's one of my [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=1399.28s)]
*  jobs is to look globally at the entire range of challenges. We are always carefully considering [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=1402.32s)]
*  our forced posture around the world and then offering options to the Secretary and to the [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=1410.28s)]
*  President. I won't comment on any future things, but the American people should know that we [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=1416.56s)]
*  consider those moves around the world and try to modulate as needed our force structure [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=1423.56s)]
*  in the region. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=1430.84s)]
*  Absolutely. Yeah, right here. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=1431.84s)]
*  Thank you. What communications are being sent to the Iranians right now, and is there any [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=1433.84s)]
*  possibility of diplomacy now or in the coming days? [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=1438.32s)]
*  I can only confirm that there are both public and private messages being directly delivered [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=1442.94s)]
*  to the Iranians in multiple channels, giving them every opportunity to come to the table. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=1448.12s)]
*  They understand precisely what the American position is, precisely what steps they can [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=1453.6s)]
*  take to allow for peace, and we hope they do so. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=1459.36s)]
*  Yes. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=1464.36s)]
*  The President may not want an open-ended conflict. The Iranians may disagree. Are you prepared [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=1465.36s)]
*  for a protracted war? [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=1471.6399999999999s)]
*  Well, anything can happen in conflict. We acknowledge that. But the scope of this was [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=1474.8799999999999s)]
*  intentionally limited. That's the message that we're sending. With the capabilities [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=1478.4399999999998s)]
*  of the American military nearly unlimited. So Iran, in that sense, has a choice. But [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=1483.04s)]
*  we've made it very clear to them this is nuclear sites, this is nuclear capabilities, this [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=1489.1999999999998s)]
*  is the line that the President set, and we set that back. Now is the time to come forward [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=1493.84s)]
*  for peace, but we, I think one of the takeaways from this as well is the unprecedented level [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=1500.04s)]
*  of ongoing cooperation. I can't speak highly enough of the Chairman and his staff and General [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=1505.04s)]
*  Corilla in CENTCOM, what they've done to look around the corner, to pre-position, to understand [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=1510.88s)]
*  how an operation like this comes together. The scope and scale of what occurred last [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=1517.04s)]
*  night would take the breath away of almost any American if you had an opportunity to [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=1521.96s)]
*  watch it in real time. And I think Tehran is certainly calculating the reality that [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=1526.04s)]
*  planes flew from the middle of America and Missouri overnight, completely undetected [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=1532.52s)]
*  over three of their most highly sensitive sites, and we were able to destroy nuclear [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=1537.04s)]
*  capabilities and our boys in those bombers are on their way home right now. We believe [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=1541.92s)]
*  that'll have a clear psychological impact on how they view the future, and we certainly [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=1547.52s)]
*  hope they take the path to negotiate a peace. But I could not be more proud of how this [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=1552.28s)]
*  building operated, of the precision, the sensitivity, and the professionalism of the troops involved [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=1557.52s)]
*  in this effort. I will take one more, we'll take one more question. Yes, right there. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=1563.56s)]
*  Thank you, Mr. Secretary. Concerning the justification for these strikes, in March the Office of [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=1568.56s)]
*  the Director of National Intelligence released their threat assessment, concluding, quote, [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=1576.56s)]
*  Iran is not building a nuclear weapon and Khomeini has not authorized the nuclear programs [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=1582.56s)]
*  he suspended in 2003, unquote. So what new intelligence does the U.S. have since then [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=1590.08s)]
*  that the Iranians have changed their position on nuclear weapons, and does this new intelligence [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=1597.44s)]
*  come from U.S. sources and methods, or are we getting this information from other countries? [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=1602.84s)]
*  Well, I would just simply say that the President's made it very clear. He's looked at all of [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=1608.32s)]
*  this, all of the intelligence, all of the information, and come to the conclusion that [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=1613.0s)]
*  the Iranian nuclear program is a threat, and was willing to take this precision operation [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=1617.4199999999998s)]
*  to neutralize that threat in order to advance American national interests, reduce the Iranian [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=1624.26s)]
*  nuclear program, and obviously collect self-defense of ourselves and our allies. So he looked [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=1629.2s)]
*  at all of it, understood the nature of the threat, and took bold action I think the American [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=1633.24s)]
*  people would expect in a Commander-in-Chief. That's all we've got. Thank you very much. [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=1637.3600000000001s)]
*  Appreciate it. Mr. Chairman. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=1641.56s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=1642.56s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=668oKOJ43_E&t=1659.2s)]
