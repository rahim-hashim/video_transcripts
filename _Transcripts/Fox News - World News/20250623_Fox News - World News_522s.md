# Iran VOWS revenge for US bombings of nuclear sites
**Fox News - World News:** [June 23, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ij3jHpC2B8)
*  Senior correspondent Mike Tobin in Tel Aviv, Mike. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ij3jHpC2B8&t=0.0s)]
*  And here, says Israeli warplanes continue to strike targets in Iran. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ij3jHpC2B8&t=5.0s)]
*  They're sending messages to people on the ground there to stay away from military infrastructure [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ij3jHpC2B8&t=8.56s)]
*  and military bases. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ij3jHpC2B8&t=13.280000000000001s)]
*  As the Israeli warplanes unloaded at least 100 missile-striking targets on the ground [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ij3jHpC2B8&t=15.32s)]
*  in Iran, among the targets they hit, the Forto nuclear facility. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ij3jHpC2B8&t=20.16s)]
*  They hit the access roads leading up to that facility. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ij3jHpC2B8&t=24.240000000000002s)]
*  They hit the Evin prison, notorious because that's where political prisoners had been held. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ij3jHpC2B8&t=27.0s)]
*  They hit command centers for the Revolutionary Guard and the forces that put down uprisings. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ij3jHpC2B8&t=31.64s)]
*  They also hit Iran's very old fleet of aircraft. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ij3jHpC2B8&t=36.2s)]
*  It's unclear if any of those aircraft ever got off the ground during this round of conflict. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ij3jHpC2B8&t=39.4s)]
*  A top Iranian diplomat speaking in Vienna vowed retaliation. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ij3jHpC2B8&t=44.16s)]
*  Iran reaffirms its inherent right to self-defense and will strongly defend its great nation, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ij3jHpC2B8&t=51.0s)]
*  its sovereignty, and its supreme national interests by all necessary means. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ij3jHpC2B8&t=57.480000000000004s)]
*  The era of unchecked impunity has come to an end. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ij3jHpC2B8&t=62.84s)]
*  Waves of Iranian missiles again came at Israel. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ij3jHpC2B8&t=68.92s)]
*  What you're looking there in the video is very near the town of Ashdod, where one of [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ij3jHpC2B8&t=71.64s)]
*  the projectiles got through the Israeli defenses. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ij3jHpC2B8&t=75.16s)]
*  That particular explosion is quite a bit smaller than some of what we have seen in recent days [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ij3jHpC2B8&t=78.08000000000001s)]
*  from the ballistic missiles fired from Iran. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ij3jHpC2B8&t=82.84s)]
*  No one was hurt in that one. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ij3jHpC2B8&t=85.56s)]
*  It did result in some power outages. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ij3jHpC2B8&t=86.68s)]
*  But two times today Israelis, two times this morning Israelis were sent scrambling for [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ij3jHpC2B8&t=89.16000000000001s)]
*  the shelters once overnight. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ij3jHpC2B8&t=93.12s)]
*  Harris? [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ij3jHpC2B8&t=95.0s)]
*  Mike, this is something we're learning, and it's a short while ago the IDF hit military [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ij3jHpC2B8&t=96.0s)]
*  sites belonging to Hezbollah. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ij3jHpC2B8&t=100.48s)]
*  That's up in Lebanon, of course, containing rocket and missile launchers along with weapon [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ij3jHpC2B8&t=102.30000000000001s)]
*  storage facilities north of the Latani River in Lebanon. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ij3jHpC2B8&t=105.92s)]
*  Look, I bring this up. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ij3jHpC2B8&t=110.2s)]
*  It's breaking just moments ago. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ij3jHpC2B8&t=111.72s)]
*  In part to get to the wider point of Israel is fighting on several fronts and of course [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ij3jHpC2B8&t=113.6s)]
*  still in Gaza. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ij3jHpC2B8&t=118.32000000000001s)]
*  But let's focus on Lebanon because that would be a direct violation so it's being reported [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ij3jHpC2B8&t=119.32000000000001s)]
*  to the agreements that have been made between Lebanon and Israel. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ij3jHpC2B8&t=124.28s)]
*  Well, also if you think back to the agreement that ended the 2006-11 Lebanon war or Hezbollah [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ij3jHpC2B8&t=127.72s)]
*  war, that's a U.N. agreement 1701 that said that Hezbollah cannot arm themselves south [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ij3jHpC2B8&t=134.92s)]
*  of the Latani River. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ij3jHpC2B8&t=142.51999999999998s)]
*  This strike was north of the Latani River. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ij3jHpC2B8&t=143.67999999999998s)]
*  And it's a pretty clear indication that the Israelis aren't going to stand for any threats [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ij3jHpC2B8&t=145.76s)]
*  that are close to their border. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ij3jHpC2B8&t=150.35999999999999s)]
*  And the one thing that Hezbollah showed in this last conflict is they could project their [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ij3jHpC2B8&t=151.35999999999999s)]
*  firepower from north of the Latani River. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ij3jHpC2B8&t=155.38s)]
*  Mike Tobin, great reporting as always. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ij3jHpC2B8&t=158.11999999999998s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ij3jHpC2B8&t=160.72s)]
*  And focus now, Danny Danone, Israel's ambassador to the United States. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ij3jHpC2B8&t=163.68s)]
*  Great to see you. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ij3jHpC2B8&t=168.08s)]
*  Thank you for having me, Iris. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ij3jHpC2B8&t=169.08s)]
*  Let's get into the conflict right now that is multi-faced, multi-faceted, and Israel [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ij3jHpC2B8&t=171.20000000000002s)]
*  being in the middle of this and still striking Iran. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ij3jHpC2B8&t=177.20000000000002s)]
*  Just lay the groundwork for me. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ij3jHpC2B8&t=179.88s)]
*  So we are fighting multiple fronts, like you mentioned. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ij3jHpC2B8&t=181.52s)]
*  You know, we're still fighting in Gaza. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ij3jHpC2B8&t=184.52s)]
*  We have 50 hostages in captivity. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ij3jHpC2B8&t=186.08s)]
*  We were able to retrieve three bodies over the weekend and we brought them to burial [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ij3jHpC2B8&t=188.08s)]
*  in Israel. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ij3jHpC2B8&t=192.88s)]
*  But we still have 50 hostages and we assume 20 are alive. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ij3jHpC2B8&t=194.08s)]
*  At the same time, we see what's happening in Lebanon. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ij3jHpC2B8&t=197.76s)]
*  Hezbollah is not engaged against Israel. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ij3jHpC2B8&t=200.84s)]
*  But when we see that they are preparing something, we take— [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ij3jHpC2B8&t=204.32s)]
*  You take that seriously, obviously. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ij3jHpC2B8&t=206.96s)]
*  We take it very seriously. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ij3jHpC2B8&t=208.76s)]
*  And we take preemptive attacks. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ij3jHpC2B8&t=209.76s)]
*  And with Iran, that's the major task today of the IDF. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ij3jHpC2B8&t=211.88s)]
*  You know, mainly the Air Force and the intelligence are very busy continuing to degrade the capabilities [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ij3jHpC2B8&t=214.56s)]
*  of Iran. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ij3jHpC2B8&t=220.92000000000002s)]
*  So how much does Iran need its proxies now? [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ij3jHpC2B8&t=221.95999999999998s)]
*  More than ever, about the same, how weakened do we think that they are? [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ij3jHpC2B8&t=225.23999999999998s)]
*  We are not on the ground, but Israel is assessing that very thing. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ij3jHpC2B8&t=228.64s)]
*  Well, for years, Iran threatened us with the proxies. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ij3jHpC2B8&t=231.72s)]
*  They say we're going to build like a circle of fire around Israel. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ij3jHpC2B8&t=234.72s)]
*  And when the day will come, they will all attack you and invade you. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ij3jHpC2B8&t=238.76s)]
*  And we were able to neutralize that threat. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ij3jHpC2B8&t=241.95999999999998s)]
*  You know, Hamas is very weak today. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ij3jHpC2B8&t=244.16s)]
*  Hezbollah is not the same. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ij3jHpC2B8&t=246.07999999999998s)]
*  The Houthis are not the same. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ij3jHpC2B8&t=247.92s)]
*  But still, they do have capabilities. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ij3jHpC2B8&t=249.48s)]
*  But I think today they saw what we did in Iran, which was remarkable. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ij3jHpC2B8&t=251.8s)]
*  They saw the attack of the U.S., which was stunning. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ij3jHpC2B8&t=255.8s)]
*  And I think even the proxies are calculating the next steps. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ij3jHpC2B8&t=259.12s)]
*  You do. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ij3jHpC2B8&t=262.36s)]
*  What could they entail? [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ij3jHpC2B8&t=263.36s)]
*  Well, you know, I think they know we can reach them. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ij3jHpC2B8&t=264.36s)]
*  Even the Houthis, all of them, we have intelligence and we have the capabilities. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ij3jHpC2B8&t=266.64s)]
*  Would Saudi Arabia help? [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ij3jHpC2B8&t=270.16s)]
*  I mean, it can't just be—I mean, they're kind of have been in a proxy situation also. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ij3jHpC2B8&t=271.36s)]
*  So, you know, yesterday— [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ij3jHpC2B8&t=276.92s)]
*  I mean, the Houthis are a problem for everybody. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ij3jHpC2B8&t=278.92s)]
*  Yesterday, I was at the Security Council. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ij3jHpC2B8&t=281.20000000000005s)]
*  Iran, believe it or not, they called for an emergency session of the Security Council [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ij3jHpC2B8&t=283.0s)]
*  on a Sunday. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ij3jHpC2B8&t=287.6s)]
*  And when I came there, I was sure everybody would thank the U.S. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ij3jHpC2B8&t=288.6s)]
*  But actually, it was only us that actually said, thank you very much, President Trump, [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ij3jHpC2B8&t=291.88000000000005s)]
*  for the brave decision, for showing leadership. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ij3jHpC2B8&t=295.96000000000004s)]
*  And some of the Gulf countries, you know, they know better. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ij3jHpC2B8&t=298.92s)]
*  They know that Iran is a threat to the stability of the region. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ij3jHpC2B8&t=301.6s)]
*  But they tried to be in the middle. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ij3jHpC2B8&t=305.28000000000003s)]
*  They tried to call for de-escalation. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ij3jHpC2B8&t=307.6s)]
*  You don't have both sides. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ij3jHpC2B8&t=309.8s)]
*  You have Iran, you know, evil regime, and you have Israel and the U.S. that try basically [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ij3jHpC2B8&t=310.84000000000003s)]
*  to bring stability to the region. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ij3jHpC2B8&t=316.48s)]
*  Right. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ij3jHpC2B8&t=318.04s)]
*  All right. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ij3jHpC2B8&t=319.04s)]
*  The United Nations—speaking of the U.N., Secretary General condemned the U.S. strikes [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ij3jHpC2B8&t=320.04s)]
*  on Iran nuclear facilities at an emergency meeting that Ambassador was just telling us [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ij3jHpC2B8&t=324.08000000000004s)]
*  about. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ij3jHpC2B8&t=328.24s)]
*  Watch this. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ij3jHpC2B8&t=329.24s)]
*  The bombing of Iranian nuclear facilities by the United States marks a perilous turn [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ij3jHpC2B8&t=331.8s)]
*  in a region that is already re-linked. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ij3jHpC2B8&t=337.52s)]
*  We now risk descending into a red hole of retaliation after retaliation. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ij3jHpC2B8&t=339.96s)]
*  Before the attacks, Ambassador, you had some strong words for Iran's representative. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ij3jHpC2B8&t=346.56s)]
*  We're going to watch those together. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ij3jHpC2B8&t=351.12s)]
*  How dare you ask the international community to protect you from the consequences of your [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ij3jHpC2B8&t=353.56s)]
*  own genocidal agenda? [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ij3jHpC2B8&t=361.35999999999996s)]
*  Have you no shame with innocent blood still dripping from your hands? [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ij3jHpC2B8&t=364.92s)]
*  You come here asking for sympathy. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ij3jHpC2B8&t=371.44s)]
*  You are not a victim. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ij3jHpC2B8&t=374.24s)]
*  You are a wolf pretending to be a diplomat. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ij3jHpC2B8&t=375.24s)]
*  Ambassador? [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ij3jHpC2B8&t=378.76s)]
*  You know, I percussed in action. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ij3jHpC2B8&t=379.76s)]
*  Iran for years breached all rules of international law, and now they come to the Security Council, [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ij3jHpC2B8&t=381.64s)]
*  play victim, ask for sympathy, and the secretary general yesterday actually played the game [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ij3jHpC2B8&t=388.04s)]
*  with them. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ij3jHpC2B8&t=393.28s)]
*  Instead of condemning Iran for what they did all those years, he actually called for restraint. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ij3jHpC2B8&t=394.28s)]
*  So I think the UN— [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ij3jHpC2B8&t=399.2s)]
*  By us. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ij3jHpC2B8&t=400.64s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ij3jHpC2B8&t=401.64s)]
*  So I told him, where were you? [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ij3jHpC2B8&t=402.64s)]
*  Where were you when they enriched uranium? [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ij3jHpC2B8&t=403.64s)]
*  When they built the ballistic missiles? [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ij3jHpC2B8&t=406.08s)]
*  When they targeted Israel? [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ij3jHpC2B8&t=407.47999999999996s)]
*  When they paid those proxies? [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ij3jHpC2B8&t=409.23999999999995s)]
*  You were a bystander. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ij3jHpC2B8&t=410.23999999999995s)]
*  So don't come now and preach us when we're actually doing the role of the UN. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ij3jHpC2B8&t=412.23999999999995s)]
*  Wow. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ij3jHpC2B8&t=416.47999999999996s)]
*  And I know that was a spicy meeting. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ij3jHpC2B8&t=417.47999999999996s)]
*  And we didn't get the dribs and drabs that you're giving us now, like the big push. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ij3jHpC2B8&t=418.96s)]
*  It sounds like they're really weakened and desperate if they're going to call a meeting [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ij3jHpC2B8&t=422.36s)]
*  like that and then find out they don't have friends in the room. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ij3jHpC2B8&t=425.12s)]
*  Well, he sent six letters, and every day he's calling for a meeting. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ij3jHpC2B8&t=427.44s)]
*  It will not help them. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ij3jHpC2B8&t=431.40000000000003s)]
*  They will need to understand Iran will not be nuclear, and we will remove the threat. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ij3jHpC2B8&t=432.40000000000003s)]
*  Look, just recently in the last couple of days, the president has floated the idea that [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ij3jHpC2B8&t=436.92s)]
*  if—and I'll just quote him—if Iran can't make Iran better again or great again, then [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ij3jHpC2B8&t=442.48s)]
*  perhaps they need a regime change. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ij3jHpC2B8&t=449.04s)]
*  He's not calling for one, but others are. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ij3jHpC2B8&t=450.8s)]
*  And what do you think of that? [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ij3jHpC2B8&t=454.0s)]
*  I think the president is absolutely right. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ij3jHpC2B8&t=455.0s)]
*  We pray for a regime change, but that's up for the Iranian people to decide about it. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ij3jHpC2B8&t=456.68s)]
*  You know, they suffer the most from the regime. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ij3jHpC2B8&t=461.32s)]
*  You know, they live—they are oppressed. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ij3jHpC2B8&t=463.52000000000004s)]
*  They don't have freedom. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ij3jHpC2B8&t=465.72s)]
*  And I pray for the day. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ij3jHpC2B8&t=467.08000000000004s)]
*  You know, 46 years ago, before the revolution in Iran, we had a great relationship with [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ij3jHpC2B8&t=468.08000000000004s)]
*  the Iranian people. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ij3jHpC2B8&t=472.32s)]
*  We had flights between Tel Aviv to Tehran. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ij3jHpC2B8&t=473.32s)]
*  We developed great things together. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ij3jHpC2B8&t=475.98s)]
*  And I am telling them, we want that day to come, that you can come visit us in Tel Aviv, [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ij3jHpC2B8&t=477.84s)]
*  in Jerusalem, but they will have to take control and change the regime. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ij3jHpC2B8&t=482.32s)]
*  I pray too. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ij3jHpC2B8&t=487.23999999999995s)]
*  Ambassador, thank you. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ij3jHpC2B8&t=488.23999999999995s)]
