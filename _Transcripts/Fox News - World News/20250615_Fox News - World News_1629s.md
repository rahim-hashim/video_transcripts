# BREAKING: Iranian missiles strike residential buildings in Central Israel
**Fox News - World News:** [June 15, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM)
*  This is a Fox News alert. I'm Ashley Strohmeier live in New York. Crews in Israel are searching [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=0.0s)]
*  for survivors following Iran's latest barrage of missiles and drones. We're going to get [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=6.08s)]
*  right to Trey Yanks who is live on the scene in Tel Aviv. Trey, tell us what you're seeing [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=10.32s)]
*  from what I'm hearing from our people in the booth. It's pretty volatile where you are [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=14.6s)]
*  right now. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=19.04s)]
*  Yeah, Ashley, there was just a large-scale Iranian ballistic missile barrage toward Tel [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=20.04s)]
*  Aviv. One of those missiles slipped past air defense systems and slammed into the buildings [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=27.68s)]
*  behind me. This is a residential area of Tel Aviv. This is an area that people are known [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=33.68s)]
*  to move. And we're just going to move one second because they're trying to clear out [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=40.88s)]
*  this area, Ashley, as we talk. And my cameraman is going to show you the scene here as we [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=43.96s)]
*  move. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=48.0s)]
*  But again, this is in Tel Aviv, Israel's second largest city. And you can see that these crews [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=49.0s)]
*  are trying to get a fire under control. They are looking through these buildings to make [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=56.4s)]
*  sure that no one is trapped under the rubble. I can count one, two, three, four, five buildings [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=61.8s)]
*  directly affected by this. And again, the police are just moving people around here [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=67.44s)]
*  as they try to clear a path for the first responders and ambulances that have arrived [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=73.44s)]
*  here on the scene. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=79.4s)]
*  Ashley, as we move forward here, we will learn more and be able to report more about the [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=80.96000000000001s)]
*  location. But broadly, I can say that we are in Tel Aviv, Israel's second largest city. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=86.26s)]
*  The army and police are aware of our location. We coordinate these things to make sure that [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=92.26s)]
*  we're not giving away any details that could be harmful to first responders of the people [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=96.42s)]
*  on the scene. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=101.62s)]
*  But just to describe what we are seeing here, when we arrived, it was still dark. There [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=102.62s)]
*  was a man who was injured. His name was Gal. He was bleeding from his legs. And I talked [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=108.0s)]
*  to him and I said, what happened? How are you? How are you feeling? He said, my ears [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=112.98s)]
*  are ringing. I can barely hear you. He said he has glass injuries to his legs and he was [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=117.54s)]
*  waiting to get medical attention. He was just one of a number of people who was injured. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=124.9s)]
*  And you can see there's about 10 or 15 journalists at this location we're at. And we're just [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=131.06s)]
*  going to push back a little bit here, Ashley. But again, the latest information that we [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=134.8s)]
*  have, there has been a ballistic missile attack launched by Iran at central Israel. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=138.9s)]
*  One of those missiles slipping past air defense systems and slamming into the ground below, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=145.94s)]
*  causing damage to four or five buildings in Tel Aviv. First responders, you can see, are [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=153.26s)]
*  here on the scene. They have gloves, hard hats, and torch lamps. They are now going [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=157.94s)]
*  into the buildings to try and see if they can find any survivors or other people that [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=163.73999999999998s)]
*  were injured. I want to just show you across the street here, Ashley, there's a massive [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=169.78s)]
*  amount of damage to this very tall building. And it just shows you the blast wave and radius [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=174.26s)]
*  of such a blast when something like this takes place. And so we will find out more information [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=180.78s)]
*  in the minutes, hours ahead. But what we know right now, a number of people have been injured. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=188.34s)]
*  We can confirm that because we saw it when we arrived here on the scene. When we got [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=194.54s)]
*  here, this entire parking lot was on fire. Cars were crushed and smashed. And first responders [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=198.22s)]
*  ran into the blaze and they started to put out the fire. As the fire died down, we could [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=204.02s)]
*  really start to see the full scope of what happened here and start to count the buildings [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=209.88s)]
*  that were affected by this blast. One, two, three, four, five, six, shrapnel to this building, [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=213.86s)]
*  seven. This entire facade over here on this building destroyed. And it just gives you [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=220.06s)]
*  a sense of how destructive these Iranian missiles are when they land in the center part of Israel, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=225.22s)]
*  these densely populated areas filled with Israeli civilians. Ashley? [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=232.1s)]
*  You know, Trey, when you were talking, I saw in the video there was a little girl with [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=235.9s)]
*  her backpack on walking with her dad and it looked like her brother. And I just want [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=241.58s)]
*  to point out it's 5.15 a.m. in Tel Aviv. I can imagine this is when people are starting [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=246.78s)]
*  to get up and they're going to school and trying to live their normal lives. How does [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=251.70000000000002s)]
*  this attack and what you're seeing on the ground compare to what you saw when this first [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=255.18s)]
*  initially happened last week on that first attack? [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=261.74s)]
*  Yeah, Ashley, I'm going to have my cameraman, Yanniv, show you the scene here in Tel Aviv. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=265.02s)]
*  But that first attack when we were live on Fox and you saw those ballistic missiles raining [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=273.06s)]
*  down on this city, this was the first indication that the Iranians do possess the ability to [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=277.82s)]
*  strike deep into Israel and cause significant damage. And when you see the scene here and [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=285.47999999999996s)]
*  just a small distance from the impact location, again, after checking with the police and [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=291.38s)]
*  checking with the army to ensure that we're not giving away any operational security, [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=297.62s)]
*  we arrived here and saw this was yet another missile attack causing this much damage. They're [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=302.53999999999996s)]
*  using similar missiles. As to your question that they used on the first day responding [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=309.65999999999997s)]
*  to the Israeli strikes targeting Iranian nuclear facilities and top IRGC officials, what has [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=314.62s)]
*  changed though is as the pressure continues to increase on the Israeli air defense system, [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=320.22s)]
*  it starts to create a situation where the Israelis can't reload as quickly. They can't [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=326.74s)]
*  shoot down all of this incoming fire. And then ultimately it puts Israel in a place [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=331.58000000000004s)]
*  where they have to simply tell the population to go into bomb shelters and hope. Because [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=337.18s)]
*  as you can see with this damage here, Ashley, even if you are in a shelter, something fortified [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=343.72s)]
*  with concrete that normally Israelis would go to if there's a rocket attack or something [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=349.09999999999997s)]
*  similar, it's not enough for these missiles. These missiles are so large and they have [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=353.65999999999997s)]
*  such a large warhead on top that even being in a shelter doesn't necessarily mean that [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=357.65999999999997s)]
*  you will be protected. But it is certainly better than being on the street or just being [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=364.18s)]
*  near windows or walls. Here at the scene, I'm just trying to, as daylight is starting [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=368.09999999999997s)]
*  to come together here, I'm trying to get a better picture of this area without giving [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=374.78s)]
*  away too much of the location. I will broadly say that this is an area, it's quite close [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=380.02s)]
*  to where we are reporting from in Tel Aviv often before this round of conflict began. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=386.73999999999995s)]
*  And there are coffee shops here. There are oftentimes people going for runs. It's a residential [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=394.9s)]
*  area and it's an area that is now under direct fire from the Iranian regime. This speaks [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=402.53999999999996s)]
*  to the targets that the Iranians are picking out. They are not simply just targeting military [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=410.5s)]
*  installations in Israel. They are going after the heart of cities. They are targeting residential [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=415.53999999999996s)]
*  areas. They are hitting apartment buildings. You saw on Fox the images that we brought [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=421.38s)]
*  you from central Israel earlier today where they were digging through debris looking for [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=425.65999999999997s)]
*  bodies and there was a man there and he was sitting in a wheelchair in a hospital gown. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=431.28s)]
*  And we talked to his friend and he said he was pulled from the rubble. His father was [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=436.96s)]
*  still stuck under the debris. They took this man to the hospital and he insisted that the [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=441.59999999999997s)]
*  doctors and nurses take him back to the scene and he wait as these first responders tried [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=446.23999999999995s)]
*  to dig out his father. These are humans. They are just like us. They like to go to coffee [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=450.2s)]
*  shops. They like to go to the beach. They are peaceful people and they have been targeted [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=455.48s)]
*  following the Israeli strikes against Iran. And as you can see in the distance behind [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=462.24s)]
*  me, this is a very difficult moment for this country because officials and sources that [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=467.64000000000004s)]
*  we talk to every day tell us the following days are going to be incredibly difficult [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=474.12s)]
*  actually. They will take casualties. There will be significant destruction to residential [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=478.44s)]
*  areas of this country. But the Israelis say they knew this was the price going into an [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=483.24s)]
*  operation that they started. They started with strikes against nuclear facilities in [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=488.4s)]
*  Iran. They started the strikes against the ballistic missile program of Iran and they [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=493.88s)]
*  took out officials from the IRGC. But the Israelis tell us this was the price that they [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=497.71999999999997s)]
*  knew they would have to pay in order to reduce those threats against the state of Israel [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=503.44s)]
*  and to try to stabilize a region that is rapidly unraveling. Ashley? [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=509.0s)]
*  Yeah, and you make a very good point. It's a residential area and obviously you don't [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=513.16s)]
*  want to give anything away past that. But these are people just living their lives. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=517.52s)]
*  This is exactly the type of thing we do. We get up, we go to school, we take our kids [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=521.48s)]
*  to school, we go to work, we go sit down and have coffee with our family and our friends. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=525.0s)]
*  But this is what they're having to deal with today, which is a Monday morning. It's supposed [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=529.0s)]
*  to be a normal Monday morning for them. So Iran has made it clear that they don't care [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=534.64s)]
*  about the loss of life that is happening in Israel when they send these rockets into these [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=539.4799999999999s)]
*  residential areas. Have you seen, is it still too early or have you seen anybody be brought [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=544.7199999999999s)]
*  out of these buildings? Have you been able to speak to anyone other than the man you [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=551.3599999999999s)]
*  spoke to that you referenced? We saw a couple people being brought out of [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=555.9599999999999s)]
*  this area. The concern is that many of them are trapped in these partially collapsed [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=561.72s)]
*  buildings and that's why these first responders have made sure that all of the crews that [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=566.0400000000001s)]
*  have arrived here are at a safe distance. They're going into these buildings and starting [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=571.24s)]
*  to dig and try to get information if anyone's trapped under the debris. But that man that [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=575.1800000000001s)]
*  we talked to, Gal, he was still in shock and I just asked him, I said, Achi, which is bro [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=579.44s)]
*  in Hebrew, are you okay? He said he's okay, but his ears were ringing because the explosion [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=585.88s)]
*  was so loud. He didn't have a bomb shelter in his building, so he went to the stairwell. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=591.6s)]
*  It's the next best thing for Israelis who live in older buildings in cities like Tel [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=595.9200000000001s)]
*  Aviv. And I don't even know that he noticed, but he was bleeding from both of his legs. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=599.64s)]
*  He had injuries from glass and metal. When the explosion happened, it hit him. And you [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=605.12s)]
*  can only imagine he was in a building that wasn't directly hit from what we understand. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=611.64s)]
*  You can imagine the types of injuries that would happen to someone who was in one of [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=616.84s)]
*  those buildings. When you see someone like this, it really highlights what's happening [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=620.68s)]
*  here. It highlights the fact that the population is doing what they can when these alerts come [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=628.08s)]
*  in, but it does take time to get to shelters. They do have a text message alert that goes [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=632.96s)]
*  out to people. But at the end of the day, this is a volatile situation that Israeli [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=636.8s)]
*  officials say is in some ways the nightmare scenario they were trying to prepare for. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=643.48s)]
*  Trey, when you talk about that text message system about those missiles incoming, do you [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=647.8000000000001s)]
*  know how long they have in advance before they know it's going to hit, or at least in [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=652.4s)]
*  their general area? [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=656.28s)]
*  So broadly they have about 10 minutes when they know missiles are being launched from [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=659.48s)]
*  Iran. And as they get closer, there's a 90-second warning, and you start to hear the air raid [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=662.8000000000001s)]
*  sirens sounding across Tel Aviv. And that's the moment that if you're not already in a [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=669.22s)]
*  shelter, you need to get to one or to get to cover. The issue is that when these attacks [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=673.8s)]
*  happen in the middle of the night, it's challenging. Sometimes people are so exhausted they sleep [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=679.68s)]
*  through the alarms, they don't see the text, or they simply just don't go to the shelter, [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=684.2s)]
*  and it can be deadly. As we saw today, they were pulling bodies out of the rubble of this [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=690.06s)]
*  apartment building. And again, I just want to show you the scene here, Ashley, as the [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=694.64s)]
*  sun rises here in Tel Aviv, you can see the aftermath of this strike more clearly. I have [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=699.56s)]
*  been to this area, and I'm being again very careful about talking about this, I've been [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=708.1199999999999s)]
*  to this area countless times. It is an area with coffee shops, it is an area filled with [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=712.16s)]
*  a very popular spot to live as a young person in Tel Aviv, because you can run, you can [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=717.0s)]
*  end up going to areas where other people gather. And it is now the site of a ballistic missile [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=722.16s)]
*  attack and a tragedy for the Israeli people. You can see right now they're taking a drone [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=729.48s)]
*  into the air to see if they can gather any information from the rooftops and see if anyone [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=736.28s)]
*  was on these upper floors. Ashley? [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=740.28s)]
*  Trey, you said that you saw bodies being brought out of this particular missile strike? [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=742.0799999999999s)]
*  Earlier in the day we were at another site where first responders were pulling bodies [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=750.64s)]
*  out. And as they were pulling those bodies out from a different area of central Israel, [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=754.68s)]
*  not this location, they had the media step back as a sign of respect. And this is something [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=760.3199999999999s)]
*  that we often adhere to. I remember being here on October 7th, and in the days after [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=765.88s)]
*  when they were pulling bodies out of the police station in the southern city of Stherot and [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=772.2399999999999s)]
*  other places, we tried to do our best to gather the information that we need to gather to [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=776.68s)]
*  tell the world what's happening here while taking into account that these are people [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=780.98s)]
*  with families and also taking into account the serious operational security issues as [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=784.78s)]
*  this war continues. And as we move forward here, and I just want to show you what it [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=789.42s)]
*  looks like down this sidewalk, you can just see the amount of debris and leaves coming [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=794.26s)]
*  from these trees. There are buildings that are popped with shrapnel marks and there are [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=800.34s)]
*  storefronts that are completely smashed. Yaniv, if you'll come with me here, I just want to [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=808.34s)]
*  show you, careful, watch your step, Yaniv, but I just want to show you inside this store [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=811.7s)]
*  the destruction. And actually this is an explosion that happened less than an hour ago. I mean, [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=816.58s)]
*  we have just arrived on the scene, but you see the amount of destruction in this store. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=820.96s)]
*  This is a convenience store, a corner store that has things like paper towels and flip-flops [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=826.3000000000001s)]
*  and batteries, things that people would need if they're living in this area of Tel Aviv. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=831.38s)]
*  And it has been completely destroyed. Like I said before, this is an area that is packed [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=836.04s)]
*  with civilians. There are no military locations close to where we are. We will have more information [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=841.68s)]
*  to report, hopefully, later in the day about the significance of this area. I don't want [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=850.24s)]
*  to get into it now, but people will talk about it later today, certainly. In terms of what [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=854.9599999999999s)]
*  happens now, these first responders will stay on the scene. They'll try to gather as much [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=860.56s)]
*  information as they can from people who came out of these buildings to know if anyone was [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=865.06s)]
*  trapped. Just give me one second. Stay with me here. Can you just tell us a little bit [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=869.14s)]
*  about the scene here and what you've seen? A little bit in English. We're live to America. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=881.18s)]
*  What should people know? Just in English. Introduce it. What should people know about [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=888.18s)]
*  what happened here? There is a missile hit in the street and there is damage for some [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=897.3399999999999s)]
*  building. We take off all the fire and search after injuries and trample the people. Are [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=904.6999999999999s)]
*  you worried that there could be people under the rubble? Yeah. Until we not get into the [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=912.34s)]
*  building, we are still worried that there is some people. Thank you so much for speaking [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=923.22s)]
*  with us. You can see this is a local fire personnel. There are medics on the scene, [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=928.4200000000001s)]
*  but he just there talked about what is the biggest concern right now, Ashley, and that [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=936.1800000000001s)]
*  is the possibility that there are people trapped under the rubble and debris from these [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=939.74s)]
*  collapsed buildings. That's really in the minutes and hours ahead. These are critical [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=945.78s)]
*  minutes because if people are injured and they survive the initial blast, they want [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=951.72s)]
*  to get to them as quickly as possible. In the distance, they're currently setting up [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=955.42s)]
*  a tent. We have seen this tent before. This tent is used for people to check in in the [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=958.82s)]
*  neighborhood and they will give their names and addresses and any relatives or friends [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=964.38s)]
*  or family members that they have in the area to ensure that they can account for everyone. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=970.4599999999999s)]
*  Right now, there are people unaccounted for. You heard directly from that local fire chief. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=974.74s)]
*  Still as we speak right now, Ashley, and you're going to see it in a moment, they are bringing [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=980.06s)]
*  in stretchers preparing for the worst. We'll be very careful about what we show you here [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=983.54s)]
*  live. In the distance, there are ambulances and they're waiting to just see. Here's one [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=988.38s)]
*  of those orange stretchers that's being taken in by these first responders on the scene [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=994.28s)]
*  who immediately rushed to this site. Again, when we arrived here, everything was on fire. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=998.4s)]
*  You couldn't even see the buildings. There were so many flames. As the firefighters got [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=1002.68s)]
*  them extinguished, we started to gather more about what happened here, which was clearly [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=1006.24s)]
*  a direct hit of an Iranian ballistic missile. Ashley? Yeah, and I just want to point out [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=1012.04s)]
*  to anyone who's watching, whatever you're seeing on your screen behind Trey and the [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=1016.48s)]
*  whatever it looks like in this scene, it is a million times worse in real life where Trey [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=1023.28s)]
*  is. You couldn't even fathom to explain and describe. I mean, you're doing a great job [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=1028.6s)]
*  of describing what you're seeing, Trey, and we obviously want you to stay safe. It's just [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=1036.14s)]
*  hard to see and it's hard to watch. It's hard to talk about. But also, I want to talk about [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=1043.6200000000001s)]
*  these first responders. They are worn completely thin doing this. What have they been telling [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=1047.2s)]
*  you with the first responders and the crews, the rescue crews that you're talking to? [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=1055.04s)]
*  How are they feeling? Because this is very tough on them. Yeah, Ashley, it's all hands [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=1059.4s)]
*  on deck for these crews. They are using the Army and first responder units in the Army [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=1065.24s)]
*  to respond to these scenes. And I talked to a few guys yesterday at a different site in [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=1072.4s)]
*  central Israel, guys about my age, and I said, look, are you guys in the Army all the time? [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=1077.2s)]
*  And they said, no, we're in what's called Miluim, reserve duty here. And they worked [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=1083.2s)]
*  in high tech jobs in Tel Aviv and they have gone into the Army. They were called up because [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=1088.44s)]
*  of this war that has now erupted between Israel and Iran. And they were at a site basically [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=1093.8400000000001s)]
*  saying, we never thought we were going to have to use these skills, just given the fact [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=1098.72s)]
*  that their unit is an emergency unit in the Army. It's a last resort for when other teams [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=1102.92s)]
*  are overwhelmed, firefighters and medics in the area. And so the fact that they were called [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=1109.16s)]
*  up and responding to scenes, digging through rubble, looking for survivors, it speaks to [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=1113.44s)]
*  just how challenging this moment is for Israel. And again, as we speak, the Israelis are continuing [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=1118.38s)]
*  airstrikes against positions inside of Iran. And Iranian officials earlier in the day, [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=1124.24s)]
*  just yesterday, talked about the fact that they're not willing to stop firing these ballistic [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=1129.68s)]
*  missiles and the Israelis have indicated they're not willing to stop striking Iran. So this [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=1134.42s)]
*  is far from over. And the reality is, is that these major population centers like Tel Aviv [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=1139.18s)]
*  are going to continue to pay a very heavy price with these missiles raining down. When [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=1146.4s)]
*  this explosion happened, we were in a shelter in Tel Aviv, relatively far from here, not [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=1150.64s)]
*  walking distance. And it shook the entire building that we were in. And I talked to [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=1158.2s)]
*  a few people I know that live around here and they said something terrible has happened. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=1163.48s)]
*  They could hear it, they could feel it. When these strikes happen, it shakes the ground [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=1168.72s)]
*  and it destroys all of the buildings in its path, in the blast radius of something like [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=1173.0400000000002s)]
*  this. And again, as we get more light here, the scene is coming into reality. The aftermath [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=1178.9199999999998s)]
*  of this strike is coming into reality. And as you heard from that fire chief directly, [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=1186.24s)]
*  Ashley, their biggest concern is that there are Israeli civilians trapped under the rubble. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=1192.1599999999999s)]
*  Trey, I don't know if you're seeing what I'm seeing, but I'm seeing a baby that looks [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=1197.76s)]
*  probably about eight months old being brought out and it is absolutely heartbreaking. We're [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=1202.56s)]
*  going to actually move positions if you can stay with us here. Yeah, of course. They're [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=1210.36s)]
*  bringing babies out, they're bringing kids out. I mean, this is just from what I'm seeing [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=1214.72s)]
*  in your shot now. I'm sure there's tons of children being brought out with their families [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=1220.28s)]
*  that you're seeing right now. We're leaving. Yes, and that's part of what we're trying [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=1226.08s)]
*  to do here is get a better picture of that. And it's a bit of negotiation here with these [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=1233.8s)]
*  first responders. Of course, it's a very tense scene. But when you move in these areas, their [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=1239.36s)]
*  biggest concern is that there are buildings that could collapse. There are... And... Okay, [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=1247.8s)]
*  just one second. Stay with me, Ashley. Just stay with me, Ashley. We're trying to get [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=1255.8s)]
*  to that area that you are discussing where people are being taken. And so we're just [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=1261.24s)]
*  walking here in Tel Aviv. But again, you're going to see the tent that I talked about [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=1265.8s)]
*  as we walk by here. And actually this is important to explain as we're live here, Ashley. The [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=1271.76s)]
*  tent off to my right here is used by teams that are trained in first response. They are [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=1276.44s)]
*  have computers and they have information about the local residents so that they can try to [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=1285.04s)]
*  start accounting for people. And just stay with me here, Ashley, because we just need [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=1290.6s)]
*  to watch where we're going. You're going to see a lot of first responders in this area. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=1296.32s)]
*  These are the teams that are waiting for people that are being taken out. Are these medic [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=1304.46s)]
*  teams, Frank? Just give me one moment. Yes, these are medic teams. And I'm going to have... [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=1309.32s)]
*  I'm going to show you a different vantage point here. You can see down here, these are [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=1313.44s)]
*  all medics from United Hatzalah. And just stay with me. I just need to talk to the team [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=1316.88s)]
*  for one second, Ashley. We're going to stand right here. Here, okay? Okay. No, no, no. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=1323.68s)]
*  And so we're just moving back a little bit here as these teams continue to work. But [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=1334.44s)]
*  I'll just show you a little bit more damage across the street here, Ashley. Again, this [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=1339.16s)]
*  speaks to the blast radius when these things happen. And just be mindful of some of these [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=1342.76s)]
*  signs when you shoot this direction. And if you look down here, you're going to see a [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=1350.24s)]
*  lot of damage to storefronts. You can hear those alarms that are going off. And we won't [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=1356.84s)]
*  stay in this location too long as to not... to keep it so loud. But again, behind me in [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=1362.32s)]
*  the distance, there are teams still going through this debris, looking for any survivors [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=1369.0s)]
*  that may be trapped still under the rubble. Ashley? You know, I'm seeing just in the video [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=1373.76s)]
*  box next to you, it looks like an older woman being brought out. How many people... Like [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=1380.84s)]
*  I said, this is just what I'm seeing from the video that you guys are shooting right [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=1387.4s)]
*  now. How many people are you seeing them bring out right now? I can't see the video that [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=1390.84s)]
*  you are showing. And from what we understand, there are multiple... At this vantage point, [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=1397.9599999999998s)]
*  we are not. And we also understand there are multiple impact scenes. And just stay with [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=1404.1999999999998s)]
*  me, Ashley. I'm going to get away from this loud noise so that you can hear me a little [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=1409.4399999999998s)]
*  bit better. We understand that there are multiple impact scenes. And so it may be somewhere [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=1412.08s)]
*  else in central Israel. It may be in a location close to here. And I'm just going to show [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=1418.32s)]
*  you here as these teams of first responders, they have all of this gear ready. They're [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=1423.36s)]
*  prepared for these scenarios. They're often considered worst-case scenarios, but they [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=1427.6s)]
*  are prepared. They're ready. And that is what we're seeing now, the plan into action. But [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=1433.28s)]
*  I think what is the most important point to this... And I'm just going to show you this [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=1439.9199999999998s)]
*  area. And before I show it to you, you need to stay... One second, Ashley. Stay pointed [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=1443.8799999999999s)]
*  here. I'm going to give you some instructions, because again, I don't want to give away the [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=1448.3999999999999s)]
*  location that we're at. Try to just shoot the front of this location. But if you look into [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=1451.0s)]
*  here, wrong direction, into here, you will see that this is a coffee shop. There's no [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=1458.16s)]
*  sign. It doesn't tell you the exact location, but it's a coffee shop. It's where people [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=1463.3600000000001s)]
*  gather. And it's actually a relatively new coffee shop. This is two blocks away from [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=1468.04s)]
*  the epicenter of this blast, where still as we speak, and we'll pan over here, they are [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=1473.48s)]
*  trying to get the situation under control. I'm not sure where those images... And actually [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=1481.28s)]
*  here there's a dog that you're going to see over here. I think that's just someone else's [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=1491.3600000000001s)]
*  dog. But you asked earlier about something that I'll give you the answer to now. As we're [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=1495.76s)]
*  kind of moving here, I'm thinking about a lot of things at one time. You asked earlier [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=1499.68s)]
*  about the first responders, Ashley. And to tell you about them, they're people, most [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=1503.4s)]
*  of them who have day jobs in high tech, where they work in bars or restaurants. And they [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=1508.6s)]
*  have volunteered in many cases to come into a reserve role during this war and to help [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=1514.6799999999998s)]
*  and do what they can. And so today we were at the scene and they were in a circle and [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=1521.52s)]
*  they were basically trying to keep their spirits high, understanding that the work that they [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=1527.7199999999998s)]
*  were about to do is some of the most horrific work that you could imagine, taking people's [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=1531.56s)]
*  loved ones from under the debris in the aftermath of a ballistic missile strike. And that's [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=1536.2s)]
*  exactly what is happening here behind me in Tel Aviv today, following the latest strike. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=1541.84s)]
*  And so when we think about what they go through, we've seen a lot of this firsthand. It's challenging [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=1546.84s)]
*  to process. And there was a dog earlier today actually that they brought. It was a resilience [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=1552.24s)]
*  dog. But the first responders were going over to it and the dog's name was June and it was [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=1557.12s)]
*  a black lab with long hair. And they were petting it. And it was just this moment of [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=1561.2s)]
*  peace amid so much chaos here that reminded me of what this is all for in terms of responding [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=1565.24s)]
*  to these scenes. It's about trying to make people feel safe and comfortable. And so we [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=1574.1200000000001s)]
*  talk about what it's for, why these first responders do what they do. That's why, because [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=1579.1200000000001s)]
*  they want to be in a situation where they can give back to their community and ensure [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=1583.68s)]
*  they can help in any way possible amid this war. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=1587.64s)]
*  Yeah, it's a total hands on deck with everyone there. Like you said, they have other [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=1590.0s)]
*  jobs. They're just they're just trying to help out. And that was my question. Are they [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=1595.08s)]
*  how many first responders do they have? But if they're coming from other jobs and that's [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=1599.6799999999998s)]
*  just them helping out, that makes total sense. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=1603.3999999999999s)]
*  Trey Yngst, thank you so much for the work you're doing down there and giving us some [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QahoNqHYJrM&t=1606.32s)]
