# Trump is still in Iran’s ‘crosshairs,’ Dan Hoffman warns
**Fox News - World News:** [July 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpMt5t0edTM)
*  President Trump already living his life in the bullseye after narrowly escaping death last year in Butler, Pennsylvania [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpMt5t0edTM&t=0.0s)]
*  And now having a target on his back and revenge for the death of Iranian general Sulaimani [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpMt5t0edTM&t=5.88s)]
*  That was from years ago Dana [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpMt5t0edTM&t=10.78s)]
*  And now we're learning new details about the severity of the threats against his life [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpMt5t0edTM&t=12.22s)]
*  During the presidential campaign and author Josh Dawsey told us this yesterday [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpMt5t0edTM&t=16.64s)]
*  You have some reporting in your book also about the Iranian threat the president Trump [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpMt5t0edTM&t=21.52s)]
*  It's not over I [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpMt5t0edTM&t=27.32s)]
*  Don't know how serious it is. I don't know how close they can get to him. What can you share about that? [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpMt5t0edTM&t=29.52s)]
*  Well, they certainly have an elevated level of protection around him even compared to other presidents [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpMt5t0edTM&t=36.12s)]
*  But I will say on the campaign trial what we found was they had kill teams in the United States the intelligence folks [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpMt5t0edTM&t=40.68s)]
*  You're telling them folks in the United States who want to kill him [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpMt5t0edTM&t=46.08s)]
*  Jillian Turner live the State Department picks up our reporting now and Jillian. Good morning to you [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpMt5t0edTM&t=50.56s)]
*  Good morning to you Bill and Dana. So President Trump is now being targeted by Iranian death fatwas including ones coming [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpMt5t0edTM&t=55.42s)]
*  directly from Iranian government officials this all the more astounding because it comes as [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpMt5t0edTM&t=63.660000000000004s)]
*  Washington and Tehran are reportedly hoping to rejigger nuclear negotiations [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpMt5t0edTM&t=70.54s)]
*  Take a look at this bill from an advisor to Iran's ayatollah. He says quote [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpMt5t0edTM&t=76.26s)]
*  Trump can no longer sunbathe in Mar-a-Lago because while he's lying down a micro drone [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpMt5t0edTM&t=83.36000000000001s)]
*  Might target and strike him right in the navel [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpMt5t0edTM&t=89.32000000000001s)]
*  This is not the first time we have seen something like this an Iranian assassination plot was uncovered just weeks before the now infamous [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpMt5t0edTM&t=92.80000000000001s)]
*  Butler, Pennsylvania rally [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpMt5t0edTM&t=100.76s)]
*  Nevertheless the president yesterday didn't sound overly concerned [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpMt5t0edTM&t=103.24000000000001s)]
*  When he was asked about this new threat take a listen [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpMt5t0edTM&t=108.24000000000001s)]
*  Do you think that's a real threat and when it's the last time he went sunbathing anyway, I've been a long time [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpMt5t0edTM&t=111.96s)]
*  It's been a long time. I don't know. Maybe I was around seven or so. I'm not too big into it [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpMt5t0edTM&t=117.55999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I guess it's a threat I'm not sure it's a threat actually buddy, perhaps it is [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpMt5t0edTM&t=127.32s)]
*  So one watchdog group United against nuclear Iran is demanding immediate sanctions now on any Iranian clerics or [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpMt5t0edTM&t=133.92s)]
*  Organizations that have issued any fatwas at all fatwa being a legal decree that calls for the torture and assassination of [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpMt5t0edTM&t=142.32s)]
*  President Trump the last fatwa against an American citizen was Salman Rushdie. It nearly cost him his life [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpMt5t0edTM&t=149.51999999999998s)]
*  He was attacked. You might remember bill on stage [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpMt5t0edTM&t=155.76s)]
*  While giving remarks during the summer two years ago at Chita at the Chitaqua [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpMt5t0edTM&t=159.07999999999998s)]
*  Institution it was pretty terrifying not just for the people who were there in the audience, but for everybody in America [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpMt5t0edTM&t=164.0s)]
*  It's important to note bill. It's not just the president that faces threats from Iran [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpMt5t0edTM&t=169.79999999999998s)]
*  There is a level 4 travel warning in place here from the State Department telling Americans not to go there [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpMt5t0edTM&t=174.92s)]
*  No matter your nationality whether Iran and Iranian American or otherwise for any reason [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpMt5t0edTM&t=179.76s)]
*  Okay, Julian thanks Julian Turner at the State Department there serious stuff Dana [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpMt5t0edTM&t=185.64s)]
*  I'm a woman this Dan Hoffman is a former CIA chief of station and a Fox News contributor [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpMt5t0edTM&t=189.48s)]
*  Let's listen to a little bit more from Josh Dossi [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpMt5t0edTM&t=194.2s)]
*  Who was on with this yesterday talking about the extraordinary lanes that security services were trying to go through once they realized [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpMt5t0edTM&t=196.35999999999999s)]
*  This threat against the president [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpMt5t0edTM&t=201.79999999999998s)]
*  They were flying decoy planes all over the country because they were worried about missiles [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpMt5t0edTM&t=204.0s)]
*  The Iranian threats towards President Trump people were saying where the campaign was paranoid this that and the other but they were getting real [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpMt5t0edTM&t=208.56s)]
*  Intelligence and real information that there was something here that they had to be extraordinarily careful about what about now [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpMt5t0edTM&t=214.78s)]
*  I don't know the current threats towards him now other than I mean [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpMt5t0edTM&t=220.14s)]
*  There's no reason to believe after he bombed their nuclear sites that they would be less interested [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpMt5t0edTM&t=224.26s)]
*  Anyway, what can you tell us about the Iranians and their desire apparently to kill the president of the United States? [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpMt5t0edTM&t=229.98s)]
*  Well, Dane, I think there's no question that that President Trump is still in Iran's crosshairs [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpMt5t0edTM&t=238.78s)]
*  And that's why it's so important that our intelligence community [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpMt5t0edTM&t=243.46s)]
*  collect intelligence [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpMt5t0edTM&t=247.18s)]
*  On those threats so that we can preempt them before any harm is caused to the president that means working very effectively with state local [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpMt5t0edTM&t=248.94s)]
*  And federal law enforcement this public threat from the advisor senior advice Iranian advisor [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpMt5t0edTM&t=256.9s)]
*  However, I think is more of a and not so sophisticated influence operation [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpMt5t0edTM&t=264.5s)]
*  Look Israel has decimated Iran's proxy terrorist networks as well as their air defenses [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpMt5t0edTM&t=269.74s)]
*  We have reestablished escalation dominance after bombing Iran's nuclear sites [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpMt5t0edTM&t=275.18s)]
*  Iran doesn't have a whole lot of leverage going into the negotiations that we need to end their nuclear program for good [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpMt5t0edTM&t=280.26000000000005s)]
*  And this is a way of Iran [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpMt5t0edTM&t=286.48s)]
*  Publicly flaunting their capability to strike us not just the president remember that they've tried to kill former national security advisor John Bolton and former [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpMt5t0edTM&t=289.02000000000004s)]
*  Secretary of State Mike Pompeo [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpMt5t0edTM&t=297.34000000000003s)]
*  They are the world's leading sponsor of terrorism the al-qaeda leader safe al-adil is currently enjoying [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpMt5t0edTM&t=299.78000000000003s)]
*  Safe haven in Iran and so this is the message from Iran the overarching message that they can still hurt us [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpMt5t0edTM&t=307.02000000000004s)]
*  They're just trying I think to establish some leverage in advance of those anticipated negotiations. Yeah, Dan [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpMt5t0edTM&t=313.46000000000004s)]
*  That's very interesting you mentioned Pompeo and Bolton and waiting for more on that [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpMt5t0edTM&t=319.06s)]
*  There's in the threat of sleeper cells in America and you know the intelligence agencies are buckling down [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpMt5t0edTM&t=322.94000000000005s)]
*  To try and find them if that's the case, but you got this man in Rhode Island now [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpMt5t0edTM&t=328.38s)]
*  Who was what he was rooted out through a social media post? What do you know about that? [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpMt5t0edTM&t=332.5s)]
*  Yeah, well that one [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpMt5t0edTM&t=338.62s)]
*  You know he popped his head above water there with the social media post and that gave us the opportunity to find and fix his [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpMt5t0edTM&t=339.82s)]
*  location and deal with it contrast that with the threat to the president's life the assassination assassination attempt in [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpMt5t0edTM&t=347.08s)]
*  Pennsylvania and and the challenge there and finding a lone wolf so you've got to be prepared [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpMt5t0edTM&t=354.5s)]
*  With security around the president at the point of attack [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpMt5t0edTM&t=360.18s)]
*  But you really want to get to those threats way out as we like to say left of boom [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpMt5t0edTM&t=364.06s)]
*  That means scouring social media being into the networks [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpMt5t0edTM&t=368.86s)]
*  the nexus between overseas threats that we saw with Farhad Shaqari who was the [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpMt5t0edTM&t=373.02s)]
*  ethnic Afghan whom we deported in [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpMt5t0edTM&t=378.65999999999997s)]
*  2008 and was living in Iran and was put up to assassinate President Trump during the campaign that was a fantastic [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpMt5t0edTM&t=381.3s)]
*  operation by the FBI [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpMt5t0edTM&t=387.74s)]
*  to end that [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpMt5t0edTM&t=390.34s)]
*  Operation before any harm was caused to the president than a candidate Dan Hoffman with all that insight we appreciate your expertise [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpMt5t0edTM&t=392.09999999999997s)]
