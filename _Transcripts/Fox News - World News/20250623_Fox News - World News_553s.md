# BREAKING: Qatar closes airspace as world awaits possible Iranian retaliation
**Fox News - World News:** [June 23, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBTICDCSwcU)
*  Operation Midnight Hammer was an epic operation that caught Iran completely off guard. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBTICDCSwcU&t=0.0s)]
*  As they say, our bomber pilots are now back home in Missouri. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBTICDCSwcU&t=5.5s)]
*  And President Trump thanked them in a post last night for a job well done! [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBTICDCSwcU&t=9.5s)]
*  Exclamation point all caps. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBTICDCSwcU&t=13.9s)]
*  We're learning more about the many levels of deception and decoy. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBTICDCSwcU&t=15.98s)]
*  It was like a James Bond movie that went into this mission. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBTICDCSwcU&t=19.86s)]
*  The real strike force went east toward the heavily fortified nuclear facility at Fordow. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBTICDCSwcU&t=23.14s)]
*  Those B-2 bombers dropped a dozen bunker buster bombs on Fordow alone, each weighing 30,000 [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBTICDCSwcU&t=29.54s)]
*  pounds. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBTICDCSwcU&t=36.4s)]
*  And they never once encountered enemy fire. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBTICDCSwcU&t=37.4s)]
*  Chief National Correspondent, Security Correspondent Jennifer Griffin is at the Pentagon. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBTICDCSwcU&t=40.379999999999995s)]
*  I tell you, you just can't stop being wowed by what we pulled off, Jennifer. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBTICDCSwcU&t=44.76s)]
*  An absolutely flawless mission. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBTICDCSwcU&t=51.120000000000005s)]
*  But Harris, U.S. military forces are now on high alert across the Middle East, expecting [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBTICDCSwcU&t=53.480000000000004s)]
*  an imminent response from Iran. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBTICDCSwcU&t=57.78s)]
*  The U.S. Navy actively planning its response should Iran's Revolutionary Guard Navy mine [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBTICDCSwcU&t=60.099999999999994s)]
*  the Strait of Hormuz. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBTICDCSwcU&t=64.88s)]
*  Few here at the Pentagon think this is over, despite Saturday's flawless military strike [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBTICDCSwcU&t=66.52s)]
*  on Iran's three nuclear facilities, a plan that has been honed and practiced since 2008. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBTICDCSwcU&t=71.64s)]
*  U.S. B-2 pilots have been practicing this 37-hour round-trip flight to the Middle East [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBTICDCSwcU&t=77.46s)]
*  for years. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBTICDCSwcU&t=83.7s)]
*  B-2 bombers dropped a dozen bunker buster bombs on Fordow. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBTICDCSwcU&t=85.64s)]
*  As recently as last year, the U.S. Navy has been testing against hardened targets. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBTICDCSwcU&t=89.24000000000001s)]
*  This operation underscores the unmatched capabilities and global reach of the United States military. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBTICDCSwcU&t=92.44s)]
*  As the president clearly said last night, no other in the military, no other military [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBTICDCSwcU&t=100.14s)]
*  in the world could have done this. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBTICDCSwcU&t=105.9s)]
*  125 U.S. warplanes, each B-2 refueled in midair three to four times each way on the nonstop [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBTICDCSwcU&t=108.82000000000001s)]
*  18-hour flight from Missouri. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBTICDCSwcU&t=116.32000000000001s)]
*  An air refueling bridge across the Mediterranean and Middle East, 14 GBU-57 bunker buster [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBTICDCSwcU&t=118.62s)]
*  bombs among the 75 satellite-guided munitions dropped, and 30 Tomahawk missiles fired from [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBTICDCSwcU&t=124.74000000000001s)]
*  an Ohio-class submarine 400 miles away, which stayed in the air one hour and 40 minutes [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBTICDCSwcU&t=130.84s)]
*  time to drop after the last B-2 struck in Fordow. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBTICDCSwcU&t=137.0s)]
*  Captain Todd Sawhill, an intelligence targeting officer focused on this problem for years, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBTICDCSwcU&t=141.18s)]
*  was asked whether the Tomahawks could destroy Isfahan and the deep tunnels where the Iranian [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBTICDCSwcU&t=146.26s)]
*  uranium conversion takes place. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBTICDCSwcU&t=152.26s)]
*  No. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBTICDCSwcU&t=155.22s)]
*  In that case, it's extremely limited, because those weapons are really designed to go after [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBTICDCSwcU&t=157.7s)]
*  surface targets. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBTICDCSwcU&t=161.66s)]
*  They don't have much penetration capability. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBTICDCSwcU&t=162.66s)]
*  The problem is, like you mentioned, the mountain, which is deep under hard granite and unreachable [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBTICDCSwcU&t=165.12s)]
*  by conventional munitions, to include the GBU-57. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBTICDCSwcU&t=169.94s)]
*  Isfahan is arguably a tougher target, Harris, than Fordow. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBTICDCSwcU&t=173.82s)]
*  The U.S. will be using signals intelligence and other means to sniff for nuclear particles [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBTICDCSwcU&t=177.3s)]
*  at the sites, along with Israeli human intelligence on the ground, to give the final bomb damage [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBTICDCSwcU&t=182.02s)]
*  assessment, Harris. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBTICDCSwcU&t=187.02s)]
*  Yeah, and the world awaits to see what that will hold. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBTICDCSwcU&t=188.02s)]
*  Jennifer, we have breaking news right now, and it's partially on what you were talking [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBTICDCSwcU&t=190.58s)]
*  Qatar's foreign minister now has just announced that he's shutting down its airspace to all [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBTICDCSwcU&t=195.0s)]
*  commercial flights indefinitely. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBTICDCSwcU&t=199.24s)]
*  And we know just a few minutes ago that the U.S. issued a shelter-and-place order for [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBTICDCSwcU&t=201.52s)]
*  Americans in Qatar. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBTICDCSwcU&t=205.48s)]
*  What does all of this tell you? [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBTICDCSwcU&t=207.36s)]
*  Well, there's very significant intelligence and a warning that Iran could strike at any [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBTICDCSwcU&t=208.68s)]
*  time an imminent threat to Qatar. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBTICDCSwcU&t=216.08s)]
*  Of course, Qatar is where Al Udeid is. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBTICDCSwcU&t=220.24s)]
*  It's the largest U.S. military base in the Middle East. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBTICDCSwcU&t=222.5s)]
*  Normally, there would be 10,000 U.S. troops stationed there. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBTICDCSwcU&t=225.46s)]
*  Last week, we reported that most of the aircraft had been moved from Al Udeid. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBTICDCSwcU&t=229.02s)]
*  However, those missiles, crews and ballistics, short and medium-range, from Iran would take [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBTICDCSwcU&t=233.9s)]
*  just a few minutes to reach Qatar. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBTICDCSwcU&t=239.54s)]
*  And there's also the possibility of swarming drones. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBTICDCSwcU&t=242.22s)]
*  So right now, high alert, inside Qatar. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBTICDCSwcU&t=244.58s)]
*  We've seen the warnings at the U.S. Embassy as well as at other embassies across Qatar. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBTICDCSwcU&t=247.6s)]
*  I'm so glad you're on with us at this moment, because following a U.S. security alert for [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBTICDCSwcU&t=252.76000000000002s)]
*  U.S. nationals in Qatar out of an abundance of caution, we've recommended that British [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBTICDCSwcU&t=257.44s)]
*  nationals in Qatar also shelter in place until further notice. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBTICDCSwcU&t=262.0s)]
*  So this is ramping up, and what we do know is our military is at the ready. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBTICDCSwcU&t=265.08s)]
*  They've been pulling into place for a couple of weeks now, even. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBTICDCSwcU&t=270.6s)]
*  Jennifer, thank you very much. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBTICDCSwcU&t=273.76s)]
*  I always appreciate your reporting. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBTICDCSwcU&t=275.74s)]
*  More on the breaking news. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBTICDCSwcU&t=277.74s)]
*  Out of that region, KT McFarland served as deputy national security adviser during President [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBTICDCSwcU&t=279.38s)]
*  Trump's first administration. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBTICDCSwcU&t=284.22s)]
*  So hitting our troops in that region, Iran has done so many times before, over 200 times [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBTICDCSwcU&t=286.22s)]
*  under President Biden. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBTICDCSwcU&t=293.82000000000005s)]
*  It is time we respond. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBTICDCSwcU&t=295.22s)]
*  What do you foresee just out of these warnings from Qatar? [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBTICDCSwcU&t=298.02000000000004s)]
*  Well, Iran's going to retaliate. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBTICDCSwcU&t=300.66s)]
*  The question is, how are they going to retaliate and how successful will they be? [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBTICDCSwcU&t=303.8s)]
*  The most they could do is to try to take out U.S. forces or attack U.S. forces in the region. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBTICDCSwcU&t=307.76s)]
*  But as you pointed out, we're ready for that. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBTICDCSwcU&t=312.92s)]
*  We've brought more assets into the region to defend our bases, our people. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBTICDCSwcU&t=314.76s)]
*  We've taken civilians out of the region, so to make a smaller target, if you will. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBTICDCSwcU&t=318.71999999999997s)]
*  And we've also, particularly Israel, has degraded the capability of Iran to have those kind [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBTICDCSwcU&t=324.91999999999996s)]
*  of attacks. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBTICDCSwcU&t=329.4s)]
*  So we're ready, but we're expecting to take the blow, but we're ready. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBTICDCSwcU&t=330.4s)]
*  Iran could also go after Israeli facilities in the region or bomb Israel again. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBTICDCSwcU&t=333.46s)]
*  But again, their ability to do so has been greatly reduced. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBTICDCSwcU&t=338.21999999999997s)]
*  We know they're going to do something. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBTICDCSwcU&t=341.38s)]
*  The question is what and would it trigger the response that President Trump has talked [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBTICDCSwcU&t=342.78s)]
*  about? [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBTICDCSwcU&t=347.7s)]
*  They've got to all be nervous. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBTICDCSwcU&t=348.7s)]
*  I mean, they've shown that Donald Trump is showing that he's not a patsy. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBTICDCSwcU&t=349.7s)]
*  He's not going to believe that, oh, well, we want to negotiate. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBTICDCSwcU&t=353.29999999999995s)]
*  He's going to do what he has to do to protect Americans. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBTICDCSwcU&t=356.58s)]
*  And what I hear you getting at is they have to be really careful when they make this next [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBTICDCSwcU&t=359.46s)]
*  move. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBTICDCSwcU&t=362.66s)]
*  I mean, it's like walking on toothpicks on top of a lily pad. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBTICDCSwcU&t=363.66s)]
*  You can't be too heavy-footed or you'll go into water and you don't know how deep it [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBTICDCSwcU&t=366.8s)]
*  is. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBTICDCSwcU&t=370.40000000000003s)]
*  I mean, Trump is willing to do what is necessary, right? [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBTICDCSwcU&t=371.40000000000003s)]
*  I mean, it's just that tricky. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBTICDCSwcU&t=374.16s)]
*  I have parents from the South, so I have a lot of those little sayings. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBTICDCSwcU&t=375.76000000000005s)]
*  But look, what you're saying is they've got to try to hit us but not hit us too hard. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBTICDCSwcU&t=378.6s)]
*  I don't know if they can pull that off. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBTICDCSwcU&t=383.28000000000003s)]
*  Many of their military commanders were taken out by Israel. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBTICDCSwcU&t=384.76000000000005s)]
*  And the ones that remain know that if they, you know, they could be taken out as well. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBTICDCSwcU&t=389.46s)]
*  I mean, it's pretty clear that Assad has thoroughly penetrated the Iranian military, the Iranian [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBTICDCSwcU&t=392.7s)]
*  civilian leadership. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBTICDCSwcU&t=397.9s)]
*  And if they try to do something that would, especially something that would cause the [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBTICDCSwcU&t=399.65999999999997s)]
*  loss of American life, you know, they might as well pull the trigger on their own heads. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBTICDCSwcU&t=402.97999999999996s)]
*  What President Trump was interested in when he talked about regime change. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBTICDCSwcU&t=406.7s)]
*  Now, regime change in the George W. Bush, Barack Obama senses, American Marines go in, [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBTICDCSwcU&t=409.73999999999995s)]
*  we get rid of the guy, we put our own government in. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBTICDCSwcU&t=416.29999999999995s)]
*  We try to figure out how they should become a modern American democracy. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBTICDCSwcU&t=418.52s)]
*  And it's never worked. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBTICDCSwcU&t=421.64s)]
*  It didn't work in Afghanistan, didn't work in Iraq, didn't work in Libya. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBTICDCSwcU&t=422.64s)]
*  President Trump has said to the Iranian people, look, you should have leaders who make your [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBTICDCSwcU&t=426.76s)]
*  country great again. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBTICDCSwcU&t=431.03999999999996s)]
*  It's up to you. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBTICDCSwcU&t=432.03999999999996s)]
*  And he said consistently throughout his two terms that it's up to the people to decide [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBTICDCSwcU&t=433.64s)]
*  their own country. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBTICDCSwcU&t=439.08s)]
*  You know, you decide what kind of a government you want, what leaders you want, how you worship [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBTICDCSwcU&t=440.08s)]
*  your God. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBTICDCSwcU&t=444.67999999999995s)]
*  We, it's up to you. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBTICDCSwcU&t=445.67999999999995s)]
*  If you want to do regime change, that's on you. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBTICDCSwcU&t=447.42s)]
*  But we might applaud it if you do this in the case of Iran. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBTICDCSwcU&t=449.52000000000004s)]
*  So a few minutes ago when Ambassador Danone was here, he was telling me, and it seems [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBTICDCSwcU&t=452.52000000000004s)]
*  like a point of desperation. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBTICDCSwcU&t=457.72s)]
*  We were both agreeing off camera. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBTICDCSwcU&t=458.72s)]
*  And then the conversation ensued. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBTICDCSwcU&t=462.3s)]
*  He said that they are hiring prisoners coming out of jails in Israel. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBTICDCSwcU&t=464.26s)]
*  Iran is doing this, trying to find the angriest among them to see if they can flip them as [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBTICDCSwcU&t=468.76s)]
*  assets and give them menial tasks, he said. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBTICDCSwcU&t=472.96000000000004s)]
*  They'll send them, you know, take a picture over here. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBTICDCSwcU&t=475.68s)]
*  They'll get a little bit of change for that until they work them up into doing something worse. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBTICDCSwcU&t=477.46s)]
*  You know, that's an act of desperation, right? [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBTICDCSwcU&t=483.85999999999996s)]
*  I mean, the Iranian, the Ayatollah we know is in hiding. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBTICDCSwcU&t=486.26s)]
*  He's already listed. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBTICDCSwcU&t=489.62s)]
*  He already has decided he's going to be a martyr. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBTICDCSwcU&t=490.62s)]
*  He's 86 years old. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBTICDCSwcU&t=492.73999999999995s)]
*  He's dying of cancer. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBTICDCSwcU&t=494.14s)]
*  What a great way to go out. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBTICDCSwcU&t=495.46s)]
*  He's already designated three people who would be his successors. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBTICDCSwcU&t=496.46s)]
*  But you have to wonder what's the conversations they're having within the leadership group [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBTICDCSwcU&t=500.02s)]
*  of Iran. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBTICDCSwcU&t=503.29999999999995s)]
*  Because of the generals looking at each other and say, I've had this job for 48 hours now. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBTICDCSwcU&t=504.62s)]
*  My predecessor was assassinated. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBTICDCSwcU&t=508.32s)]
*  I want to keep this job. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBTICDCSwcU&t=510.4s)]
*  Did I sign up for this? [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBTICDCSwcU&t=511.8s)]
*  Did I sign up for martyrdom? [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBTICDCSwcU&t=513.0s)]
*  And maybe, as President Trump says, the Iranian people want to make Iran great again. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBTICDCSwcU&t=515.24s)]
*  President Trump's offering an opportunity to come to the negotiating table and extend [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBTICDCSwcU&t=520.28s)]
*  the hand of freedom and peace. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBTICDCSwcU&t=523.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBTICDCSwcU&t=525.52s)]
*  And meanwhile, Iran looks for enemies within the countries that it would like to have death of. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBTICDCSwcU&t=526.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBTICDCSwcU&t=531.12s)]
*  Katie McFarland, great to have you. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBTICDCSwcU&t=532.12s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBTICDCSwcU&t=533.12s)]
*  Thank you for watching the Faulkner Focus, Outnumbered after the break. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBTICDCSwcU&t=534.12s)]
