# Levin SLAMS ‘hypocrisy’ from the ‘cabal of isolationists’
**Fox News - World News:** [June 13, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzpaXkV6EKA)
*  We bring in now the host of Life, Liberty and Levin, the great one Mark Levin, to play [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzpaXkV6EKA&t=0.0s)]
*  off Clay's point. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzpaXkV6EKA&t=4.72s)]
*  This really is an issue of moral clarity. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzpaXkV6EKA&t=6.28s)]
*  And that is, Donald Trump and Steve Witkoff and Marco Rubio, they all gave Iran an offramp. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzpaXkV6EKA&t=10.64s)]
*  They chose not to take it. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzpaXkV6EKA&t=17.32s)]
*  But Iran now has been fomenting terror, firing tens and tens of thousands of rockets. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzpaXkV6EKA&t=19.32s)]
*  Clay's been there. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzpaXkV6EKA&t=25.28s)]
*  You've been there. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzpaXkV6EKA&t=26.28s)]
*  I've been there. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzpaXkV6EKA&t=27.28s)]
*  They continue to threaten to wipe Israel and the U.S. off the map. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzpaXkV6EKA&t=28.48s)]
*  They're now targeting civilians. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzpaXkV6EKA&t=32.28s)]
*  To me, it's, you know, how many rockets would be fired into the U.S. before there was a [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzpaXkV6EKA&t=35.480000000000004s)]
*  citizen uprising demanding retribution? [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzpaXkV6EKA&t=41.480000000000004s)]
*  I'd say one. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzpaXkV6EKA&t=46.52s)]
*  What do you say? [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzpaXkV6EKA&t=47.88s)]
*  I say none. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzpaXkV6EKA&t=51.24s)]
*  Our policy right now is that if Cuba attempts to have a nuclear missile on their island, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzpaXkV6EKA&t=52.64s)]
*  we view that as a potential act of war. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzpaXkV6EKA&t=60.760000000000005s)]
*  As a potential act of war. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzpaXkV6EKA&t=63.6s)]
*  They don't have to fire anything. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzpaXkV6EKA&t=65.52s)]
*  So the hypocrisy of some of the cabal of isolationists, that the Israeli Jews should sit there and [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzpaXkV6EKA&t=68.52s)]
*  be victims again, that's just not going to happen. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzpaXkV6EKA&t=75.88s)]
*  These people are warriors. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzpaXkV6EKA&t=78.72s)]
*  We give them the greatest equipment on the face of the earth, but they are among the [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzpaXkV6EKA&t=80.48s)]
*  greatest warriors on the face of the earth, just like our men. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzpaXkV6EKA&t=83.72s)]
*  The equipment goes nowhere if you don't have great leadership, like in Afghanistan with [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzpaXkV6EKA&t=87.88000000000001s)]
*  Biden. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzpaXkV6EKA&t=92.16s)]
*  But they have a great leader. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzpaXkV6EKA&t=93.4s)]
*  His name is Netanyahu, and he's not going to stop. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzpaXkV6EKA&t=94.4s)]
*  It doesn't matter what anybody says, which is why he's so hated by the left, by the isolationists, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzpaXkV6EKA&t=96.68s)]
*  and by our enemies. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzpaXkV6EKA&t=102.88000000000001s)]
*  But we wouldn't allow anything in Cuba. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzpaXkV6EKA&t=103.88000000000001s)]
*  We wouldn't allow missiles, nuclear missiles, in Central America, anywhere where we have [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzpaXkV6EKA&t=106.64s)]
*  the Monroe Doctrine. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzpaXkV6EKA&t=110.56s)]
*  Not in Cuba, Central America, South America, period. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzpaXkV6EKA&t=112.36s)]
*  Our president has said that damn Panama Canal belongs to us. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzpaXkV6EKA&t=115.32s)]
*  You either give it back or we're going to take it by force. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzpaXkV6EKA&t=118.84s)]
*  That's a man. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzpaXkV6EKA&t=121.6s)]
*  That's a leader. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzpaXkV6EKA&t=122.6s)]
*  That's a statesman. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzpaXkV6EKA&t=123.76s)]
*  Netanyahu says, you bastards murdered our men and women. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzpaXkV6EKA&t=124.92s)]
*  You raped them. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzpaXkV6EKA&t=129.94s)]
*  You decapitated our babies. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzpaXkV6EKA&t=130.94s)]
*  You burned them alive. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzpaXkV6EKA&t=132.44s)]
*  I know there's no ceasefire. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzpaXkV6EKA&t=133.44s)]
*  We're not going to stop until we wipe you out. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzpaXkV6EKA&t=135.64s)]
*  And now we're going for the mothership. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzpaXkV6EKA&t=138.0s)]
*  The mothership had every opportunity. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzpaXkV6EKA&t=139.76s)]
*  They were thrown a lifeline by President Trump. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzpaXkV6EKA&t=141.72s)]
*  He said something simple. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzpaXkV6EKA&t=144.42s)]
*  Don't build nukes. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzpaXkV6EKA&t=146.64s)]
*  And then the cabal of isolationists said, oh, there's no proof they're building nukes, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzpaXkV6EKA&t=148.6s)]
*  but they wouldn't give it up. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzpaXkV6EKA&t=153.0s)]
*  So President Trump says, Israel, do what you got to do. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzpaXkV6EKA&t=154.48s)]
*  Now, let me tell you something. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzpaXkV6EKA&t=157.27999999999997s)]
*  What we're not seeing on TV is TV cameras in Iran. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzpaXkV6EKA&t=159.1s)]
*  You got 200 jet fighters that day and night are dropping something on something over there [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzpaXkV6EKA&t=164.52s)]
*  in Iran. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzpaXkV6EKA&t=170.60000000000002s)]
*  They must be picking that damn country to pieces. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzpaXkV6EKA&t=171.60000000000002s)]
*  That is my guess. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzpaXkV6EKA&t=174.68s)]
*  My guess is they're on offense. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzpaXkV6EKA&t=176.04000000000002s)]
*  My guess is American military and intelligence. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzpaXkV6EKA&t=177.4s)]
*  We do have IDF video that we're showing, and they're hitting their targets, including that [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzpaXkV6EKA&t=179.84s)]
*  nuclear site. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzpaXkV6EKA&t=184.0s)]
*  That's not enough. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzpaXkV6EKA&t=185.0s)]
*  Well, I'm saying we do have some proof. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzpaXkV6EKA&t=186.0s)]
*  We have evidence they're hitting their target. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzpaXkV6EKA&t=188.20000000000002s)]
*  My point is the extent of it is not being shown. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzpaXkV6EKA&t=193.32s)]
*  We see these missiles coming in, and we play it and loop it and loop it. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzpaXkV6EKA&t=196.64000000000001s)]
*  And of course, they're casualties. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzpaXkV6EKA&t=199.72s)]
*  It's terrible things happening. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzpaXkV6EKA&t=201.2s)]
*  But can you imagine 200 jet fighters? [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzpaXkV6EKA&t=203.16s)]
*  Can you imagine they own the airspace? [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzpaXkV6EKA&t=205.98s)]
*  Can you imagine they can't do anything about them? [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzpaXkV6EKA&t=210.16s)]
*  When these Islamist terrorists run out of ballistic missiles, they have nothing. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzpaXkV6EKA&t=213.62s)]
*  Nothing. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzpaXkV6EKA&t=217.92000000000002s)]
*  This isn't a ground campaign. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzpaXkV6EKA&t=218.92000000000002s)]
*  They don't have an Air Force. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzpaXkV6EKA&t=221.04s)]
*  They don't have a Navy. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzpaXkV6EKA&t=222.38s)]
*  They are finished. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzpaXkV6EKA&t=223.7s)]
*  Netanyahu knows it. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzpaXkV6EKA&t=224.7s)]
*  His generals know it. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzpaXkV6EKA&t=226.14s)]
*  They're going to pick these guys apart. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzpaXkV6EKA&t=227.7s)]
*  And I have a couple of suggestions to make. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzpaXkV6EKA&t=229.78s)]
*  Elon Musk, may I ask you to do a favor for the Iranian people? [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzpaXkV6EKA&t=231.62s)]
*  Turn on your Starlink for the Iranian people. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzpaXkV6EKA&t=236.29999999999998s)]
*  Turn it on. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzpaXkV6EKA&t=238.85999999999999s)]
*  They've shut down the internet over there because they don't want to be overthrown because [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzpaXkV6EKA&t=239.85999999999999s)]
*  it's a police state. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzpaXkV6EKA&t=243.34s)]
*  The people live under fear. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzpaXkV6EKA&t=244.85999999999999s)]
*  Turn on the Starlink. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzpaXkV6EKA&t=246.62s)]
*  That would be one of the greatest acts of humanity ever. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzpaXkV6EKA&t=247.62s)]
*  Israel, I want to tell the anti-Jew, anti-Israel cabal, Israel has nothing to apologize for. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzpaXkV6EKA&t=251.26s)]
*  They were attacked and they're going to bring this to an end come hell or high water. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzpaXkV6EKA&t=259.5s)]
*  In the Iranian regime, if there are 50 damn years of killing people, our people, our Marines, [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzpaXkV6EKA&t=263.6s)]
*  killing Israelis, killing people in Yemen and the rest of the Middle East, your day [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzpaXkV6EKA&t=270.74s)]
*  has come. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzpaXkV6EKA&t=275.1s)]
*  So I'll say what nobody else will say. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzpaXkV6EKA&t=276.1s)]
*  You ready, Sean? [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzpaXkV6EKA&t=277.62s)]
*  Israel, kick their asses on our behalf, your behalf and the rest of the world. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzpaXkV6EKA&t=279.18s)]
*  Kick it and don't give up until they're done. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzpaXkV6EKA&t=285.58s)]
*  I'm done. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzpaXkV6EKA&t=288.46s)]
*  That's why we call you the great one. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzpaXkV6EKA&t=289.46s)]
*  Mark Levin, thank you. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzpaXkV6EKA&t=292.5s)]
