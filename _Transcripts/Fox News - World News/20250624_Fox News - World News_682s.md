# 'COMPLETELY PREPOSTEROUS': Trump envoy sets the record straight on leaked intel report
**Fox News - World News:** [June 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfAPeA-_pMY)
*  So how did this ceasefire deal between Iran and Israel actually get negotiated? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfAPeA-_pMY&t=0.0s)]
*  We know President Trump was directly involved talking with Bibi Netanyahu, while Vance, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfAPeA-_pMY&t=7.3s)]
*  Rubio and my next guest talked with the Iranians. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfAPeA-_pMY&t=12.280000000000001s)]
*  Here with what happened behind the scenes is Steve Witkoff, assistant to the president [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfAPeA-_pMY&t=15.620000000000001s)]
*  and special presidential envoy for peace missions. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfAPeA-_pMY&t=19.580000000000002s)]
*  Steve, you have a lot on your plate, but you were tapped to help with this. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfAPeA-_pMY&t=23.12s)]
*  How did we go from Israel bombing Iran and our sending our B2s to—with those bunker [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfAPeA-_pMY&t=28.02s)]
*  busters to brokering this ceasefire just days later? [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfAPeA-_pMY&t=35.62s)]
*  Take us inside these talks. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfAPeA-_pMY&t=40.28s)]
*  You know, Laura, I listened to your introduction and you've got it right. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfAPeA-_pMY&t=41.82s)]
*  So many people had it wrong about the president. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfAPeA-_pMY&t=48.120000000000005s)]
*  He had an objective. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfAPeA-_pMY&t=50.739999999999995s)]
*  He wouldn't have entered the war—entered this 12-day, as he calls it, war without that [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfAPeA-_pMY&t=52.32s)]
*  objective. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfAPeA-_pMY&t=56.86s)]
*  The objective was to eliminate enrichment in Iran and weaponization capability on the [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfAPeA-_pMY&t=58.1s)]
*  part—on the part of Iran. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfAPeA-_pMY&t=64.62s)]
*  And he achieved his objective. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfAPeA-_pMY&t=66.9s)]
*  And he achieved it after 12 days. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfAPeA-_pMY&t=68.78s)]
*  And so it was never going to be a forever war. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfAPeA-_pMY&t=71.14s)]
*  It was never going to be a war just for war's sake. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfAPeA-_pMY&t=73.3s)]
*  It was a war to achieve an objective that I think most Americans should be very, very [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfAPeA-_pMY&t=76.74000000000001s)]
*  satisfied with. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfAPeA-_pMY&t=83.26s)]
*  I can tell you that I was in those discussions. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfAPeA-_pMY&t=84.86s)]
*  I watched our commander-in-chief. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfAPeA-_pMY&t=87.25999999999999s)]
*  He is—he's got this uncanny ability to understand exactly when to push the button [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfAPeA-_pMY&t=89.89999999999999s)]
*  and when to pull out. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfAPeA-_pMY&t=96.69999999999999s)]
*  He achieved his objective, and that was the end of it. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfAPeA-_pMY&t=98.61999999999999s)]
*  From the Iranian side of this, Steve, if you can share with us some of their concerns and [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfAPeA-_pMY&t=101.78s)]
*  some of their promises, given what we've seen in some of the reports with this leaked [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfAPeA-_pMY&t=110.08s)]
*  intelligence early assessment of what we know right now. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfAPeA-_pMY&t=117.12s)]
*  What did Iran actually pledge? [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfAPeA-_pMY&t=121.72s)]
*  Well, Iran, throughout—since this conflict began, we've been talking to them about [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfAPeA-_pMY&t=124.64s)]
*  having some sort of peaceful settlement. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfAPeA-_pMY&t=134.0s)]
*  And Iran's—Iran's one caveat has always been that Israel had to stop its campaign. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfAPeA-_pMY&t=137.04s)]
*  And once Israel fulfilled its objective, which they did, and once the United States fulfilled [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfAPeA-_pMY&t=144.68s)]
*  its objective, which it did, the total destruction of the enrichment capacity of the Iranian [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfAPeA-_pMY&t=150.56s)]
*  state, then the president was able to go to both parties and get a ceasefire done. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfAPeA-_pMY&t=157.48s)]
*  And by the way, the proof is in the pudding. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfAPeA-_pMY&t=164.2s)]
*  No one's shooting at each other. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfAPeA-_pMY&t=166.1s)]
*  It's over. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfAPeA-_pMY&t=168.38s)]
*  Steve, the—this leaked intel assessment, it's an early look at what was actually accomplished [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfAPeA-_pMY&t=169.38s)]
*  on the ground, and I underline early, but it was leaked. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfAPeA-_pMY&t=176.78s)]
*  Somebody decided to leak this from the DIA. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfAPeA-_pMY&t=179.7s)]
*  And it's being used in the media, and it's all over today, that, aha, Trump said it was [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfAPeA-_pMY&t=184.14000000000001s)]
*  obliterated, but it's not obliterated. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfAPeA-_pMY&t=191.22s)]
*  It's set back months, but not—it's not over from Iran's nuclear program's perspective. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfAPeA-_pMY&t=193.10000000000002s)]
*  Your reaction to that, and I assume you know what we're talking about with this leaked [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfAPeA-_pMY&t=202.02s)]
*  intel report. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfAPeA-_pMY&t=207.66000000000003s)]
*  Well, it goes without saying that leaking that type of information, whatever the information, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfAPeA-_pMY&t=208.66000000000003s)]
*  whatever side it comes out on, is outrageous. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfAPeA-_pMY&t=215.82000000000002s)]
*  It's treasonous. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfAPeA-_pMY&t=218.58s)]
*  So it ought to be investigated, and whoever did it, whoever's responsible for it, should [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfAPeA-_pMY&t=220.14000000000001s)]
*  be held accountable. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfAPeA-_pMY&t=225.5s)]
*  It could hurt lives in the future. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfAPeA-_pMY&t=227.34s)]
*  Leaking is a completely unacceptable thing. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfAPeA-_pMY&t=230.54000000000002s)]
*  But let me give you—because I've read all the damage assessment reports from not [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfAPeA-_pMY&t=232.9s)]
*  just our government, but from other governments, and I'm not going to get into anything that's [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfAPeA-_pMY&t=237.38000000000002s)]
*  top secret, but let me tell you for sure what happened here. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfAPeA-_pMY&t=241.98000000000002s)]
*  There were three—there are three distinct facilities in Iran that we were concerned [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfAPeA-_pMY&t=245.74s)]
*  with. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfAPeA-_pMY&t=250.06s)]
*  Isfahan, which is a conversion facility. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfAPeA-_pMY&t=251.06s)]
*  You cannot weaponize unless you have what's called the conversion process at the beginning [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfAPeA-_pMY&t=253.38s)]
*  of enrichment and then a conversion process to metallicize the material at the end of [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfAPeA-_pMY&t=259.3s)]
*  enrichment. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfAPeA-_pMY&t=266.86s)]
*  That conversion facility, which, as far as we know, is the only facility in Iran that [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfAPeA-_pMY&t=268.14s)]
*  can do this, was completely destroyed at Isfahan. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfAPeA-_pMY&t=273.74s)]
*  It's above ground. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfAPeA-_pMY&t=276.65999999999997s)]
*  It was hit with a 30,000-pound bunker buster, and it could not survive that hit. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfAPeA-_pMY&t=278.18s)]
*  So they have no conversion opportunity, and that means they cannot weaponize, even if [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfAPeA-_pMY&t=283.41999999999996s)]
*  they've enriched to 90 percent. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfAPeA-_pMY&t=288.3s)]
*  Then there are two other nuclear reactors in Natanz, one above ground and one below [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfAPeA-_pMY&t=290.53999999999996s)]
*  ground. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfAPeA-_pMY&t=295.34s)]
*  The below-ground one, we know we eviscerated, and the above-ground one, which had been hit [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfAPeA-_pMY&t=296.46s)]
*  by the Israelis and had been substantially damaged, we put another bomb on top of it [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfAPeA-_pMY&t=301.74s)]
*  just to make sure that it was eviscerated, and we know for a fact it was. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfAPeA-_pMY&t=306.86s)]
*  Fordow is the last enrichment reactor that was operating there, and we put 12 bunker [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfAPeA-_pMY&t=311.86s)]
*  buster bombs on Fordow. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfAPeA-_pMY&t=318.41999999999996s)]
*  There's no doubt that it breached the canopy. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfAPeA-_pMY&t=320.06s)]
*  There's no doubt that it was well within reach of the depth that these bunker buster [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfAPeA-_pMY&t=322.82s)]
*  bombs go to, and there's no doubt that it was obliterated. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfAPeA-_pMY&t=327.53999999999996s)]
*  So the reporting out there that in some ways suggests that we did not achieve the objective [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfAPeA-_pMY&t=331.02s)]
*  is just completely preposterous. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfAPeA-_pMY&t=339.18s)]
*  So your conclusion tonight, seeing what you've seen, is that Iran could not resume its nuclear [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfAPeA-_pMY&t=341.38s)]
*  enrichment program within a matter of months? [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfAPeA-_pMY&t=350.85999999999996s)]
*  It's not even conceivable. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfAPeA-_pMY&t=354.18s)]
*  The conversion, destroying of the conversion facility, which not a lot of people are aware [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfAPeA-_pMY&t=357.46000000000004s)]
*  of, that is, that stops the enrichment process in the beginning, and it's needed to finish [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfAPeA-_pMY&t=362.98s)]
*  the enrichment process. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfAPeA-_pMY&t=370.54s)]
*  Once you get to 90 percent, you now must metallicize the material, shape it into a round ball, [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfAPeA-_pMY&t=371.98s)]
*  a round metallic ball. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfAPeA-_pMY&t=378.5s)]
*  That round metallic ball goes into the bomb. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfAPeA-_pMY&t=379.78000000000003s)]
*  Without conversion, you can't begin enrichment and you can't end enrichment in a successful [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfAPeA-_pMY&t=382.58000000000004s)]
*  weaponization. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfAPeA-_pMY&t=388.18s)]
*  That was taken out. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfAPeA-_pMY&t=389.26000000000005s)]
*  Then, on top of that, the nuclear reactors, again, as I said, two in the tons, one in [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfAPeA-_pMY&t=390.26000000000005s)]
*  Fordow, all three of those had most, if not all, of the centrifuges damaged or destroyed [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfAPeA-_pMY&t=395.58000000000004s)]
*  in a way that it will be almost impossible for them to resurrect that program for, in [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfAPeA-_pMY&t=404.42s)]
*  my view and in many other experts' views who have seen the raw data, it will take a period [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfAPeA-_pMY&t=410.26000000000005s)]
*  of years. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfAPeA-_pMY&t=415.42s)]
*  Senator Mark Kelly joined a chorus of Democrat senators who expressed deep concern about [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfAPeA-_pMY&t=416.42s)]
*  what may not have gone right with this watch. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfAPeA-_pMY&t=425.98s)]
*  Because of these unconstitutional actions, we don't know where the uranium is. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfAPeA-_pMY&t=430.26000000000005s)]
*  We don't know if we destroyed these sites. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfAPeA-_pMY&t=434.78000000000003s)]
*  And we don't know if the Iranians are going to race to the development of a nuclear weapon. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfAPeA-_pMY&t=438.38s)]
*  And we wind up with a situation that's similar to what we're dealing with with North Korea. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfAPeA-_pMY&t=442.21999999999997s)]
*  Nobody wants that. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfAPeA-_pMY&t=446.82s)]
*  I think the best way to deal with it now is if we can get back to the negotiating table [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfAPeA-_pMY&t=447.82s)]
*  and talk about this. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfAPeA-_pMY&t=450.9s)]
*  There was no plan here. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfAPeA-_pMY&t=452.42s)]
*  There was no goals. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfAPeA-_pMY&t=453.42s)]
*  Take it away, Steve. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfAPeA-_pMY&t=454.42s)]
*  That's—I just—I mean, I listened to these things. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfAPeA-_pMY&t=457.9s)]
*  Of course there was a plan here. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfAPeA-_pMY&t=462.94s)]
*  There was an objective. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfAPeA-_pMY&t=464.62s)]
*  The objective was eradicate nuclear enrichment capability, which we did. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfAPeA-_pMY&t=466.62s)]
*  And even if there was nuclear material that was hidden, it was then to eradicate the conversion—the [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfAPeA-_pMY&t=472.94s)]
*  conversion building, the conversion process that existed at Esfahan, which we did, which [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfAPeA-_pMY&t=481.58s)]
*  now rendered it absolutely impossible to weaponize. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfAPeA-_pMY&t=488.34000000000003s)]
*  So— [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfAPeA-_pMY&t=491.94s)]
*  Well, he doesn't care about knowing this? [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfAPeA-_pMY&t=492.94s)]
*  No matter what. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfAPeA-_pMY&t=493.94s)]
*  I mean, they either don't care about the details—I presume he's a very smart individual. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfAPeA-_pMY&t=495.26s)]
*  He would be able to comprehend those details, but they're not interested in the truth. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfAPeA-_pMY&t=501.7s)]
*  They're interested in a political smear of this administration without any sense of, [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfAPeA-_pMY&t=505.86s)]
*  you know, any sense of magnanimity or common sense. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfAPeA-_pMY&t=512.9s)]
*  And I've got to say, Americans are watching this tonight, and they're like—they just [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfAPeA-_pMY&t=517.02s)]
*  throw their hands up. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfAPeA-_pMY&t=519.9s)]
*  They don't know—they don't even have a response to that. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfAPeA-_pMY&t=520.9s)]
*  I've got to ask you one question, because what comes next, Steve, to negotiate a deal [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfAPeA-_pMY&t=523.58s)]
*  with Iran, you know, as the ceasefire, we hope, holds? [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfAPeA-_pMY&t=528.62s)]
*  What would that look like, given what you've concluded about this uranium enrichment and [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfAPeA-_pMY&t=532.98s)]
*  the overall program? [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfAPeA-_pMY&t=538.66s)]
*  Obviously, we have to get inspectors in there. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfAPeA-_pMY&t=539.66s)]
*  How would that be different from previous efforts to hold Iran accountable through inspections? [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfAPeA-_pMY&t=541.9399999999999s)]
*  Well, first of all, the IEA is involved. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfAPeA-_pMY&t=549.0999999999999s)]
*  By the way, the IEA, Rafael Grossi, I've talked to each and every day multiple times. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfAPeA-_pMY&t=553.9799999999999s)]
*  He agrees with the assessments that I'm giving you tonight, Laura. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfAPeA-_pMY&t=558.5s)]
*  So there's plenty of backup for the administration's opinion here. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfAPeA-_pMY&t=561.8599999999999s)]
*  With regard to the Iranians, the president has said unequivocally that he wants to see [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfAPeA-_pMY&t=569.18s)]
*  and he's hopeful for a comprehensive peace agreement that goes beyond even the ceasefire. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfAPeA-_pMY&t=576.82s)]
*  We're already talking to each other, not just directly, but also through interlocutors. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfAPeA-_pMY&t=581.9s)]
*  I think that the conversations are promising. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfAPeA-_pMY&t=588.18s)]
*  We're hopeful that we can have a long-term peace agreement that resurrects Iran, that [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfAPeA-_pMY&t=591.78s)]
*  brings it into the League of Nations, that creates long-term prosperity for Iran, and [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfAPeA-_pMY&t=600.6600000000001s)]
*  most importantly, allows for the GCC to grow economically. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfAPeA-_pMY&t=607.46s)]
*  Eliminating this risk was crucial to the economic future and prosperity of the entire Gulf region, [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfAPeA-_pMY&t=613.1800000000001s)]
*  and we've achieved that. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfAPeA-_pMY&t=621.58s)]
*  So I think now it's time for us to sit down with the Iranians and get to a comprehensive [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfAPeA-_pMY&t=622.6600000000001s)]
*  peace agreement, and I'm very confident that we're going to achieve that. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfAPeA-_pMY&t=629.18s)]
*  That's exciting. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfAPeA-_pMY&t=632.54s)]
*  Steve, I have about 15 seconds. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfAPeA-_pMY&t=633.54s)]
*  Will you allow any uranium enrichment in this deal? [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfAPeA-_pMY&t=634.6999999999999s)]
*  No. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfAPeA-_pMY&t=637.7399999999999s)]
*  Oh, that's 15 seconds. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfAPeA-_pMY&t=638.7399999999999s)]
*  They need it, Laura. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfAPeA-_pMY&t=642.8599999999999s)]
*  They don't need it. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfAPeA-_pMY&t=644.9s)]
*  What they need is a civil non-enrichment program, just like Abu Dhabi has. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfAPeA-_pMY&t=647.78s)]
*  They're running a reactor like that called Boucher, where they don't have enrichment [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfAPeA-_pMY&t=652.38s)]
*  getting fueled from the outside, and we're going to work with them on this. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfAPeA-_pMY&t=657.18s)]
*  But what they don't need is enrichment. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfAPeA-_pMY&t=660.66s)]
*  Steve, thank you very much for these details, your perspective, and for trying to set the [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfAPeA-_pMY&t=662.6999999999999s)]
*  record straight. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfAPeA-_pMY&t=668.18s)]
*  We really appreciate it. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfAPeA-_pMY&t=669.18s)]
