# Here's the 'end game' for Israel, Iran
**Fox News - World News:** [June 14, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ux8vSjQt60)
*  House Foreign Affairs Committee member Jared Moskovitz. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ux8vSjQt60&t=0.0s)]
*  Congressman, thanks so much for being with me here tonight. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ux8vSjQt60&t=2.92s)]
*  I think there is a worthy conversation about playing this out down the road. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ux8vSjQt60&t=6.36s)]
*  What is the end game in this war? [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ux8vSjQt60&t=10.38s)]
*  Is it simply taking away the threat to Israel, the nuclear capabilities of Iran, or is there [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ux8vSjQt60&t=12.88s)]
*  a bigger goal at this point in mind that we need to acknowledge? [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ux8vSjQt60&t=17.84s)]
*  Is it about regime change in Iran? [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ux8vSjQt60&t=20.64s)]
*  Thanks, Will. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ux8vSjQt60&t=22.96s)]
*  Thanks for having me on the show under these unfortunate circumstances. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ux8vSjQt60&t=26.6s)]
*  I mean, look, I think the goal is what the goal has been for the last several decades, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ux8vSjQt60&t=29.560000000000002s)]
*  Democratic presidents and Republican presidents, and the goal of this administration, which [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ux8vSjQt60&t=36.160000000000004s)]
*  is that Iran cannot have a nuclear weapon. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ux8vSjQt60&t=39.92s)]
*  I think that has to be the goal. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ux8vSjQt60&t=42.28s)]
*  If the Israelis have further goals, I'm not aware of that, and they haven't broadcast [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ux8vSjQt60&t=43.88s)]
*  that to the public. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ux8vSjQt60&t=47.64s)]
*  I think that is the goal of the Israelis at the moment and obviously in the interests [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ux8vSjQt60&t=48.64s)]
*  of America. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ux8vSjQt60&t=54.36s)]
*  Deny Iran a nuclear weapon. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ux8vSjQt60&t=56.86s)]
*  How far do you feel like these Israeli attacks went in accomplishing that goal? [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ux8vSjQt60&t=58.92s)]
*  We know that they hit several nuclear sites, basically housing centrifuges, the ability [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ux8vSjQt60&t=63.5s)]
*  to enrich uranium in Iran, but there are still huge reactor sites also capable of advancing [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ux8vSjQt60&t=69.36s)]
*  uranium that the Israelis have chosen not to attack. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ux8vSjQt60&t=75.64s)]
*  There's real implications of hitting a reactor and what the nuclear fallout could be for [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ux8vSjQt60&t=79.48s)]
*  a population locally. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ux8vSjQt60&t=84.28s)]
*  So how much was accomplished that you can tell through these initial attacks from Israel [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ux8vSjQt60&t=85.72s)]
*  in setting Iran back on their quest for a nuclear weapon? [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ux8vSjQt60&t=89.8s)]
*  Well, look, the attacks obviously were significant, and as you listen to the Israelis, they're [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ux8vSjQt60&t=93.36s)]
*  not done. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ux8vSjQt60&t=99.64s)]
*  This is going to go on for several days, and if you look at what they did just in the initial [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ux8vSjQt60&t=100.64s)]
*  strikes, if they have further plans for that on other facilities, then obviously they'll [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ux8vSjQt60&t=104.72000000000001s)]
*  continue to degrade Iran's capability. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ux8vSjQt60&t=110.48s)]
*  I mean, listen, for administration for administration after administration, we've been trying to [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ux8vSjQt60&t=113.80000000000001s)]
*  delay this day, delay what now is inevitable, which was that there was intelligence that [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ux8vSjQt60&t=119.56s)]
*  Iran, excuse me, was near getting a nuclear weapon. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ux8vSjQt60&t=125.12s)]
*  And so, you know, this, unfortunately, was Iran's choice after five rounds of negotiations. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ux8vSjQt60&t=131.52s)]
*  Well, you know this, after five rounds of negotiations, and this administration giving [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ux8vSjQt60&t=138.4s)]
*  Iran almost every opportunity to prevent this from happening, this was the choice of the [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ux8vSjQt60&t=142.6s)]
*  Iranian regime, of the supreme leader, who's 86, experiencing mental decline and wants [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ux8vSjQt60&t=149.2s)]
*  to be martyred. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ux8vSjQt60&t=154.24s)]
*  Why would we let someone like that have a nuclear weapon? [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ux8vSjQt60&t=155.52s)]
*  This is not a civilian nuclear program. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ux8vSjQt60&t=158.32s)]
*  They could have had that a long time ago. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ux8vSjQt60&t=160.92000000000002s)]
*  The IAEA came out and said that they're violating their obligations. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ux8vSjQt60&t=163.24s)]
*  And so listen, you know, if we can get to the table and they can agree to abandon and [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ux8vSjQt60&t=166.44s)]
*  dismantle the nuclear program, fantastic. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ux8vSjQt60&t=172.28s)]
*  But they were offered that and turned that down. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ux8vSjQt60&t=174.72s)]
*  If this initial strike convinces them of that, we should take that opportunity. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ux8vSjQt60&t=176.76000000000002s)]
*  But otherwise, the Israelis should continue to dismantle that. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ux8vSjQt60&t=180.54000000000002s)]
*  Any country that chants death to America cannot be allowed to have a nuclear weapon. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ux8vSjQt60&t=184.44s)]
*  And look, I have vast disagreements, obviously, with President Trump. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ux8vSjQt60&t=189.48s)]
*  But obviously, we had some knowledge that this was going to happen, probably could have [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ux8vSjQt60&t=193.0s)]
*  stopped it. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ux8vSjQt60&t=196.44s)]
*  U.S. presidents have that ability. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ux8vSjQt60&t=197.44s)]
*  President Trump let it go forward and he got it right. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ux8vSjQt60&t=199.51999999999998s)]
*  I was going to ask you your opinion of that. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ux8vSjQt60&t=202.04s)]
*  President Trump says he's still willing to negotiate with Iran. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ux8vSjQt60&t=204.79999999999998s)]
*  Whether or not negotiations are still a possibility after what we're seeing unfold is an open [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ux8vSjQt60&t=207.44s)]
*  question. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ux8vSjQt60&t=211.79999999999998s)]
*  But clearly, as you pointed out, the United States knew this was going to take place. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ux8vSjQt60&t=212.79999999999998s)]
*  The Trump administration, President Trump himself seemed to play an incredible game [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ux8vSjQt60&t=216.07999999999998s)]
*  of poker in relaxing the Iranians, acting like he wanted restraint from Israel. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ux8vSjQt60&t=219.23999999999998s)]
*  But clearly, this was going to happen. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ux8vSjQt60&t=223.88s)]
*  So it appears, it sounds like you're pretty pleased with President Trump. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ux8vSjQt60&t=225.56s)]
*  Yeah, look, like I said, I think the president got it right. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ux8vSjQt60&t=229.88s)]
*  Obviously, if we were given the heads up that this was going to happen, we could have prevented [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ux8vSjQt60&t=235.0s)]
*  it. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ux8vSjQt60&t=239.84s)]
*  We could have delayed it. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ux8vSjQt60&t=240.84s)]
*  U.S. presidents have that ability. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ux8vSjQt60&t=241.84s)]
*  We have that relationship with the Israelis. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ux8vSjQt60&t=242.84s)]
*  This president decided to let it go forward. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ux8vSjQt60&t=246.0s)]
*  And so I think the president made the right decision. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ux8vSjQt60&t=249.0s)]
*  I also think it was the right decision to try to avoid this. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ux8vSjQt60&t=251.12s)]
*  He gave the Iranians 60 days, five rounds. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ux8vSjQt60&t=254.68s)]
*  Now, I disagreed with some of the information that was coming out about, you know, maybe [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ux8vSjQt60&t=257.24s)]
*  we would let them have some low-level enrichment. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ux8vSjQt60&t=260.84000000000003s)]
*  I was vocal about that at the time. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ux8vSjQt60&t=263.12s)]
*  But the president's been clear, as have other presidents before him, that Iran cannot have [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ux8vSjQt60&t=266.28000000000003s)]
*  a nuclear weapon. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ux8vSjQt60&t=270.94s)]
*  This president decided to let the Israelis finally start dismantling that program because [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ux8vSjQt60&t=272.32s)]
*  the Iranians chose not to do that themselves. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ux8vSjQt60&t=276.48s)]
*  Well, Congressman, we appreciate you being with us here tonight. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ux8vSjQt60&t=279.52s)]
*  We wish you the best of luck. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ux8vSjQt60&t=282.36s)]
*  Walk in the hallways with your colleagues after offering up a rare compliment for President [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ux8vSjQt60&t=283.36s)]
*  Trump from the Democrats. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ux8vSjQt60&t=286.52s)]
*  We do appreciate your time tonight. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ux8vSjQt60&t=288.14s)]
