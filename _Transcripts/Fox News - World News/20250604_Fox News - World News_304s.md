# Colorado terror suspect's wife, kids face deportation after attack
**Fox News - World News:** [June 04, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdGZEg5e4pQ)
*  Family members of the man charged in Sunday's attack in Boulder, Colorado have been taken [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdGZEg5e4pQ&t=0.0s)]
*  into custody. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdGZEg5e4pQ&t=5.34s)]
*  The suspect's wife and five children are now facing a potentially speedy deportation. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdGZEg5e4pQ&t=6.5200000000000005s)]
*  Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem also sang on X. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdGZEg5e4pQ&t=12.96s)]
*  We are investigating to see what extent his family knew about this heinous attack, if [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdGZEg5e4pQ&t=16.14s)]
*  they had knowledge of it, or if they provided support to it. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdGZEg5e4pQ&t=21.48s)]
*  Director of Policy Studies at the Center for Immigration Studies Jessica Vaughn joins me [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdGZEg5e4pQ&t=25.560000000000002s)]
*  now. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdGZEg5e4pQ&t=29.56s)]
*  Jessica, thank you for joining us this morning. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdGZEg5e4pQ&t=30.56s)]
*  I mean, it's unclear if this attacker knew how deeply his actions would impact his family, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdGZEg5e4pQ&t=32.0s)]
*  but he did admit to not holding, not carrying out this attack until after his daughter graduated [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdGZEg5e4pQ&t=36.4s)]
*  from high school. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdGZEg5e4pQ&t=42.72s)]
*  So clearly he did care about their future and now he has to live with their potential [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdGZEg5e4pQ&t=43.72s)]
*  deportation as he sits in jail, potentially for the rest of his life. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdGZEg5e4pQ&t=48.599999999999994s)]
*  Well, you know, I don't think anybody should shed too many tears over this. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdGZEg5e4pQ&t=55.08s)]
*  This is something that he and almost certainly his wife planned in advance. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdGZEg5e4pQ&t=59.96s)]
*  They went and applied for visas to come to the United States. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdGZEg5e4pQ&t=65.24s)]
*  Within a couple of weeks of that, they filed an asylum claim knowing that under the Biden [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdGZEg5e4pQ&t=69.03999999999999s)]
*  administration rules that they would be allowed to stay here indefinitely and get work permits. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdGZEg5e4pQ&t=75.24s)]
*  And even after that work permit expired, he stayed here as a visa overstay. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdGZEg5e4pQ&t=81.08s)]
*  You know, we have more than a half a million visa overstays every year. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdGZEg5e4pQ&t=88.36s)]
*  And this guy, along with hundreds of thousands of others, have completely exploited our visa [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdGZEg5e4pQ&t=92.8s)]
*  system. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdGZEg5e4pQ&t=100.0s)]
*  And this is yet another example of why our immigration enforcement is important, why [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdGZEg5e4pQ&t=101.0s)]
*  we need to do a better job of vetting applicants and especially why it's important now for [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdGZEg5e4pQ&t=107.84s)]
*  the Trump administration to have this so-called mass deportation campaign to try to clean [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdGZEg5e4pQ&t=114.08s)]
*  up the mistakes of all the people who are allowed in under the Biden policies. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdGZEg5e4pQ&t=121.2s)]
*  And it's why we can't be just limiting enforcement to people who've been convicted of crimes. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdGZEg5e4pQ&t=126.08000000000001s)]
*  That lets people stay here to have the opportunity to commit horrific acts like this. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdGZEg5e4pQ&t=131.36s)]
*  Jessica, do you foresee any legal challenges in deporting his family or will they be back [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdGZEg5e4pQ&t=136.64s)]
*  in Egypt very quickly? [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdGZEg5e4pQ&t=141.6s)]
*  I don't see how they possibly could have a case for staying here. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdGZEg5e4pQ&t=144.35999999999999s)]
*  You know, they'd have to show that they would be persecuted if they were to be sent back [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdGZEg5e4pQ&t=149.48s)]
*  to Egypt. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdGZEg5e4pQ&t=153.76s)]
*  I'm sure that someone will try on their behalf to do that because there are so many people [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdGZEg5e4pQ&t=154.76s)]
*  involved in immigration advocacy who are willing to defend almost anyone being able [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdGZEg5e4pQ&t=161.88s)]
*  to stay here and, you know, and to fight enforcement at all costs. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdGZEg5e4pQ&t=167.88s)]
*  But they overstayed their visas. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdGZEg5e4pQ&t=172.48s)]
*  They should be sent home. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdGZEg5e4pQ&t=174.76s)]
*  So a major concern that the Trump administration is grappling with right now is, of course, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdGZEg5e4pQ&t=176.38s)]
*  how safe our country really is considering there were so many known godaways that entered [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdGZEg5e4pQ&t=180.51999999999998s)]
*  this country under the Biden administration, leading Tom Holman to say this recently. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdGZEg5e4pQ&t=186.92s)]
*  Watch. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdGZEg5e4pQ&t=190.44s)]
*  It scares the hell out of me. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdGZEg5e4pQ&t=191.96s)]
*  I've been doing this for 40 years. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdGZEg5e4pQ&t=192.96s)]
*  It should have scared the hell out of every American what the Biden administration did. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdGZEg5e4pQ&t=194.92s)]
*  This two-man known godaways scares the hell out of me. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdGZEg5e4pQ&t=198.72s)]
*  So I'm convinced something's coming unless we can find them. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdGZEg5e4pQ&t=201.84s)]
*  And on top of that, Jessica, Colorado, I mean, the state where this attack took place, Democrats [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdGZEg5e4pQ&t=205.62s)]
*  there just passed a new immigration law strengthening constitutional rights for immigrant families. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdGZEg5e4pQ&t=210.07999999999998s)]
*  It's basically a law that will not allow local law enforcement to work with ICE. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdGZEg5e4pQ&t=215.64s)]
*  Is that the direction our country should really be going on a state level as a result of this? [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdGZEg5e4pQ&t=222.27999999999997s)]
*  Absolutely not. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdGZEg5e4pQ&t=227.95999999999998s)]
*  Colorado has been a sanctuary state for a long time. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdGZEg5e4pQ&t=231.67999999999998s)]
*  And the fact that they are doubling down on this now is purely political and at odds with [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdGZEg5e4pQ&t=234.2s)]
*  what citizens in Colorado want to see happen. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdGZEg5e4pQ&t=241.08s)]
*  And we keep track of sanctuaries and we have a map that shows where all the sanctuaries are. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdGZEg5e4pQ&t=245.72s)]
*  And Colorado is one of the worst offenders in this. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdGZEg5e4pQ&t=252.12s)]
*  The result is inevitably that they protect criminal aliens that ICE is trying to deport. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdGZEg5e4pQ&t=256.04s)]
*  And, you know, they're simply trying to throw a wrench in the deportation process. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdGZEg5e4pQ&t=263.16s)]
*  And it's important that we take steps to block these kinds of sanctuary policies or if they [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdGZEg5e4pQ&t=269.32s)]
*  can't be blocked through the courts, then to at least impose some consequences on these [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdGZEg5e4pQ&t=275.0s)]
*  politicians who insist on putting up these roadblocks to immigration enforcement. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdGZEg5e4pQ&t=281.15999999999997s)]
*  It's a major issue our country is going to be grappling with for years. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdGZEg5e4pQ&t=287.15999999999997s)]
*  So, Jessica, thank you for joining us to discuss it today. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdGZEg5e4pQ&t=289.96s)]
