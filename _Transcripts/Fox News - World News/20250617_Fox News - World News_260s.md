# Trump lashes out at 'publicity seeking' Macron after leaving G7 early
**Fox News - World News:** [June 17, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iwaw7SiktAY)
*  In other news, President Trump is cutting his G7 trip short as Israel and Iran are trading [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iwaw7SiktAY&t=0.0s)]
*  these devastating strikes. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iwaw7SiktAY&t=5.98s)]
*  Mark Meredith joins us live now with more. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iwaw7SiktAY&t=7.5s)]
*  Mark. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iwaw7SiktAY&t=9.94s)]
*  Ainsley, good morning to you. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iwaw7SiktAY&t=10.94s)]
*  President Trump is back at the White House after cutting his trip to Canada short. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iwaw7SiktAY&t=12.18s)]
*  The president making it very clear he does not believe in any uncertain terms that Iran [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iwaw7SiktAY&t=15.44s)]
*  should have any nuclear weapon capabilities. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iwaw7SiktAY&t=19.400000000000002s)]
*  But the president was also asked on Air Force One on his way back to D.C. why he decided [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iwaw7SiktAY&t=21.98s)]
*  he needed to come back to D.C. so quickly. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iwaw7SiktAY&t=25.92s)]
*  Listen to what he had to say. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iwaw7SiktAY&t=28.0s)]
*  We're not looking for a ceasefire. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iwaw7SiktAY&t=29.0s)]
*  I didn't say I was looking for a ceasefire. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iwaw7SiktAY&t=30.0s)]
*  We're looking for better than a ceasefire. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iwaw7SiktAY&t=31.0s)]
*  Remember, Iran cannot have nuclear weapons. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iwaw7SiktAY&t=32.0s)]
*  Very simple. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iwaw7SiktAY&t=33.0s)]
*  Not to go too deep into it. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iwaw7SiktAY&t=34.0s)]
*  They just can't have a nuclear weapon. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iwaw7SiktAY&t=35.0s)]
*  What was the thinking on the call for Tehran to evacuate? [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iwaw7SiktAY&t=36.0s)]
*  Is there a threat or is there incoming? [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iwaw7SiktAY&t=37.0s)]
*  What was the thinking on the call? [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iwaw7SiktAY&t=38.0s)]
*  I want people to be safe. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iwaw7SiktAY&t=39.0s)]
*  Now, the president was in Canada meeting with many world leaders including French President [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iwaw7SiktAY&t=40.0s)]
*  Emmanuel Macron. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iwaw7SiktAY&t=41.0s)]
*  And while he was there, the president was also there to talk about the future of the country. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iwaw7SiktAY&t=42.0s)]
*  And it was a very important time for the country. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iwaw7SiktAY&t=43.0s)]

*  I'm very happy that this is happening. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iwaw7SiktAY&t=106.0s)]
*  I'm very happy that this is happening. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iwaw7SiktAY&t=107.0s)]
*  Brian, Lawrence, and Azenith. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iwaw7SiktAY&t=109.0s)]
*  It's not the Israeli-Iran conflict. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iwaw7SiktAY&t=110.0s)]
*  I get it, but the president is on a fast track to get a trade deal, it looks like, with Canada. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iwaw7SiktAY&t=111.0s)]
*  He formally signed the one with the UK. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iwaw7SiktAY&t=116.0s)]
*  And I personally think that he was not thrilled about the Ukrainian talks that were on tap. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iwaw7SiktAY&t=118.0s)]
*  He probably knows he's going to get pressured to hit Russia with sanctions. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iwaw7SiktAY&t=124.0s)]
*  I don't think he was really looking forward to that session. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iwaw7SiktAY&t=128.0s)]
*  Do you think that played into it, Mark? [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iwaw7SiktAY&t=130.0s)]
*  Well, Brian, Macron and Trump have certainly had interesting relationships over the last year. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iwaw7SiktAY&t=132.0s)]
*  Trump, last year, praised him as a pretty smart guy, but obviously we've seen the back and forth that Macron has had. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iwaw7SiktAY&t=137.0s)]
*  He's been very vocal when it comes to the Ukraine issue. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iwaw7SiktAY&t=142.0s)]
*  And Macron obviously wanted to keep Europe and the U.S. involved with Ukraine. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iwaw7SiktAY&t=145.0s)]
*  However, I would imagine with so much of the focus, though, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iwaw7SiktAY&t=149.0s)]
*  the president's going to be on what happens next, whether or not Israel goes forward with an even larger attack against Tehran. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iwaw7SiktAY&t=151.0s)]
*  Trump was asked about that on the plane, why he said the people of Tehran should evacuate. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iwaw7SiktAY&t=157.0s)]
*  He didn't elaborate further, but obviously people are reading between the lines that a possibility of a major attack is still on the table. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iwaw7SiktAY&t=162.0s)]
*  Hi, Mark. Thanks so much. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iwaw7SiktAY&t=168.0s)]
*  Do you know if they made up at all, the Macron's? [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iwaw7SiktAY&t=170.0s)]
*  I mean, that little incident on the plane? [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iwaw7SiktAY&t=172.0s)]
*  The president and his wife? [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iwaw7SiktAY&t=175.0s)]
*  Could you follow up on that? [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iwaw7SiktAY&t=176.0s)]
*  Well, they also released their statement, that joint statement yesterday, the G7. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iwaw7SiktAY&t=178.0s)]
*  And I'm like, when are these countries going to learn to stop making statements when the U.S. is not on the table? [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iwaw7SiktAY&t=182.0s)]
*  It's like, OK, everybody but the U.S. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iwaw7SiktAY&t=188.0s)]
*  The U.S. is what the power is of the statement. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iwaw7SiktAY&t=190.0s)]
*  And they try to undercut the president. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iwaw7SiktAY&t=193.0s)]
*  He's like, I'm not signing the statement. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iwaw7SiktAY&t=195.0s)]
*  I actually appreciate what he said on the plane because during the gaggle, he said Macron, he said he's a nice guy, but he's got this wrong. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iwaw7SiktAY&t=198.0s)]
*  And in another statement, this was on Truth Social, he said, whether purposely or not, Emmanuel always gets it wrong. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iwaw7SiktAY&t=205.0s)]
*  Stay tuned. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iwaw7SiktAY&t=212.0s)]
*  Right. I will say this. I think we agree on this. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iwaw7SiktAY&t=213.0s)]
*  He has got a great tailor. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iwaw7SiktAY&t=215.0s)]
*  Right. Those are great suits. Am I correct? [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iwaw7SiktAY&t=217.0s)]
*  Every suit. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iwaw7SiktAY&t=219.0s)]
*  The Europeans normally be pretty well-versed in the suit department. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iwaw7SiktAY&t=220.0s)]
*  Right. They really know what they're doing. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iwaw7SiktAY&t=222.0s)]
*  I've been trying to help you out. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iwaw7SiktAY&t=224.0s)]
*  I know. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iwaw7SiktAY&t=225.0s)]
*  If you live in France and you're the president, I would expect that. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iwaw7SiktAY&t=226.0s)]
*  Right. Not everybody. But he's got it going on. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iwaw7SiktAY&t=229.0s)]
*  He just gets on the president's nerves. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iwaw7SiktAY&t=232.0s)]
*  That's what matters is the suit. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iwaw7SiktAY&t=234.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iwaw7SiktAY&t=236.0s)]
*  I think the president just thinks he's not as strong. He's weaker. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iwaw7SiktAY&t=237.0s)]
*  He's also a publicity hound. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iwaw7SiktAY&t=240.0s)]
*  He is. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iwaw7SiktAY&t=242.0s)]
*  He's always trying to jump in front. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iwaw7SiktAY&t=243.0s)]
*  That's what he was saying. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iwaw7SiktAY&t=244.0s)]
