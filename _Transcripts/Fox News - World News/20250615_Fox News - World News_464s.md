# BREAKING: Siren blares as Israelis race to shelter amid Iranian missile attacks
**Fox News - World News:** [June 15, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_HGHg20TWQ)
*  Let's get to our top story. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_HGHg20TWQ&t=0.0s)]
*  The IDF confirms new strikes in Tehran this morning. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_HGHg20TWQ&t=2.92s)]
*  As Israeli crews are searching for survivors in the rubble, after deadly Iranian missiles [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_HGHg20TWQ&t=6.76s)]
*  killed 10 people and injured hundreds others. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_HGHg20TWQ&t=11.02s)]
*  Alex Hogan is live on the ground near Tel Aviv with the very latest. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_HGHg20TWQ&t=14.040000000000001s)]
*  Alex, good morning. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_HGHg20TWQ&t=18.04s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_HGHg20TWQ&t=19.04s)]
*  We're getting some breaking news right now. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_HGHg20TWQ&t=20.04s)]
*  An alert has gone out to the entire country here in Israel telling people they need to [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_HGHg20TWQ&t=22.84s)]
*  get close to a shelter. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_HGHg20TWQ&t=27.32s)]
*  As sirens do go off, we're going to move into one of these buildings and take shelter as [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_HGHg20TWQ&t=29.52s)]
*  there is the belief that there is likely an incoming attack. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_HGHg20TWQ&t=34.72s)]
*  This is after we have seen widespread devastation in this neighborhood. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_HGHg20TWQ&t=38.44s)]
*  This is Bat Yam in the outskirts of Tel Aviv, where one building behind me, a residential [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_HGHg20TWQ&t=41.879999999999995s)]
*  building, a large apartment building, was the scene of a direct hit. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_HGHg20TWQ&t=47.84s)]
*  But as a result, all of the surrounding homes, all of the surrounding residential and apartment [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_HGHg20TWQ&t=51.879999999999995s)]
*  have been completely destroyed with the windows broken, the doors mangled, the roofs either [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_HGHg20TWQ&t=58.44s)]
*  partially or fully blown off as a result of this direct hit. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_HGHg20TWQ&t=64.03999999999999s)]
*  This was the scene overnight of some of these impacts that we saw of Iranian missiles, some [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_HGHg20TWQ&t=68.03999999999999s)]
*  of which were able to breach Israel's air defense systems and create direct hits like [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_HGHg20TWQ&t=74.36s)]
*  this. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_HGHg20TWQ&t=79.8s)]
*  We are now also learning of the increased number of dead, as many as 11 people have [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_HGHg20TWQ&t=80.8s)]
*  died in overnight strikes. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_HGHg20TWQ&t=85.92s)]
*  I'll show you this footage here, some of the drone footage of the area where I'm standing. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_HGHg20TWQ&t=87.44s)]
*  Search and rescue teams have been going through the area, combing through the rubble and have [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_HGHg20TWQ&t=92.48s)]
*  just uncovered another body, another grim part of the news of the dead that we have [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_HGHg20TWQ&t=95.8s)]
*  learned of in recent days. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_HGHg20TWQ&t=100.08s)]
*  Children are among the dead here in Israel. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_HGHg20TWQ&t=101.56s)]
*  And we talked with the international spokesperson of the police who says they had to use drones, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_HGHg20TWQ&t=105.03999999999999s)]
*  canines to comb through this area and search for survivors. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_HGHg20TWQ&t=111.2s)]
*  Take a listen. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_HGHg20TWQ&t=114.96000000000001s)]
*  What happens next? [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_HGHg20TWQ&t=116.92s)]
*  What happens tonight? [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_HGHg20TWQ&t=117.92s)]
*  Are you preparing to see, unfortunately, attacks and scenes just like this tomorrow morning [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_HGHg20TWQ&t=118.92s)]
*  again? [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_HGHg20TWQ&t=124.44s)]
*  Well, I can't see the future, but I can tell you that the Israel police is prepared in [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_HGHg20TWQ&t=125.44s)]
*  the event that another barrage of rockets targets our civilian communities. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_HGHg20TWQ&t=128.64000000000001s)]
*  Like I told you, we're on high alert, but we've also recruited seven battalions, reserve [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_HGHg20TWQ&t=133.04s)]
*  battalions of our border police to help reinforce our units that are on the ground so that we [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_HGHg20TWQ&t=136.92000000000002s)]
*  areas of Israel. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_HGHg20TWQ&t=142.2s)]
*  And if there's a rocket strike, a missile strike to a certain residential community, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_HGHg20TWQ&t=144.07999999999998s)]
*  we can get there as fast as possible. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_HGHg20TWQ&t=148.23999999999998s)]
*  Time is of the essence when it comes to these things. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_HGHg20TWQ&t=150.35999999999999s)]
*  We want to get people medically evacuated as fast as possible, provide service to anybody [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_HGHg20TWQ&t=152.48s)]
*  that may be trapped. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_HGHg20TWQ&t=156.78s)]
*  And that's what we're going to continue doing. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_HGHg20TWQ&t=158.22s)]
*  So we've seen a massive police presence here throughout the morning. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_HGHg20TWQ&t=160.16s)]
*  Medics, again, going through this area door to door. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_HGHg20TWQ&t=165.6s)]
*  You're seeing all of them right now evacuating this area, getting themselves to shelter, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_HGHg20TWQ&t=168.16s)]
*  something we are going to do as well. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_HGHg20TWQ&t=172.48s)]
*  If those sirens do sound off here in Tel Aviv, meaning that the city would once again be [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_HGHg20TWQ&t=173.8s)]
*  under attack and it would be something that we have not seen in recent days. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_HGHg20TWQ&t=178.88s)]
*  Typically, these Iranian missile and drone strikes have been happening at night. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_HGHg20TWQ&t=182.92s)]
*  But for those sirens to take place during the day, it shows just once again the changing [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_HGHg20TWQ&t=187.52s)]
*  experience that Israelis are living through amid this escalation here in the Middle East. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_HGHg20TWQ&t=192.8s)]
*  Back to you. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_HGHg20TWQ&t=198.32s)]
*  Thank you, Alex. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_HGHg20TWQ&t=199.32s)]
*  So obviously, you know, what we're looking at behind you is evidence that the Iron Dome [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_HGHg20TWQ&t=200.32s)]
*  did not get all the missiles that were that were incoming for Israel. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_HGHg20TWQ&t=206.24s)]
*  And it's not the only those are not the only that's not the only missile that sort of got [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_HGHg20TWQ&t=211.44s)]
*  past the Iron Dome. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_HGHg20TWQ&t=214.92s)]
*  What is the you know, and obviously, you have Israel, you have the United States, but there [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_HGHg20TWQ&t=216.92s)]
*  are also other countries that are trying to intercept these missiles. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_HGHg20TWQ&t=221.2s)]
*  They have a long way to go from Iran. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_HGHg20TWQ&t=225.76s)]
*  It's about a thousand miles. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_HGHg20TWQ&t=228.4s)]
*  They're going over Jordan. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_HGHg20TWQ&t=230.04s)]
*  They're going over Saudi Arabia. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_HGHg20TWQ&t=231.7s)]
*  And we know that those two countries are trying to help shoot down some of these missiles. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_HGHg20TWQ&t=234.0s)]
*  What other efforts are there? [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_HGHg20TWQ&t=238.84s)]
*  What other countries in the region are working to help shoot down some of these missiles [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_HGHg20TWQ&t=240.57999999999998s)]
*  that are incoming to Israel? [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_HGHg20TWQ&t=246.62s)]
*  We're getting we're getting some sirens right now. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_HGHg20TWQ&t=248.85999999999999s)]
*  We're going to move ourselves to shelter. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_HGHg20TWQ&t=250.76s)]
*  We're going to follow you. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_HGHg20TWQ&t=252.32s)]
*  But you can stay with us as we continue to move. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_HGHg20TWQ&t=253.32s)]
*  So to answer your question, the air defense systems here in Israel, it's not made up just [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_HGHg20TWQ&t=255.8s)]
*  of the Iron Dome. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_HGHg20TWQ&t=260.8s)]
*  We also have David's sling as well as the arrow, all of which have different capabilities. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_HGHg20TWQ&t=262.24s)]
*  Careful here as we move down on these stairs. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_HGHg20TWQ&t=267.52s)]
*  So we're going to move with everyone into the shelter, into the closest shelter that [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_HGHg20TWQ&t=269.48s)]
*  we can find. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_HGHg20TWQ&t=272.76s)]
*  As a result, the sirens mean that Tel Aviv is one of the cities that the idea believes [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_HGHg20TWQ&t=274.42s)]
*  could be the center of this next incoming attack. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_HGHg20TWQ&t=279.88s)]
*  So we have seen a U.S. presence continue to defend Israel as well. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_HGHg20TWQ&t=283.6s)]
*  We know that the army and the Navy, they have been using their resources to strike down [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_HGHg20TWQ&t=288.54s)]
*  some of these missiles and these drones that we've seen in recent days. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_HGHg20TWQ&t=294.88s)]
*  As you mentioned, Jordan, the other day, Jordan was able to intercept some of the drones that [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_HGHg20TWQ&t=298.64s)]
*  breached its airspace. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_HGHg20TWQ&t=302.88s)]
*  But so far, in terms of the international response, really we're seeing Israel defend [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_HGHg20TWQ&t=304.96s)]
*  its skies as well as the U.S. trying to step in. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_HGHg20TWQ&t=310.2s)]
*  So right now we're walking into this underground bunker. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_HGHg20TWQ&t=314.59999999999997s)]
*  This appears to be a parking garage, one of the types of areas that would work well because [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_HGHg20TWQ&t=317.08s)]
*  it's insulated with concrete. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_HGHg20TWQ&t=322.24s)]
*  This is the kind of area, again, similar to a stairwell or a bomb shelter, is the kind [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_HGHg20TWQ&t=323.79999999999995s)]
*  of place that people will need to stay until we get the all clear. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_HGHg20TWQ&t=328.46s)]
*  Alex, I'm not sure if you can still hear us very well, but just so we understand, that [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_HGHg20TWQ&t=331.59999999999997s)]
*  siren going off, does that mean something is imminent, that something has been spotted [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_HGHg20TWQ&t=336.55999999999995s)]
*  in the air? [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_HGHg20TWQ&t=341.32s)]
*  I lost you there for a second. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_HGHg20TWQ&t=342.32s)]
*  I think I have you back, if you could just repeat that question for me. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_HGHg20TWQ&t=346.67999999999995s)]
*  That alarm going off, does that mean that something is imminently incoming, that there's [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_HGHg20TWQ&t=350.15999999999997s)]
*  an active attack? [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_HGHg20TWQ&t=354.76s)]
*  Yes, the initial warning that we got indicated, it went off to the entire country, it indicated [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_HGHg20TWQ&t=357.8s)]
*  that there could be an incoming attack that could interfere with the Israeli air defenses. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_HGHg20TWQ&t=364.8s)]
*  Sorry, I'm getting some interference in my ear. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_HGHg20TWQ&t=370.96000000000004s)]
*  The first alert that we got notified everyone across the country to get close to a shelter. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_HGHg20TWQ&t=373.16s)]
*  And if the sirens did go off in their city, that would mean that their city potentially [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_HGHg20TWQ&t=379.88s)]
*  could be under attack. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_HGHg20TWQ&t=384.66s)]
*  So the fact that we just heard those sirens, the fact that we're seeing even soldiers come [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_HGHg20TWQ&t=385.78000000000003s)]
*  here to take shelter means that all of Israelis, all of the foreigners, all of the tourists [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_HGHg20TWQ&t=389.94s)]
*  that are in Tel Aviv right now need to be taking shelter. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_HGHg20TWQ&t=395.58000000000004s)]
*  We're also getting a new alert on our phones. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_HGHg20TWQ&t=399.38000000000005s)]
*  All of the cell phones that people might have have been going off. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_HGHg20TWQ&t=403.5s)]
*  So you take a look at that. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_HGHg20TWQ&t=406.70000000000005s)]
*  Just alerting people, take a shelter. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_HGHg20TWQ&t=408.18s)]
*  Obviously, this is in Hebrew. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_HGHg20TWQ&t=410.22s)]
*  But alerting people to get to shelters as quickly as possible. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_HGHg20TWQ&t=412.62s)]
*  And what we've seen in the past when we've been in this type of situation, we'll wait [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_HGHg20TWQ&t=415.94s)]
*  about 30 minutes to an hour before you get the all clear. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_HGHg20TWQ&t=420.65999999999997s)]
