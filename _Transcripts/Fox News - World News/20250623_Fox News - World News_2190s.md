# PEACE AT LAST?: Breaking down Iran-Israel ceasefire and the '12-day war'
**Fox News - World News:** [June 23, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M)
*  Breaking tonight, right at the beginning of this show, President Trump saying Iran and [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=0.0s)]
*  Israel have agreed to a ceasefire. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=6.5600000000000005s)]
*  He says it will be phased in over 24 hours. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=8.76s)]
*  We have yet to hear from the Iranians or the Israelis. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=11.64s)]
*  It's overnight there. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=13.84s)]
*  Also tonight, he is trying to make sure the price of oil does not rise dramatically following [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=15.280000000000001s)]
*  the U.S. airstrikes against Iranian nuclear facilities. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=20.36s)]
*  President Trump will head to The Hague tomorrow for a NATO summit. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=23.7s)]
*  Senior White House correspondent Peter Ducey is already there tonight with the latest. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=27.08s)]
*  Good evening, Peter. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=30.72s)]
*  Good evening, Brett. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=31.72s)]
*  President Trump didn't want to be out of the country for the tail end of the G7 last week [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=33.64s)]
*  because he needed to monitor the situation in Iran from the Situation Room at the White [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=37.56s)]
*  House. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=44.0s)]
*  But with this ceasefire announcement tonight, there is expected to be enough of a break [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=45.0s)]
*  in the action that he will soon cross the Atlantic for this week's NATO summit. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=48.84s)]
*  He has prevented a nuclear conflict. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=54.96s)]
*  Today, President Trump watched Iran retaliate against a U.S. base in Qatar that he visited [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=58.08s)]
*  just last month. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=64.84s)]
*  Al-Yudhid Air Base, sometimes referred to as the Deed. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=66.2s)]
*  Qatar has continued to act as the middleman during backchannel talks between the U.S. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=71.28s)]
*  and Iran. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=75.68s)]
*  And today, the president said, I'd like to thank the highly respected emir of Qatar for [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=76.68s)]
*  all that he has done in seeking peace for the region. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=81.08s)]
*  But the president is still concerned about oil prices and roughly 20 percent of the world's [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=84.8s)]
*  oil and natural gas shipments getting stuck if Iran closes the Strait of Hormuz. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=91.44s)]
*  Even the threat is increasing the price of oil. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=98.2s)]
*  The Iranian and Iranian people need it in order to survive for their own economic benefits [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=100.84s)]
*  or they're not thereof. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=107.24s)]
*  Iran, they need the revenue from oil. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=108.8s)]
*  China wants their oil. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=110.8s)]
*  They get it at a deep discount. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=111.8s)]
*  Ahead of President Trump's visit to the NATO summit tomorrow, one country is already saying [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=113.11999999999999s)]
*  they won't be spending more on defense, Spain. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=117.84s)]
*  We are normalizing the fact that certain powers are bombing each other, that their leaders [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=123.56s)]
*  exchanged nuclear threats and that the civilian population is the one suffering all these [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=127.03999999999999s)]
*  consequences. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=132.16s)]
*  So far, 22 of 32 NATO member states pay two percent of their GDP, as expected. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=133.32s)]
*  But the president plans to pressure them to start spending five percent. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=139.6s)]
*  President has been adamant and our NATO allies, to their credit, heeded the president's strong [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=144.56s)]
*  call in his first term and we expect them to do it this time around as well. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=149.24s)]
*  And we just reported about President Trump saying thanks to the emir of Qatar for their [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=154.2s)]
*  efforts to bring peace to the Middle East. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=158.92s)]
*  We now have a source familiar telling us that Qatar was passing messages from U.S. diplomats [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=161.82s)]
*  to Iranian diplomats in the lead up to today's attack on Al-Yadid airbase. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=166.6s)]
*  As for here in the Netherlands, leaders this week want a strong NATO because it is a big [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=172.28s)]
*  deterrent against Russian aggression. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=178.35999999999999s)]
*  But all this action in Iran may suck up more of the oxygen than they were planning on because [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=180.6s)]
*  these leaders of countries with strong militaries want to know what is going to happen next, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=185.76s)]
*  especially because the way that NATO works, if one member gets attacked, they are all [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=190.48s)]
*  responsible for helping with the defense. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=195.12s)]
*  Brett? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=197.4s)]
*  Article five, Peter Ducey at The Hague. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=198.4s)]
*  Peter, thanks. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=200.12s)]
*  Good evening, everyone, and welcome to the Ingram Angle. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=201.12s)]
*  I'm Laura Ingram, my angle and moments. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=204.16s)]
*  But first, tonight we begin with major breaking news. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=206.28s)]
*  It's a development that few thought was possible even a few days ago. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=210.64000000000001s)]
*  But with President Trump in charge, we've seen time and time again the so-called experts [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=214.76s)]
*  are proven wrong. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=219.94s)]
*  President Trump says Israel and Iran have agreed to a full ceasefire taking effect [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=222.04s)]
*  in just a few hours. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=227.82s)]
*  In a true social post in the last hour, the president wrote, congratulations to everyone. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=229.44s)]
*  There will be a complete and total ceasefire in approximately six hours from now when Israel [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=234.18s)]
*  and Iran would have wound down and completed their in progress final missions for 12 hours, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=238.39999999999998s)]
*  at which point the war will be considered ended on that assumption that everything works [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=245.38s)]
*  as it should, which it will. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=250.28s)]
*  I would like to congratulate both countries, Israel and Iran, on having the stamina, courage [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=251.6s)]
*  and intelligence to end what should be called the 12-day war. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=257.08s)]
*  This is a war that could have gone on for years and destroyed the entire Middle East, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=262.28s)]
*  but it didn't and never will. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=267.09999999999997s)]
*  Here with me now is Brett Baer, chief political anchor and special report anchor, executive [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=269.8s)]
*  editor there as well. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=274.64s)]
*  Brett, you are on the air. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=276.12s)]
*  We were all watching with Vice President Vance when Trump's truth social post landed. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=278.24s)]
*  That was in and of itself kind of hilarious, but do we have details about how this all [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=285.76s)]
*  came together in the last hour? [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=290.36s)]
*  Well, Laura, good evening. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=292.48s)]
*  It really was something. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=294.44s)]
*  I'll just give you the behind the scenes. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=295.44s)]
*  Trey Yanks was in the middle of wrapping up his report from Tel Aviv and the producer [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=296.72s)]
*  got in my ear saying, Trump's truth social coming in the email right now. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=301.0s)]
*  I look down, the vice president's right here on set with me and as I look down to read [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=306.32s)]
*  it his staff comes in with an iPhone so he can read the truth social as it's coming in. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=311.47999999999996s)]
*  Trey Yanks wraps up his live report. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=318.68s)]
*  I thank him. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=320.52s)]
*  I introduced the vice president and obviously start with what we just heard and saw. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=321.52s)]
*  He said he had heard about it, talked about it, hadn't seen the final version and that's [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=328.12s)]
*  what he was reacting to. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=332.47999999999996s)]
*  Since then we've learned that Qatar was the intermediary and that Iran officials are now [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=334.28s)]
*  saying they did in fact authorize Qatar to negotiate on their behalf, at least according [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=340.88s)]
*  to Reuters and other wire services, and that the Israelis are going to agree to this in [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=345.84s)]
*  a six hour time frame. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=353.23999999999995s)]
*  Now what happens between now and the six hours? [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=354.59999999999997s)]
*  I expect a lot of kinetic action inside Iran from the Israelis, but that's what it looks [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=356.91999999999996s)]
*  like and then the details that the president laid out about how it follows over the next [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=362.52s)]
*  24, 48 hours, we don't know what that picture looks like or whether it leads to negotiations. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=367.59999999999997s)]
*  Well what was stunning is that just in the last several hours the supreme leader put [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=373.12s)]
*  out a statement saying we will not submit, we will never submit. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=377.97999999999996s)]
*  So something was changing in that interim time period and I guess he was made an offer [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=381.91999999999996s)]
*  he couldn't refuse. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=387.79999999999995s)]
*  Maybe so. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=389.52s)]
*  We don't know. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=390.76s)]
*  The supreme leader is supposed to be holed up in a bunker. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=391.76s)]
*  The going thing in Iran we're told is that everyone doesn't know where he is except the [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=395.76s)]
*  Israelis and the US and they have said that they could take him out at any time. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=400.68s)]
*  I don't know what has transpired that changed the Iranians' bold action other than to read [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=407.32s)]
*  the tea leaves here. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=412.92s)]
*  They gave a pre-warning about the missile strike on Qatar and the Al-Yudid air base [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=414.36s)]
*  saying this is going to happen, get your people out of there and then the air defenses took [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=419.96000000000004s)]
*  down those missiles including one from Qatar and you know I think that the president's [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=425.24s)]
*  very weak response post and let's get to peace started phone calls between all of the parties [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=430.32s)]
*  according to the vice president and in between the time he left the White House and the time [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=437.44s)]
*  he arrived on this set something had transpired to get that truth social post. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=441.88s)]
*  And the president even thanked Iran for the heads up as you noted with Vance which it [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=447.08s)]
*  all seemed like it was missile theater at some point. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=453.84000000000003s)]
*  They gave them a chance to save face, shoot up a couple of you know what looked like Roman [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=456.92s)]
*  candles and they were missiles but no damage was done as far as we understand on the ground. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=461.8s)]
*  So you wonder why they even went through that exercise but nevertheless the president didn't [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=467.66s)]
*  choose to humiliate Iran in this moment which I think is that's classic Trump he wants to [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=472.1s)]
*  give people a way out. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=478.14000000000004s)]
*  He did say let's get to peace, let's get to the table. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=479.76000000000005s)]
*  He called it very weak and thanked them for the heads up but you know it follows a pattern. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=482.42s)]
*  In 2020 the Iranians did the same thing. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=487.14000000000004s)]
*  They fired on an Iraq, a U.S. military base in Iraq but they also gave a heads up ahead [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=489.78000000000003s)]
*  That was after the Suleimani assassination, the take down of the main military commander [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=495.5s)]
*  for Iran by the U.S. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=501.46000000000004s)]
*  And so it follows a pattern. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=503.82s)]
*  We'll see if this also follows a ceasefire because as you know the Israelis feel like [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=505.90000000000003s)]
*  they have a lot of superiority in the skies and they can take out targets at will and [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=509.82s)]
*  they're on the cusp of making a big change to their existential threat. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=514.62s)]
*  So it may be tough for them to agree to it but I think the president is pushing. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=520.0600000000001s)]
*  And Brett, although people don't want to be political in this moment, politics always [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=524.7s)]
*  enters the equation. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=528.94s)]
*  We had an enormous amount of kind of nastiness across the political aisle over the last few [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=530.5s)]
*  days regarding the president's decision. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=537.38s)]
*  Some Democrats were more tepid about it but others were basically very, very negative [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=540.3000000000001s)]
*  on what the president was doing. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=545.1800000000001s)]
*  How do you see this moment playing out politically? [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=547.4000000000001s)]
*  I mean, John Fetterman was the only Democrat I saw very vocal in his support of the action. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=552.02s)]
*  Others were either tepid or saying it was unconstitutional and he had to come to Congress [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=557.74s)]
*  first. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=562.4200000000001s)]
*  I think a lot of those Democrats, if you look back at President Obama's actions in Lebanon, [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=563.4200000000001s)]
*  in Syria, they were not anywhere near as vocal about the congressional authorization issue [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=569.1s)]
*  back then. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=575.7s)]
*  Politically, I think it plays pretty well. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=576.86s)]
*  He's kept his party largely together. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=578.98s)]
*  There are some vocal voices, as you know, Marjorie Taylor Greene and others, Tom Massey, [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=580.88s)]
*  but fairly small in number and in voice. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=586.08s)]
*  And I think it really depends how the ceasefire works out and what comes next. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=590.2s)]
*  Brett, thank you very much. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=594.28s)]
*  That was an unbelievable interview. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=596.2s)]
*  Secretary Chris Wright, Mr. Secretary, big news tonight. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=598.0s)]
*  Before we booked you to come on the show about this ceasefire deal that's going to take effect, [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=602.8s)]
*  in just a few hours from now, your thoughts about this day, especially as it related to [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=608.48s)]
*  the oil shipments through the Gulf, through the Strait of Hormuz and Iran's threats. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=616.16s)]
*  You heard the admiral's comments, but Americans were very concerned. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=621.76s)]
*  Yeah, look, Donald Trump is just simply a transformative president. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=627.28s)]
*  A little over a week ago, major hostilities break out in the Middle East. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=632.4s)]
*  And as the admiral just talked about, this is the lifeblood of global oil flows, big [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=636.54s)]
*  flows for natural gas as well. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=640.9s)]
*  Everyone's predicting for sure over a hundred dollar oil is just around the corner. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=643.66s)]
*  Then we have strong leadership from our president, precision strikes over the weekend to take [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=648.6999999999999s)]
*  out Iran's key nuclear facilities. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=653.86s)]
*  Everyone thinks that's another $20 on the price of oil. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=657.76s)]
*  But here we are Monday evening and oil dropped below $70 a barrel. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=660.96s)]
*  And more importantly for American consumers, retail wholesale gasoline was down over 10 [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=666.26s)]
*  cents today and diesel down 15%. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=671.7800000000001s)]
*  That is the collective benefits of President Trump's energy dominance agenda and his strong, [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=675.26s)]
*  clear peace through strength leadership style. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=681.38s)]
*  It's just transforming the Middle East. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=684.5400000000001s)]
*  Now, Mr. Secretary, for those of us who were young politicos back in the 80s, and I happened [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=686.7199999999999s)]
*  to work for President Reagan, this is a Reagan-esque move on the part of President Trump. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=693.92s)]
*  I mean, the America First agenda at play. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=700.3599999999999s)]
*  There were a lot of people on the right who were very concerned. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=703.3599999999999s)]
*  And I had my concerns. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=705.88s)]
*  I don't like any military involvement if we can avoid it. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=708.2399999999999s)]
*  He made a decision that there was no good reason to avoid this military engagement, [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=711.26s)]
*  that it was critical for America First. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=717.5400000000001s)]
*  I love the Reagan-esque comparison. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=721.74s)]
*  Ronald Reagan just looked at the Soviet Union completely differently than all the leaders [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=724.3000000000001s)]
*  before him. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=729.0s)]
*  He saw the black and white. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=730.0600000000001s)]
*  He saw the good and evil. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=731.34s)]
*  And the only way you win is by being clear and strong and bold. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=732.98s)]
*  And he did just that. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=738.0s)]
*  Donald Trump got elected to do the same thing with American energy policy and with American [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=739.6s)]
*  foreign policy. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=744.5200000000001s)]
*  Iran has been a mess. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=745.72s)]
*  They've been the cause of all the trouble and instability for 46 years now in this entire [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=747.88s)]
*  region of the world. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=752.76s)]
*  He didn't follow the old playbook, the Biden playbook of appeasement, ask them nicely to [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=754.44s)]
*  do less bad behavior, don't enforce the sanctions and give Iran a bunch of money. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=759.48s)]
*  That didn't work. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=765.0400000000001s)]
*  President Trump came in with a very different approach. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=766.42s)]
*  And we're still in the midst of this, but just dramatically different results in the [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=769.5799999999999s)]
*  Middle East and for American energy buyers. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=774.1s)]
*  Now, Mr. Secretary, we're just getting new details in about the ceasefire. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=776.66s)]
*  Reuters is reporting that President Trump brokered the agreement with a phone call with [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=780.86s)]
*  Netanyahu this afternoon. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=786.0799999999999s)]
*  And that Vance Rubio and Envoy Wittkopf held direct and indirect talks over the last few [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=788.5799999999999s)]
*  days with the Iranians. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=795.34s)]
*  Again, to your point, he just decided to abandon this idea that you don't treat Iran like [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=796.9200000000001s)]
*  they're real people there. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=805.0400000000001s)]
*  And he's like, they are people. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=806.5600000000001s)]
*  They want a better life. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=808.24s)]
*  Something, someone there wants a better life for these people. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=809.44s)]
*  I'm going to try to play to that while I play America's strength on the world stage. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=812.2s)]
*  But the old guard, they didn't go the Trump way. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=817.72s)]
*  And they talked him down for years and years. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=821.22s)]
*  And no one else could have pulled this off. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=824.6600000000001s)]
*  And again, assuming this all holds. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=827.38s)]
*  I agree, Laura. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=831.22s)]
*  Just a totally transformative style. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=832.36s)]
*  You know, who's President Trump's one constituency is the American people. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=835.46s)]
*  And when he does foreign policy, who's his constituency in Iran? [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=839.88s)]
*  90 million Iranians. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=843.7800000000001s)]
*  This is an educated, technically successful, pretty doing well society not long ago. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=847.14s)]
*  And it's gone backwards for 46 years. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=854.6999999999999s)]
*  Those Iranians, they want peace and trade and prosperity just like we want in the United [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=857.6999999999999s)]
*  States, just like the rest of the Middle East does. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=862.58s)]
*  Maybe they're going to get a taste of it. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=864.9s)]
*  They're going to have to step up and find their new leader. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=866.9399999999999s)]
*  Mr. Secretary, the president said drill, baby, drill today or yesterday when he was concerned [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=869.58s)]
*  about the price, perhaps of oil going up. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=875.06s)]
*  But this seems like great news so far. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=877.3s)]
*  Thank you very much for joining us. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=879.98s)]
*  Explain Jonathan Turley, George Washington University law prof and Fox News contributor. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=881.58s)]
*  I mean, that was a tough moment for all the AOC there. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=887.02s)]
*  The ceasefire. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=890.3s)]
*  So we got to impeach Trump. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=891.5s)]
*  Jonathan, you really substance of this, the substance of this, because I know you have [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=893.82s)]
*  some history about ceasefire negotiations and a president involved in these kinds of [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=898.66s)]
*  things. But tell us what we should know. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=903.96s)]
*  We have to feel for AOC. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=908.08s)]
*  You're all dressed up for an impeachment and peace breaks out. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=909.48s)]
*  It's sort of a Marissa Tomei moment from my cousin Vinny. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=911.96s)]
*  What a nightmare. And the problem is that it doesn't make for a very good impeachment. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=916.1600000000001s)]
*  And that's why she was struggling. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=922.32s)]
*  The other problem is that if this is impeachable, you could impeach a good number of [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=924.0400000000001s)]
*  presidents going back to Thomas Jefferson, who moved against the Barbary pirates. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=928.96s)]
*  You would also include Bill Clinton and Barack Obama. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=933.38s)]
*  I mean, Obama in 2016 alone dropped over 26000 bombs on countries ranging from Somalia [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=937.3000000000001s)]
*  to Syria to Afghanistan to Iraq. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=948.5s)]
*  And, you know, there was no suggestion by Democrats that they had to immediately impeach [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=952.66s)]
*  Barack Obama. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=958.1800000000001s)]
*  The fact is that presidents have always claimed this authority to be able to commit troops [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=959.8000000000001s)]
*  and take military action. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=966.84s)]
*  And yes, in my view, this is an act of war. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=968.72s)]
*  But the way that courts and Congress have interpreted it is that is not something that [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=972.44s)]
*  requires a declaration. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=977.32s)]
*  And keep in mind, we've only declared 11 wars in our history. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=979.0400000000001s)]
*  We've had over 125 military operations, some going on for years without such a [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=982.4s)]
*  declaration, including Vietnam and Korea. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=988.24s)]
*  You know, I think it's probably a good idea for Congress to have to weigh in on war, [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=991.9s)]
*  especially protracted conflicts and boots on the ground. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=996.46s)]
*  But this this obviously was her point was ridiculous from the beginning. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=999.66s)]
*  Now, we had another big win for President Trump today. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1004.46s)]
*  I mean, he has lots of wins to talk about today. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1007.26s)]
*  But this was the Supreme Court, at least temporarily clearing the way for the White [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1009.22s)]
*  House to speed up these deportations and send illegals to countries where they have no [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1013.14s)]
*  previous ties. How important is this, Jonathan, tonight? [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1017.58s)]
*  This is enormously important. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1022.6s)]
*  It gives a great number of options now to the Trump administration. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1024.04s)]
*  It should have the effect of speeding up deportations. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1027.76s)]
*  This Boston judge actually said that he believed the Supreme Court and Congress were on [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1031.04s)]
*  his side. Well, obviously, he was wrong about one of those by 6-3, because that's the [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1035.72s)]
*  result today. And the and the court said you can send people to a country other than [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1040.6000000000001s)]
*  their home country. That is a major stumbling block for the administration. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1045.58s)]
*  They have a lot of people to deport, but they also don't have cooperative countries [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1050.54s)]
*  often on the other side. This gives them options. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1054.26s)]
*  And you can bet they're going to use it. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1057.4199999999998s)]
*  Now, I think the Trump administration does not have the time to give the process that [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1060.1799999999998s)]
*  the left thinks every illegal alien is due. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1065.54s)]
*  Most of them have already been given their own due process. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1068.3799999999999s)]
*  But, Jonathan, this is fascinating. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1070.78s)]
*  Incredible day of news. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1072.46s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1073.62s)]
*  What happened with Iran in the Middle East and some breaking news coming just now. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1074.6399999999999s)]
*  Joining us this evening, Vice President J.D. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1078.12s)]
*  Vance. Mr. Vice President, thanks for coming. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1080.72s)]
*  Absolutely. Just seconds ago, the president went to True Social and typed this. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1082.56s)]
*  It has been fully agreed by and between Israel and Iran that there will be a complete [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1088.1999999999998s)]
*  and total ceasefire. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1093.9199999999998s)]
*  Complete and total ceasefire is what he typed. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1096.32s)]
*  Yeah. What does that mean? [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1098.52s)]
*  How did it come about? [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1100.3999999999999s)]
*  What's the development? [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1101.76s)]
*  Yeah. Well, we were actually working on that just as I left the White House to come over [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1102.76s)]
*  here. So that's good news that the president was able to get that across the finish line. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1105.94s)]
*  I think what it means, Brett, is quite simple. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1108.94s)]
*  First of all, the president, without knock on wood, having a single American casualty, [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1110.9s)]
*  obliterated the Iranian nuclear program. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1117.54s)]
*  We are now in a place where we weren't a week ago. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1119.62s)]
*  A week ago, Iran was very close to having a nuclear weapon. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1122.02s)]
*  Now Iran is incapable of building a nuclear weapon with the equipment they have because [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1125.18s)]
*  we destroyed it. So that's a very, very big thing. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1129.94s)]
*  Now what that means, I think, is we have to talk to Iran and of course to Israel about [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1132.86s)]
*  what the future holds, because while we have obliterated the Iranian nuclear program, our [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1137.3s)]
*  hope and our expectation is that they're not going to try to rebuild that program. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1141.58s)]
*  And I think that's what the president is really trying to figure out here, is to build a [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1145.18s)]
*  long term settlement here to where we can have peace in the region, where our regional [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1149.42s)]
*  allies and of course the American people most importantly can be secured. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1154.3s)]
*  But where we can ensure that the destruction of the Iranian nuclear program that has already [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1157.7s)]
*  happened is not something they try to rebuild. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1161.6s)]
*  I want to get to the obliterated part in just a minute, but I just want to read this fully so [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1164.08s)]
*  I get the context. Congratulations to everyone. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1167.84s)]
*  It has been fully agreed by and between Israel and Iran that there will be a complete and [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1170.48s)]
*  total ceasefire in approximately six hours from now when Israel and Iran have wound down [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1174.8799999999999s)]
*  and completed their in progress final missions for 12 hours, at which point the ceasefire [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1179.84s)]
*  for 12 hours, at which point the war will be considered ended. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1185.08s)]
*  Officially, Iran will start the ceasefire and upon the 12th hour, Israel will start the [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1188.86s)]
*  ceasefire and upon the 24th hour, an official end to the 12 day war will be saluted by the [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1192.86s)]
*  world. During each ceasefire, the other side will remain peaceful and respectful on the [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1198.22s)]
*  assumption that everything works as it should, which it will. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1202.54s)]
*  I would like to congratulate both countries, Israel and Iran, on having the stamina, courage [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1205.54s)]
*  and intelligence to end what should be called the 12 day war. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1209.7s)]
*  This is a war that could have gone on for years and destroyed the entire Middle East, but [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1213.06s)]
*  it didn't and never will. God bless Israel. God bless Iran. God bless Iran. God bless [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1217.02s)]
*  the Middle East. God bless the United States of America and God bless the world. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1222.44s)]
*  He seems confident that this is all coming together. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1227.04s)]
*  That's right. And when you left the White House, were you thinking this was all gelling [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1230.24s)]
*  here? When I left the White House, I thought that we might be able to get it across the [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1235.12s)]
*  finish line before this broadcast. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1238.6399999999999s)]
*  And it looks like the president has been able to do that. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1240.24s)]
*  I mean, look, he's been working the phones constantly, frankly, before the 12 day war [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1242.2s)]
*  started. But certainly over the past 12 days, the president's been extremely clear about [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1246.06s)]
*  America's national objective here. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1250.78s)]
*  It is to create a world where Iran cannot build a nuclear weapon. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1252.86s)]
*  We, of course, destroyed the nuclear program that they had. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1256.6599999999999s)]
*  And the president told the entire team, we're going to work to make sure that they don't [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1259.6599999999999s)]
*  try to rebuild that nuclear capability in the future. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1263.5s)]
*  And it's look, this is a great thing for Israel. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1266.3799999999999s)]
*  Think about this. They've accomplished an important military objective. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1269.1399999999999s)]
*  They've helped us destroy the Iranian nuclear program. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1272.8999999999999s)]
*  They've also destroyed the conventional missile capability of Iran that threatened the country [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1275.62s)]
*  of Israel for the Iranians. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1280.08s)]
*  I think this is a new opportunity to actually pursue the path of peace. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1281.84s)]
*  As I said yesterday, what the Iranians have showed through their support of terror networks [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1285.1599999999999s)]
*  through their now failed effort to build a nuclear weapon is that they're just not very [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1289.8s)]
*  good at war. And I think the president really hit the reset button and said, look, let's [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1293.9599999999998s)]
*  actually produce long term peace for the region. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1298.6399999999999s)]
*  That's always been his goal. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1301.56s)]
*  I actually think when we look back, we will say the 12 day war was an important reset [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1303.18s)]
*  moment for the entire region. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1307.74s)]
*  Would you be surprised if Iran is sending out signals that it doesn't have a specific [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1309.58s)]
*  ceasefire plan? [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1313.24s)]
*  How would the communication have been with the Iranians to get this level of confidence [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1314.42s)]
*  to put out that detailed statement? [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1319.34s)]
*  Well, one of the things I've learned, read about the Iranians in the past, you know, [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1320.94s)]
*  four or five months that I've been in this job is what they say publicly and privately [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1323.98s)]
*  can sometimes be very different. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1327.6599999999999s)]
*  I think what the Iranians have shown very clearly is they don't want this war to go [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1329.3600000000001s)]
*  on for much longer. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1332.88s)]
*  Their air defenses have been totally destroyed. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1333.76s)]
*  Their conventional missile program has been largely destroyed. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1336.0400000000002s)]
*  And of course, their nuclear program has been obliterated, as I said before. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1339.0s)]
*  So I think the Iranians are at a place where they don't want to keep on fighting. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1342.5200000000002s)]
*  You saw the president and I don't have the truth in front of me, but he talked about [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1346.68s)]
*  the next six hours finalizing the attacks. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1350.8000000000002s)]
*  I mean, what I think what he's talking about is right now for the American people [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1353.24s)]
*  watching, it's dark over there. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1356.76s)]
*  That's typically when the Israelis and the Iranians have been shooting at each other. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1358.68s)]
*  I think there's some recognition that that might continue for another few hours. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1362.22s)]
*  And tomorrow really is a new day. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1365.66s)]
*  The end of the 12 day war, the end of the Iranian nuclear program. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1367.18s)]
*  And I really do believe the beginning of something very big for peace in the Middle East. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1370.5s)]
*  So you said totally obliterated. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1374.3s)]
*  The president has said totally obliterated the Iran nuclear program. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1376.14s)]
*  Do you know for sure where all the highly enriched uranium is? [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1381.74s)]
*  Well, Brett, I think that's actually not the question before us. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1385.8000000000002s)]
*  The question before us is can Iran enrich the uranium to weapons grade level and can [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1389.2s)]
*  they convert that fuel to a nuclear weapon? [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1394.28s)]
*  And we know based on the success of our mission, of course, the leadership of the president, [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1396.76s)]
*  but the incredible skill of our military that the two mission objectives are completely [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1401.0800000000002s)]
*  successful. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1406.6000000000001s)]
*  We know that they cannot build a nuclear weapon. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1407.6000000000001s)]
*  Now you asked about the highly enriched uranium. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1409.48s)]
*  Yeah, like 900 pounds of it. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1412.0s)]
*  But what we know, Brett, is that uranium is something that exists in very large supply. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1413.34s)]
*  Our goal was to bury the uranium and I do think the uranium is buried. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1419.06s)]
*  But our goal was to eliminate the enrichment and eliminate their ability to convert that [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1423.3799999999999s)]
*  enriched fuel into a nuclear weapon. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1428.1599999999999s)]
*  I actually just I think that's an important point, Brett, because so many of the folks [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1429.78s)]
*  who have focused on the highly enriched uranium, the main focus, Brett, has been to destroy [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1433.1399999999999s)]
*  their enrichment capacity because we don't want that 60% uranium to become 90% uranium. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1439.26s)]
*  That's the real concern and that's what was so successful about our mission. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1445.28s)]
*  So after all this, if the Iranian government survives as is, what's to stop it from rebuilding [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1448.64s)]
*  over time if they in fact move the 60% highly enriched uranium? [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1453.84s)]
*  That's the concern. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1458.96s)]
*  No, the big concern, Brett, and this is again what we destroyed, is their ability to enrich [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1459.96s)]
*  uranium. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1464.84s)]
*  They have 60% enriched uranium, but they don't have the ability to enrich it to 90% and further [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1465.84s)]
*  they don't have the ability to convert that to a nuclear weapon. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1471.4599999999998s)]
*  That is mission success. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1474.62s)]
*  That is the obliteration of their nuclear program, which is why the president I think [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1475.84s)]
*  rightly is using that term. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1479.3999999999999s)]
*  But here's the question. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1481.32s)]
*  If Iran is desperate to build a nuclear weapon in the future, then they're going to have [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1482.62s)]
*  to deal with a very, very powerful American military again. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1486.8799999999999s)]
*  lesson that the Iranians have learned here is look, we can fly a bunker buster bomb from [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1491.8s)]
*  Missouri to Iran completely undetected without landing once on the ground and we can destroy [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1497.6399999999999s)]
*  whatever nuclear capacity you build up. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1503.56s)]
*  I think that lesson is what's going to teach them not to rebuild their nuclear capacity. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1505.76s)]
*  Yesterday, were you speaking on the president's behalf when you said he was not interested [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1509.6399999999999s)]
*  in regime change? [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1514.12s)]
*  Well, Brett, what I've said is the American military, that is not our mission is regime [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1515.12s)]
*  change. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1519.36s)]
*  Our mission was to destroy the nuclear facilities and the nuclear program of Iran, which we [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1520.36s)]
*  of course did. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1524.4399999999998s)]
*  I think what the president's also said is that the Iranian people want to make a decision [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1525.4399999999998s)]
*  about regime change. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1529.04s)]
*  That's between the Iranian people and the regime. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1530.1999999999998s)]
*  Of course, we support freedom fighters all around the world, but our mission was to destroy [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1532.6399999999999s)]
*  the nuclear facilities and that's what we did. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1537.04s)]
*  So you don't think there's any mixed message when he goes to true social and says it's [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1538.8s)]
*  not politically correct to use the term regime change, but if the current Iranian regime [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1542.36s)]
*  is unable to make Iran great again, why wouldn't there be a regime change? [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1545.6399999999999s)]
*  Well, I think what the president is saying very clearly, Brett, is if the Iranian people [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1549.6s)]
*  want to do something about their own leadership, that's up to the Iranian people. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1554.52s)]
*  What the American national security interests here is very simple. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1558.32s)]
*  It's to destroy the nuclear program. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1561.48s)]
*  That's what we've done. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1563.24s)]
*  And now that the 12-day war appears to be effectively over, we have an opportunity, [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1564.52s)]
*  I think, to restart a real peace process. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1568.92s)]
*  And Brett, this is not just about two countries, Iran and Israel. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1571.1200000000001s)]
*  All of these Gulf Arab states, they want peace. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1575.08s)]
*  They want to invest. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1578.04s)]
*  They want to build artificial intelligence, hardware. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1579.04s)]
*  They want to sort of come into the new economy. [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1581.8s)]
*  And that was impossible when you had Iran that was, as the president said, acting like [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1584.68s)]
*  a bully across the Middle East. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1589.2s)]
*  We really think that if the Iranians are smart about the path forward, this could be a new [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1590.6399999999999s)]
*  dawn of an economic age of prosperity, of course, for our Gulf Arab allies, for us, [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1595.12s)]
*  for the Israelis, for everybody. [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1600.96s)]
*  But it's going to require the Iranians play it smart from here. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1603.06s)]
*  The president called it very weak, the Iran missile firing on the U.S. base in Qatar, [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1605.66s)]
*  al-Yadid. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1611.0600000000002s)]
*  Was it a face-saving move? [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1613.46s)]
*  How do you get from that, firing missiles at a U.S. base, to a ceasefire, as he details [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1615.0600000000002s)]
*  in this Truth Social? [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1620.3000000000002s)]
*  Well, as the president said, they actually gave us some warning here. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1621.3000000000002s)]
*  And we think they gave us some warning because they didn't want to kill Americans and they [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1623.96s)]
*  didn't want to escalate. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1626.98s)]
*  There's definitely some symbolism to this, Brett. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1628.6200000000001s)]
*  the Iranian attack. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1631.3s)]
*  It was 14 missiles that they telegraphed ahead of time. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1632.54s)]
*  We dropped 14 bunker buster bombs, as the president told me earlier. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1635.98s)]
*  Our missiles, our bombs, were a little bit bigger than their bombs. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1640.1200000000001s)]
*  Our bombs actually accomplished the goal of eliminating their nuclear program. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1643.24s)]
*  But look, we're happy, again, to restart the peace process as the president just did today. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1647.52s)]
*  Was the message delivered directly to the U.S. or through an emissary? [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1651.74s)]
*  The message is always delivered through some sort of intermediary. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1655.04s)]
*  That's been consistently true of the Iranians. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1659.16s)]
*  Of course, we'd love to talk to them. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1661.48s)]
*  The president's been clear about this. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1663.0400000000002s)]
*  We'd love to have a direct conversation about how we move this thing forward. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1664.3600000000001s)]
*  Because again, we've got to step back here. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1668.44s)]
*  Why did the president do what he did over the past week? [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1670.8400000000001s)]
*  It's so that we could destroy their nuclear program. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1674.24s)]
*  If they try to rebuild it, they're going to be on the wrong end of American power once [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1676.3600000000001s)]
*  again. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1679.8000000000002s)]
*  We don't want that. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1680.8000000000002s)]
*  I think they don't want that. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1681.8000000000002s)]
*  But the ball's in their hands. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1682.8000000000002s)]
*  You've been reluctant, or at least cautious, about getting engaged previously. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1683.8000000000002s)]
*  And that has been public. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1688.64s)]
*  What made you sign on to this action this time? [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1690.6000000000001s)]
*  Well, I think the president has been very clear, and I've always agreed with the president, [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1693.8400000000001s)]
*  that Iran can't have a nuclear weapon. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1697.2800000000002s)]
*  And you try to run the diplomatic process as much as you possibly can. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1699.44s)]
*  When the president decided that wasn't going to work, he took the action that he had to [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1703.48s)]
*  take. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1706.96s)]
*  Now we're in a new phase. [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1707.96s)]
*  That action was successful. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1708.96s)]
*  We had a wildly successful military operation to take out their nuclear program. [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1709.96s)]
*  Now let's go on to the next phase. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1714.5600000000002s)]
*  I think the president, look, sometimes he's willing to use peace. [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1716.08s)]
*  Sometimes he's willing to use the military. [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1720.76s)]
*  I think it really depends on what the Iranians do from here. [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1722.4399999999998s)]
*  And what do you think they do from here? [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1725.8s)]
*  Well, it's an open question, Brett. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1727.1999999999998s)]
*  I don't want to predict what the other side will do, but I think that I know what we'll [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1728.84s)]
*  do if they continue to pursue a nuclear weapon. [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1732.24s)]
*  And I hope they don't choose that path because I know the president wants to see the Middle [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1735.12s)]
*  East become peaceful and prosperous in the future. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1738.28s)]
*  That's not going to happen if Iran pursues a nuclear weapon again. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1741.22s)]
*  So we talked about the people who believe that this is going towards World War III, [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1745.04s)]
*  especially in your own party. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1748.92s)]
*  There's a section that's very vocal. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1750.04s)]
*  There's another section that says you should take out this regime because it's evil and [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1752.28s)]
*  horrible and has done horrible things for decades. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1755.76s)]
*  How do you square those two sides? [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1758.3799999999999s)]
*  And can this regime stay in place and still have a peaceful reaction relationship with [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1761.1599999999999s)]
*  the U.S.? [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1768.6s)]
*  Well, I think the president has squared those two sides quite well. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1769.6s)]
*  One, because he's the leader of the movement and a lot of people trust the president as [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1772.4399999999998s)]
*  they should. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1775.8799999999999s)]
*  They recognize they're not seeing the same intelligence. [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1776.8799999999999s)]
*  They're not seeing the same classified documents. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1779.04s)]
*  They trust the president to do a good job. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1780.9599999999998s)]
*  But importantly, Brett, I think he's threaded the needle quite well here. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1783.28s)]
*  We had a very particular objective. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1786.3999999999999s)]
*  It was profound and difficult to accomplish the elimination of the Iranian nuclear program. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1788.36s)]
*  And I think the president successfully did that. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1794.1599999999999s)]
*  You're asking were the Iranians close to nuclear weapon? [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1796.76s)]
*  Brett, they were very close to a nuclear weapon. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1799.72s)]
*  And what I encourage my fellow Americans to think about here is that a week ago, the Iranians [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1802.44s)]
*  were quite close to achieving a nuclear weapon. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1807.8s)]
*  Now they cannot build a nuclear weapon. [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1810.48s)]
*  That is the biggest testament to the president's leadership and to the success of our mission. [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1814.1200000000001s)]
*  In one week, without, thank God so far, not losing a single American casualty, we have [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1818.68s)]
*  taken what was a threatening nuclear program that could have destabilized the entire world. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1824.04s)]
*  Now that program is gone. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1828.96s)]
*  We did it through effective presidential leadership and also some very, very competent work from [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1830.72s)]
*  our troops. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1835.04s)]
*  How often does it happen where you're going to do an interview and you get a true social [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1836.48s)]
*  seconds before? [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1840.64s)]
*  You have some sense of it, but it's pretty detailed where you are being asked about something [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1842.1200000000001s)]
*  the president has just put out. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1847.2s)]
*  In this administration, Brett, it happens quite a bit actually, but we knew this was [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1848.8400000000001s)]
*  coming. [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1852.8400000000001s)]
*  The draft, it was interesting. [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1853.8400000000001s)]
*  I just read the draft about two minutes before we went on the air. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1855.48s)]
*  It was a little bit different from what the president had showed me a couple of hours [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1858.48s)]
*  ago, but again, I knew that he was working the phones as I was on the way over here. [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1861.88s)]
*  So I knew exactly what we were going to do. [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1866.28s)]
*  And look, I love that about this presidency and this administration is he's always working. [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1868.08s)]
*  He doesn't say, you know, the vice president is going to do an interview, so I'm going [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1873.32s)]
*  to stop doing anything. [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1876.0s)]
*  He says, you know, we're going to do the American people's business. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1877.0s)]
*  The vice president knows what I'm trying to accomplish. [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1880.14s)]
*  And if I get it done, great, because we're going to talk about it and celebrate it because [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1882.16s)]
*  it is a thing to celebrate. [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1885.68s)]
*  I can't emphasize this enough, Brett. [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1887.24s)]
*  We have destroyed the Iranian nuclear program. [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1889.32s)]
*  Zero Americans have died. [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1892.36s)]
*  That's an amazing, amazing thing. [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1893.8s)]
*  Americans whether Democrats or Republicans, we should be celebrating that. [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1896.56s)]
*  Mr. Vice President, we appreciate you coming and rolling with the punches as well. [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1899.76s)]
*  Thank you for the time. [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1903.6s)]
*  Thanks Brett. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1904.96s)]
*  Good to see you. [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1905.96s)]
*  Nationally syndicated radio host Dana Lash is here. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1906.96s)]
*  How are the Democrats handling these strikes and this quick ceasefire? [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1910.96s)]
*  Jesse, it's pretty unbelievable because they're all over the map on this. [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1916.76s)]
*  I mean, I remember going all the way back to like the Green Revolution and going back [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1921.4s)]
*  to Egypt and Libya. [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1925.68s)]
*  Democrats loved unilateral action. [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1928.52s)]
*  They loved unilateral action in Libya, going after Gaddafi and trying to reinstitute a [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1930.52s)]
*  bunch of Clinton's stooges in order to nation build. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1934.8s)]
*  They loved getting involved in Egyptian elections and backing the Muslim Brotherhood as Hillary [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1937.72s)]
*  Clinton did, a banned entity in Egypt before then. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1941.64s)]
*  They loved getting involved in Honduran elections and trying to back different leaders in Honduras. [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1944.6000000000001s)]
*  I mean, we could go on and on. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1949.68s)]
*  I don't know if there's ever been a moment in my life where Democrats haven't loved unilateral [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1951.28s)]
*  action and nation building. [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1956.56s)]
*  And to just the cherry on top of all of this, everybody remembers the entire reason we are [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1958.56s)]
*  in this position in the first place is because of Jimmy Carter and Democrats back in the [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1963.6s)]
*  70s when they decided to get rid of the Shah and they installed the Mueller regime. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1968.56s)]
*  That's exactly why we're in this position. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1973.0s)]
*  Democrats own it. [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1975.28s)]
*  So you would think that they would be celebrating that their legacy has come full circle, but [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1976.56s)]
*  they haven't yet. [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1980.24s)]
*  And as far as the argument on whether or not the office of the executive has unilateral [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1981.52s)]
*  action, I've made my position very clear on my radio program, Jesse. [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1986.12s)]
*  I think war is a last resort. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1989.48s)]
*  I'm not an interventionist, but I'm not a neocon. [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1991.1599999999999s)]
*  However, I would like to direct people to reread if they haven't or read James Madison [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1993.9199999999998s)]
*  and the Federalist Papers because it's all brilliantly lined out. [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=1998.9199999999998s)]
*  And it's in these things, Jesse, for progressives to read called books. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=2002.1999999999998s)]
*  You can have a noble objection to these strikes. [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=2008.28s)]
*  There was people on the right who had it. [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=2012.1599999999999s)]
*  There's people on the left that have it. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=2014.24s)]
*  And that's fine. [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=2015.96s)]
*  And that's good. [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=2016.96s)]
*  I mean, you know, everyone's going to agree on everything. [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=2017.96s)]
*  But to say that, you know, that Trump should have asked your permission if you're Jasmine [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=2020.44s)]
*  Crockett, I mean, what? [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=2025.68s)]
*  I thought this was a secret aerial campaign. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=2029.3600000000001s)]
*  He's just supposed to announce to the world, Jasmine, can I please have your permission [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=2032.3200000000002s)]
*  to do this? [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=2037.28s)]
*  And that doesn't make any sense. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=2038.28s)]
*  I get the objections on from some of those coming on the right because they're genuine [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=2041.6000000000001s)]
*  objections that come from a place of genuine concern. [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=2046.28s)]
*  Just to remind everybody, we have grown up. [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=2049.64s)]
*  I mean, Jesse, you and I have grown up our entire lives with military campaigns that [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=2052.0s)]
*  had mission creep. [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=2056.04s)]
*  You know, the objectives were changing. [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=2057.04s)]
*  It turned into these long protracted conflicts and then, you know, multiple generations that [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=2059.52s)]
*  were involved in it. [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=2065.72s)]
*  I had multiple generations in my family that were in Iraq and Afghanistan. [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=2066.72s)]
*  I mean, that's like wild that that would even be considered commonplace in our culture. [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=2069.7999999999997s)]
*  But we kind of got off base in terms of how we prosecute conflict. [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=2074.44s)]
*  To see a one and done or to see a politician and elected officials say we're going to get [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=2078.7599999999998s)]
*  in, we're going to do this and we're going to get out. [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=2083.7999999999997s)]
*  We're not used to that yet. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=2085.7599999999998s)]
*  So I give a lot of grace to a lot of my friends on the right who aren't all on the same page [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=2087.3999999999996s)]
*  with this. [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=2092.24s)]
*  That being said, I think you could look back at POTUS's first term and see that everything [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=2093.24s)]
*  that he engaged in militarily, we didn't get involved in any kind of long term committed [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=2097.8399999999997s)]
*  conflict. [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=2102.3199999999997s)]
*  It wasn't mission creep. [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=2103.3199999999997s)]
*  He said we went in and we did and then we came back out with like the most limited loss [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=2104.56s)]
*  of resource and even loss of human life. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=2109.28s)]
*  And that's how it should be. [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=2111.96s)]
*  So I think we're still on the right kind of acclimating to this. [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=2113.52s)]
*  However, I will add on the left, there has never been any consistency. [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=2116.72s)]
*  There has never been any proper follow through. [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=2120.8s)]
*  There's never been any clear communication with the American people about any of their [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=2123.04s)]
*  objectives, which again is why we're in this position in the first place. [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=2126.56s)]
*  So I think it's good to have a healthy dose of caution. [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=2130.0s)]
*  And I like what Congressman Thomas Massey, who I know, I think, you know, he's genuinely a [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=2133.12s)]
*  kindhearted person who comes at it from a very strictly constitutionalist angle. [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=2137.44s)]
*  And thank God we have people like that holding down that spectrum in Congress. [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=2141.92s)]
*  I think that we can all agree that it's better to have some of those folks in Congress than [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=2145.64s)]
*  not. But to see where this goes, we have to make sure that, you know, the intelligence is [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=2149.2s)]
*  accurate. That's all we've been acting on. [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=2153.08s)]
*  I think that the president has demonstrated in previous military conflicts and engagements [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=2155.2s)]
*  that he deserves the grace and the benefit of the doubt on this. [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=2160.52s)]
*  I haven't always agreed with him on everything, but I'm willing to do that with us. [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=2162.92s)]
*  Yeah, he's earned the trust of the American people, especially what he's gone through [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=2166.32s)]
*  during the last term and especially that last campaign where he almost died. [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=2170.76s)]
*  Dana Lash, great to see you. [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goQCZ_AKC1M&t=2175.48s)]
