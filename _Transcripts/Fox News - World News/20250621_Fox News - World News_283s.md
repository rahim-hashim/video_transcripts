# Multiple countries evacuate Mid-East embassies as Israel strikes another Iranian nuclear facility
**Fox News - World News:** [June 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5i3_nL6O_M)
*  A U.S. official confirms to Fox News B-2 stealth bombers appear headed from Whiteman Air Force [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5i3_nL6O_M&t=0.0s)]
*  Base in Missouri, who will base in Guam, as President Trump weighs possible U.S. involvement [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5i3_nL6O_M&t=5.84s)]
*  in the war between Israel and Iran. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5i3_nL6O_M&t=10.74s)]
*  It is now week two of Israel and Iran trading strikes. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5i3_nL6O_M&t=21.2s)]
*  Meantime, the first talks on Iran's nukes since the warfare began were held in Geneva, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5i3_nL6O_M&t=24.44s)]
*  but no breakthrough. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5i3_nL6O_M&t=29.5s)]
*  So all eyes turn to Washington. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5i3_nL6O_M&t=31.18s)]
*  President Trump heads back to the White House tonight for a security briefing after saying [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5i3_nL6O_M&t=33.3s)]
*  he'll decide in two weeks whether our forces join Israel's. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5i3_nL6O_M&t=36.7s)]
*  Good afternoon. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5i3_nL6O_M&t=41.94s)]
*  I'm John Scott, and this is the Fox Report. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5i3_nL6O_M&t=42.94s)]
*  Georgia Congressman Rich McCormick is standing by on possible U.S. involvement in the Middle [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5i3_nL6O_M&t=51.42s)]
*  East. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5i3_nL6O_M&t=55.86s)]
*  Next, Fox Team coverage. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5i3_nL6O_M&t=56.86s)]
*  Lukas Tomlinson is at the White House for us. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5i3_nL6O_M&t=58.32s)]
*  But we begin with senior foreign affairs correspondent Greg Palcott. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5i3_nL6O_M&t=61.38s)]
*  He's live in Tel Aviv right now. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5i3_nL6O_M&t=64.58s)]
*  Greg. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5i3_nL6O_M&t=66.66s)]
*  Hi, John. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5i3_nL6O_M&t=67.66s)]
*  Yeah, it's nighttime here in Tel Aviv, and officials are on high alert for any new attacks. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5i3_nL6O_M&t=68.66s)]
*  As we saw last night, Iran seems to prefer darkness for its dirty work. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5i3_nL6O_M&t=74.7s)]
*  Five Iranian missiles were launched. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5i3_nL6O_M&t=79.58s)]
*  All were shot down by Israel's anti-missile defenses. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5i3_nL6O_M&t=82.06s)]
*  This is Israeli jets today pummeled the Isfahan nuclear facility. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5i3_nL6O_M&t=86.3s)]
*  The IAEA confirms damage to the centrifuge construction facility. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5i3_nL6O_M&t=90.94s)]
*  The IDF says in addition, they've been hitting Iran's military infrastructure in the southwest [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5i3_nL6O_M&t=95.82s)]
*  part of that country. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5i3_nL6O_M&t=101.1s)]
*  There's also another assassination by Israel today. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5i3_nL6O_M&t=102.66s)]
*  This time, Saeed Zadi was killed. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5i3_nL6O_M&t=105.97999999999999s)]
*  He was a Revolutionary Guard commander who played a key role in the deadly October 7th [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5i3_nL6O_M&t=109.02s)]
*  Hamas attack against Israel. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5i3_nL6O_M&t=114.53999999999999s)]
*  And the IDF says it shot down all but one of 40 Iranian drones headed towards Israel [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5i3_nL6O_M&t=117.41999999999999s)]
*  this morning. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5i3_nL6O_M&t=123.33999999999999s)]
*  Tehran has had less success with these relatively slow-moving projectiles. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5i3_nL6O_M&t=124.5s)]
*  Meanwhile, the U.S. is joining other countries in getting its citizens out of Israel. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5i3_nL6O_M&t=129.57999999999998s)]
*  There was a military flight yesterday of some 79 embassy staff and families. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5i3_nL6O_M&t=135.24s)]
*  Ambassador Huckabee today reaching out in a post to any other Americans interested in [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5i3_nL6O_M&t=140.98s)]
*  leaving. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5i3_nL6O_M&t=146.45999999999998s)]
*  John, this as reports, increase of U.S. military buildup here in the region and the movement [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5i3_nL6O_M&t=147.45999999999998s)]
*  a bit closer to the area of those B-2 stealth bombers. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5i3_nL6O_M&t=154.38s)]
*  They are key to any step up of American involvement in this crisis. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5i3_nL6O_M&t=158.57999999999998s)]
*  Back to you. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5i3_nL6O_M&t=163.42s)]
*  One of the questions, Greg, which maybe nobody has an answer to, including yourself, is how [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5i3_nL6O_M&t=164.42s)]
*  many of those ballistic missiles does Iran have left in its arsenal? [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5i3_nL6O_M&t=169.18s)]
*  We know the Israelis have tried to take out as many as they can. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5i3_nL6O_M&t=173.46s)]
*  That's a good question indeed, John. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5i3_nL6O_M&t=179.34s)]
*  There are a couple of thousand, it is believed, left in the arsenal of Iran, but also being [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5i3_nL6O_M&t=181.78s)]
*  taken out are the missile launchers by Israel. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5i3_nL6O_M&t=188.42000000000002s)]
*  And if you don't have the launchers, you can't fire the missiles. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5i3_nL6O_M&t=193.46s)]
*  Israel is working on a couple of different ways to limit the damage from Iran, but they [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5i3_nL6O_M&t=197.26s)]
*  still can pack a punch right now. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5i3_nL6O_M&t=203.98s)]
*  Give us a sense, Greg, of the mood of the Israeli people. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5i3_nL6O_M&t=206.45999999999998s)]
*  They're hearing these sirens just about every night, it would seem. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5i3_nL6O_M&t=210.66s)]
*  Yeah, we've been through it in the past several days since we've been here. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5i3_nL6O_M&t=215.78s)]
*  To get an alert on your phone, that means the missiles have been fired from Iran heading [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5i3_nL6O_M&t=220.42s)]
*  towards Israel. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5i3_nL6O_M&t=226.94s)]
*  It takes about 12 minutes for these missiles to get here, so there is enough time to get [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5i3_nL6O_M&t=227.94s)]
*  to shelters and protect yourself, and that's exactly what most of the folks here in Israel [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5i3_nL6O_M&t=233.01999999999998s)]
*  are doing. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5i3_nL6O_M&t=239.5s)]
*  But this happens once, twice, maybe three times a day and night. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5i3_nL6O_M&t=240.5s)]
*  It is getting wary on these people, even if they are not always in harm's way, it certainly [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5i3_nL6O_M&t=245.29999999999998s)]
*  is wearing down the psyche of the people here in Israel. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5i3_nL6O_M&t=250.9s)]
*  And I must add, there's a lot of damage being done in Iran as well. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5i3_nL6O_M&t=255.22s)]
*  The people there are feeling it very hard too. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5i3_nL6O_M&t=259.18s)]
*  Yeah, 12 minutes doesn't seem like a lot of time to save your life. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5i3_nL6O_M&t=261.86s)]
*  Greg Palka, reporting live from Tel Aviv, Israel. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5i3_nL6O_M&t=266.86s)]
*  Greg, thanks. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5i3_nL6O_M&t=269.26s)]
*  And thanks for joining us. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5i3_nL6O_M&t=275.1s)]
*  We'll see you next time. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5i3_nL6O_M&t=276.1s)]
*  Bye. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5i3_nL6O_M&t=277.1s)]
*  Bye. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5i3_nL6O_M&t=278.1s)]
*  Bye. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5i3_nL6O_M&t=279.1s)]
