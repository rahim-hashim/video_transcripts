# Mark Levin: Iran is trying to kill as many Israelis as it possibly can
**Fox News - World News:** [June 16, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybW1uU5JjQ4)
*  MUSIC [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybW1uU5JjQ4&t=0.0s)]
*  Hello America, I'm Mark Levin and it's Life, Liberty and Levin Sunday. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybW1uU5JjQ4&t=15.44s)]
*  We have two great guests, Senator Tom Cotton and Robert Greenway, expert on the Middle East [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybW1uU5JjQ4&t=19.2s)]
*  and Iran in particular, former National Security Council Senior Director under President Trump in his first term. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybW1uU5JjQ4&t=24.0s)]
*  It was a hell of a wonderful celebration last evening, wasn't it, with the President and [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybW1uU5JjQ4&t=29.6s)]
*  the military there, 250th anniversary of the Army. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybW1uU5JjQ4&t=35.36s)]
*  1775, what happened in 1775? Our Collins decided that they didn't want to be abused anymore. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybW1uU5JjQ4&t=41.6s)]
*  They didn't want to be abused anymore, they wanted self-government, and so they fought for it and they [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybW1uU5JjQ4&t=51.52s)]
*  were never supposed to win. Bailey outnumbered, they didn't have much for a professional army, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybW1uU5JjQ4&t=57.52s)]
*  you know the story. The President of the United States gave a tremendous speech [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybW1uU5JjQ4&t=62.64s)]
*  about our heroes, about how our men and women in uniform fight, fight, fight, just like he did in [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybW1uU5JjQ4&t=67.52000000000001s)]
*  that assassination attempt. We have Medal of Honor winners. Why do we have a Medal of Honor? [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybW1uU5JjQ4&t=74.24000000000001s)]
*  We have a Medal of Honor to give special recognition to the greatest of warriors, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybW1uU5JjQ4&t=79.92s)]
*  and yet there are tremendous numbers of warriors we've had throughout our history. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybW1uU5JjQ4&t=85.12s)]
*  Look at the Revolutionary War, incredible war, incredible victory, horrible, horrible deaths, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybW1uU5JjQ4&t=90.24000000000001s)]
*  and the British would take our men, imprison them on their slave boats, prison ships they call them, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybW1uU5JjQ4&t=99.04s)]
*  they would dive dysentery to the extent they fed them, the meat was rancid, we lost about half of [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybW1uU5JjQ4&t=105.68s)]
*  our men during the Revolutionary War who were on those ships. And without the French, without the [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybW1uU5JjQ4&t=112.24s)]
*  help of the French, basically taking down and chasing off much of the British Navy, we wouldn't [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybW1uU5JjQ4&t=118.24s)]
*  have won at Yorktown, we wouldn't have our independence. Important to remember, isn't it, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybW1uU5JjQ4&t=124.32s)]
*  those who say we don't need allies and we can always go it along. It's not what our history shows. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybW1uU5JjQ4&t=129.28s)]
*  We fought a civil war, over 700,000 casualties. Was it worth it? Or should we just say peace? [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybW1uU5JjQ4&t=134.72s)]
*  They have slavery and we don't have slavery. That's not what Abraham Lincoln said. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybW1uU5JjQ4&t=141.6s)]
*  He said we're gonna have one country and we're gonna end slavery. 700,000 casualties. We literally [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybW1uU5JjQ4&t=146.32s)]
*  had battles where there were 30, 40,000 casualties in a battle. A lot of people thought that was a [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybW1uU5JjQ4&t=151.35999999999999s)]
*  forever war. Lincoln said we're gonna see it through and we're gonna put an end to this. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybW1uU5JjQ4&t=159.68s)]
*  That's what he did. World War II, minding our own business, we got attacked at Pearl Harbor [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybW1uU5JjQ4&t=164.16s)]
*  by Imperial Japan. You see, evil countries with evil men running them, they don't care [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybW1uU5JjQ4&t=169.84s)]
*  if we want peace. They don't care about forever wars. They don't care about all the isolationist [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybW1uU5JjQ4&t=176.48s)]
*  propaganda. They're evil. That's what they are, which brings me to today. We're witnessing with [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybW1uU5JjQ4&t=180.88s)]
*  our own eyes half of the war. We can't really see what's going on in Iran and Israeli attacks on the [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybW1uU5JjQ4&t=188.0s)]
*  various nuclear sites and other sites there, but we're seeing what's going on in Israel. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybW1uU5JjQ4&t=195.12s)]
*  And what are we seeing? Hundreds and hundreds of ballistic missiles being fired at this little [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybW1uU5JjQ4&t=200.64000000000001s)]
*  country. It has one of the most sophisticated, if not the most sophisticated, anti-missile system [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybW1uU5JjQ4&t=205.84s)]
*  on the face of the earth. They spent a lot of time and money working on it, but it's not perfect. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybW1uU5JjQ4&t=211.84s)]
*  No defense system can ever be perfect. It doesn't take much. These ballistic missiles are massive. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybW1uU5JjQ4&t=216.8s)]
*  Imagine if they had nuclear warheads. The Israelis do. Look at the damage these missiles are doing. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybW1uU5JjQ4&t=223.92000000000002s)]
*  They have about 3,000 of them. Apparently about 1,500 or 2,000 of them can reach Israel. Imagine [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybW1uU5JjQ4&t=229.84s)]
*  if they had 10,000 of them. Imagine if they had 20,000 of them. Well, the Israelis do imagine that. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybW1uU5JjQ4&t=236.48000000000002s)]
*  So they worry about the ballistic missiles. They worry about nuclear warheads. And now, [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybW1uU5JjQ4&t=242.8s)]
*  exactly what is Iran targeting? It's major cities. It's trying to kill as many citizens [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybW1uU5JjQ4&t=248.56s)]
*  as it possibly can. Exactly what is Israel targeting? Their nuclear sites, their oil [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybW1uU5JjQ4&t=255.44s)]
*  fields and so forth, or oil storage centers that they use to fuel these ballistic missiles, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybW1uU5JjQ4&t=262.4s)]
*  among other things. Now, Iran's been warned by our great president time and time again, [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybW1uU5JjQ4&t=268.72s)]
*  you better make a deal. And they thumb their nose at them. Israel's warned them time and time again, [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybW1uU5JjQ4&t=273.91999999999996s)]
*  quit firing these damn ballistic missiles at our citizens, or we're going to punish you severely. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybW1uU5JjQ4&t=279.84s)]
*  But they keep firing ballistic missiles at their citizens. Iran has signed parchment agreements, [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybW1uU5JjQ4&t=284.08s)]
*  some parchment agreements. They'll sign them with Europe. They'll sign them with the IAE, [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybW1uU5JjQ4&t=290.88s)]
*  the UN. They'll sign them with that. They'll sign whatever you want. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybW1uU5JjQ4&t=294.71999999999997s)]
*  But they lie. They don't adhere to them. Even more, they're arming proxies. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybW1uU5JjQ4&t=298.55999999999995s)]
*  It's a country of 13 million people surrounded by hundreds of millions, [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybW1uU5JjQ4&t=303.04s)]
*  many of whom are enemies. On every front, so far, they've been victorious or almost victorious. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybW1uU5JjQ4&t=306.56s)]
*  And now there is the mothership that funds it all, all of it, and says they want to wipe Israel, [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybW1uU5JjQ4&t=312.32s)]
*  meaning the Jewish people and the other people of Israel, off the face of the earth. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybW1uU5JjQ4&t=319.03999999999996s)]
*  And they've demonstrated, if they can, they will. You have a free country that believes in life, [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybW1uU5JjQ4&t=322.64s)]
*  that wants to be left alone, versus an evil, terrorist regime. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybW1uU5JjQ4&t=329.28s)]
*  This isn't about expanding war in the region. The Arab countries are not going to jump into this [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybW1uU5JjQ4&t=335.11999999999995s)]
*  in order to ensure that Iran gets nuclear missiles. They hate Iran. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybW1uU5JjQ4&t=339.52s)]
*  Iran is a Persian country. The Arab countries are Arab countries. They have nothing in common, [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybW1uU5JjQ4&t=344.4s)]
*  culturally or otherwise. Yes, there are Muslims in both, but different types of Muslims. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybW1uU5JjQ4&t=349.44s)]
*  And I've explained on this program for years. There are Muslims, and then there are Jihadi, [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybW1uU5JjQ4&t=353.76s)]
*  Islamist terrorists who kill their own people. Just like the regime in Iran is slaughtering its [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybW1uU5JjQ4&t=358.16s)]
*  own people, raping its own people, torturing its own people, they have dungeons. They have these [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybW1uU5JjQ4&t=364.08000000000004s)]
*  concentration camps. The people have risen up twice to try and overthrow that government. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybW1uU5JjQ4&t=370.40000000000003s)]
*  Nobody talks about the Iranian people. It's like, let's make a deal with the regime, [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybW1uU5JjQ4&t=375.12s)]
*  and the people will be prosperous. No, they won't. They're not going to be prosperous. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybW1uU5JjQ4&t=378.96000000000004s)]
*  They live in a hellhole. Now, we have significant military assets in the region. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybW1uU5JjQ4&t=384.0s)]
*  We have significant military assets in every region. So the isolationists who are peasers, [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybW1uU5JjQ4&t=388.8s)]
*  who will get us all killed, they believe we should just pull back from everywhere, NATO, Europe, [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybW1uU5JjQ4&t=394.56s)]
*  Africa, Middle East. What are we doing there? We're protecting ourselves. That's what we're [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybW1uU5JjQ4&t=400.56s)]
*  doing there. They're forward bases. We have allies, like Israel, who are fighting wars that [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybW1uU5JjQ4&t=404.16s)]
*  really help us too. With a base in Qatar, Israel didn't put it there. With a base in Iraq, [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybW1uU5JjQ4&t=410.08s)]
*  Israel didn't put that one there either. We have locations and bases throughout the Middle East [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybW1uU5JjQ4&t=416.71999999999997s)]
*  that have absolutely nothing to do with the state of Israel or even defending the state of Israel. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybW1uU5JjQ4&t=421.36s)]
*  So what should we do? Should we withdraw? Say, you know what? China, North Korea, Russia, [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybW1uU5JjQ4&t=426.4s)]
*  Iran, all the terrorist groups, you can have the Middle East, you can have the oil, [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybW1uU5JjQ4&t=433.84s)]
*  you can have the navigable waters. We're out of here. Really? I'd love to see the plan of [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybW1uU5JjQ4&t=439.12s)]
*  the isolationists and the pacifists and the peasants. I would love to see it. They don't [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybW1uU5JjQ4&t=446.08s)]
*  have a plan. They'll get us all killed. So we need to protect our bases. And so people are saying, [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybW1uU5JjQ4&t=449.67999999999995s)]
*  what, Israel shouldn't defend itself because the enemy might attack some of our bases? [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybW1uU5JjQ4&t=457.35999999999996s)]
*  Does that make sense to anybody? Wouldn't it be better to take out the enemy? [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybW1uU5JjQ4&t=462.15999999999997s)]
*  When the Islamist Nazis hit us on 9-11, did the Israelis urge us not to create a wider war? [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybW1uU5JjQ4&t=466.47999999999996s)]
*  Because the Islamist Nazis come out of their neighborhood. Did they say, [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybW1uU5JjQ4&t=472.88s)]
*  please don't hit them too hard in Afghanistan or anywhere else? [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybW1uU5JjQ4&t=476.96s)]
*  They may rise up and attack us, drag us into your war. No, they said, how can we help you? [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybW1uU5JjQ4&t=480.32s)]
*  They gave us as much intelligence as they could. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybW1uU5JjQ4&t=486.47999999999996s)]
*  Now, the Islamist terrorists in the Middle East have struck us hard. They've struck Europe hard. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybW1uU5JjQ4&t=490.15999999999997s)]
*  They strike Africa hard. And of course, they strike countries in the Middle East hard, [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybW1uU5JjQ4&t=496.4s)]
*  including Israel. But it's left a little Israel to carry the entire burden, the entire burden. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybW1uU5JjQ4&t=501.84s)]
*  Now look, if that's the way it is, that's the way it is. But should we at least let them finish the [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybW1uU5JjQ4&t=509.52s)]
*  job? Are we going to pull them back because Putin is making phone calls? Putin, who's a special [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybW1uU5JjQ4&t=514.4s)]
*  pleader for rent, Putin, who provided the ground-to-air missile system to take out Israel's [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybW1uU5JjQ4&t=520.88s)]
*  air force that Israel took out, we're going to listen to him? We're going to listen to him about [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybW1uU5JjQ4&t=526.0799999999999s)]
*  a ceasefire when he's blowing away Ukrainian civilians and he won't even go to the ceasefire [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybW1uU5JjQ4&t=530.3199999999999s)]
*  table? Are we kidding ourselves? Putin? Seriously? And this Iranian regime provides oil to China. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybW1uU5JjQ4&t=535.04s)]
*  China, that's about to invade Taiwan. Is that smart? Does that make sense? You know, sometimes [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybW1uU5JjQ4&t=545.12s)]
*  when you see evil, it's actually evil. Sometimes when you see a regime, that's how to destroy the [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybW1uU5JjQ4&t=551.68s)]
*  West. That's how to destroy Christians and Jews and Muslims that won't go along. That's working [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybW1uU5JjQ4&t=558.0s)]
*  with the Marxists and the fascists and others of our enemies. Sometimes they're evil. Wouldn't [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybW1uU5JjQ4&t=565.04s)]
*  Israel be doing the United States and the West a favor by taking them out? Well, Mark, I thought [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybW1uU5JjQ4&t=570.16s)]
*  you said just nuclear weapons. It's too late for that. Have you been watching what's going on? [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybW1uU5JjQ4&t=576.64s)]
*  We're going to have a nuclear deal. We're going to have a ballistic missile deal. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybW1uU5JjQ4&t=581.52s)]
*  And how are you going to have a ballistic missile deal when China's providing them with the fuel [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybW1uU5JjQ4&t=585.68s)]
*  for the ballistic missiles? Will they sign the deal too? And will Russia sign the deal to make [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybW1uU5JjQ4&t=589.12s)]
*  sure there's no more ground-to-air missile defense systems? Who are we signing this deal with? [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybW1uU5JjQ4&t=593.6s)]
*  The president posted this last night. The U.S. had nothing to do with the attack on Iran tonight. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybW1uU5JjQ4&t=600.64s)]
*  If we are attacked in any way, shape or form by Iran, the full strength and might of the U.S. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybW1uU5JjQ4&t=606.0s)]
*  armed forces will come down on you at levels never seen before. However, we can easily get a deal [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybW1uU5JjQ4&t=611.12s)]
*  done between Iran and Israel and end this bloody conflict. Donald Trump is a leader. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybW1uU5JjQ4&t=616.64s)]
*  Donald Trump is a historic and iconic leader who loves his country and is going to protect his [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybW1uU5JjQ4&t=622.9599999999999s)]
*  country at any cost. Benjamin Netanyahu is a leader who loves his country and is going to [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybW1uU5JjQ4&t=628.4s)]
*  protect his country at any cost either, as would any great president or prime minister. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybW1uU5JjQ4&t=633.4399999999999s)]
*  If we are attacked in any way, shape or form by Iran, the full strength and might of the U.S. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybW1uU5JjQ4&t=639.84s)]
*  armed forces will come down on you at levels never seen before. What does that mean? Nuclear? I don't [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybW1uU5JjQ4&t=646.72s)]
*  know. But it means we're not going to put up with a damn thing. Do you think the Israelis [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybW1uU5JjQ4&t=652.64s)]
*  have been attacked enough in this war and other wars? Do you think? Let me ask you a question. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybW1uU5JjQ4&t=658.24s)]
*  Today, if Russia or China wanted to put nuclear missiles in Cuba, would we tolerate that? [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybW1uU5JjQ4&t=666.48s)]
*  Would we? Let me ask you this question. If Mexico had sent thousands of terrorists into our country [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybW1uU5JjQ4&t=674.16s)]
*  that raped, butchered, murdered, decapitated, burned alive citizens in say Texas or Arizona [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybW1uU5JjQ4&t=683.28s)]
*  or New Mexico, would there be a discussion about a ceasefire? And what about the country that was [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybW1uU5JjQ4&t=690.08s)]
*  behind it, Iran? Would they get away with that? Is that okay? Let me ask you a question. If we [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybW1uU5JjQ4&t=696.96s)]
*  took ballistic missiles hundreds of the time from let's say Canada, do you think we'd put up with [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybW1uU5JjQ4&t=703.9200000000001s)]
*  that? You know, we used to have a Monroe Doctrine that said anything that goes on in our hemisphere [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybW1uU5JjQ4&t=710.56s)]
*  is our business and we will defend our country come hell or high war. Monroe Doctrine, our entire [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybW1uU5JjQ4&t=716.0s)]
*  hemisphere. President of the United States says we need that Panama Canal for our defense. We build [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybW1uU5JjQ4&t=721.8399999999999s)]
*  it. It's ours. Either you give it to us or we're going to take it. Exactly the right thing. So [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybW1uU5JjQ4&t=728.0s)]
*  here's the state of Israel. They got a country, a country that has funded proxies that have [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybW1uU5JjQ4&t=735.84s)]
*  slaughtered their citizens, that promises to continue to do that. Is that going to be part of [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybW1uU5JjQ4&t=742.5600000000001s)]
*  some deal? You see, you can make a deal with evil, but evil is evil. It laughs. And they've shot [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybW1uU5JjQ4&t=747.2s)]
*  ballistic missiles in and now we know. All those people saying, how do you know, Mark, that they're [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybW1uU5JjQ4&t=755.52s)]
*  building nuclear programs. I said, well, all the intelligence says, now we know the sites are [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybW1uU5JjQ4&t=760.56s)]
*  actually being hit. There's actually nuclear radiation being leaked in one of these sites. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybW1uU5JjQ4&t=765.68s)]
*  Well, what was that for? Domestic energy? How many times did we hear that? Over and over and over [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybW1uU5JjQ4&t=772.4799999999999s)]
*  again. The key is what the president said. If we are attacked in any way, shape or form by Iran, [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybW1uU5JjQ4&t=778.16s)]
*  the full strength and might of the US armed forces will come down on you at levels never seen [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybW1uU5JjQ4&t=784.56s)]
*  before. He's not going to be convinced otherwise, whether Putin calls him and says, hey, Donald, [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybW1uU5JjQ4&t=790.4s)]
*  you may not want to do that. He'd say to Putin, you know what, go shove it. Those are my people [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybW1uU5JjQ4&t=796.16s)]
*  and those are my armed forces. Here's the truth. A deal with Iran at this point, seeing what they're [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybW1uU5JjQ4&t=801.1199999999999s)]
*  doing, I would think is a delusion. You know, I remember when in our country, if a country thought [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybW1uU5JjQ4&t=806.88s)]
*  to kill, that is, assassinate our president, we would destroy it. It's an act of war. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybW1uU5JjQ4&t=814.32s)]
*  I don't think we'd negotiate with it. I don't think we'd give a damn what they have to say. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybW1uU5JjQ4&t=823.2800000000001s)]
*  And if we had an ally country that's trying to destroy the regime, [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybW1uU5JjQ4&t=828.96s)]
*  or at least their nuclear weapons, I think we'd be appreciative of that, don't you? I think so. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybW1uU5JjQ4&t=834.5600000000001s)]
*  I mean, after all, Israel did destroy Hezbollah or its leadership, which killed all our Marines, [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybW1uU5JjQ4&t=842.08s)]
*  the 200 and some at a base, as well as attacked two embassies and killed hundreds of American [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybW1uU5JjQ4&t=846.96s)]
*  citizens. They took them out. Our leadership, Biden didn't take them out. So they took out [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybW1uU5JjQ4&t=852.72s)]
*  Nasrallah and his team. I mean, they've taken out terrorists, terrorist leaders who've killed [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybW1uU5JjQ4&t=861.9200000000001s)]
*  Americans. I don't even think we sent them a thank you note, Mr. Producer. I don't think so. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybW1uU5JjQ4&t=868.96s)]
*  I'm just making the point. And nobody talks about the people of Iran. Nobody. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybW1uU5JjQ4&t=874.08s)]
*  If there's a deal and the regime stays, then the people remain imprisoned in their own country. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybW1uU5JjQ4&t=881.6s)]
*  Is that a good thing? Well, Mark, that's none of our business. Well, for signing a deal, [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybW1uU5JjQ4&t=890.1600000000001s)]
*  and I'm not saying we are, by the way, but if we are, and those people remain imprisoned, [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybW1uU5JjQ4&t=894.32s)]
*  it seems to me that is our business. So if we do a deal with Iran, does that mean that regime will [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybW1uU5JjQ4&t=898.96s)]
*  stay in power for another 50 years? That means it'll outlive, obviously, Donald Trump's second term. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybW1uU5JjQ4&t=904.96s)]
*  Do they think they're going to be bound by this agreement? [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybW1uU5JjQ4&t=912.72s)]
*  Will the next supreme Islamist Nazi feel that he's bound by this document? You see, the only [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybW1uU5JjQ4&t=917.36s)]
*  way to get rid of evil, I hate to say it, is to get rid of evil. Is to get rid of evil. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybW1uU5JjQ4&t=926.48s)]
*  Peace means the elimination of evil. And if evil exists in a regime, [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybW1uU5JjQ4&t=933.2s)]
*  I don't know how you get peace, serious lasting peace, when a regime wants nothing more than [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybW1uU5JjQ4&t=941.52s)]
*  terrorism, slaughter, and war, as it's demonstrated over and over again. And this is not just a nuclear [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybW1uU5JjQ4&t=948.0s)]
*  program now. It's a ballistic program. It's even bigger than that. They've built an alliance [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybW1uU5JjQ4&t=954.8s)]
*  with other countries that endanger the United States of America. And let me ask you this question. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybW1uU5JjQ4&t=961.12s)]
*  What's to stop Iran from trying to assassinate our president again? What's to stop Iran from [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybW1uU5JjQ4&t=967.68s)]
*  funding terrorists to come into our country and hit us again and again and again? What's to stop them? [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybW1uU5JjQ4&t=973.52s)]
*  Force. Force. It's the only thing to stop them. The elimination of that regime. It's the only thing [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybW1uU5JjQ4&t=981.52s)]
*  to stop them. You know, we have a transportation security administration to protect us from [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybW1uU5JjQ4&t=988.96s)]
*  terrorists. You know, law enforcement has been rejiggered all over the country. We have [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybW1uU5JjQ4&t=993.6s)]
*  task force, terrorist task force to protect us from what? The Islamist Nazis in the Middle East, [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybW1uU5JjQ4&t=999.44s)]
*  for the most part, like Iran. We spend tens of billions of dollars, if not hundreds of billions [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybW1uU5JjQ4&t=1004.8s)]
*  of dollars a year, local, state, federal, law enforcement, military, all of our services, [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybW1uU5JjQ4&t=1010.4s)]
*  to protect us from what? Countries like Iran, terrorists like Iran. So even if we have this [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybW1uU5JjQ4&t=1016.72s)]
*  one agreement between Israel and Iran, it's not going to stop. What is terrorism? Why do we call [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybW1uU5JjQ4&t=1024.08s)]
*  them terrorists? It's because they're doing what they're doing, that's why. So let me end it this [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybW1uU5JjQ4&t=1033.36s)]
*  way. Thank God we have President Trump. Thank God the President of the United States is standing [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybW1uU5JjQ4&t=1040.16s)]
*  shoulder to shoulder with Israel. Thank God we're providing Israel with arms so that they can defend [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybW1uU5JjQ4&t=1045.6000000000001s)]
*  themselves and attack the nuclear sites. And thank God President Trump, in my view, will not be swayed [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybW1uU5JjQ4&t=1051.8400000000001s)]
*  by Putin. He won't be swayed by other countries. He knows right from wrong. He knows good from evil. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybW1uU5JjQ4&t=1059.2s)]
*  And he knows history. He knows about Neville Chamberlain. He knows about these phony agreements. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybW1uU5JjQ4&t=1065.3600000000001s)]
*  He knows that these are effectively the same people who've attacked the United States of America [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybW1uU5JjQ4&t=1069.36s)]
*  and that we wouldn't act any differently than the state of Israel, except perhaps even more [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybW1uU5JjQ4&t=1075.9199999999998s)]
*  aggressively, because the little state of Israel is relying on other countries to not undermine it [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybW1uU5JjQ4&t=1083.9199999999998s)]
*  completely. I'm talking about Western countries, whereas we're big enough to stay the course. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybW1uU5JjQ4&t=1090.3999999999999s)]
*  America must continue to stand behind Israel. They need to finish the job. It's going to take several weeks. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybW1uU5JjQ4&t=1095.04s)]
*  Their bombs simply cannot penetrate all of these nuclear sites with one, two, three, five runs. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybW1uU5JjQ4&t=1103.36s)]
*  They need several runs. And so that's the way it goes. They're the ones taking the incoming. The [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybW1uU5JjQ4&t=1109.36s)]
*  Israeli people are paying the price and the Israeli people want to live in peace. They want to be able [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybW1uU5JjQ4&t=1115.92s)]
*  to enjoy their parks, their playgrounds. They want to be able to enjoy their schools, their cafes, [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybW1uU5JjQ4&t=1120.4s)]
*  their restaurants. They want to be able to go to synagogue and church. They want to be able to live [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybW1uU5JjQ4&t=1125.92s)]
*  like free people, like we do, without a nuclear weapon pointing at their head, without ballistic [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybW1uU5JjQ4&t=1131.2800000000002s)]
*  missiles pointing at their head, without looking in every direction, being surrounded by terrorists. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybW1uU5JjQ4&t=1137.6000000000001s)]
*  It's hard to believe that any piece of paper can prevent that. And if you can show me any time in [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybW1uU5JjQ4&t=1143.3600000000001s)]
*  world history that it has, I'd love to see it. I don't think the founding fathers, as brilliant as [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybW1uU5JjQ4&t=1149.12s)]
*  they were, could write a document, a document that would contain evil. No, unfortunately at times it [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybW1uU5JjQ4&t=1154.3999999999999s)]
*  takes force. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybW1uU5JjQ4&t=1161.04s)]
