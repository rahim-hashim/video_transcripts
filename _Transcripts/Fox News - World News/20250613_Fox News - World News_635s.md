# BREAKING: Israel launches new wave of attacks as Trump issues chilling warning to Iran
**Fox News - World News:** [June 13, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE)
*  We struck at the heart of Iran's nuclear enrichment program. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=0.0s)]
*  We struck at the heart of Iran's nuclear weaponization program. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=4.04s)]
*  We targeted Iran's main enrichment facility in Natanz. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=8.08s)]
*  We targeted Iran's leading nuclear scientists working on the Iranian bomb. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=11.68s)]
*  We also struck at the heart of Iran's ballistic missile program. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=16.56s)]
*  Early this morning, multiple explosions were heard at Iran's Natanz nuclear power facility. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=21.52s)]
*  Iran this morning says that that site has not been destroyed, although Israel this morning [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=26.4s)]
*  saying that that center has been severely damaged. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=30.279999999999998s)]
*  Other reports that it has been destroyed. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=33.48s)]
*  So Iranian state media today also saying that three military commanders in the Iranian regime [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=35.68s)]
*  were killed, as well as six nuclear scientists who were killed. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=40.68s)]
*  And Iran's ministry issued the following statement, saying, quote, the aggressive actions of the [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=44.68s)]
*  Zionist regime against Iran could not have been carried out without the coordination [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=48.92s)]
*  and with the approval of the United States. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=53.28s)]
*  Thus, the U.S. government is the main supporter of this regime will be held responsible for [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=55.559999999999995s)]
*  the dangerous consequences of Israel's adventurism. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=60.36s)]
*  Now, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio issued a statement as well, saying, quote, we are [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=63.919999999999995s)]
*  not involved in strikes against Iran and our top priority is protecting American forces [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=69.03999999999999s)]
*  in the region. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=74.36s)]
*  It was three a.m. this morning when sirens blared across the country, waking millions [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=75.36s)]
*  of people in Israel, telling them to get to shelters. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=80.19999999999999s)]
*  Defense minister declared a special state of emergency after this elaborate strike in [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=83.47999999999999s)]
*  anticipation for the Iranian attack that would likely follow. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=88.24s)]
*  And Israel says that Iran launched 100 drones in retaliation. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=92.56s)]
*  Jordan says it was able to strike down some of those drones over its air force. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=96.96s)]
*  And Israel says that its air force, the fighter jets were able to take out many of those drones [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=101.91999999999999s)]
*  before they reached Israeli airspace. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=107.32s)]
*  Guys, back to you, Alex. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=109.56s)]
*  Any word if those 100 drones made it into Israel? [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=111.04s)]
*  Did the Iron Dome prevent that? [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=113.88000000000001s)]
*  And as to the fighter jets were able to be up in the air and striking down these drones [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=117.24000000000001s)]
*  before they entered Israeli airspace, a major sigh of relief for people who, again, woke [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=121.28s)]
*  up at three in the morning rushing to those shelters, waiting for word of when and if [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=126.48s)]
*  it would be safe and whether or not the Iron Dome would be overwhelmed. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=131.4s)]
*  So we do have a little bit of clarity. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=135.16s)]
*  As of now, the Home Command has told people they are allowed to go a little further out [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=137.23999999999998s)]
*  from their home. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=141.72s)]
*  They do not need to stay in their shelter or right next to their shelter. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=142.44s)]
*  But still, the streets are empty. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=146.04s)]
*  People are inside. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=148.16s)]
*  There is no public gathering allowed today or throughout the coming days, as the IDF [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=149.56s)]
*  warned just about an hour ago. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=155.04s)]
*  This likely could continue as again, we are following these new reports of another wave [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=156.76s)]
*  of potential strikes taking place right now in Iran. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=161.88s)]
*  All right, Roger, thank you so much. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=165.07999999999998s)]
*  So a lot of people are wondering what does this mean for the United States? [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=167.4s)]
*  Are we going to get inserted in this war? [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=170.56s)]
*  What about the talks that were going on between the United States and Iran? [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=173.44s)]
*  Had the opportunity to talk with the president this morning. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=177.68s)]
*  He said it didn't have to go down like this. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=179.60000000000002s)]
*  I want a peace. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=181.64000000000001s)]
*  I want to be known as the president of peace. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=182.48000000000002s)]
*  This is why I took a whole tour in the Middle East. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=184.60000000000002s)]
*  He has since released a statement. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=187.12s)]
*  And I really think it goes into the mind of what he was thinking from the very beginning. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=189.08s)]
*  This is what the president says. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=193.60000000000002s)]
*  I gave Iran a chance after chance to make a deal. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=195.35999999999999s)]
*  I told them in the strongest of words to just do it. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=199.07999999999998s)]
*  But no matter how hard they tried, no matter how close they got, they just couldn't get it done. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=202.64s)]
*  I told them that it would be much worse than anything they know, anticipated or were told [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=208.4s)]
*  that the United States makes the best and the most lethal military equipment anywhere [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=215.12s)]
*  in the world by far. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=219.48s)]
*  And that Israel has a lot of it with much more to come. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=220.76s)]
*  And they know how to use it. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=224.0s)]
*  Sir, an Iranian hardliner spoke bravely, but they didn't know what was about to happen. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=225.68s)]
*  They are all dead now and it will only get worse. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=230.56s)]
*  There has already been great death and destruction, but there is still time to make this slaughter [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=234.0s)]
*  with the next already planned attacks being even more brutal come to an end. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=239.12s)]
*  Iran must make a deal before there is nothing left and save what was once known as the Iranian Empire. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=244.0s)]
*  No more deaths, no more destruction. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=250.24s)]
*  Just do it before it is too late. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=252.2s)]
*  God bless you all, Charlie. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=255.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=257.28s)]
*  Yeah, you know, it's interesting to listen to that statement. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=257.88s)]
*  You know, there is sort of an arm's length where the president is saying, you know, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=262.0s)]
*  I've tried to negotiate with both sides and specifically Iran has not sort of come along. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=266.0s)]
*  Last night when we first started getting reports of this, Marco Rubio, Secretary of State, [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=272.36s)]
*  warned that this was a unilateral action, meaning that it was not something that the United States [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=278.44s)]
*  was involved in, however much they might have known about it. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=283.24s)]
*  He went on to say that America's priority was safeguarding Americans and American interests [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=287.40000000000003s)]
*  in the region and that Israel was acting out of self-defense. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=293.72s)]
*  All of that, I thought, I think is interesting because it is sort of more of an arm's length [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=298.12s)]
*  than we have seen from administrations previously. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=303.32s)]
*  What they're saying is that, you know, we want peace. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=308.12s)]
*  Israel is acting on its own right now. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=311.88s)]
*  But the problem is if Iran retaliates and retaliates against the United States interests, [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=314.59999999999997s)]
*  it's going to be a completely different deal. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=320.6s)]
*  Well, President Trump said sitcom is on high alert and the U.S. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=323.48s)]
*  will defend itself and Israel if Iran does retaliate. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=326.36s)]
*  Israel sent in 200 fighter jets. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=330.28s)]
*  They hit 100 targets. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=332.2s)]
*  But the world can't allow a number one state sponsor of terror to make nuclear weapons. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=333.8s)]
*  Iran's breakout time, we're being told, was about a month. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=338.59999999999997s)]
*  Benjamin Netanyahu said that the military assessed Iran currently has enough enriched [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=341.64s)]
*  uranium to build 15 nuclear bombs. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=346.12s)]
*  And Iran, through its proxies, they fired tens of thousands of missiles into Israel [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=348.52s)]
*  over the past years. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=353.71999999999997s)]
*  So how would America respond if hundreds of thousands or tens of thousands of missiles [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=355.08s)]
*  are lobbed into America? [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=360.84s)]
*  We would respond the same way. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=362.28s)]
*  Iran was given every chance under Donald Trump to negotiate a deal. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=363.64s)]
*  They were supposed to even talk this weekend. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=367.48s)]
*  We're being told Iran is saying that that probably will not be happening. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=369.8s)]
*  Donald Trump told Brett Baer last night that we were not involved in this. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=373.8s)]
*  Trump was aware beforehand of these strikes and that he hopes that Iran will return to [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=377.72s)]
*  the negotiating table. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=383.96s)]
*  They're going to definitely try for that. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=385.48s)]
*  There are several people in leadership that will not be coming back. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=386.84s)]
*  He says, referring to the fact that they are now dead. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=389.64s)]
*  You know, they killed three generals. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=392.84s)]
*  Israel had a successful operation. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=394.68s)]
*  But I think you really have to look at this two ways. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=396.36s)]
*  Yes, the United States wasn't directly involved, but as the president notes in his statement, [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=400.44s)]
*  Israel has our weapons as well. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=405.32s)]
*  And we will defend Israel if it's come necessary. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=407.56s)]
*  He also says that he tried to give them the opportunity to have peace. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=411.4s)]
*  He warned them that their people would die, that their leadership would die. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=414.91999999999996s)]
*  Just come to the negotiating. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=418.76s)]
*  You can't have enrichment. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=419.96s)]
*  You can't have a nuclear weapon. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=421.48s)]
*  Just sign a deal. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=423.0s)]
*  And I think once we got to an area where Israel was worried that there could be some attack [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=424.92s)]
*  on their people, I mean, we just had October the 7th. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=431.32s)]
*  And I think honestly, Israel would have attacked a lot sooner if a lot of these folks didn't [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=434.2s)]
*  have the hostages. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=439.24s)]
*  And so I think we're getting to the period of time right now where the walls are closing in. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=440.59999999999997s)]
*  Iran still has an opportunity, although because of the radical agenda and their ideology, [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=445.96s)]
*  I think there will be some sort of response from Iran. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=451.23999999999995s)]
*  But they could put the brakes on this. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=454.12s)]
*  They could choose the peace that Saudi Arabia and other Middle Eastern countries have done [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=456.12s)]
*  under this administration. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=462.52s)]
*  But unfortunately, the leaders there, I mean, essentially the Ayatollah is underground right [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=464.12s)]
*  now, hiding right now because he's so fearful. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=470.2s)]
*  Don't forget what Iran's Ayatollah has always said. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=472.44s)]
*  Death to America is not just a slogan. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=475.47999999999996s)]
*  It is a policy openly threatening to wipe both Israel and the U.S. off the face of the [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=478.2s)]
*  mat. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=483.64s)]
*  And we're also being told that Israelis, you heard Alex's report, that many of them [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=483.96s)]
*  are being told or they're all being told to prepare your shelters for long-term use. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=487.88s)]
*  Many of them were rushing to the grocery store before they had that call to stay home to [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=491.71999999999997s)]
*  get water, bottled water, and a lot of supplies. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=495.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=498.35999999999996s)]
*  And so, you know, as you pointed out, IDF believes that Iran has the capacity to build [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=498.84s)]
*  as many as 15 nuclear weapons within days. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=504.12s)]
*  Yeah, very scary. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=507.56s)]
*  They have a matter of days of a ramp up. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=508.36s)]
*  And so you have to sit here and wonder, you know, this could be, you know, who knows? [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=511.64s)]
*  There have been a lot of cases in the past where Iran has talked a big game and then [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=517.0s)]
*  wound up not being able to match the actions with their words. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=522.04s)]
*  But if indeed, you know, this is not from just Iran. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=527.4s)]
*  This is from the IDF. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=530.6800000000001s)]
*  If they are days away from being able to turn that nuclear material into weapons, [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=532.36s)]
*  then we could be looking at days away from a nuclear-armed Iran. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=538.44s)]
*  So the president had a vision for Iran. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=544.52s)]
*  It was really a peaceful vision, just like he has tried to do in all of the Middle East [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=548.28s)]
*  with the Abram Accords as well. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=552.6s)]
*  This is what the president said before this attack. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=554.76s)]
*  Iran will never have a nuclear weapon. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=557.64s)]
*  But with that said, Iran can have a much brighter future, but will never allow America and its [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=568.84s)]
*  allies to be threatened with terrorism or nuclear attack. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=575.0799999999999s)]
*  The choice is theirs to make. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=579.0s)]
*  We really want them to be a successful country. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=581.0s)]
*  We want them to be a wonderful, safe, great country. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=583.72s)]
*  But they cannot have a nuclear weapon. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=587.88s)]
*  This is an offer that will not last forever. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=589.72s)]
*  The time is right now for them to choose. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=594.12s)]
*  Right now, we don't have a lot of time to wait. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=596.9200000000001s)]
*  Things are happening at a very fast pace. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=600.44s)]
*  They're happening right here. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=603.32s)]
*  They're happening at a very fast pace. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=604.52s)]
*  So they have to make their move right now. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=606.6800000000001s)]
*  One way or the other, make your move. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=610.28s)]
*  Later on in the program, we're going to be having breaking coverage all morning. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=614.6s)]
*  General Jack Keene is going to be on the show. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=617.8000000000001s)]
*  Former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and the great one Mark Levin is going to be coming up in the show. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=619.4s)]
