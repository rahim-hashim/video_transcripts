# Watters: Trump is working ‘around the clock’
**Fox News - World News:** [June 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t271DXX-KMk)
*  Fox News alert. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t271DXX-KMk&t=0.0s)]
*  There's been an earthquake in Iran, 5.1 magnitude right outside the Capitol, but the war isn't [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t271DXX-KMk&t=4.92s)]
*  slowing down. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t271DXX-KMk&t=10.72s)]
*  Iranian missiles hitting cities in Israel, one missile hitting an Israeli daycare center. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t271DXX-KMk&t=11.96s)]
*  The USS Nimitz carrier strike group arrives in the region this weekend, doubling the number [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t271DXX-KMk&t=17.88s)]
*  of aircraft carriers there. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t271DXX-KMk&t=23.400000000000002s)]
*  Trump telling reporters that two weeks isn't a deadline. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t271DXX-KMk&t=25.64s)]
*  Anything could happen before then. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t271DXX-KMk&t=29.24s)]
*  Does Iran have two weeks or could you strike before that? [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t271DXX-KMk&t=32.12s)]
*  Are you essentially giving them a two week timeline? [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t271DXX-KMk&t=35.04s)]
*  Giving them a period of time, we're going to see what that period of time is, but I'm [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t271DXX-KMk&t=37.04s)]
*  giving them a period of time and I would say two weeks would be the maximum. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t271DXX-KMk&t=39.839999999999996s)]
*  This period of time gives Trump more military options as he moves more assets into place. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t271DXX-KMk&t=45.92s)]
*  It could also be a setup for a surprise attack. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t271DXX-KMk&t=51.28s)]
*  And it lets Israel soften up Iranian targets and suppress their capacity to retaliate if [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t271DXX-KMk&t=54.56s)]
*  Trump does decide to join the offensive. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t271DXX-KMk&t=59.68s)]
*  Continued Israeli bombardment could pressure the Iranians to sign away their nuke program. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t271DXX-KMk&t=62.92s)]
*  Trump's hoping that's the case. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t271DXX-KMk&t=68.32000000000001s)]
*  Today, Iranian negotiators met with European diplomats in Switzerland, but there was no [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t271DXX-KMk&t=70.12s)]
*  breakthrough. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t271DXX-KMk&t=75.24000000000001s)]
*  The regime continues to insist on enrichment. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t271DXX-KMk&t=76.52000000000001s)]
*  Trump says negotiations with the Europeans are a waste of time. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t271DXX-KMk&t=80.16s)]
*  Did the Europeans help at all in talking with Iran? [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t271DXX-KMk&t=84.0s)]
*  No, they didn't help. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t271DXX-KMk&t=87.44s)]
*  Iran doesn't want to speak to Europe. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t271DXX-KMk&t=89.24s)]
*  They want to speak to us. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t271DXX-KMk&t=92.0s)]
*  Europe is not going to be able to help in this. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t271DXX-KMk&t=93.0s)]
*  Iranian negotiators are saying they'll only meet with the United States if Israel stops [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t271DXX-KMk&t=96.4s)]
*  its airstrikes. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t271DXX-KMk&t=100.84s)]
*  But Trump has already said, we're not interested in a ceasefire, we want a solution. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t271DXX-KMk&t=102.28s)]
*  And the Israeli airstrikes have been very effective. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t271DXX-KMk&t=107.64s)]
*  Would you support Iran being able to have civilian nuclear energy capabilities up to [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t271DXX-KMk&t=111.4s)]
*  3.76%? [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t271DXX-KMk&t=115.92s)]
*  You know, they're sitting on the top of one of the largest piles of oil in the world. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t271DXX-KMk&t=116.92s)]
*  I just don't know why they need that for civilian work. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t271DXX-KMk&t=121.92s)]
*  It's one thing for certain countries to say, hey, I want to have a certain amount where [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t271DXX-KMk&t=125.6s)]
*  I can go nuclear a little bit because we need it for electricity, we need it for air conditioners, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t271DXX-KMk&t=129.92000000000002s)]
*  etc. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t271DXX-KMk&t=135.72s)]
*  But when you're sitting on one of the largest oil piles anywhere in the world, it's a little [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t271DXX-KMk&t=136.8s)]
*  bit hard to see why you need that. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t271DXX-KMk&t=141.84s)]
*  The march to war was picking up speed and the two-week window takes the pressure off [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t271DXX-KMk&t=143.76s)]
*  and gives Trump control of the timeline, not Netanyahu. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t271DXX-KMk&t=148.28s)]
*  There's risks to action and there's risks to inaction. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t271DXX-KMk&t=152.32s)]
*  It's like life-saving emergency surgery. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t271DXX-KMk&t=156.24s)]
*  It's delicate and dangerous. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t271DXX-KMk&t=158.5s)]
*  Sources say the president's looking at what happened to Libya. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t271DXX-KMk&t=161.24s)]
*  The president in recent days has specifically mentioned the oil-rich North African countries' [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t271DXX-KMk&t=164.88000000000002s)]
*  decades-long plunge into anarchy in 2011 after the U.S. joined a NATO bombing campaign to [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t271DXX-KMk&t=169.08s)]
*  oust dictator Muammar Qaddafi. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t271DXX-KMk&t=175.88000000000002s)]
*  Qaddafi saw America topple Saddam over WMDs, so he got rid of his program voluntarily, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t271DXX-KMk&t=178.72000000000003s)]
*  thinking it would save him from an invasion. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t271DXX-KMk&t=184.56s)]
*  But Obama, Hillary, and the Europeans exploited the vulnerability, launched airstrikes, and [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t271DXX-KMk&t=187.52s)]
*  Qaddafi was brutally murdered by the Arab street. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t271DXX-KMk&t=192.68s)]
*  Libya is now a failed state. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t271DXX-KMk&t=195.96s)]
*  It's run by militias and terrorists. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t271DXX-KMk&t=198.16s)]
*  And Europe had to absorb waves of refugees. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t271DXX-KMk&t=200.6s)]
*  Air campaigns aren't always successful. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t271DXX-KMk&t=204.28s)]
*  Look at North Vietnam. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t271DXX-KMk&t=206.76000000000002s)]
*  Look at Kosovo. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t271DXX-KMk&t=208.24s)]
*  They're attractive because they limit casualties, but Trump's ruled out boots on the ground. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t271DXX-KMk&t=209.8s)]
*  Iran's mountains and deserts create a natural fortress, and any ground assault would be [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t271DXX-KMk&t=223.6s)]
*  a death wish. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t271DXX-KMk&t=228.28s)]
*  If the Ayatollah is taking out an airstrike or a coup, there's no natural opposition [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t271DXX-KMk&t=229.28s)]
*  group to seize power. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t271DXX-KMk&t=235.44s)]
*  Those in charge will be men with guns, and they will try to bring back some sort of clerical [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t271DXX-KMk&t=237.6s)]
*  leadership because, after all, this is an Islamic republic. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t271DXX-KMk&t=243.16s)]
*  If the supreme leader were toppled and foreign enemies sought to foment public unrest by [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t271DXX-KMk&t=247.36s)]
*  bombarding the country, enforcing a no-fly zone, and applying economic pressure, as [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t271DXX-KMk&t=252.42s)]
*  they did against Saddam Hussein's Iraq in the 90s, the Guard would use brute force to [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t271DXX-KMk&t=257.38s)]
*  maintain power. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t271DXX-KMk&t=262.58s)]
*  This is the reason Trump and his team have been working around the clock to reach a deal [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t271DXX-KMk&t=264.5s)]
*  behind the scenes. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t271DXX-KMk&t=268.97999999999996s)]
*  47 knows if you snuff out the Ayatollah without planning for the aftermath, he owns what happens [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t271DXX-KMk&t=270.62s)]
*  next. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t271DXX-KMk&t=276.78s)]
*  Are you concerned that Iran or its proxies would wage terror attacks against American [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t271DXX-KMk&t=277.78s)]
*  targets abroad if you order military action? [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t271DXX-KMk&t=283.58s)]
*  We're always concerned about that, and we have to take them out and be very strong. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t271DXX-KMk&t=286.53999999999996s)]
*  You're even in danger talking to me right now. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t271DXX-KMk&t=290.97999999999996s)]
*  Do you know that? [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t271DXX-KMk&t=293.02s)]
*  You are in danger talking to me right now. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t271DXX-KMk&t=294.4s)]
*  So I should probably get out of here. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t271DXX-KMk&t=297.41999999999996s)]
*  But you guys are actually in danger. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t271DXX-KMk&t=299.09999999999997s)]
*  Can you believe it? [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t271DXX-KMk&t=301.26s)]
*  If the United States did take military action, the Iranians could have a clandestine nuclear [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t271DXX-KMk&t=302.74s)]
*  operation. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t271DXX-KMk&t=307.86s)]
*  They could activate it without us knowing and spin up a nuke in the dark. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t271DXX-KMk&t=309.22s)]
*  Once the missiles start flying, things move fast. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t271DXX-KMk&t=314.26s)]
*  The exiled Shah's son is already meeting with congressmen and planning for a post-Ayatollah [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t271DXX-KMk&t=317.36s)]
*  Iran. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t271DXX-KMk&t=323.3s)]
*  At least there's planning for what comes next. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t271DXX-KMk&t=324.64s)]
*  You couldn't say that for some of these other wars. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t271DXX-KMk&t=327.90000000000003s)]
*  This is why there's only one commander in chief. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t271DXX-KMk&t=330.94s)]
*  President Bill Clinton, he was given an opportunity to preemptively strike North Korea's nuclear [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t271DXX-KMk&t=334.44s)]
*  program in the 90s. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t271DXX-KMk&t=339.34s)]
*  He chose not to. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t271DXX-KMk&t=341.3s)]
*  And today, North Korea can put a nuclear warhead on an intercontinental ballistic missile within [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t271DXX-KMk&t=342.7s)]
*  the range of California. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t271DXX-KMk&t=347.98s)]
*  Bill Clinton also was given the opportunity to take out Bin Laden in the 90s. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t271DXX-KMk&t=350.22s)]
*  He chose not to. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t271DXX-KMk&t=354.84s)]
*  And then just a few years later, 9-11. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t271DXX-KMk&t=356.22s)]
*  Iraq, Libya, North Korea, Bin Laden. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t271DXX-KMk&t=359.1s)]
*  These are all fresh in 47's mind. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t271DXX-KMk&t=362.62s)]
*  As he likes to say, we'll see what happens. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t271DXX-KMk&t=365.34000000000003s)]
