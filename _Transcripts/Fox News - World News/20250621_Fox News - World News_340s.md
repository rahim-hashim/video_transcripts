*  Hello Greg. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHO2bsit07U&t=55.239999999999995s)]
*  Hello Mike. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHO2bsit07U&t=57.24s)]
*  Yeah, we are into now day nine of the war between Israel and Iran and there are more [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHO2bsit07U&t=58.24s)]
*  raids on key Iranian targets as well as individuals. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHO2bsit07U&t=64.88s)]

*  morning. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHO2bsit07U&t=102.67999999999999s)]
*  Tehran has had less success with these relatively slow moving projectiles. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHO2bsit07U&t=103.67999999999999s)]
*  Here in Tel Aviv after we watched overnight a barrage of some five Iranian missiles all [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHO2bsit07U&t=109.24s)]
*  knocked down by Israeli defenses, it has been relatively quiet. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHO2bsit07U&t=116.11999999999999s)]

*  to be headed to Guam which is a bit closer and a bit of an easier run to Iran. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHO2bsit07U&t=134.72s)]
*  Now Mike that aircraft is the only one that can deploy the much discussed bunker busting [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHO2bsit07U&t=141.52s)]
*  bombs needed to take out Iran's deeply dug and crucial Fordo nuclear facility. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHO2bsit07U&t=146.84s)]

*  he would wait up to two weeks on a decision to strike the Middle Eastern country. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHO2bsit07U&t=164.54s)]
*  Nate Foy is traveling with the president in Bedminster, New Jersey. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHO2bsit07U&t=168.64000000000001s)]
*  Hello Nate. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHO2bsit07U&t=172.2s)]
*  Hey Mike, good afternoon. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHO2bsit07U&t=173.2s)]
*  So yeah the pieces on the chessboard and the posturing ahead of a potential decision from [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHO2bsit07U&t=175.8s)]
*  President Donald Trump which he promises is coming in the next two weeks continues to [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHO2bsit07U&t=181.0s)]
*  with according to that open source flight tracking data those six B-2 bombers and according [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHO2bsit07U&t=186.1s)]
*  to the data that we are seeing in the refueling pattern of those planes it appears that they [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHO2bsit07U&t=191.5s)]
*  left without a full fuel tank which could indicate that they are in fact carrying those [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHO2bsit07U&t=197.54s)]
*  bombs on board but the White House has not confirmed this independently. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHO2bsit07U&t=202.5s)]
*  We are working for that confirmation. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHO2bsit07U&t=206.76s)]
*  But President Trump is at his Bedminster club here today in New Jersey. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHO2bsit07U&t=209.45999999999998s)]
*  He's going back to the White House later today where he will meet with his national security [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHO2bsit07U&t=212.86s)]
*  team and he spoke yesterday about that two week timeline that he's promised. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHO2bsit07U&t=216.82000000000002s)]
*  Listen here. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHO2bsit07U&t=221.42000000000002s)]
*  Mr. President, what was the thought process behind the two week time table? [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHO2bsit07U&t=222.42000000000002s)]
*  Just time to see whether or not people come to their senses. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHO2bsit07U&t=227.42000000000002s)]
*  Giving them a period of time, we're going to see what that period of time is, but I'm [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHO2bsit07U&t=232.42000000000002s)]
*  giving them a period of time and I would say two weeks would be the maximum. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHO2bsit07U&t=235.62s)]
*  Now Mike Trump also pushed back on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's comments that Israel [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHO2bsit07U&t=242.94000000000003s)]
*  is capable of destroying Iran's Fordo nuclear facility on its own. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHO2bsit07U&t=247.78s)]
*  The president said Israel has a limited capacity. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHO2bsit07U&t=252.5s)]
*  He also said his own national intelligence director was wrong when she testified before [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHO2bsit07U&t=255.62s)]
*  Congress in March saying that Iran was not pursuing a nuclear weapon. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHO2bsit07U&t=260.98s)]
*  Listen here. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHO2bsit07U&t=264.46000000000004s)]
*  What intelligence do you have that Iran is building a nuclear weapon? [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHO2bsit07U&t=266.04s)]
*  Your intelligence community has said they have no evidence that they are at this point. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHO2bsit07U&t=268.74s)]
*  Well then my intelligence community is wrong. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHO2bsit07U&t=272.54s)]
*  Who in the intelligence community said that? [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHO2bsit07U&t=274.66s)]
*  Your director of national intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHO2bsit07U&t=277.38s)]
*  She's wrong. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHO2bsit07U&t=280.18s)]
*  Now Gabbard responded on X writing in part, quote, the dishonest media is intentionally [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHO2bsit07U&t=283.18s)]
*  taking my testimony out of context and spreading fake news as a way to manufacture division. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHO2bsit07U&t=288.02000000000004s)]
*  America has intelligence that Iran is at the point that it can produce a nuclear weapon [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHO2bsit07U&t=294.22s)]
*  within weeks to months. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHO2bsit07U&t=298.70000000000005s)]
*  Now in that same testimony before Congress in March, Gabbard testified that Iran has [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHO2bsit07U&t=301.46000000000004s)]
*  an unprecedented amount of enriched uranium and the White House is pointing to that as [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHO2bsit07U&t=306.62s)]
*  evidence that there's no daylight between her and the president in his view of Iran's [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHO2bsit07U&t=312.42s)]
*  capabilities in regards to her previous testimony. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHO2bsit07U&t=318.42s)]
*  Trump is set to leave Benminster for the White House later this afternoon. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHO2bsit07U&t=321.78000000000003s)]
*  We'll send it back to you Mike. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHO2bsit07U&t=324.78000000000003s)]
*  Nate Foy live in the Garden State with the president. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHO2bsit07U&t=326.26s)]
*  Nate, thanks very much. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHO2bsit07U&t=328.5s)]
