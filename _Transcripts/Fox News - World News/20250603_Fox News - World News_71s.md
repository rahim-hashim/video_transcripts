# ‘FACE BASHED IN’: Jillian Michaels sounds off on Olympics gender controversy #shorts #olympics #us
**Fox News - World News:** [June 03, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5X3KdTH1rw)
*  This is the most offensive for the following reasons. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5X3KdTH1rw&t=0.0s)]
*  Number one, I'm not transgender, which means I'm not even on puberty blockers and cross-sex [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5X3KdTH1rw&t=3.36s)]
*  hormones, which makes this individual far more dangerous in a combat sport. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5X3KdTH1rw&t=9.040000000000001s)]
*  It's arguably the highest level of achievement in sports, a gold medal that you have stripped [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5X3KdTH1rw&t=14.08s)]
*  away from the women that have been studying or training their entire lives for this moment. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5X3KdTH1rw&t=20.400000000000002s)]
*  And the fact that the Olympics actually gaslit all of us who had eyes. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5X3KdTH1rw&t=26.96s)]
*  I could sit here and explain to you what that means, XY chromosomes, XY karyotypes, I own [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5X3KdTH1rw&t=31.64s)]
*  a sports medicine facility, but do you need me to? [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5X3KdTH1rw&t=36.88s)]
*  Or do your eyes tell you that something is not right here? [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5X3KdTH1rw&t=39.68s)]
*  And I used to be so much softer and so much more empathetic, but I am sick and tired of [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5X3KdTH1rw&t=43.84s)]
*  this. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5X3KdTH1rw&t=49.68s)]
*  Enough is enough. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5X3KdTH1rw&t=50.68s)]
*  We are done seeing women get their face bashed in in a boxing ring on an international stage. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5X3KdTH1rw&t=52.28s)]
*  And you know what? [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5X3KdTH1rw&t=59.28s)]
*  If the Democrats want to go down with this ship, I would say let them, but how many more [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5X3KdTH1rw&t=60.28s)]
*  women are going to suffer while that ship sinks? [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5X3KdTH1rw&t=64.2s)]
