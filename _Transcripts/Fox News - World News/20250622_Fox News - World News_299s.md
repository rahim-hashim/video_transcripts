# STATE OF EMERGENCY: Israel on heightened alert as Iran retaliates
**Fox News - World News:** [June 22, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDhVGYYKfo4)
*  But first Mike Tobin live on the ground in Tel Aviv with the very latest warning Mike [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDhVGYYKfo4&t=0.0s)]
*  Good morning Griff and once again the sirens wailed in central Israel this morning as another Iranian attack was inbound [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDhVGYYKfo4&t=6.4s)]
*  The IDF now says some 27 Iranian missiles were part of that attack and they've updated the number of drones [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDhVGYYKfo4&t=13.32s)]
*  Saying 30 drones were fired at Israel today almost all of the projectiles were intercepted mid-air [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDhVGYYKfo4&t=19.080000000000002s)]
*  Causing great booms in the sky as they were intercepted several did get through with massive warheads causing a tremendous amount of destruction on the ground [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDhVGYYKfo4&t=26.38s)]
*  Particularly with the projectiles that hit here in central Israel in the Tel Aviv area [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDhVGYYKfo4&t=35.46s)]
*  That being said again David Adoma Ambulance Agency reports some 80 injuries [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDhVGYYKfo4&t=40.46s)]
*  But most of those injuries are light only one substantial substantial injury [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDhVGYYKfo4&t=45.9s)]
*  Which is remarkable given the amount of power that was in the warheads of those particular missiles now the Iranian foreign minister [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDhVGYYKfo4&t=51.34s)]
*  promises more attacks like this with a threatening post that reads in part in accordance with the UN Charter and [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDhVGYYKfo4&t=58.660000000000004s)]
*  Its provisions allowing a legitimate response in self-defense Iran reserves all options to defend its sovereignty [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDhVGYYKfo4&t=64.98s)]
*  interests and people [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDhVGYYKfo4&t=72.06s)]
*  Israeli fighter jets were active in the skies over central and western Iran today [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDhVGYYKfo4&t=73.86s)]
*  20 of them to be specific two f5 fighter jets were hit on the ground as well as eight missile launchers that Israel says were [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDhVGYYKfo4&t=79.3s)]
*  neutralized as they were preparing to fire on Israel also [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDhVGYYKfo4&t=86.3s)]
*  The the [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDhVGYYKfo4&t=91.89999999999999s)]
*  Launchers that were used in the attack themselves were neutralized by the Israeli fighter jets that are still [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDhVGYYKfo4&t=93.5s)]
*  Reportedly active in the skies over over Iran and a sad update from the war in the Gaza Strip [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDhVGYYKfo4&t=101.14s)]
*  Three of the hostages have been recovered but not alive. The remains have been recovered. The names are as follows [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDhVGYYKfo4&t=107.78s)]
*  Oh for a key to our she was from one of the kibbutz's [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDhVGYYKfo4&t=114.22s)]
*  Close to the Gaza Strip [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDhVGYYKfo4&t=117.5s)]
*  Yonatan Mordecai Samarano [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDhVGYYKfo4&t=119.42s)]
*  He had been attending the Nova Music Festival when he was kidnapped and killed and staff sergeant Shia [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDhVGYYKfo4&t=121.14s)]
*  Levinson their remains were recovered this morning not through negotiations, but rather through I should say their remains were recovered yesterday [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDhVGYYKfo4&t=127.46000000000001s)]
*  Not through negotiations, but through a special operation guys back to you in New York [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDhVGYYKfo4&t=134.5s)]
*  Mike when we look at the act the activity of Israel over Iran [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDhVGYYKfo4&t=139.85999999999999s)]
*  You know American might sit here a viewer must hear and say why don't we just bomb all of the launch? [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDhVGYYKfo4&t=145.22s)]
*  Sites that Iran has that way they can't send any more missiles [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDhVGYYKfo4&t=150.66s)]
*  Is it is it a situation where Israel is actively patrolling over Iran with fighter jets that they need to see a missile? [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDhVGYYKfo4&t=153.7s)]
*  Battery shoot before they can find its location. Do you have any insight on that? [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDhVGYYKfo4&t=160.7s)]
*  Once they start moving them around the Israelis do say they'll get them once they come out to launch when they move the [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDhVGYYKfo4&t=166.06s)]
*  Launchers into place prime them as they said today [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDhVGYYKfo4&t=172.74s)]
*  That's when they can become visible the fighter jets and the fighter jets can operate at will over central and Western Iran [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDhVGYYKfo4&t=176.66s)]
*  Mike you mentioned the response from Iran so far and obviously we've been covering that for the last week plus now [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDhVGYYKfo4&t=184.02s)]
*  The question becomes does Iran shut down the Strait of Hormuz? [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDhVGYYKfo4&t=190.1s)]
*  What's your indication on that any sense as to whether they go that far? [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDhVGYYKfo4&t=193.57999999999998s)]
*  Well, it seems that Iran would not have held back anything at this point [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDhVGYYKfo4&t=199.14s)]
*  This is as severe as the conflict can get for them if they want to take this to a naval war [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDhVGYYKfo4&t=204.18s)]
*  They've got that that option the threat of mining the Strait of Hormuz has been there for decades now [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDhVGYYKfo4&t=209.06s)]
*  We just haven't seen materialized yet [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDhVGYYKfo4&t=215.1s)]
*  What do we know about the reaction of the neighbors? [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDhVGYYKfo4&t=217.38s)]
*  To Iran to Israel just the neighborhood. What has been the reaction to this bombing? [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDhVGYYKfo4&t=221.62s)]
*  Well much less than we would have thought [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDhVGYYKfo4&t=228.22s)]
*  One thing that prevented Israel from striking at Iran a long time ago was the threat that the Iranian proxies [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDhVGYYKfo4&t=230.9s)]
*  It could cause so much damage really to the civilian population of Israel [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDhVGYYKfo4&t=237.45999999999998s)]
*  Keep in mind that Israel hasn't really fought an enemy for a long time [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDhVGYYKfo4&t=241.85999999999999s)]
*  That fought them militarily if you will they had some air defenses in place [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDhVGYYKfo4&t=247.22s)]
*  But mostly what you see is this threat that says don't fire on us or we'll fire on your civilian population [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDhVGYYKfo4&t=251.01999999999998s)]
*  We'll dispatch suicide bombers things of that nature [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDhVGYYKfo4&t=257.06s)]
*  So it really does seem to that the if the proxies were gonna act they would have acted at this point [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDhVGYYKfo4&t=260.06s)]
*  We've seen a few missiles out of the Houthi rebels, but that's about it [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDhVGYYKfo4&t=266.7s)]
*  Now I was referring to Saudi Arabia as well and Kuwait and you know the UAE [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDhVGYYKfo4&t=270.3s)]
*  But we can we were running out of time Mike. We'll come back to that [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDhVGYYKfo4&t=275.86s)]
*  Those are some of the questions we have and we'll be following this story so closely and we really appreciate you [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDhVGYYKfo4&t=279.46s)]
*  Coming into us live right now. Thank you Mike [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDhVGYYKfo4&t=283.98s)]
