# 'OVERWHELMING EVIDENCE': Gen. Keane on Iran's nuclear program
**Fox News - World News:** [June 25, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C25UnE0zrys)
*  I want to bring in General Jack Keene to get his thoughts here. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C25UnE0zrys&t=0.0s)]
*  President Trump, I'm not going to play any sound right now since we just were able to [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C25UnE0zrys&t=4.1s)]
*  hear from it and you listened to the entire thing. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C25UnE0zrys&t=7.8s)]
*  When it comes to Iran and being on its heels and this intel assessment and how long it [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C25UnE0zrys&t=11.32s)]
*  takes in order to understand what actually happened, what do you think about his answer [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C25UnE0zrys&t=17.32s)]
*  there? [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C25UnE0zrys&t=22.32s)]
*  I think the evidence as it comes out will be quite overwhelming. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C25UnE0zrys&t=23.32s)]
*  I've been in contact with the Israelis who are really the people on the ground taking [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C25UnE0zrys&t=33.04s)]
*  a look at this and they believe that based on their preliminary assessment because it's [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C25UnE0zrys&t=37.08s)]
*  the people on the ground that are going to make the most in-depth assessment of what [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C25UnE0zrys&t=43.400000000000006s)]
*  is taking place here and they haven't completed their assessment and they believe the program [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C25UnE0zrys&t=47.36s)]
*  is set back at least two years if not longer based on what took place at those sites and [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C25UnE0zrys&t=52.72s)]
*  obviously they hit all 12 sites before we hit the major underground facilities here. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C25UnE0zrys&t=58.08s)]
*  And look at the DIA report. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C25UnE0zrys&t=65.76s)]
*  It was a preliminary report that had never reached the president yet. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C25UnE0zrys&t=67.72s)]
*  It has to go through a process with all the intelligence agencies coming together making [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C25UnE0zrys&t=71.32s)]
*  an assessment and then bring that conclusion to the president. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C25UnE0zrys&t=76.48s)]
*  That has been truncated by the leak so that process hasn't even been completed and certainly [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C25UnE0zrys&t=81.14s)]
*  the people reporting on it, New York Times and CNN are trying to take advantage of it. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C25UnE0zrys&t=87.98s)]
*  I think this will simmer down at some point as the evidence is overwhelming in terms of [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C25UnE0zrys&t=92.98s)]
*  the success of this operation. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C25UnE0zrys&t=97.34s)]
*  But let me say a couple of more points on this. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C25UnE0zrys&t=99.22s)]
*  The ceasefire, I would have liked to have seen it have some conditions, public conditions [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C25UnE0zrys&t=101.74000000000001s)]
*  as well as private conditions and that is that you are not going to rebuild your program [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C25UnE0zrys&t=106.26s)]
*  and if you do, Israel and the United States may have to stop it and we will. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C25UnE0zrys&t=112.78s)]
*  I think that's implied and the president certainly made statements to that effect here so it [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C25UnE0zrys&t=119.46000000000001s)]
*  cleared up any doubt of what would benefit. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C25UnE0zrys&t=123.66000000000001s)]
*  Let's face reality here. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C25UnE0zrys&t=127.10000000000001s)]
*  The regime that's in power in Iran has not changed. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C25UnE0zrys&t=129.42000000000002s)]
*  They're going to still want a nuclear weapon because they believe it protects them in terms [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C25UnE0zrys&t=133.82s)]
*  of their survival. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C25UnE0zrys&t=138.1s)]
*  They will try to find a way to rebuild it. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C25UnE0zrys&t=139.72s)]
*  That's kind of who they are. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C25UnE0zrys&t=143.01999999999998s)]
*  They are steadfast in their resistance to the United States and Israel and the United [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C25UnE0zrys&t=144.38s)]
*  States certainly is committed to Israel here to make certain this doesn't happen. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C25UnE0zrys&t=151.1s)]
*  As Martha said, Iran is back on its heels in a way that they have never been in 45 years. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C25UnE0zrys&t=155.29999999999998s)]
*  They have lost their military capability, they have lost their nuclear program, much [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C25UnE0zrys&t=164.62s)]
*  of their ballistic missile program, much of their leadership and I think they have been [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C25UnE0zrys&t=168.82s)]
*  politically weakened inside of their country which makes them more vulnerable to maybe [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C25UnE0zrys&t=172.92000000000002s)]
*  through violence and a coup changing the regime or eventually the people themselves having [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C25UnE0zrys&t=180.78s)]
*  a say about changing the regime. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C25UnE0zrys&t=186.82s)]
*  But nonetheless, I don't want to focus too much on regime change but they are vulnerable [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C25UnE0zrys&t=188.70000000000002s)]
*  to it in a way they haven't been. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C25UnE0zrys&t=192.86s)]
*  Then the second major point he made is deterrence. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C25UnE0zrys&t=194.38000000000002s)]
*  The United States in focusing on destroying the end state of Iran's nuclear program with [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C25UnE0zrys&t=198.74s)]
*  such a major remarkable operation that was conducted here, our adversaries are looking [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C25UnE0zrys&t=204.78s)]
*  at this and they see the message and that's United States global leadership returning [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C25UnE0zrys&t=212.10000000000002s)]
*  to the world stage and their willingness to confront adversaries. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C25UnE0zrys&t=217.3s)]
*  The other thing that makes this so important and critical is look at the proxies. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C25UnE0zrys&t=221.42s)]
*  None of them came to help Iran in a moment of desperation, particularly Hezbollah who [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C25UnE0zrys&t=228.01999999999998s)]
*  was organized with billions of dollars, 150,000 rockets and missiles to do principally one [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C25UnE0zrys&t=232.77999999999997s)]
*  thing, defend Iran against Israel. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C25UnE0zrys&t=238.5s)]
*  They never fired a shot. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C25UnE0zrys&t=241.7s)]
*  Where is Russia and China in helping their partner, their partner in the Axis alliance? [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C25UnE0zrys&t=243.66s)]
*  No help whatsoever except rhetoric. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C25UnE0zrys&t=251.66s)]
*  Iran is isolated here and we have achieved the measure of deterrence. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C25UnE0zrys&t=255.9s)]
*  Both of those adversary countries need to know and they got the message from President [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C25UnE0zrys&t=261.3s)]
*  Trump. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C25UnE0zrys&t=265.42s)]
*  We are willing to confront your aggression and your ambitions when they're stepping on [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C25UnE0zrys&t=266.52s)]
*  national interests and that is usually powerful message that is coming out of what we're saying [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C25UnE0zrys&t=271.38s)]
*  here. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C25UnE0zrys&t=276.78000000000003s)]
*  I'm Steve Ducey. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C25UnE0zrys&t=277.78000000000003s)]
*  I'm Brian Kilmeade. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C25UnE0zrys&t=278.78000000000003s)]
