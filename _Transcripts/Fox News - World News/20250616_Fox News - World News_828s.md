# BREAKING: Israel eliminates 4 senior Iranian intelligence officials
**Fox News - World News:** [June 16, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBMHvKuTC6Y)
*  So we get to what Fox News alert Israel says it has eliminated four senior Intel officials [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBMHvKuTC6Y&t=0.0s)]
*  including the IRGC's head of intelligence. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBMHvKuTC6Y&t=7.36s)]
*  This is the CUD's force headquarters we believe. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBMHvKuTC6Y&t=11.6s)]
*  It comes as Iranian missile strikes kill at least eight and injured hundreds more as rockets [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBMHvKuTC6Y&t=14.8s)]
*  as rocket fire rained down on central and northern Israel overnight. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBMHvKuTC6Y&t=20.96s)]
*  Trey Yanks is live in Israel with the latest. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBMHvKuTC6Y&t=25.2s)]
*  Good morning Trey. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBMHvKuTC6Y&t=27.2s)]
*  Hey guys good morning. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBMHvKuTC6Y&t=29.2s)]
*  Overnight missiles rained down across Israel killing at least eight people. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBMHvKuTC6Y&t=30.32s)]
*  Some of them slipping past missile defense systems at five different locations destroying [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBMHvKuTC6Y&t=35.28s)]
*  both apartment buildings and residential blocks. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBMHvKuTC6Y&t=40.56s)]
*  We got to one scene in the heart of Tel Aviv just blocks away from the U.S. embassy branch [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBMHvKuTC6Y&t=43.519999999999996s)]
*  here that was also damaged in that strike and when we got there first responders were [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBMHvKuTC6Y&t=49.04s)]
*  rushing into the flames trying to look for survivors in the rubble. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBMHvKuTC6Y&t=53.68s)]
*  We spoke with one man named Gal. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBMHvKuTC6Y&t=57.2s)]
*  Here's what he had to say. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBMHvKuTC6Y&t=59.040000000000006s)]
*  When the missile arrived we were in the staircase in the building and the shock was like so [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBMHvKuTC6Y&t=61.440000000000005s)]
*  huge I never saw even a piece of a rocket and to see an explosion right in front of [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBMHvKuTC6Y&t=68.16s)]
*  my face and the other face crazy. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBMHvKuTC6Y&t=73.76s)]
*  A ballistic missile has just slammed into a building in the center of Tel Aviv. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBMHvKuTC6Y&t=77.04s)]
*  Right now first responders are trying to put out the flames in the distance. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBMHvKuTC6Y&t=83.60000000000001s)]
*  You can see right now there are a variety of paramedics on the scene, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBMHvKuTC6Y&t=88.56s)]
*  police officers and soldiers and if you come over here you'll see part of a collapsed [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBMHvKuTC6Y&t=93.12s)]
*  building. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBMHvKuTC6Y&t=98.64s)]
*  They don't know if anyone is currently inside but they are checking right now. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBMHvKuTC6Y&t=99.12s)]
*  The Iranians continue to launch waves and waves of ballistic missiles into this country. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBMHvKuTC6Y&t=106.72s)]
*  We understand there were 65 missiles and they were targeting a variety of locations. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBMHvKuTC6Y&t=111.84s)]
*  We could hear the explosions in Tel Aviv as some were intercepted overhead by Israel's [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBMHvKuTC6Y&t=117.6s)]
*  advanced missile defense systems. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBMHvKuTC6Y&t=122.56s)]
*  The Israelis are striking back taking out top intelligence officials from the Iranian regime [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBMHvKuTC6Y&t=124.48s)]
*  including the country's chief intelligence officer and his deputy. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBMHvKuTC6Y&t=129.6s)]
*  They also took out what they say are one third of the ballistic missile launching positions. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBMHvKuTC6Y&t=133.6s)]
*  Despite the fact the Israelis say they now have air superiority over the Iranian capital of Tehran, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBMHvKuTC6Y&t=138.88000000000002s)]
*  this is expected to continue for a number of days if not weeks as Israeli forces are [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBMHvKuTC6Y&t=144.56s)]
*  trying to weaken the Iranian regime and target the country's nuclear facilities. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBMHvKuTC6Y&t=149.84s)]
*  Hey Trey, would you say the number of ballistic missiles, rockets and drones are leveling off [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBMHvKuTC6Y&t=155.76000000000002s)]
*  from night after night after night because that's what Israel is banking on. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBMHvKuTC6Y&t=161.28s)]
*  That they're going to locate the launchers, they're going to run out of rockets, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBMHvKuTC6Y&t=165.76s)]
*  they can't replenish and they have no air defense. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBMHvKuTC6Y&t=169.28s)]
*  So is that happening? [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBMHvKuTC6Y&t=172.32s)]
*  Look the Iranians appear to be preserving what missiles they have left. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBMHvKuTC6Y&t=175.67999999999998s)]
*  We spoke with a senior Israeli intelligence official over the weekend who indicated the [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBMHvKuTC6Y&t=179.44s)]
*  assessment is that Iran has around 2,000 ballistic missiles and the Israelis have been able to take [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBMHvKuTC6Y&t=183.76s)]
*  out some of the stockpile. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBMHvKuTC6Y&t=188.88s)]
*  They've been able to target like I said a third of the launching positions but this still gives [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBMHvKuTC6Y&t=190.16s)]
*  Iran the capability to fire hundreds of ballistic missiles into this country and that is why Israel [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBMHvKuTC6Y&t=195.04s)]
*  is still in a state of emergency. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBMHvKuTC6Y&t=200.23999999999998s)]
*  The airport is closed and they are bracing for challenging days ahead. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBMHvKuTC6Y&t=201.68s)]
*  Officials speaking with Fox News say there will be more casualties, there will be more destruction [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBMHvKuTC6Y&t=205.84s)]
*  and you see in the aftermath videos here these are not like the rockets that came from Gaza [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBMHvKuTC6Y&t=210.32s)]
*  or from southern Lebanon. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBMHvKuTC6Y&t=214.79999999999998s)]
*  These are missiles that can take out entire blocks in major cities like Tel Aviv and from [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBMHvKuTC6Y&t=216.56s)]
*  what we saw last night and I was being very careful as we arrived on the scene less than an hour [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBMHvKuTC6Y&t=222.48s)]
*  after the explosion of describing where it was but now we can report because US Ambassador to [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBMHvKuTC6Y&t=226.79999999999998s)]
*  Israel Mike Huckabee came out publicly and said there was minor damage to the US embassy branch [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBMHvKuTC6Y&t=232.72s)]
*  here in Tel Aviv. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBMHvKuTC6Y&t=238.79999999999998s)]
*  This is a residential area. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBMHvKuTC6Y&t=240.0s)]
*  It is packed with civilians, cafes and restaurants and when we got there for blocks you could see [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBMHvKuTC6Y&t=241.83999999999997s)]
*  storefronts that were completely ripped apart, glass shards all over the street from windows that [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBMHvKuTC6Y&t=247.92s)]
*  were blown out and so to answer your question the Iranians are preserving what supply they have left. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBMHvKuTC6Y&t=252.95999999999998s)]
*  They certainly are in a position where eventually they will run out of ballistic missiles but [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBMHvKuTC6Y&t=258.88s)]
*  Israel is certainly not out of the woods yet and we can expect more Israeli strikes throughout the [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBMHvKuTC6Y&t=263.59999999999997s)]
*  day as they try to mitigate that risk of ballistic missile fire toward major cities like Jerusalem, [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBMHvKuTC6Y&t=267.59999999999997s)]
*  Tel Aviv and the northern city of Haifa. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBMHvKuTC6Y&t=274.08s)]
*  So Tre, I'm curious these missiles that the Iranians are firing do they have targets or [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBMHvKuTC6Y&t=276.16s)]
*  are they just shooting them out there? [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBMHvKuTC6Y&t=283.68s)]
*  So the reason why I ask this is because number one they're hitting civilians and number two [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBMHvKuTC6Y&t=285.6s)]
*  when it comes to that embassy area that belongs to the United States essentially what they have [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBMHvKuTC6Y&t=290.88000000000005s)]
*  known that's where that missile was going to hit. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBMHvKuTC6Y&t=294.8s)]
*  Yes, they have precision guided munitions and they know broadly where they are firing these [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBMHvKuTC6Y&t=300.0s)]
*  without getting into too many details about some of the targets that were hit I can broadly tell [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBMHvKuTC6Y&t=305.92s)]
*  you that the Iranians are going after military and civilian targets. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBMHvKuTC6Y&t=311.52s)]
*  Now with that said the Israelis are striking in a much more precise manner when they hit Iran. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBMHvKuTC6Y&t=315.03999999999996s)]
*  They go after military leadership certainly civilians have been killed in Iran but the [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBMHvKuTC6Y&t=320.0s)]
*  focus of Israeli strikes its IRGC targets and its nuclear program linked targets along with the [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBMHvKuTC6Y&t=324.96s)]
*  country's ballistic missile program. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBMHvKuTC6Y&t=331.44s)]
*  When the Iranians fired these barrages of missiles they're often hitting densely populated areas and [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBMHvKuTC6Y&t=332.96s)]
*  as we saw earlier in the day yesterday at a different location that had been hit the entire [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBMHvKuTC6Y&t=338.56s)]
*  half of an apartment building collapsed after one of these missiles struck an area and killed two [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBMHvKuTC6Y&t=344.56s)]
*  children along with two adults and many other people were injured and just to give you a sense [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBMHvKuTC6Y&t=350.4s)]
*  of the scene because we often talk about the missiles and we talk about the ability to [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBMHvKuTC6Y&t=356.15999999999997s)]
*  intercept them and how many are being fired by Iran but the people that are paying the price [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBMHvKuTC6Y&t=360.64s)]
*  it's Israeli civilians and when we arrived at that scene earlier in the day yesterday [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBMHvKuTC6Y&t=364.88s)]
*  separately from where you saw that insert where I spoke with the wounded man we saw a son and he [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBMHvKuTC6Y&t=369.03999999999996s)]
*  was wearing a hospital gown because he had been taken from the rubble to a local hospital and he [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBMHvKuTC6Y&t=374.32s)]
*  demanded that the doctors and nurses release him despite the fact that he was wounded because his [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBMHvKuTC6Y&t=380.32s)]
*  father was still buried under the debris and we brought you that story yesterday but unfortunately [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBMHvKuTC6Y&t=384.96s)]
*  his father was killed his body was pulled from the rubble later in the day after we we left that area [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBMHvKuTC6Y&t=390.79999999999995s)]
*  and it speaks to the people who are affected here they are civilians they're family members [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBMHvKuTC6Y&t=396.71999999999997s)]
*  no Israeli soldiers have been killed in the Iranian response a few have been lightly wounded [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBMHvKuTC6Y&t=401.35999999999996s)]
*  but largely we're talking about civilians according to the Israelis 24 of them have been [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBMHvKuTC6Y&t=406.64s)]
*  killed since Friday night when the Israelis launched this campaign targeting the Iranian regime [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBMHvKuTC6Y&t=410.8s)]
*  and so as we move forward here this is really important to talk about the distinction between [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBMHvKuTC6Y&t=416.08s)]
*  the target list here for the Iranians and the Israelis but we expect very difficult days ahead [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBMHvKuTC6Y&t=419.92s)]
*  given the fact that the missile defense system here is not perfect and while they're able to [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBMHvKuTC6Y&t=425.6s)]
*  shoot down a lot of the incoming fire that also includes attack drones these suicide shaheed drones [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBMHvKuTC6Y&t=430.72s)]
*  that the Russians also use in their war against Ukraine their goal here is to overwhelm Israel's [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBMHvKuTC6Y&t=436.4s)]
*  missile defense system and we've been out here on this balcony reporting live as these missile [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBMHvKuTC6Y&t=441.91999999999996s)]
*  defense systems are active over Tel Aviv and we have watched as these missiles slam into this city [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBMHvKuTC6Y&t=447.28s)]
*  and the destruction that they cause is oftentimes catastrophic if you're standing outside you don't [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBMHvKuTC6Y&t=453.52s)]
*  even need to be hit by the missile you could just be a few blocks away and be killed by the blast [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBMHvKuTC6Y&t=459.28s)]
*  wave. All right so Trey two questions for you what what's the feel there in Israel what are [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBMHvKuTC6Y&t=463.68s)]
*  what are the people who live there the residents saying about this attack on Iran and vice versa [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBMHvKuTC6Y&t=469.68s)]
*  and then also what are the what's the biggest fear what is left what should Israel and even America [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBMHvKuTC6Y&t=474.48s)]
*  be scared of that is left in Iran is it more leaders is it the Ayatollah the supreme leader [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBMHvKuTC6Y&t=480.32s)]
*  is it Fordo the nuclear site? [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBMHvKuTC6Y&t=486.32s)]
*  Yeah look the Iranians have two pieces of leverage left and they're not relatively strong compared to [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBMHvKuTC6Y&t=491.2s)]
*  what they had when you think back two years ago when their proxies were very active in the region [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBMHvKuTC6Y&t=496.56s)]
*  like Hezbollah in Lebanon Hamas and Islamic Jihad in Gaza or the Houthis in Yemen these groups have [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBMHvKuTC6Y&t=501.12s)]
*  been largely decimated by both the Israeli campaign and then in Yemen partially the American campaign [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBMHvKuTC6Y&t=507.36s)]
*  so they don't have the proxies to respond so they're relying on two things the country's [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBMHvKuTC6Y&t=513.52s)]
*  ballistic missile program that is limited they can certainly cause damage but eventually they [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBMHvKuTC6Y&t=517.04s)]
*  will run out of missiles and then they have the ability to ratchet up what's left of their nuclear [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBMHvKuTC6Y&t=521.68s)]
*  program now the Israelis have targeted two key facilities the Natanz facility and the Isfahan [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBMHvKuTC6Y&t=526.4s)]
*  facility these are locations where the Iranians were according to Israeli officials pursuing [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBMHvKuTC6Y&t=531.92s)]
*  ballistic missiles but they were pursuing more importantly according to the Israelis [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBMHvKuTC6Y&t=537.6s)]
*  nuclear weapons and they were enriching uranium up to 60% purity very close to weapons grade [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBMHvKuTC6Y&t=541.52s)]
*  material and that is one of three reasons the Israelis say they launched this campaign the big [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBMHvKuTC6Y&t=547.36s)]
*  x-factor here is the Fordow facility this is their main facility it is deep underground and according [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBMHvKuTC6Y&t=552.4s)]
*  to initial reports and officials that we've talked to over the past almost decade here they say they [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBMHvKuTC6Y&t=557.68s)]
*  don't have all of the munitions needed now we should note overnight there was some movement of [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBMHvKuTC6Y&t=562.72s)]
*  American interest in American planes to the region there are real questions and when you [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBMHvKuTC6Y&t=567.44s)]
*  ask about Israeli civilians and officials this is the question that everyone has will the Americans [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBMHvKuTC6Y&t=573.12s)]
*  get more directly involved I spoke with a very high ranking Israeli intelligence official over [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBMHvKuTC6Y&t=578.24s)]
*  the weekend we had an extensive 30-minute conversation and we got into the details of [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBMHvKuTC6Y&t=583.0400000000001s)]
*  this he stopped short at talking about what the American support looks like he said right now he [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBMHvKuTC6Y&t=588.0s)]
*  can tell me the Americans are helping to shoot down these incoming ballistic missiles and I said [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBMHvKuTC6Y&t=593.28s)]
*  well in terms of military activity what does that look like are you encouraging the Americans to get [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBMHvKuTC6Y&t=597.6s)]
*  involved and he stopped he paused and he said I can tell you the Americans are not our colleagues [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBMHvKuTC6Y&t=602.0s)]
*  they are our friends we would not be as successful as we are if we did not have the support of the [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBMHvKuTC6Y&t=607.36s)]
*  Trump administration but he didn't want to go into the details about possible American involvement [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBMHvKuTC6Y&t=612.0799999999999s)]
*  in striking the Iranian regime it is certainly possible and when we talk to people in the streets [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBMHvKuTC6Y&t=617.76s)]
*  they're encouraging it they want this to be over as quickly as possible and they know that American [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBMHvKuTC6Y&t=624.24s)]
*  involvement could lead to that and so in the days ahead we will look out to see if there is more [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBMHvKuTC6Y&t=628.48s)]
*  movement of American forces in the region to prep for a possible strike but one thing that we should [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBMHvKuTC6Y&t=633.28s)]
*  note here the Iranians have stopped short of doing one other thing that they can do they have not [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBMHvKuTC6Y&t=638.3199999999999s)]
*  directly targeted American bases in the region and they've not targeted embassies in the region [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBMHvKuTC6Y&t=643.12s)]
*  like the U.S. embassy in Baghdad this is important because it's a tactical decision on their part [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBMHvKuTC6Y&t=647.76s)]
*  they don't want the Americans involved but we've heard President Trump and he said just yesterday [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBMHvKuTC6Y&t=653.44s)]
*  sometimes you have to let them fight it out and that's exactly what's happening right now [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBMHvKuTC6Y&t=658.48s)]
*  but Trey for the most part the nuclear plants they hit full for them but it looks like Natanz and [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBMHvKuTC6Y&t=663.12s)]
*  Fordo nobody thinks that they've been disabled yet the IAEA weighed in and said from their monitors [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBMHvKuTC6Y&t=670.32s)]
*  and we're in Vienna they think they're still intact so you could never stop this operation [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBMHvKuTC6Y&t=675.5200000000001s)]
*  if your objective is to get rid of their nuclear program now it's not done it's certainly not done [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBMHvKuTC6Y&t=680.72s)]
*  if their objective is to destroy the country's nuclear program the IAEA came out today and said [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBMHvKuTC6Y&t=688.1600000000001s)]
*  they didn't have any evidence of material that was leaking that is one thing that they monitor in the [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBMHvKuTC6Y&t=693.44s)]
*  region it's just part of their job here in the middle east but the other thing is that when you [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBMHvKuTC6Y&t=698.96s)]
*  think about these facilities many of them are deep underground and again this is the leverage that [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBMHvKuTC6Y&t=703.44s)]
*  the regime still has left they can say we're going to pull out of the current treaty that they're a [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBMHvKuTC6Y&t=708.08s)]
*  part of to have oversight for their nuclear program at this point a lot of this conversation [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBMHvKuTC6Y&t=713.9200000000001s)]
*  about leverage at the negotiating table is quite frankly irrelevant because there's a war happening [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBMHvKuTC6Y&t=719.12s)]
*  between Israel and Iran right now now the Trump administration including the president has been [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBMHvKuTC6Y&t=724.96s)]
*  clear they'd like Iran to come back to the negotiating table but Israeli officials say [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBMHvKuTC6Y&t=729.12s)]
*  they're not done they have many targets they still want to hit Iran is a very large country the regime [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBMHvKuTC6Y&t=733.28s)]
*  has been preparing for this possibility of a direct war with Israel for decades and so the the job [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBMHvKuTC6Y&t=737.76s)]
*  will likely continue from an Israeli perspective as for the country's nuclear program the question is [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBMHvKuTC6Y&t=744.48s)]
*  as the Israelis continue to hit Iran and if the Americans get more directly involved [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBMHvKuTC6Y&t=750.0s)]
*  will the regime say look we want to come back to the table and we want to have an agreement [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBMHvKuTC6Y&t=754.4s)]
*  they were supposed to have a six round of nuclear talks just yesterday and of course those were [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBMHvKuTC6Y&t=758.56s)]
*  cancelled as a result of this conflict. Trey, great job you were just on a few hours ago [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBMHvKuTC6Y&t=762.4s)]
*  reporting live from a bomb site. Thanks, great information. Yeah I just don't think there is [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBMHvKuTC6Y&t=766.88s)]
*  any way we should have talks now you had your chance for talks you can't now you're going to [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBMHvKuTC6Y&t=771.28s)]
*  talk to try to preserve what's left to your nuclear program so what we can remove sanctions? [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBMHvKuTC6Y&t=775.12s)]
*  I think the president still wants to give peace a chance especially when you talk about the [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBMHvKuTC6Y&t=779.76s)]
*  escalation where the supreme leader could be taken out and then that starts a whole religious war [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBMHvKuTC6Y&t=785.6s)]
*  because Iran wants to unite the Muslim world and I think if you take out the supreme leader that [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBMHvKuTC6Y&t=791.92s)]
*  happened so he wants to give him one more shot do you want peace or he can escalate? Yeah he wants [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBMHvKuTC6Y&t=797.12s)]
*  de-escalation right now he wants a deal he says he does he does foresee that a deal will be done [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBMHvKuTC6Y&t=802.56s)]
*  and he will help negotiate that just like he did with India and Pakistan [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBMHvKuTC6Y&t=807.2s)]
*  but we could take out their gas infrastructure if they go after American troops or they go [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBMHvKuTC6Y&t=811.36s)]
