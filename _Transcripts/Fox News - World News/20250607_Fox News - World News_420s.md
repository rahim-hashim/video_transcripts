# Chang: The world is not big enough for all of China's products
**Fox News - World News:** [June 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUZ-t5D5rdo)
*  Now, President Trump said last night on Air Force One that Chinese President Xi Jinping [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUZ-t5D5rdo&t=0.0s)]
*  has agreed to let rare earth minerals and magnets flow back to the U.S. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUZ-t5D5rdo&t=4.36s)]
*  President's comments coming a day after a phone call with the Chinese leader to try [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUZ-t5D5rdo&t=10.040000000000001s)]
*  once again to resolve the recent trade tensions between the two countries. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUZ-t5D5rdo&t=13.540000000000001s)]
*  China previously stopped exports of minerals and magnets to the U.S. back in April, you [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUZ-t5D5rdo&t=17.84s)]
*  may recall. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUZ-t5D5rdo&t=22.44s)]
*  In the meantime, that disrupted supplies needed by the world's car makers, obviously, computer [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUZ-t5D5rdo&t=23.44s)]
*  chip manufacturers, and yes, military contractors as well. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUZ-t5D5rdo&t=29.68s)]
*  We're very far advanced on the China deal. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUZ-t5D5rdo&t=33.92s)]
*  We had to have clarification, and that's what we're really having the meeting about. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUZ-t5D5rdo&t=38.12s)]
*  We had a very good talk. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUZ-t5D5rdo&t=43.12s)]
*  I talked to President Xi for, I guess, more than two hours. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUZ-t5D5rdo&t=44.12s)]
*  We had a very good talk. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUZ-t5D5rdo&t=45.12s)]
*  It's a complicated deal, but it's a deal that's, you know, that brings us a lot of [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUZ-t5D5rdo&t=46.120000000000005s)]
*  money and a lot of everything else, and we get along very well with President Xi and [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUZ-t5D5rdo&t=47.120000000000005s)]
*  with China. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUZ-t5D5rdo&t=48.120000000000005s)]
*  President Trump says negotiations on a possible China deal have advanced substantially, and [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUZ-t5D5rdo&t=49.12s)]
*  he points to China's agreement to restart the flow of rare earth minerals as an example [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUZ-t5D5rdo&t=65.47999999999999s)]
*  of that. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUZ-t5D5rdo&t=70.2s)]
*  And for more on this and the plant trade talks between the two countries on Monday, we want [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUZ-t5D5rdo&t=71.2s)]
*  to bring in Gates Stone Institute Senior Fellow Gordon Chang. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUZ-t5D5rdo&t=76.16s)]
*  Great to have you with us, Gordon, as always. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUZ-t5D5rdo&t=79.67999999999999s)]
*  I want to play a quick sound bite. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUZ-t5D5rdo&t=81.6s)]
*  This is Peter Navarro, and he basically says, you know, when it comes to trade and this [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUZ-t5D5rdo&t=83.46s)]
*  strategy with the U.S. and China, it's not a China problem, it's a world problem, and [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUZ-t5D5rdo&t=87.06s)]
*  it's one that has to be addressed here and now. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUZ-t5D5rdo&t=93.03999999999999s)]
*  Listen to Peter Navarro get your thoughts on the other side. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUZ-t5D5rdo&t=96.28s)]
*  We will have deals. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUZ-t5D5rdo&t=100.88s)]
*  It takes time. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUZ-t5D5rdo&t=102.36s)]
*  Actually it takes months and years. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUZ-t5D5rdo&t=104.2s)]
*  In this administration, it's going to take more like days. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUZ-t5D5rdo&t=106.48s)]
*  We're on task and on target. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUZ-t5D5rdo&t=109.92s)]
*  All we want is fairness. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUZ-t5D5rdo&t=111.52000000000001s)]
*  We have the highest tariffs facing us in the world and the highest trade barriers. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUZ-t5D5rdo&t=113.2s)]
*  It's not a China problem, it's a world problem, and we're going to fix it because that's [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUZ-t5D5rdo&t=118.74000000000001s)]
*  what President Trump does. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUZ-t5D5rdo&t=123.64s)]
*  And therein lies the rub. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUZ-t5D5rdo&t=126.60000000000001s)]
*  People frankly, Gordon, act like we're the only people on the planet that are like trying [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUZ-t5D5rdo&t=128.44s)]
*  to have new tariffs when the fact is we've been hit by tariffs all over the planet for [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUZ-t5D5rdo&t=133.54s)]
*  as long as I've been alive, and this is perhaps a rebalancing. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUZ-t5D5rdo&t=138.85999999999999s)]
*  Is that a fair way to look at how things are being negotiated? [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUZ-t5D5rdo&t=142.45999999999998s)]
*  That's a fair assessment. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUZ-t5D5rdo&t=147.34s)]
*  So, for instance, with the European Union, it's not just a question of tariffs, it's [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUZ-t5D5rdo&t=148.34s)]
*  the non-tariff barriers. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUZ-t5D5rdo&t=152.5s)]
*  And that's true with China and true with a number of other countries as well. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUZ-t5D5rdo&t=154.42s)]
*  And the U.S. has generally had an open policy that we did not demand reciprocity. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUZ-t5D5rdo&t=158.3s)]
*  So Navarro is right. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUZ-t5D5rdo&t=163.82000000000002s)]
*  We need to have that reciprocity because this has not worked out well for the American people. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUZ-t5D5rdo&t=165.48000000000002s)]
*  You know, it's interesting, and I don't want to make it overly political, but it seemed [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUZ-t5D5rdo&t=171.22s)]
*  to me that at least early on in the negotiations, Gordon, that there were a number of Democrats [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUZ-t5D5rdo&t=175.38000000000002s)]
*  on Capitol Hill that seemed to make the argument that China was going to win this thing and [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUZ-t5D5rdo&t=180.5s)]
*  we were going to really regret it and American consumers would be really hit hard. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUZ-t5D5rdo&t=185.38s)]
*  But it seems to me, and sort of watching it play out bit by bit, that the U.S. still has [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUZ-t5D5rdo&t=190.29999999999998s)]
*  the stronger hand here. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUZ-t5D5rdo&t=194.98s)]
*  How would you assess that thought? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUZ-t5D5rdo&t=197.82s)]
*  We have a far stronger hand. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUZ-t5D5rdo&t=200.44s)]
*  Got to remember that China's right now, its economy is failing. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUZ-t5D5rdo&t=202.26s)]
*  It's in a deflationary spiral. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUZ-t5D5rdo&t=205.54s)]
*  The country's unhappy. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUZ-t5D5rdo&t=207.7s)]
*  You see protests, workers burning down their factories. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUZ-t5D5rdo&t=209.12s)]
*  A lot of people in the U.S., they don't see that, so they don't take that into account. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUZ-t5D5rdo&t=213.94s)]
*  But yes, we are the far stronger society by almost all the metrics. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUZ-t5D5rdo&t=218.29999999999998s)]
*  The other problem for China is you can't sort of export your way out of a problem if your [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUZ-t5D5rdo&t=223.29999999999998s)]
*  number one destination for exports is simply raising tariffs and frankly saying, you know, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUZ-t5D5rdo&t=229.54s)]
*  we don't need everything that you're sending out there. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUZ-t5D5rdo&t=234.74s)]
*  You can try to dump it in other markets in, say, Southeast Asia and try to circumvent. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUZ-t5D5rdo&t=237.01999999999998s)]
*  But I think the tariffs, the way they're lining up, Gordon, may actually counteract that attempt [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUZ-t5D5rdo&t=241.94s)]
*  by Beijing. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUZ-t5D5rdo&t=247.78s)]
*  Yes. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUZ-t5D5rdo&t=248.78s)]
*  Well, first of all, the other markets around the world are not big enough to accept the [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUZ-t5D5rdo&t=249.78s)]
*  surge of exports from China that they stuff that they can't sell us. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUZ-t5D5rdo&t=254.98s)]
*  But also when President Trump puts tariffs on the Chinese goods, he's giving inspiration [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUZ-t5D5rdo&t=260.12s)]
*  to others to also protect their economies because nobody wants China to decimate local [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUZ-t5D5rdo&t=264.98s)]
*  industries. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUZ-t5D5rdo&t=270.58s)]
*  So this is, as Navarro says, is a global problem for China right now. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUZ-t5D5rdo&t=272.21999999999997s)]
*  And I think the Chinese are going to find that the path that they have is try to export [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUZ-t5D5rdo&t=275.94s)]
*  to the world to get out of their local problems isn't going to work because the world is not [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUZ-t5D5rdo&t=280.02s)]
*  big enough for all of China's products. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUZ-t5D5rdo&t=284.82s)]
*  Do you have high expectations or low expectations for Monday's chats? [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUZ-t5D5rdo&t=287.52s)]
*  I have high expectations for meaningless comments from both sides. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUZ-t5D5rdo&t=292.12s)]
*  But remember, the Chinese violated the May 12 agreement with us. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUZ-t5D5rdo&t=298.62s)]
*  Part of that agreement was that China agreed to remove all of the non-tariff barriers that [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUZ-t5D5rdo&t=302.62s)]
*  they had put in place after April 2nd. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUZ-t5D5rdo&t=307.46000000000004s)]
*  And this ban on the exports of rare earths was something that should have been removed [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUZ-t5D5rdo&t=309.98s)]
*  immediately. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUZ-t5D5rdo&t=313.86s)]
*  So I don't think that China is going to comply with any new agreement that comes out of London [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUZ-t5D5rdo&t=314.86s)]
*  on Monday. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUZ-t5D5rdo&t=319.38s)]
*  And even if they do say they will, they have a long track record of violating the agreements [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUZ-t5D5rdo&t=320.38s)]
*  that they've made. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUZ-t5D5rdo&t=325.26000000000005s)]
*  Lastly, in the 30 seconds or so we have left, a couple of Chinese nationals accused of smuggling [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUZ-t5D5rdo&t=326.42s)]
*  dangerous agroterrorism fungus into the U.S. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUZ-t5D5rdo&t=331.14s)]
*  This is a real shocker, frankly, and could be an absolute catastrophe. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUZ-t5D5rdo&t=336.42s)]
*  Your thoughts on what has happened and obviously, fortunately, these people were caught. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUZ-t5D5rdo&t=340.48s)]
*  This is part of a years-long effort. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUZ-t5D5rdo&t=345.78s)]
*  In 2020, China exported seeds to the U.S. to Americans in all 50 states unsolicited. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUZ-t5D5rdo&t=347.98s)]
*  We saw this again this year with Tmoo, the online Chinese retailer sending seeds into [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUZ-t5D5rdo&t=354.41999999999996s)]
*  the U.S. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUZ-t5D5rdo&t=359.06s)]
*  This is part of an attempt to plant invasive species and a part of this attack on U.S. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUZ-t5D5rdo&t=360.17999999999995s)]
*  agriculture. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUZ-t5D5rdo&t=365.21999999999997s)]
*  This fungus, this was a weapon of mass destruction. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUZ-t5D5rdo&t=366.38s)]
*  This was an attack on the United States of America. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUZ-t5D5rdo&t=369.58s)]
*  We need to treat this with far more seriousness than we have so far. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUZ-t5D5rdo&t=372.09999999999997s)]
*  You know what? [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUZ-t5D5rdo&t=375.94s)]
*  And it took people a while, Gordon, to figure out that fentanyl was an attack on our young [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUZ-t5D5rdo&t=376.94s)]
*  people and things like this. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUZ-t5D5rdo&t=383.2s)]
*  These are real attacks. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUZ-t5D5rdo&t=384.84000000000003s)]
*  People think of wars as sort of bullets and tanks, but listen, there are a number of ways [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUZ-t5D5rdo&t=386.78000000000003s)]
*  to affect a war and we are at war when things like this happen. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUZ-t5D5rdo&t=392.2s)]
*  It becomes all the more clear each and every day. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUZ-t5D5rdo&t=396.84000000000003s)]
*  Gordon Chang, thank you so much. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUZ-t5D5rdo&t=399.32s)]
*  We appreciate your time on a Saturday. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUZ-t5D5rdo&t=400.8s)]
*  Have a great weekend. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUZ-t5D5rdo&t=402.24s)]
*  You too, Kevin, and thank you so much. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUZ-t5D5rdo&t=403.24s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUZ-t5D5rdo&t=405.32s)]
*  Stay safe. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUZ-t5D5rdo&t=406.32s)]
*  Yes, sir, you do the same. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUZ-t5D5rdo&t=407.32s)]
*  Hey, Sean Hannity here. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUZ-t5D5rdo&t=408.32s)]
*  We'll see you next time. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUZ-t5D5rdo&t=409.32s)]
