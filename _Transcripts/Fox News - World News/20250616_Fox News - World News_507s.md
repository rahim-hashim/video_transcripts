# 'NOT WITHOUT RISK': Here's what's at stake amid Israel-Iran conflict
**Fox News - World News:** [June 16, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvmxaJCWFRI)
*  Also tonight, thus far, Israel's air campaign, it has been a massive success. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvmxaJCWFRI&t=0.0s)]
*  According to multiple reports, the mullahs of Iran are now begging for new negotiations. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvmxaJCWFRI&t=5.2s)]
*  One report not confirmed has a supreme leader negotiating asylum, possibly with Putin and [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvmxaJCWFRI&t=10.56s)]
*  Russia. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvmxaJCWFRI&t=16.92s)]
*  Almost all of their top military commanders, they are now dead. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvmxaJCWFRI&t=17.92s)]
*  Their top nuclear scientists, they're also dead. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvmxaJCWFRI&t=21.12s)]
*  Their ability to fire ballistic missiles, as you just heard from Trey Yanks, that is [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvmxaJCWFRI&t=24.16s)]
*  diminishing by the hour. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvmxaJCWFRI&t=28.799999999999997s)]
*  Their weaponry slowly being depleted and degraded. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvmxaJCWFRI&t=30.439999999999998s)]
*  Their nuclear aspirations, they are quickly coming to an end, which is good for mankind. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvmxaJCWFRI&t=33.64s)]
*  As President Trump has emphasized over and over and over again, and he tried hard, he [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvmxaJCWFRI&t=39.12s)]
*  fought hard for peace, Iran cannot, in the end, have a nuclear weapon. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvmxaJCWFRI&t=44.4s)]
*  Period. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvmxaJCWFRI&t=50.36s)]
*  End of sentence. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvmxaJCWFRI&t=51.36s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvmxaJCWFRI&t=52.36s)]
*  Do you want to see regime change in Iran? [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvmxaJCWFRI&t=53.48s)]
*  I want to see no nuclear weapon in Iran, and we're well on our way to making sure that [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvmxaJCWFRI&t=56.48s)]
*  happens. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvmxaJCWFRI&t=61.56s)]
*  Now, that would be the Trump doctrine. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvmxaJCWFRI&t=62.56s)]
*  I fully, completely support this doctrine, as the president wrote on Truth Social. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvmxaJCWFRI&t=65.76s)]
*  America first means many great things, including the fact that Iran cannot have a nuclear weapon. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvmxaJCWFRI&t=70.88s)]
*  Make America great again. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvmxaJCWFRI&t=76.6s)]
*  The president also made one other point, very clear. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvmxaJCWFRI&t=78.12s)]
*  If we are attacked in any way, shape or form by Iran, the full strength and might of the [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvmxaJCWFRI&t=81.08s)]
*  U.S. armed forces will come down on you at levels never seen before. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvmxaJCWFRI&t=86.56s)]
*  In the meantime, it appears that Israel's air campaign, now with full air superiority, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvmxaJCWFRI&t=90.36s)]
*  they own the Iranian skies, achieved in just four days, will only be ramping up at this [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvmxaJCWFRI&t=96.28s)]
*  point. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvmxaJCWFRI&t=102.36s)]
*  They own the skies. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvmxaJCWFRI&t=103.36s)]
*  They have all the leverage. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvmxaJCWFRI&t=104.36s)]
*  But let's be clear. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvmxaJCWFRI&t=105.75999999999999s)]
*  This conflict, any conflict, is not without risk. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvmxaJCWFRI&t=106.96s)]
*  It is not without hardship. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvmxaJCWFRI&t=110.6s)]
*  It is not without suffering. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvmxaJCWFRI&t=112.19999999999999s)]
*  Also, part of the Trump doctrine is no more forever wars. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvmxaJCWFRI&t=113.67999999999999s)]
*  I fully agree with that also. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvmxaJCWFRI&t=117.47999999999999s)]
*  With Israel owning the air over the entire country of Iran, the country now is suspect. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvmxaJCWFRI&t=119.91999999999999s)]
*  They're going to lose the nuclear program. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvmxaJCWFRI&t=126.28s)]
*  That is pretty abundantly clear tonight. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvmxaJCWFRI&t=127.88s)]
*  But they could also lose their electric grid, which is gas-driven. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvmxaJCWFRI&t=130.32s)]
*  That could be taken out just as quickly. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvmxaJCWFRI&t=134.72s)]
*  which is their entire economy can also be taken out. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvmxaJCWFRI&t=138.16s)]
*  And without a protracted war or boots on the ground, doesn't make it risk-free. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvmxaJCWFRI&t=142.68s)]
*  Everything has risk. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvmxaJCWFRI&t=148.28s)]
*  However, the president is correct. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvmxaJCWFRI&t=149.28s)]
*  The greater risk would be to do nothing in the face of a clear and present danger. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvmxaJCWFRI&t=151.3s)]
*  The world cannot experience another Holocaust. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvmxaJCWFRI&t=156.12s)]
*  Iran has proven over and over again, convert or die, death to Israel, death to America. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvmxaJCWFRI&t=160.24s)]
*  And as the president repeats, over and over again, Iran cannot have a nuclear weapon. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvmxaJCWFRI&t=165.76s)]
*  Just noticed how Israel hits military targets. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvmxaJCWFRI&t=170.52s)]
*  And look what the Iranians are doing. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvmxaJCWFRI&t=173.56s)]
*  They are terrorizing heavy-populated civilian areas like Tel Aviv. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvmxaJCWFRI&t=174.96s)]
*  Imagine the region with a nuclear-armed Iran, the number one state sponsor of terror, pledging [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvmxaJCWFRI&t=179.96s)]
*  to wipe Israel and the U.S. off the map, fighting proxy war after proxy war after proxy war. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvmxaJCWFRI&t=185.76s)]
*  I brought this up last week. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvmxaJCWFRI&t=191.84s)]
*  Ask yourself, how many rockets, if they were fired into our country by the number one sponsor [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvmxaJCWFRI&t=193.32s)]
*  of terror and they were threatening to wipe us off the map, how many rockets would it [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvmxaJCWFRI&t=200.04s)]
*  take before every American demanded a military response from their government? [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvmxaJCWFRI&t=205.0s)]
*  Israel now for decades has been the target of tens, not hundreds, of thousands of rocket [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvmxaJCWFRI&t=211.08s)]
*  attacks. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvmxaJCWFRI&t=216.88s)]
*  Now the ballistic missiles, they are getting more powerful than ever. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvmxaJCWFRI&t=218.08s)]
*  The Iranians, according to reports, they want 4,000-pound ballistic missiles. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvmxaJCWFRI&t=221.76s)]
*  That can cause a lot of damage in a city like Tel Aviv. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvmxaJCWFRI&t=228.16s)]
*  I've been there. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvmxaJCWFRI&t=230.92000000000002s)]
*  What would you want a U.S. president to do? [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvmxaJCWFRI&t=232.52s)]
*  And that is exactly what Israel is facing. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvmxaJCWFRI&t=235.4s)]
*  Iran wanted to wipe the world's only Jewish state off the map, and with each passing day, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvmxaJCWFRI&t=238.52s)]
*  the Islamic Republic was getting closer and closer to achieving that goal. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvmxaJCWFRI&t=242.8s)]
*  During both the Obama and Biden years, Iran was able to do pretty much whatever they wanted. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvmxaJCWFRI&t=247.04s)]
*  I blame both of them for enriching the Uraniums. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvmxaJCWFRI&t=251.44s)]
*  I blame both of them, especially Biden, turning a blind eye to the sanctions that were bankrupting [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvmxaJCWFRI&t=254.88s)]
*  him that Donald Trump had put in place. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvmxaJCWFRI&t=259.84000000000003s)]
*  They stockpiled thousands of ballistic missiles. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvmxaJCWFRI&t=262.48s)]
*  They were able to use that money to foment terror all over the region and build out their [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvmxaJCWFRI&t=265.4s)]
*  nuclear program and enrich Uranium at a far more rapid pace. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvmxaJCWFRI&t=271.0s)]
*  They have armed their proxies to the teeth, all while declaring, you know, what they want, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvmxaJCWFRI&t=276.04s)]
*  what their stated goal is. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvmxaJCWFRI&t=281.52000000000004s)]
*  And while Israel has neutralized Iran's top proxies, the nuclear program, the country's [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvmxaJCWFRI&t=282.92s)]
*  missile production capabilities, they were picking up speed. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvmxaJCWFRI&t=288.32000000000005s)]
*  In about a month, a nuclear holocaust would have been a real possibility. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvmxaJCWFRI&t=291.68s)]
*  That is not a risk that any country should ever have to face. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvmxaJCWFRI&t=296.18s)]
*  Unfortunately, the so-called Party of Compassion doesn't seem to care. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvmxaJCWFRI&t=300.68s)]
*  In fact, the base of the Democratic Party, others with extreme views, they seem perfectly [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvmxaJCWFRI&t=304.84s)]
*  OK with the virulent anti-Semitism in the halls of Congress, on college campuses and [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvmxaJCWFRI&t=310.12s)]
*  worldwide. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvmxaJCWFRI&t=315.52s)]
*  And, you know, from the river to the sea, how often have we heard that? [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvmxaJCWFRI&t=316.52s)]
*  Or at best, they wouldn't mind if it did happen. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvmxaJCWFRI&t=320.28s)]
*  In fact, tonight, left-wing protesters in New York City openly supporting Iran. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvmxaJCWFRI&t=322.88s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvmxaJCWFRI&t=328.24s)]
*  Do you condone or condemn the missiles on Israel? [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvmxaJCWFRI&t=329.24s)]
*  Condone! [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvmxaJCWFRI&t=333.24s)]
*  F*** Israel! [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvmxaJCWFRI&t=335.04s)]
*  F*** Israel about the terrorist apartheid regime! [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvmxaJCWFRI&t=336.04s)]
*  F*** the Israel! [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvmxaJCWFRI&t=340.04s)]
*  F*** the U.S. empire! [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvmxaJCWFRI&t=341.04s)]
*  It's a colonial project! [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvmxaJCWFRI&t=342.04s)]
*  It's a f***ing racist piece of s*** state! [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvmxaJCWFRI&t=343.04s)]
*  It's true. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvmxaJCWFRI&t=346.04s)]
*  Fake country! [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvmxaJCWFRI&t=347.04s)]
*  Made of fake people! [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvmxaJCWFRI&t=348.04s)]
*  F***ing white supremacy! [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvmxaJCWFRI&t=351.04s)]
*  The party of AOC, the party of the Squad, the party of Jasmine Crockett, the party of [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvmxaJCWFRI&t=353.04s)]
*  Grandpa Bernie have gone outright insane. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvmxaJCWFRI&t=359.24s)]
*  They are literally out in the street dressed like Islamic extremists calling for the destruction [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvmxaJCWFRI&t=361.64s)]
*  of Israel from the river to the sea. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvmxaJCWFRI&t=366.24s)]
*  Their anti-Semitic protests have raged now for nearly two years. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvmxaJCWFRI&t=368.71999999999997s)]
*  This is the same party that turned a suspected human trafficker, gang member, illegal immigrant [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvmxaJCWFRI&t=372.68s)]
*  Abrego Garcia into their hero. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvmxaJCWFRI&t=377.88s)]
*  The same party that blocks highways and attacks law enforcement and federal buildings because [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvmxaJCWFRI&t=380.24s)]
*  ICE is doing what the law requires and deporting criminal illegal immigrants that Joe, Kamala [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvmxaJCWFRI&t=384.8s)]
*  and Mayorkas allowed into this country. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvmxaJCWFRI&t=390.84s)]
*  That means known terrorists. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvmxaJCWFRI&t=393.4s)]
*  We have Iranian Hiss squads in the country. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvmxaJCWFRI&t=395.03999999999996s)]
*  We have murderers, we have rapists, we have cartel members, gang members, drug dealers [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvmxaJCWFRI&t=397.26s)]
*  and people that commit other heinous crimes. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvmxaJCWFRI&t=401.76s)]
*  The same party that burned Teslas and attacked their owners all because Elon Musk supported [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvmxaJCWFRI&t=404.2s)]
*  Donald Trump and was saving money and rescuing astronauts. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvmxaJCWFRI&t=409.76s)]
*  The same party obsessed with gender identity politics, allowing and championing the right [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvmxaJCWFRI&t=413.26s)]
*  of men to play women's sports. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvmxaJCWFRI&t=418.06s)]
*  The same party that supports racist DEI policies over merit and hard work. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvmxaJCWFRI&t=420.04s)]
*  The same party that believed the Russia hoax. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvmxaJCWFRI&t=425.12s)]
*  They went along with FISA warrants. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvmxaJCWFRI&t=427.56s)]
*  The same people that went along with false valuations of at Mar-a-Lago. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvmxaJCWFRI&t=430.28s)]
*  The same party that calls the summer of 2020 the summer of love. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvmxaJCWFRI&t=434.44s)]
*  Five hundred and seventy four riots. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvmxaJCWFRI&t=438.72s)]
*  The same party that tried to remove Donald Trump from the ballot through lawfare and [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvmxaJCWFRI&t=440.76s)]
*  pick their own presidential candidate without a single primary vote. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvmxaJCWFRI&t=445.32s)]
*  Now it's the very party that lacks any and all self-awareness with a ridiculous nationwide [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvmxaJCWFRI&t=449.03999999999996s)]
