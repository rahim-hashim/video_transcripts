# President Trump deserves the Nobel Peace Prize, Katie Pavlich says
**Fox News - World News:** [June 22, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK3934Cf2Y8)
*  We'll look back at probably one of the most courageous military efforts that is protecting [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK3934Cf2Y8&t=0.0s)]
*  the entire world, and we don't even know the true magnitude of what this will do in [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK3934Cf2Y8&t=8.2s)]
*  the future or what this could have become if it wasn't dealt with. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK3934Cf2Y8&t=16.32s)]
*  In other words, the number one state sponsor of terror with nuclear weapons, and then, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK3934Cf2Y8&t=20.48s)]
*  of course, ballistic missiles that get longer and longer in terms of their range, what that [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK3934Cf2Y8&t=25.0s)]
*  could have meant for the United States, what that could have meant for the world. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK3934Cf2Y8&t=29.599999999999998s)]
*  The world is a safer place tonight, is my conclusion. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK3934Cf2Y8&t=33.32s)]
*  What's yours? [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK3934Cf2Y8&t=35.96s)]
*  I couldn't agree more, Sean. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK3934Cf2Y8&t=36.96s)]
*  God bless President Trump. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK3934Cf2Y8&t=38.2s)]
*  God bless the U.S. military. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK3934Cf2Y8&t=39.68s)]
*  And God bless the Israelis for paving the way so this mission could be as successful [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK3934Cf2Y8&t=41.16s)]
*  as it was tonight. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK3934Cf2Y8&t=45.44s)]
*  You know, the president reiterated what you've been saying, what I've been saying for weeks [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK3934Cf2Y8&t=46.44s)]
*  now leading up to this, which is the Iranian regime has been at war with the American people [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK3934Cf2Y8&t=50.4s)]
*  for 45 years, and their pursuit of a nuclear weapon was the final straw. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK3934Cf2Y8&t=55.6s)]
*  And I thought when President Trump said tonight that they've been killing and maiming our [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK3934Cf2Y8&t=61.0s)]
*  people and he decided a long time ago that this was not going to continue. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK3934Cf2Y8&t=64.08s)]
*  It's so interesting to watch the relationship between Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK3934Cf2Y8&t=69.16s)]
*  and President Trump, not just in the last six months since President Trump came back [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK3934Cf2Y8&t=73.48s)]
*  into office, but also combine that with what they did together during the first term. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK3934Cf2Y8&t=77.96000000000001s)]
*  You know, this time around, President Trump invited Netanyahu as the first foreign leader [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK3934Cf2Y8&t=82.32s)]
*  in his second term to visit America, to come visit him at the White House, to talk about [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK3934Cf2Y8&t=87.52s)]
*  these issues. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK3934Cf2Y8&t=91.84s)]
*  He then came back in April and actually had a meeting with a number of reporters. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK3934Cf2Y8&t=92.88s)]
*  I happened to be there at the Blair House with Netanyahu, and he talked about this relationship [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK3934Cf2Y8&t=96.52s)]
*  that he had with President Trump and how different it was from the Biden administration, how he [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK3934Cf2Y8&t=100.8s)]
*  could trust America, how he could rely on President Trump, how he was a man of his word, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK3934Cf2Y8&t=106.44s)]
*  how they were on the same page. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK3934Cf2Y8&t=111.44000000000001s)]
*  And now here we are today with the success of this military strike, not on one nuclear [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK3934Cf2Y8&t=113.24000000000001s)]
*  site, but three, and a message not just to the Iranians, but to China, to the rest of [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK3934Cf2Y8&t=118.76s)]
*  the region, even to Russia. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK3934Cf2Y8&t=124.76s)]
*  So this was a night of historic proportions. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK3934Cf2Y8&t=126.96000000000001s)]
*  The president was courageous in making this move, in making this decision. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK3934Cf2Y8&t=130.12s)]
*  And as you said, I think we're going to see the fruits of this decision tonight play out [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK3934Cf2Y8&t=135.6s)]
*  for many, many years to come. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK3934Cf2Y8&t=139.96s)]
*  And if the Nobel Peace Prize were worth anything anymore, I would say the president certainly [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK3934Cf2Y8&t=141.64000000000001s)]
*  deserves one. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK3934Cf2Y8&t=145.86s)]
