# BLAST ZONE: US holds key weapon in destroying Iranâ€™s most heavily-protected nuclear facility
**Fox News - World News:** [June 18, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6t3GMTHKVC0)
*  All right, I just want to make everyone aware because we are watching this, but we are also [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6t3GMTHKVC0&t=0.0s)]
*  watching obviously the other huge story today, which is what happens next from the White [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6t3GMTHKVC0&t=6.5600000000000005s)]
*  House with regard to Iran. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6t3GMTHKVC0&t=10.5s)]
*  So we're going to keep an eye on this situation in denim. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6t3GMTHKVC0&t=12.58s)]
*  But I want to go back to the Iran situation because President Trump has just made news [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6t3GMTHKVC0&t=15.08s)]
*  in the Oval Office. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6t3GMTHKVC0&t=19.72s)]
*  He has made comments and we are awaiting that sound. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6t3GMTHKVC0&t=20.72s)]
*  We're going to play it for you as soon as it turns around. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6t3GMTHKVC0&t=24.28s)]
*  And I want to bring in retired 4-star General Jack Keane, Fox News Senior Strategic Analyst, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6t3GMTHKVC0&t=27.72s)]
*  former Vice Chief of Staff of the Army and Chairman of the Institute for the Study of [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6t3GMTHKVC0&t=31.88s)]
*  War. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6t3GMTHKVC0&t=35.36s)]
*  So General, as I mentioned, as soon as we get these comments from the president, we [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6t3GMTHKVC0&t=36.36s)]
*  will turn those around. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6t3GMTHKVC0&t=38.64s)]
*  But your thoughts on where we stand right now as we wait for President Trump to make [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6t3GMTHKVC0&t=40.48s)]
*  this decision about a potential strike on Fordow in Iran, the nuclear facility? [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6t3GMTHKVC0&t=44.239999999999995s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, the decision really surrounds the fact that if Fordow stands and it's not [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6t3GMTHKVC0&t=51.16s)]
*  destroyed by the Israelis or its capacity much taken down, then the simple fact is Iran [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6t3GMTHKVC0&t=59.04s)]
*  still has the capability to build a nuclear weapon. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6t3GMTHKVC0&t=66.02s)]
*  So that is really the issue here. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6t3GMTHKVC0&t=69.67999999999999s)]
*  And for the audience to understand, Iran built this very huge complex nuclear enterprise [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6t3GMTHKVC0&t=72.0s)]
*  with redundancy and resiliency at 12 different sites. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6t3GMTHKVC0&t=80.24s)]
*  So no one site by itself would eliminate the program. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6t3GMTHKVC0&t=83.9s)]
*  And the program overall is fundamentally designed from the outset to survive an attack on the [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6t3GMTHKVC0&t=89.12s)]
*  program. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6t3GMTHKVC0&t=97.52s)]
*  What the Israelis are doing right now, they built into the program that kind of ability [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6t3GMTHKVC0&t=98.52s)]
*  to absorb the attack, to survive that attack, to recover and to rebuild. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6t3GMTHKVC0&t=106.0s)]
*  And it's why the Ayatollah, Martha, in the negotiations with the Trump administration, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6t3GMTHKVC0&t=112.0s)]
*  why his negotiating team would never come to the table and say we will voluntarily dismantle. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6t3GMTHKVC0&t=117.48s)]
*  Why is that? [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6t3GMTHKVC0&t=124.48s)]
*  Because then he gives up the program with verification. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6t3GMTHKVC0&t=125.48s)]
*  He always believed that he can recover and rebuild despite the Israeli attack. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6t3GMTHKVC0&t=128.0s)]
*  And then there's this one site that he has, he knows that the Israelis likely cannot take [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6t3GMTHKVC0&t=134.56s)]
*  it down and he hopes that this will survive. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6t3GMTHKVC0&t=140.04s)]
*  That's kind of where we are. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6t3GMTHKVC0&t=143.04s)]
*  And the United States is pursuing it for the obvious reason that the president is committed [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6t3GMTHKVC0&t=145.04s)]
*  to it, but also it sends a strong signal to our allies that this is our closest ally in [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6t3GMTHKVC0&t=148.92000000000002s)]
*  the region. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6t3GMTHKVC0&t=154.88s)]
*  They need help, we're going to help them. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6t3GMTHKVC0&t=155.88s)]
*  And what does it send a message to our adversaries? [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6t3GMTHKVC0&t=157.92000000000002s)]
*  Much the same. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6t3GMTHKVC0&t=160.32s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6t3GMTHKVC0&t=161.32s)]
*  It helps to build deterrence with them. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6t3GMTHKVC0&t=162.32s)]
*  I want to ask you about the message to China and Russia because I think it's so important [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6t3GMTHKVC0&t=164.51999999999998s)]
*  in this story at this point. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6t3GMTHKVC0&t=167.6s)]
*  But first of all, just going back, give us your sense of confidence that this bunker [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6t3GMTHKVC0&t=169.44s)]
*  buster bomb would be successful in disabling Fordow. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6t3GMTHKVC0&t=175.79999999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6t3GMTHKVC0&t=182.28s)]
*  This is a challenging target. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6t3GMTHKVC0&t=184.79999999999998s)]
*  And certainly the people involved in this know this in spades. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6t3GMTHKVC0&t=187.44s)]
*  We've been looking at Fordow for years. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6t3GMTHKVC0&t=190.48s)]
*  The bunker buster, as you're describing it, was fundamentally designed to go deep, but [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6t3GMTHKVC0&t=195.44s)]
*  in a building-like structure with cement that's being reinforced. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6t3GMTHKVC0&t=200.83999999999997s)]
*  We're going deep into a mountain structure and what has considerable amount of rock in [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6t3GMTHKVC0&t=206.23999999999998s)]
*  it. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6t3GMTHKVC0&t=212.16s)]
*  And because it's rock and not a cement structure, I'm not an engineer, but engineers have advised [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6t3GMTHKVC0&t=213.16s)]
*  me on it. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6t3GMTHKVC0&t=218.0s)]
*  What happens is it dissipates some of the blast effect because it's rock and it's not [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6t3GMTHKVC0&t=219.4s)]
*  solid in a way that a cement structure would and could focus the blast much more and be [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6t3GMTHKVC0&t=225.28s)]
*  considerably more destructive. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6t3GMTHKVC0&t=232.04000000000002s)]
*  So it's not without its challenges in dealing with this. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6t3GMTHKVC0&t=234.16s)]
*  And that doesn't mean it couldn't be multiple bombs put on this target to bring it to that [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6t3GMTHKVC0&t=238.08s)]
*  level of construction. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6t3GMTHKVC0&t=243.20000000000002s)]
*  If you really wanted a guarantee to destroy it, I mean, you could conduct a raid on it [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6t3GMTHKVC0&t=244.96s)]
*  and then physically secure the site and dismantle and blow the thing up. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6t3GMTHKVC0&t=250.68s)]
*  I mean, the Israelis certainly may have a plan to do just that if the United States [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6t3GMTHKVC0&t=256.12s)]
*  is not going to help them. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6t3GMTHKVC0&t=262.28000000000003s)]
*  Obviously, there's considerably more risk with troops on the ground, insert them, be [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6t3GMTHKVC0&t=263.72s)]
*  able to get them out. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6t3GMTHKVC0&t=267.84000000000003s)]
*  How much time does it take to do the damage? [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6t3GMTHKVC0&t=268.84000000000003s)]
*  The Israelis also may have already and if they haven't, when it comes to furtile, they [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6t3GMTHKVC0&t=272.4s)]
*  can't go deep and blow it up, but they should be able to take out the power grid that supports [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6t3GMTHKVC0&t=282.03999999999996s)]
*  it and the ventilation system that supports it. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6t3GMTHKVC0&t=287.47999999999996s)]
*  They did damage like that to Natanz back in 2020 as one of their covert operations. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6t3GMTHKVC0&t=290.59999999999997s)]
*  They don't talk about it, but it's been out in the public since. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6t3GMTHKVC0&t=295.64s)]
*  So there are options that the Israelis have, but none of those options are as good as the [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6t3GMTHKVC0&t=300.02s)]
*  option that we have. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6t3GMTHKVC0&t=306.47999999999996s)]
*  And certainly, I think that's the most favored option. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6t3GMTHKVC0&t=308.65999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6t3GMTHKVC0&t=311.26s)]
*  Thank you for that assessment. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6t3GMTHKVC0&t=314.46s)]
*  I don't know if we have the sound bite of President Trump control room talking about [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6t3GMTHKVC0&t=315.46s)]
*  Putin, but let me know if we have this. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6t3GMTHKVC0&t=321.02s)]
*  But I want to ask the general, when you look at the posture right now of Russia and China [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6t3GMTHKVC0&t=325.12s)]
*  as they watch this. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6t3GMTHKVC0&t=329.84000000000003s)]
*  All right, we now have the sound from President Trump. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6t3GMTHKVC0&t=331.68s)]
*  Standby, General, if you would. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6t3GMTHKVC0&t=333.40000000000003s)]
*  Thank you very much. Let's listen in. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6t3GMTHKVC0&t=334.56s)]
*  So do you have any questions? [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6t3GMTHKVC0&t=336.64000000000004s)]
*  Do you know the latest on the evacuations out of Israel, Mr. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6t3GMTHKVC0&t=338.12s)]
*  President? No, no, we're having a meeting in an hour. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6t3GMTHKVC0&t=341.0s)]
*  I have a meeting downstairs in one hour. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6t3GMTHKVC0&t=344.6s)]
*  Yeah, Mr. President, on Iran, if regime change does happen there, if the regime falls, do [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6t3GMTHKVC0&t=346.32000000000005s)]
*  you have a plan for what you think would happen? [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6t3GMTHKVC0&t=352.64000000000004s)]
*  I have a plan for everything, but we'll see what happens. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6t3GMTHKVC0&t=356.0s)]
*  Kind of ways to go. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6t3GMTHKVC0&t=358.68s)]
*  They should have, look, they should have made the deal. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6t3GMTHKVC0&t=359.68s)]
*  I had a great deal for them. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6t3GMTHKVC0&t=362.0s)]
*  They should have made that deal. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6t3GMTHKVC0&t=363.68s)]
*  60 days we talked about it and in the end they decided not to do it. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6t3GMTHKVC0&t=364.68s)]
*  And now they wish they did it. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6t3GMTHKVC0&t=369.44s)]
*  And they want to meet, but it's a little late to meet, but they want to meet and they want [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6t3GMTHKVC0&t=371.52s)]
*  to come to the White House. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6t3GMTHKVC0&t=376.2s)]
*  They'll even come to the White House. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6t3GMTHKVC0&t=377.2s)]
*  So we'll see. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6t3GMTHKVC0&t=378.48s)]
*  I may do that. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6t3GMTHKVC0&t=379.48s)]
*  But it's a shame. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6t3GMTHKVC0&t=380.8s)]
*  It wasn't, could have been done the easy way. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6t3GMTHKVC0&t=382.8s)]
*  Do you think regime there could fall? [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6t3GMTHKVC0&t=384.8s)]
*  Sure. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6t3GMTHKVC0&t=387.40000000000003s)]
*  Anything could happen, right? [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6t3GMTHKVC0&t=388.40000000000003s)]
*  Of that? [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6t3GMTHKVC0&t=389.40000000000003s)]
*  Sure. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6t3GMTHKVC0&t=390.40000000000003s)]
*  All right. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6t3GMTHKVC0&t=391.40000000000003s)]
*  We hear President Trump saying they're going to meet again downstairs in an hour. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6t3GMTHKVC0&t=392.40000000000003s)]
*  I assume that means likely in the Situation Room as they continue this. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6t3GMTHKVC0&t=394.92s)]
*  He was asked about regime change, which obviously is a huge issue here. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6t3GMTHKVC0&t=399.36s)]
*  It's not something that, you know, there are other things that have to happen, obviously, [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6t3GMTHKVC0&t=403.6s)]
*  before that, General. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6t3GMTHKVC0&t=407.76s)]
*  And what about this suggestion that the Iranians keep shooting down, but President Trump keeps [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6t3GMTHKVC0&t=409.32s)]
*  confirming that they have reached out and said that they do want to meet? [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6t3GMTHKVC0&t=414.72s)]
*  Well, of course the Iranians want to meet. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6t3GMTHKVC0&t=421.32000000000005s)]
*  I mean, they want to do anything they can to put off what the whole world is looking [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6t3GMTHKVC0&t=423.64000000000004s)]
*  at, Martha. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6t3GMTHKVC0&t=429.16s)]
*  And let's face facts. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6t3GMTHKVC0&t=431.12s)]
*  The Iranians will come to that meeting. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6t3GMTHKVC0&t=434.12s)]
*  I am absolutely convinced with the same mindset I just described. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6t3GMTHKVC0&t=436.0s)]
*  And that is they believe they have the capacity to absorb an attack, survive it, recover and [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6t3GMTHKVC0&t=442.40000000000003s)]
*  rebuild. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6t3GMTHKVC0&t=449.44s)]
*  And they are not going to voluntarily dismantle the program, which would mean the end of it, [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6t3GMTHKVC0&t=451.04s)]
*  unless they have a secret site that we're not aware of that has enriched uranium centrifuges [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6t3GMTHKVC0&t=456.88s)]
*  and they can still build the bomb. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6t3GMTHKVC0&t=463.16s)]
*  That is the one unknown, but we don't have any evidence of that as of now. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6t3GMTHKVC0&t=465.12s)]
*  So I don't think the administration will fall for the line that let's stop everything and [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6t3GMTHKVC0&t=471.24s)]
*  go to negotiations, given what a dismal failure these negotiations have been for weeks as [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6t3GMTHKVC0&t=477.76s)]
*  the Iranians maintain the hard line. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6t3GMTHKVC0&t=483.8s)]
*  We're not going to voluntarily dismantle. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6t3GMTHKVC0&t=486.64s)]
*  Not only that, we want to continue to have enrichment capability. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6t3GMTHKVC0&t=488.76s)]
*  And I don't see them changing that. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6t3GMTHKVC0&t=493.08s)]
*  And if it comes into negotiation, it's just a ploy to put off the inevitable. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6t3GMTHKVC0&t=495.2s)]
*  I mean, there's not much they have left in their arsenal. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6t3GMTHKVC0&t=500.16s)]
*  I mean, you know, this promise to their regime that they are building this nuclear weapon [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6t3GMTHKVC0&t=504.48s)]
*  is the main thing that they hang on to in terms of power. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6t3GMTHKVC0&t=511.0s)]
*  So it seems it makes perfect sense that it would be something that they can't let go [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6t3GMTHKVC0&t=514.9200000000001s)]
*  of because I'm not sure what they have left. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6t3GMTHKVC0&t=519.12s)]
*  They have no economy. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6t3GMTHKVC0&t=520.5600000000001s)]
*  They've used all the money that they have to support these various proxy groups who [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6t3GMTHKVC0&t=521.88s)]
*  have also been decimated by Israel. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6t3GMTHKVC0&t=528.76s)]
*  Speak to the isolation at this point as you assess it at the study of war for Khomeini [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6t3GMTHKVC0&t=532.32s)]
*  right now. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6t3GMTHKVC0&t=538.9200000000001s)]
*  Well, you put your finger right on it, Martha. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6t3GMTHKVC0&t=541.16s)]
*  The the basic reason to have the nuclear weapon is to preserve the regime. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6t3GMTHKVC0&t=543.44s)]
*  That's reason one. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6t3GMTHKVC0&t=548.24s)]
*  The second reason is obviously the destruction of Israel and also as use it as political [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6t3GMTHKVC0&t=549.12s)]
*  leverage in the region to achieve dominance even more than what they have with their [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6t3GMTHKVC0&t=555.92s)]
*  proxies over the Arab states and the rest of it. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6t3GMTHKVC0&t=560.64s)]
*  And obviously the Arab states would have to enter into a nuclear arms race and makes this [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6t3GMTHKVC0&t=564.36s)]
*  whole area so much more volatile because then you have a potential for an exchange of nuclear [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6t3GMTHKVC0&t=569.4799999999999s)]
*  weapons, something we've never, ever had. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6t3GMTHKVC0&t=576.12s)]
*  So yes, primary reasons preservation of the regime. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6t3GMTHKVC0&t=579.0799999999999s)]
*  And that is why they're holding on to this thing as long as they can. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6t3GMTHKVC0&t=582.68s)]
*  But look at the let's assume the nuclear goes away and they'll still want to rebuild at [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6t3GMTHKVC0&t=586.64s)]
*  some point and recover certainly. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6t3GMTHKVC0&t=593.88s)]
*  But they'll also going to be very weakened politically internally as a result of this. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6t3GMTHKVC0&t=596.76s)]
*  You know, the people have been fed up with this regime for a long time. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6t3GMTHKVC0&t=602.76s)]
*  But now even some of the people that are close to the regime, Martha, I mean, in the first [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6t3GMTHKVC0&t=605.92s)]
*  12 hours, they lost all of their air defense capability. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6t3GMTHKVC0&t=610.84s)]
*  That means fighter jets for the last five days have been flying day and night over Iran. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6t3GMTHKVC0&t=614.0s)]
*  The psychological and emotional impact of something like that is stunning. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6t3GMTHKVC0&t=621.12s)]
*  And the second thing is they lose their nuclear program. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6t3GMTHKVC0&t=626.12s)]
*  They lose the leaders of the program. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6t3GMTHKVC0&t=629.96s)]
*  They lose the leaders of their military. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6t3GMTHKVC0&t=631.64s)]
*  And finally, they lose the one offensive power that they really do have. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6t3GMTHKVC0&t=634.2800000000001s)]
*  And it's coming to an end. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6t3GMTHKVC0&t=638.4000000000001s)]
*  And that is their ballistic missile program. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6t3GMTHKVC0&t=640.0799999999999s)]
*  So they sit there weak politically, weak economically and weak militarily as a result of what has [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6t3GMTHKVC0&t=642.36s)]
*  taken place. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6t3GMTHKVC0&t=650.04s)]
*  And are they vulnerable from internal regime change as a result of that? [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6t3GMTHKVC0&t=651.04s)]
*  You betcha. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6t3GMTHKVC0&t=655.4399999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6t3GMTHKVC0&t=656.4399999999999s)]
*  In a way that they have never been in 45 years. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6t3GMTHKVC0&t=657.4399999999999s)]
*  It's absolutely stunning situation that you don't see these proxies coming to their defense, [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6t3GMTHKVC0&t=659.76s)]
*  that you don't see Russia coming to their defense. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6t3GMTHKVC0&t=664.4s)]
*  You basically hear it's as quiet as a mouse all around the region as I think most players [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6t3GMTHKVC0&t=667.64s)]
*  feel like they wouldn't be unhappy at all to see this regime fall. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6t3GMTHKVC0&t=673.88s)]
*  General, they talk about a surprise weapon. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6t3GMTHKVC0&t=677.76s)]
*  They keep saying in Iran, you know, oh, wait till you see what we have coming down the [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6t3GMTHKVC0&t=680.9200000000001s)]
*  pipeline in a couple of days. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6t3GMTHKVC0&t=684.6s)]
*  What's your reaction to that before we go, sir? [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6t3GMTHKVC0&t=686.28s)]
*  I have no idea what they're talking about. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6t3GMTHKVC0&t=690.6800000000001s)]
*  It's just and I'm not the least bit intimidated by it and I don't think the Israelis are [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6t3GMTHKVC0&t=693.56s)]
*  certainly on the United States government. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6t3GMTHKVC0&t=699.0799999999999s)]
*  But the point that you just made is crucial. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6t3GMTHKVC0&t=702.0799999999999s)]
*  They created Hezbollah as a military force and a terrorist organization. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6t3GMTHKVC0&t=704.68s)]
*  They armed it to the teeth. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6t3GMTHKVC0&t=709.8s)]
*  They provided 150,000 rockets and missiles. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6t3GMTHKVC0&t=711.1199999999999s)]
*  The principal reason, job one for Hezbollah was to defend Iran from Israel in the event [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6t3GMTHKVC0&t=715.88s)]
*  of a war. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6t3GMTHKVC0&t=721.5999999999999s)]
*  Hezbollah has not fired a single shot, but they have thousands of weapons still. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6t3GMTHKVC0&t=723.28s)]
*  Why aren't they doing that? [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6t3GMTHKVC0&t=729.24s)]
*  They decapitated their leadership. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6t3GMTHKVC0&t=730.8399999999999s)]
*  Israel has broken their will right in front of us. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6t3GMTHKVC0&t=733.68s)]
*  No response whatsoever. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6t3GMTHKVC0&t=737.4s)]
*  That is absolutely amazing achievement that what we have seen. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6t3GMTHKVC0&t=740.24s)]
*  It's extraordinary. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6t3GMTHKVC0&t=745.64s)]
*  Think about this as such a moment of consequence in history that we have been on the brink [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6t3GMTHKVC0&t=746.64s)]
*  of and now it is such an opportunity that exists that I think is felt all around the [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6t3GMTHKVC0&t=753.0s)]
*  region and General, thank you so much. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6t3GMTHKVC0&t=758.68s)]
