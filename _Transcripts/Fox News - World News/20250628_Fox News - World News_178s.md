# Trump reveals a Gaza ceasefire could come within next week
**Fox News - World News:** [June 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xhC4IJ9mpM)
*  Main time now to a Fox News alert. We have brand new satellite images [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xhC4IJ9mpM&t=0.0s)]
*  They're giving us a fresh glimpse into the extent of the damage done by the US strikes carried out on Iran's nuclear facilities [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xhC4IJ9mpM&t=4.5600000000000005s)]
*  And of course it comes as President Trump and Iran's supreme leader continued to engage in a war of wards [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xhC4IJ9mpM&t=11.86s)]
*  Which we just talked about a little bit there Greg Palcott is live in Tel Aviv with the latest. Hey Greg [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xhC4IJ9mpM&t=17.82s)]
*  Hey folks, yeah, there is no stronger sign of the damage done in the 12-day Israeli-Iran war than what is seen at this very moment on the streets of Tehran [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xhC4IJ9mpM&t=23.48s)]
*  Some 60 coffins draped with Iranian flags carried by trucks said to contain top military, nuclear and missile officials killed in the war [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xhC4IJ9mpM&t=36.480000000000004s)]
*  A lot of the regime leadership set out for all to see the well-orchestrated crowds chanting death to America and death to Israel [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xhC4IJ9mpM&t=47.63999999999999s)]
*  It's the first time since the ceasefire earlier this week the victims had been shown [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xhC4IJ9mpM&t=55.64s)]
*  As the war words rages between Ayatollah Khamenei and President Trump [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xhC4IJ9mpM&t=60.64s)]
*  Khamenei deciding that Iran had won the war and that the failed Iranian attack on that US base was a success [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xhC4IJ9mpM&t=66.14s)]
*  Trump saying he could have killed the Iranian leader and didn't nixing any near term talk between these two countries [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xhC4IJ9mpM&t=74.3s)]
*  Iran seemingly not losing any time on the ground satellite photos, new ones of the Fordo nuclear plant blasted by the US and Israel [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xhC4IJ9mpM&t=83.3s)]
*  Show signs of Iranian workers trying to clear the blocked access roads and fill in the craters [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xhC4IJ9mpM&t=93.3s)]
*  According to most intelligence folks right now, that complex took a real hit [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xhC4IJ9mpM&t=100.46s)]
*  Meanwhile, as the war in Gaza continues between Israel and Hamas leaving heavy casualties on both sides [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xhC4IJ9mpM&t=106.46s)]
*  This as President Trump is now talking about new talks involving the two sides there [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xhC4IJ9mpM&t=115.46s)]
*  Claiming a ceasefire could be achieved in the coming week [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xhC4IJ9mpM&t=122.46s)]
*  The hope is that the momentum from the Israel-Iran war might transfer over, might provide some momentum [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xhC4IJ9mpM&t=126.61999999999999s)]
*  And finally guys, the families of some of the 50 Israelis and dual nationals still held hostage by Hamas in Gaza [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xhC4IJ9mpM&t=134.62s)]
*  Met with Secretary of State Rubio in Washington yesterday [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xhC4IJ9mpM&t=143.62s)]
*  He has said he too wants to get involved in trying to resolve the situation, trying to free the hostage [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xhC4IJ9mpM&t=149.78s)]
*  Even after that massive war over in Iran, there is a huge amount of unfinished business in this region [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xhC4IJ9mpM&t=158.78s)]
*  Back to you guys [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xhC4IJ9mpM&t=166.78s)]
