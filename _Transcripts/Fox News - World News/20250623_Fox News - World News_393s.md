# Iranians wave 'Down with USA' flags in streets of Tehran
**Fox News - World News:** [June 23, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY70VXCk4So)
*  Iranians chanting death to America and waving down with the USA flags taking over the streets [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY70VXCk4So&t=0.0s)]
*  of Tehran after Operation Midnight Hammer. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY70VXCk4So&t=8.16s)]
*  Iran's president even seen at one of these protests condemning US strikes on Iran's nuclear [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY70VXCk4So&t=11.08s)]
*  sites. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY70VXCk4So&t=16.56s)]
*  Deputy Director of the US Office of the National Council of Resistance of Iran, Ali Reza Jafr [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY70VXCk4So&t=17.56s)]
*  Sarday joins me now. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY70VXCk4So&t=22.84s)]
*  Ali Reza, great to see you as always. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY70VXCk4So&t=24.2s)]
*  These protesters are what the regime in Iran wants us to see. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY70VXCk4So&t=25.96s)]
*  But what are you hearing from your sources as to how the majority of Iranians actually [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY70VXCk4So&t=30.400000000000002s)]
*  view these strikes? [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY70VXCk4So&t=35.36s)]
*  Well, certainly Todd, this is the most the regime could do, just line up their own forces [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY70VXCk4So&t=37.36s)]
*  into the streets. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY70VXCk4So&t=45.56s)]
*  And remember, for the past 44 years, the Ayatollahs have been doing these kind of rallies chanting [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY70VXCk4So&t=46.56s)]
*  death to America, death to Israel, death to the MEK, which is the main opposition movement [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY70VXCk4So&t=53.92s)]
*  in Iran that is actually responsible for exposing much of the nuclear sites in Iran. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY70VXCk4So&t=60.480000000000004s)]
*  That's where they're concerned. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY70VXCk4So&t=66.44s)]
*  The regime is so is benefiting at this time because they're, you know, everyone is so [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY70VXCk4So&t=68.64s)]
*  focused on the situation of the war and everything, but they know once the war ends, the population [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY70VXCk4So&t=75.04s)]
*  have rejected this regime over the years. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY70VXCk4So&t=82.32s)]
*  The Mullahs benefited from the policy of appeasement that, you know, when we expose these nuclear [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY70VXCk4So&t=85.76s)]
*  sites in Natanz, in Fardow, in so many other sites, the world had a chance to stop them. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY70VXCk4So&t=91.4s)]
*  They didn't. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY70VXCk4So&t=97.32s)]
*  They gave them concessions. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY70VXCk4So&t=98.32s)]
*  They gave them money. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY70VXCk4So&t=99.32s)]
*  They legitimized the whole program. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY70VXCk4So&t=100.32s)]
*  Now that era is over. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY70VXCk4So&t=102.2s)]
*  The regime is facing a very important existential threat, and that's the people of Iran. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY70VXCk4So&t=104.52s)]
*  Remember, there have been several rounds of major uprisings in Iran since 2018, people [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY70VXCk4So&t=110.67999999999999s)]
*  chanting death to the dictator, death to the oppressor, being the Shah or the supreme leader. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY70VXCk4So&t=116.56s)]
*  That's where the real threat is. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY70VXCk4So&t=123.08s)]
*  And that's why our leader, Mrs. Maryam Rajavi, she right after the strikes, she said, now [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY70VXCk4So&t=124.5s)]
*  is the time for Khamenei to go. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY70VXCk4So&t=130.26s)]
*  Now is the time for the opportunity, neither, you know, concessions or appeasement, nor [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY70VXCk4So&t=133.12s)]
*  war. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY70VXCk4So&t=139.92000000000002s)]
*  Now is the time for standing on the side of the people of Iran to end the rule of the [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY70VXCk4So&t=140.92000000000002s)]
*  clerics, standing on the side of those resistance units who are confronting the Revolutionary [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY70VXCk4So&t=145.84s)]
*  Guard. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY70VXCk4So&t=151.12s)]
*  So that begs the question, does it happen? [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY70VXCk4So&t=152.12s)]
*  What ultimately comes next? [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY70VXCk4So&t=154.28s)]
*  While Secretary Hegsav said in that press conference yesterday that this strike was [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY70VXCk4So&t=155.96s)]
*  not about regime change, President Trump really did leave the door open in this Truth Social [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY70VXCk4So&t=160.96s)]
*  Post yesterday. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY70VXCk4So&t=167.12s)]
*  Quote, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY70VXCk4So&t=168.12s)]
*  And then he writes, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY70VXCk4So&t=181.12s)]
*  Do you expect it to happen ultimately now following these strikes? [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY70VXCk4So&t=191.24s)]
*  Well, certainly the position that President Trump has taken and the U.S. administration [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY70VXCk4So&t=197.24s)]
*  is prudent because no one is asking the United States to do the fighting for the people of [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY70VXCk4So&t=204.24s)]
*  Iran or the Western nations the same way. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY70VXCk4So&t=209.60000000000002s)]
*  There is no need for boots on the ground or appropriation of money. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY70VXCk4So&t=213.64000000000001s)]
*  Unfortunately, the policy in the past 30 years has been exactly the opposite, giving [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY70VXCk4So&t=219.07999999999998s)]
*  pallets of cash to the mullahs, legitimizing the regime, neglecting or rejecting the people. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY70VXCk4So&t=224.2s)]
*  Now the situation has turned. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY70VXCk4So&t=231.51999999999998s)]
*  It's a great opportunity for the outside world to see the realities, as President Trump said, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY70VXCk4So&t=234.68s)]
*  that it's upon the people of Iran to bring down the mullahs. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY70VXCk4So&t=240.2s)]
*  And let me tell you, you know, there's not going to be chaos after the fall of the Ayatollahs. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY70VXCk4So&t=243.67999999999998s)]
*  You know, Mrs. Mariam Rajavi has introduced a 10-point platform for the future of Iran [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY70VXCk4So&t=249.16s)]
*  based on separation of religion and state, gender equality, peace in the Middle East [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY70VXCk4So&t=253.88s)]
*  and a non-nuclear republic form of government. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY70VXCk4So&t=258.24s)]
*  She has defined a transitional period that after the fall of the Ayatollahs, within six [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY70VXCk4So&t=261.36s)]
*  months there's going to be free and fair elections leading to the formation of a national and [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY70VXCk4So&t=265.88s)]
*  constituent assembly, and it will be the representatives of the people of Iran who will determine the [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY70VXCk4So&t=270.72s)]
*  future of the course. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY70VXCk4So&t=275.8s)]
*  So everything is very clear. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY70VXCk4So&t=277.68s)]
*  One thing is well known now is that the mullahs must go. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY70VXCk4So&t=280.36s)]
*  All the indications are there. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY70VXCk4So&t=283.84000000000003s)]
*  The regime relied heavily on the nuclear weapons program to stay in power. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY70VXCk4So&t=285.12s)]
*  They spent $2 trillion on that. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY70VXCk4So&t=289.44s)]
*  They spent money on the proxies. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY70VXCk4So&t=291.4s)]
*  All of that is now gone. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY70VXCk4So&t=293.6s)]
*  Now is the opportunity for change. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY70VXCk4So&t=295.28000000000003s)]
*  We will be watching. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY70VXCk4So&t=296.84s)]
*  And the fact that you mention a woman possibly taking charge in the Middle East, in Iran, [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY70VXCk4So&t=297.84s)]
*  of all places, is absolutely shocking. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY70VXCk4So&t=303.44s)]
*  Before we let you go, about three hours ago the Iranian deputy foreign minister said, [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY70VXCk4So&t=306.52s)]
*  quote, we will continue uranium enrichment. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY70VXCk4So&t=310.71999999999997s)]
*  No one can tell us what to do. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY70VXCk4So&t=313.52s)]
*  Sounding like my five-year-old. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY70VXCk4So&t=315.91999999999996s)]
*  Can the regime back up that bluster? [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY70VXCk4So&t=317.85999999999996s)]
*  Well, you know, they could—that's their modus operandi for the past four decades. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY70VXCk4So&t=321.76s)]
*  They just make statements and, you know, rhetoric, but the reality on the ground is so different. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY70VXCk4So&t=329.76s)]
*  Remember, this regime is not the same regime that was two years ago, three years ago, five [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY70VXCk4So&t=335.15999999999997s)]
*  years ago. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY70VXCk4So&t=339.4s)]
*  They lost much of their clout in the whole region. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY70VXCk4So&t=340.4s)]
*  Their biggest ally, Assad is gone. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY70VXCk4So&t=342.56s)]
*  Hezbollah, Houthis, the Shia militias, they have been badly shattered. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY70VXCk4So&t=344.44s)]
*  The people of Iran are against them. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY70VXCk4So&t=348.6s)]
*  They lost the nuclear weapons program, which was meant to guarantee the survival of the [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY70VXCk4So&t=350.92s)]
*  regime. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY70VXCk4So&t=356.96000000000004s)]
*  All of that is gone. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY70VXCk4So&t=358.12s)]
*  So they can talk as much as they want until the last day that they fall. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY70VXCk4So&t=359.8s)]
*  This is the policy of all of the dictators. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY70VXCk4So&t=364.0s)]
*  They seem to be and talk the way that they are invincible until they fall. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY70VXCk4So&t=367.48s)]
*  Ali Reza, Jaffa Zardig, a true expert in all issues Iranian. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY70VXCk4So&t=372.28000000000003s)]
*  We appreciate you lending us your insight this morning. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY70VXCk4So&t=376.78s)]
