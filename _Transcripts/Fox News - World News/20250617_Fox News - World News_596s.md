# A 'CRITICAL QUESTION’ faces Trump, Israel
**Fox News - World News:** [June 17, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFhgutuyt5c)
*  Now, less than 24 hours after Donald Trump warned everyone to evacuate Tehran, wow, Donald [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFhgutuyt5c&t=0.0s)]
*  Trump puts out this on social media. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFhgutuyt5c&t=7.28s)]
*  The highways out of Iran's capital were absolutely positively packed with cars. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFhgutuyt5c&t=10.36s)]
*  Millions appear to be listening to Donald Trump and taking the president's words rightly [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFhgutuyt5c&t=17.56s)]
*  very seriously. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFhgutuyt5c&t=23.16s)]
*  Unfortunately, over the past two months, the mullahs of Iran, they failed to do the same. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFhgutuyt5c&t=24.6s)]
*  As the president put it, quote, Iran should have signed the deal. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFhgutuyt5c&t=29.159999999999997s)]
*  I told them to sign. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFhgutuyt5c&t=32.68s)]
*  What a shame. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFhgutuyt5c&t=34.28s)]
*  A waste of human life. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFhgutuyt5c&t=35.28s)]
*  Simply stated, Iran can not have a nuclear weapon, unquote. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFhgutuyt5c&t=36.28s)]
*  That is the Trump doctrine, for those of you that don't understand. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFhgutuyt5c&t=42.0s)]
*  It is common sense. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFhgutuyt5c&t=45.8s)]
*  Big part of the Trump platform. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFhgutuyt5c&t=47.64s)]
*  You would say it over and over again. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFhgutuyt5c&t=49.519999999999996s)]
*  Our platform is that of common sense. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFhgutuyt5c&t=51.239999999999995s)]
*  The number one state sponsor of terrorism that has threatened to wipe Israel and the [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFhgutuyt5c&t=53.84s)]
*  United States off the map repeatedly and fired, you know, either themselves or through their [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFhgutuyt5c&t=58.04s)]
*  proxies. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFhgutuyt5c&t=64.12s)]
*  What are hundreds of thousands of rockets over the years at this small country? [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFhgutuyt5c&t=65.12s)]
*  This is something the president has emphasized over and over again. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFhgutuyt5c&t=69.48s)]
*  He has done it over the years. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFhgutuyt5c&t=73.6s)]
*  Look at your screen and watch. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFhgutuyt5c&t=75.32s)]
*  Believe me, Iran will never have a nuclear weapon that I can tell you. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFhgutuyt5c&t=77.12s)]
*  Most importantly, the United States and Israel can declare with one voice that Iran must [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFhgutuyt5c&t=84.12s)]
*  never be allowed to possess a nuclear weapon. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFhgutuyt5c&t=90.24000000000001s)]
*  Never ever. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFhgutuyt5c&t=92.80000000000001s)]
*  We affirm that Iran must never be allowed to obtain, under any circumstances, a nuclear [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFhgutuyt5c&t=93.92s)]
*  weapon. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFhgutuyt5c&t=100.44s)]
*  In order to ensure the other big move, the Iranian regime never obtains nuclear weapons. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFhgutuyt5c&t=101.44000000000001s)]
*  A regime with this track record must never be allowed to possess a nuclear weapon. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFhgutuyt5c&t=110.28s)]
*  Iran will never have a nuclear weapon. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFhgutuyt5c&t=116.24s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFhgutuyt5c&t=118.36s)]
*  Now take a look at your screen. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFhgutuyt5c&t=119.92s)]
*  The president, look at this. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFhgutuyt5c&t=121.08s)]
*  He has been saying these exact words going back to 2011, steady, firm and consistent. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFhgutuyt5c&t=122.56s)]
*  And tonight, the American people overwhelmingly agree the country's most accurate pollsters, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFhgutuyt5c&t=129.35999999999999s)]
*  that would be Trafalgar, Insider Advantage. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFhgutuyt5c&t=135.0s)]
*  They nailed the 2016, 2020, 2024 presidential elections. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFhgutuyt5c&t=137.56s)]
*  They posed the following question, and it is right to the heart of the issue here. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFhgutuyt5c&t=142.20000000000002s)]
*  What is your opinion of President Trump's position that Iran must be prevented from [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFhgutuyt5c&t=147.56s)]
*  developing a nuclear weapon, adding, by any means necessary, take a look at your screen, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFhgutuyt5c&t=153.3s)]
*  a whopping 75% of the American people agree with the president. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFhgutuyt5c&t=160.16000000000003s)]
*  And according to a Harvard-Harris poll, 85% of voters say Iran should not be allowed to [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFhgutuyt5c&t=165.4s)]
*  obtain a nuclear weapon. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFhgutuyt5c&t=170.84s)]
*  A majority of voters also want the president to take out Iran's nuclear program with [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFhgutuyt5c&t=172.56s)]
*  a military operation. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFhgutuyt5c&t=177.84s)]
*  And another poll, well, from Insider Advantage, has the president's approval rating above [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFhgutuyt5c&t=179.68s)]
*  water, 10 points above water, outpacing past two-term presidents by far. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFhgutuyt5c&t=184.96s)]
*  Now, this brings us to a critical question at this hour. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFhgutuyt5c&t=190.07999999999998s)]
*  Iran has successfully now targeted two of the three most major Iranian nuclear facilities. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFhgutuyt5c&t=194.51999999999998s)]
*  The third location, the Fordow enrichment plant that Jennifer Griffin was talking about, [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFhgutuyt5c&t=200.48s)]
*  is buried deep under a mountain. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFhgutuyt5c&t=205.79999999999998s)]
*  This is south of Tehran. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFhgutuyt5c&t=208.48s)]
*  This is believed to be the most significant and secretive nuclear facility inside of Iran. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFhgutuyt5c&t=210.04s)]
*  In order to prevent the mullahs from getting a nuclear weapon, this facility must be destroyed. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFhgutuyt5c&t=215.67999999999998s)]
*  The way I see it, there are three options. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFhgutuyt5c&t=222.12s)]
*  One, Israel could use a tactical nuclear weapon to wipe out the site. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFhgutuyt5c&t=224.44s)]
*  They don't have bunker buster bombs. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFhgutuyt5c&t=229.76s)]
*  That would obviously be not only highly controversial, but come with massive risks to the region. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFhgutuyt5c&t=232.0s)]
*  It is not a good option. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFhgutuyt5c&t=238.24s)]
*  Option number two, Israel can send in a team of commandos on the ground. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFhgutuyt5c&t=240.48s)]
*  Also, very risky, with a much lower chance of success. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFhgutuyt5c&t=244.6s)]
*  The third best option involves the United States of America, our military, which is [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFhgutuyt5c&t=248.96s)]
*  equipped with these 30,000-pound bunker buster bombs capable of penetrating that mountain. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFhgutuyt5c&t=254.32000000000002s)]
*  Israel does not have this critical weapon in its arsenal, and they do not possess the [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFhgutuyt5c&t=260.96000000000004s)]
*  large bombers that are capable of dropping an ordinance of that size. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFhgutuyt5c&t=265.38s)]
*  So now President Trump has a decision to make. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFhgutuyt5c&t=270.24s)]
*  Will he deliver the final blow to Iran's nuclear program? [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFhgutuyt5c&t=273.8s)]
*  Will he rid the world of this clear and present danger and this existential threat? [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFhgutuyt5c&t=277.52s)]
*  Will he end Iran's threat of nuclear terror once and for all, and make the world a safer [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFhgutuyt5c&t=282.88s)]
*  place for generations to come? [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFhgutuyt5c&t=287.84s)]
*  This is not an easy decision for anybody. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFhgutuyt5c&t=290.38s)]
*  And let me be clear, it is not without its own risks. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFhgutuyt5c&t=292.76s)]
*  But ask yourself these questions. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFhgutuyt5c&t=296.08s)]
*  Would the world be better off without the world's number one state sponsor of terror [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFhgutuyt5c&t=298.44s)]
*  that has fired hundreds of thousands of missiles into Israel, either by themselves or through [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFhgutuyt5c&t=303.6s)]
*  their proxies? [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFhgutuyt5c&t=309.32000000000005s)]
*  Should they have nuclear weapons? [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFhgutuyt5c&t=311.64000000000004s)]
*  Do the people of Israel and the rest of the region deserve a chance to live in peace without [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFhgutuyt5c&t=313.3s)]
*  the threat of a nuclear armed Iran? [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFhgutuyt5c&t=319.8s)]
*  They would hold the world hostage. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFhgutuyt5c&t=322.16s)]
*  How many rockets, ask yourself, launched into our country, a small town, a big city, in [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFhgutuyt5c&t=323.84000000000003s)]
*  the United States, how many missiles would it take for you to demand that your country [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFhgutuyt5c&t=329.72s)]
*  fight back? [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFhgutuyt5c&t=335.56s)]
*  And again, this isn't just about Israel. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFhgutuyt5c&t=336.56s)]
*  All of Israel's neighbors in the Arab world, they want Iran's nuclear program dismantled. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFhgutuyt5c&t=339.8s)]
*  Nobody's speaking out on behalf of Iran. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFhgutuyt5c&t=346.04s)]
*  This is also about the United States. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFhgutuyt5c&t=348.52000000000004s)]
*  The Islamic Republic of Iran doesn't just threaten Israel. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFhgutuyt5c&t=350.76000000000005s)]
*  They have vowed to destroy our country, kill our people. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFhgutuyt5c&t=354.20000000000005s)]
*  Let's go back to your screen. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFhgutuyt5c&t=358.28s)]
*  The threats and acts of violence have been nonstop since the Iranian Revolution. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFhgutuyt5c&t=359.76s)]
*  That was in 1979. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFhgutuyt5c&t=364.4s)]
*  Jimmy Carter was president. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFhgutuyt5c&t=365.91999999999996s)]
*  Remember, Iran's extremists under the Ayatollah Khomeini. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFhgutuyt5c&t=367.71999999999997s)]
*  Their regime seized America's embassy in Tehran. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFhgutuyt5c&t=371.64s)]
*  They took 66 American hostages, 444 days. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFhgutuyt5c&t=374.85999999999996s)]
*  Iran was also behind the 1983 Beirut bombing of a Marine Corps barracks. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFhgutuyt5c&t=379.32s)]
*  A suicide bombing at America's embassy in Beirut that killed 17 Americans, also directed [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFhgutuyt5c&t=385.72s)]
*  by Iran. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFhgutuyt5c&t=393.0s)]
*  The mullahs were also behind the attack of the Qobar Towers, killing another 17 American [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFhgutuyt5c&t=394.08000000000004s)]
*  troops. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFhgutuyt5c&t=399.52000000000004s)]
*  Shia militias, backed by Iran, have also been responsible for countless deadly terror attacks [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFhgutuyt5c&t=400.52000000000004s)]
*  against the U.S. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFhgutuyt5c&t=406.20000000000005s)]
*  In Iraq, Iran also launched a massive missile attack on U.S. bases in Iraq in 2020, injuring [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFhgutuyt5c&t=407.91999999999996s)]
*  over 100 American servicemen and women. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFhgutuyt5c&t=415.32s)]
*  There were also, reportedly, multiple attempts by Iran to assassinate President Trump. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFhgutuyt5c&t=418.28s)]
*  Remember, we've talked a lot about Iranian assassination squads, thanks to Joe Biden, [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFhgutuyt5c&t=423.71999999999997s)]
*  Kamala Harris, Mayorkas, complicit media and complicit Democrats that told us the border [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFhgutuyt5c&t=428.91999999999996s)]
*  was closed and secure and lied to us. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFhgutuyt5c&t=434.03999999999996s)]
*  Anyway, by the Supreme Leader threatening all-out war against the United States, this [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFhgutuyt5c&t=436.44s)]
*  year, two years ago, Iran vowing that the U.S. would suffer heavy losses. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFhgutuyt5c&t=442.23999999999995s)]
*  Iran's naval commander threatened to sink U.S. ships in the Gulf. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFhgutuyt5c&t=448.35999999999996s)]
*  In 2022, Iran declared that it can use nuclear missiles to turn New York into hellish ruins. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFhgutuyt5c&t=452.4s)]
*  And of course, the unofficial motto of Iran, death to Israel, death to America. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFhgutuyt5c&t=459.52s)]
*  And by the way, this is just the tip of the iceberg. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFhgutuyt5c&t=464.44s)]
*  There is a new threat issued almost every day. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFhgutuyt5c&t=467.56s)]
*  Do you really want a country like that in possession of a nuclear weapon, or would the [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFhgutuyt5c&t=471.03999999999996s)]
