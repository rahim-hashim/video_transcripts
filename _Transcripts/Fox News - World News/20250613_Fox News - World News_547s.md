# US should be ready for 'anything' after Israel's attack: Dan Hoffman
**Fox News - World News:** [June 13, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxNA5PL6aJM)
*  President Trump urging Tehran to negotiate a nuclear deal, quote, before there is nothing [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxNA5PL6aJM&t=0.0s)]
*  left. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxNA5PL6aJM&t=5.8s)]
*  This after Israel strikes on Iran's missile and nuclear sites. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxNA5PL6aJM&t=6.8s)]
*  Let's bring in Michael Orrin. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxNA5PL6aJM&t=9.6s)]
*  He's a former Israeli ambassador to the United States. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxNA5PL6aJM&t=10.6s)]
*  He wrote in the Free Press yesterday, and here you are with us today. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxNA5PL6aJM&t=13.16s)]
*  And overnight this action happened. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxNA5PL6aJM&t=16.28s)]
*  So I understand it had been planned for a long time. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxNA5PL6aJM&t=17.68s)]
*  And as you said, Iran has long passed the red line that was drawn by Netanyahu before [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxNA5PL6aJM&t=20.32s)]
*  the United Nations in terms of enrichment. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxNA5PL6aJM&t=26.0s)]
*  And they felt that this was the time they had to go in. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxNA5PL6aJM&t=28.28s)]
*  How close were they, the Iranians, and maybe they still are, to having a nuclear weapon [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxNA5PL6aJM&t=30.080000000000002s)]
*  and that enrichment that they needed? [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxNA5PL6aJM&t=36.68s)]
*  Well, good to be with you, Dana and Bill. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxNA5PL6aJM&t=38.400000000000006s)]
*  Iran was on the verge of becoming a nuclear power. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxNA5PL6aJM&t=41.44s)]
*  And this is a regime that swears weekly, if not daily, to destroy our state, the Jewish [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxNA5PL6aJM&t=43.32s)]
*  state, has empowered and equipped proxies, Hamas, Hezbollah, the Houthis, with tens of [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxNA5PL6aJM&t=48.68000000000001s)]
*  thousands of rockets to do just that, destroy us. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxNA5PL6aJM&t=56.4s)]
*  And so Israel saw Iran's ability to make a nuclear weapon within a matter of days as [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxNA5PL6aJM&t=58.76s)]
*  an existential threat. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxNA5PL6aJM&t=63.92s)]
*  And at the end of the day, for Israeli leaders, it was a no-brainer. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxNA5PL6aJM&t=65.52s)]
*  There was really no choice but to go ahead and do this and do it in a way that would [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxNA5PL6aJM&t=68.68s)]
*  be a knockout punch. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxNA5PL6aJM&t=72.26s)]
*  I'm a certain generation that remembers the end of Godfather I where the heads of the [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxNA5PL6aJM&t=73.96000000000001s)]
*  five families are knocked off. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxNA5PL6aJM&t=78.72s)]
*  Well, Israel yesterday, last night, eliminated the military leadership of Iran, including [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxNA5PL6aJM&t=80.56s)]
*  nuclear scientists who had the know-how to make these bombs. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxNA5PL6aJM&t=86.0s)]
*  In addition to eliminating Iran's nuclear facilities, certainly in the Tans, one of [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxNA5PL6aJM&t=89.2s)]
*  them is a major enrichment facility, perhaps with other facilities as well. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxNA5PL6aJM&t=95.2s)]
*  And I think most significantly, Iran's ability to pummel Israel with ballistic missiles. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxNA5PL6aJM&t=99.12s)]
*  It has about 2,000 missiles that pack warheads of about 2,000 tons of TNT. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxNA5PL6aJM&t=104.6s)]
*  It can take down not just a building but a neighbor. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxNA5PL6aJM&t=109.56s)]
*  And we were ordered into our safe rooms, our bomb shelters, last night around 2 o'clock [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxNA5PL6aJM&t=115.08s)]
*  in the morning. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxNA5PL6aJM&t=119.0s)]
*  But a couple hours ago, the Army said, get out of your safe rooms and you can look out [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxNA5PL6aJM&t=120.0s)]
*  my window. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxNA5PL6aJM&t=122.84s)]
*  I'm near the sea here and everyone's on the beach. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxNA5PL6aJM&t=123.84s)]
*  And I think that's a very, very significant development. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxNA5PL6aJM&t=125.76s)]
*  Well, Michael, on that note, there are reports about air raid sirens in northern Israel. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxNA5PL6aJM&t=127.68s)]
*  That would seem to indicate, if that's the case, that that area would come under attack [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxNA5PL6aJM&t=133.84s)]
*  from possibly rockets or missiles fired from southern Lebanon on behalf of Hezbollah. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxNA5PL6aJM&t=138.82s)]
*  We have not confirmed that. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxNA5PL6aJM&t=143.66s)]
*  We're just reading the alerts we're getting here. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxNA5PL6aJM&t=144.9s)]
*  Have you heard anything from that part of the country? [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxNA5PL6aJM&t=147.73999999999998s)]
*  We have not. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxNA5PL6aJM&t=152.01999999999998s)]
*  And there's been no sirens in Tel Aviv. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxNA5PL6aJM&t=153.01999999999998s)]
*  And certainly, Tel Aviv would be the primary target of any Iranian retaliation, if Iran [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxNA5PL6aJM&t=154.01999999999998s)]
*  could retaliate. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxNA5PL6aJM&t=157.94s)]
*  You mentioned earlier in your broadcast that they launched 100 drone rockets or aircraft [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxNA5PL6aJM&t=159.14s)]
*  at us. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxNA5PL6aJM&t=164.42s)]
*  Iran before they actually exited Iranian territory. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxNA5PL6aJM&t=166.42s)]
*  That is in contrast to the two major missile attacks that Iran launched against us in 2024, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxNA5PL6aJM&t=169.05999999999997s)]
*  which they fired 700 huge ballistic missiles at us. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxNA5PL6aJM&t=173.33999999999997s)]
*  It's a huge downgrading, immense downgrading. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxNA5PL6aJM&t=177.38s)]
*  So we don't know. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxNA5PL6aJM&t=179.5s)]
*  All the prognostications about the Israeli action precipitating a regional war at this [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxNA5PL6aJM&t=180.7s)]
*  point seem grossly overblown. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxNA5PL6aJM&t=186.1s)]
*  Michael Oren, thank you so much. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxNA5PL6aJM&t=187.89999999999998s)]
*  We'll continue to draw upon your expertise as this develops. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxNA5PL6aJM&t=189.7s)]
*  Dan Hoffman joins us now, Fox News contributor, former CIA station chief. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxNA5PL6aJM&t=196.26s)]
*  Dan, good morning to you. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxNA5PL6aJM&t=199.82s)]
*  Let me ask you a question that may be a bit of a fantasy. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxNA5PL6aJM&t=201.29999999999998s)]
*  What if this is all there is on behalf of Iran in a response? [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxNA5PL6aJM&t=205.01999999999998s)]
*  Meaning the leadership is so decapitated, their ability so injured at the moment, that [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxNA5PL6aJM&t=209.98s)]
*  there is not much of a response out of Iran. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxNA5PL6aJM&t=216.77999999999997s)]
*  Is that even a possibility? [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxNA5PL6aJM&t=221.1s)]
*  Well, we're still in early days, Bill, and that is a key question that Prime Minister [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxNA5PL6aJM&t=224.22s)]
*  Netanyahu will be asking his intelligence services and frankly, President Trump will [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxNA5PL6aJM&t=229.22s)]
*  be doing the same thing to the U.S. intelligence community. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxNA5PL6aJM&t=233.06s)]
*  What means does Iran have to retaliate? [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxNA5PL6aJM&t=236.38s)]
*  Look, they've got the proxy terrorists we talked about in the region, but they've also [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxNA5PL6aJM&t=238.7s)]
*  got sleeper agents located in Europe and potentially here in the United States. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxNA5PL6aJM&t=242.86s)]
*  They also hosted the leader of al-Qaeda, Seyfel Adel, who has been making his way between [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxNA5PL6aJM&t=248.46s)]
*  Iran and Afghanistan. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxNA5PL6aJM&t=253.46s)]
*  Iran's links with al-Qaeda are longstanding, and so we have to be prepared for anything. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxNA5PL6aJM&t=255.62s)]
*  And I can tell you that the U.S. intelligence community at this point is on high alert, [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxNA5PL6aJM&t=260.66s)]
*  mounting a full court press, collecting the intelligence that will keep us safe. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxNA5PL6aJM&t=264.74s)]
*  Yeah, I'll ask a question here that I guess was on my mind. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxNA5PL6aJM&t=269.5s)]
*  I'm good at these. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxNA5PL6aJM&t=273.3s)]
*  I think it's a dumb question, but you might not know the answer to it. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxNA5PL6aJM&t=274.3s)]
*  The Israelis were so successful at targeting the top commanders, right? [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxNA5PL6aJM&t=278.46s)]
*  We can put them up on the screen for people here. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxNA5PL6aJM&t=283.5s)]
*  I think it's called for number four. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxNA5PL6aJM&t=285.1s)]
*  You had major military leaders that were killed. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxNA5PL6aJM&t=286.74s)]
*  The leader of the country survived. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxNA5PL6aJM&t=289.22s)]
*  What is the thinking on that in terms of the Ayatollah today? [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxNA5PL6aJM&t=293.66s)]
*  Who is he surrounded with? [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxNA5PL6aJM&t=296.1s)]
*  The number twos. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxNA5PL6aJM&t=297.62s)]
*  But I guess if you're feeling like you're number two right now, you're still not very safe. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxNA5PL6aJM&t=298.62s)]
*  Yeah, I think Israel's goal was to decapitate Iran's military. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxNA5PL6aJM&t=302.98s)]
*  They also killed the national security official who was leading the nuclear negotiations with [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxNA5PL6aJM&t=307.9s)]
*  the United States, Ali Shamkhani. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxNA5PL6aJM&t=312.7s)]
*  The goal here for Israel was to destroy Iran's means of retaliation, but also to create the [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxNA5PL6aJM&t=315.94s)]
*  opportunity for others to be potentially promoted into their place. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxNA5PL6aJM&t=320.41999999999996s)]
*  I think, as President Trump noted, maybe they will be less intransigent, less defiant, less [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxNA5PL6aJM&t=324.41999999999996s)]
*  provocative. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxNA5PL6aJM&t=330.17999999999995s)]
*  But at this point, Israel tried everything they could, so did the United States, to bring [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxNA5PL6aJM&t=331.9s)]
*  a diplomatic resolution and prevent the crisis that is unfolding in the Middle East. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxNA5PL6aJM&t=336.1s)]
*  And I would emphasize at this point as well, look, this is the fog of war, and where we [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxNA5PL6aJM&t=341.62s)]
*  go from here is awfully hard to predict. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxNA5PL6aJM&t=345.54s)]
*  And for sure, U.S., Israeli, and our European allies, all of our intelligence services and [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxNA5PL6aJM&t=348.3s)]
*  militaries on high alert to detect threats way out left of boom before things get bad [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxNA5PL6aJM&t=352.98s)]
*  and then preempt them if needed. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxNA5PL6aJM&t=358.5s)]
*  Iran knows that if they strike U.S. military bases, even with their proxies, that they [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxNA5PL6aJM&t=360.66s)]
*  will face the wrath of our military. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxNA5PL6aJM&t=364.78s)]
*  Yeah, Mike Pompeo mentioned this area called Fordow. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxNA5PL6aJM&t=366.58s)]
*  It's spelled F-O-R-D-O-W. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxNA5PL6aJM&t=369.05999999999995s)]
*  It's southwest of Tehran. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxNA5PL6aJM&t=371.14s)]
*  That is in a mountainside, in a Richmond side dug in about a half mile deep. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxNA5PL6aJM&t=373.14s)]
*  Based on our understanding, the Israeli military, they don't have bunker buster bombs. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxNA5PL6aJM&t=377.46s)]
*  And you wonder, Netanyahu, he has to run the table here, meaning he has to eliminate entirely [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxNA5PL6aJM&t=380.85999999999996s)]
*  the nuclear threat in Iran, or this will not be considered a success. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxNA5PL6aJM&t=389.02s)]
*  And they'll be back at this in a year or two, or at some point beyond that. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxNA5PL6aJM&t=393.86s)]
*  What's your view on that, Dan? [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxNA5PL6aJM&t=398.14s)]
*  No, that's right. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxNA5PL6aJM&t=401.58s)]
*  And Israel, let's remember, historically, Israel eliminated Iraq's nuclear capability [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxNA5PL6aJM&t=402.38s)]
*  in 1981 and Syria's in 2007. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxNA5PL6aJM&t=407.5s)]
*  You're right about Fordow. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxNA5PL6aJM&t=410.82s)]
*  Look, Natanz you can get to through the air. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxNA5PL6aJM&t=411.98s)]
*  Fordow, Israel doesn't have the military capability, but they do have their operatives [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxNA5PL6aJM&t=414.06s)]
*  on the ground. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxNA5PL6aJM&t=419.38s)]
*  And so the question is whether they're getting at Fordow in some other way. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxNA5PL6aJM&t=420.3s)]
*  And we'll have to wait in the coming days, perhaps, to gain some updates on the extent [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxNA5PL6aJM&t=424.38s)]
*  to which Israel was able to target Fordow. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxNA5PL6aJM&t=431.66s)]
*  But that's a key part of Iran's nuclear uranium enrichment, and it's one that Israel would [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxNA5PL6aJM&t=433.58s)]
*  definitely consider a high priority to strike. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxNA5PL6aJM&t=439.98s)]
*  I wonder, from an intelligent perspective, which is your expertise, and you think about [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxNA5PL6aJM&t=443.1s)]
*  the Israelis thinking about this operation, maybe going back to 2008, as the Iranians [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxNA5PL6aJM&t=447.41999999999996s)]
*  were trying to get this nuclear weapon, on a scale and a scope that is quite historic, [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxNA5PL6aJM&t=453.82s)]
*  what do you think about their capabilities? [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxNA5PL6aJM&t=459.9s)]
*  It does seem quite incredible. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxNA5PL6aJM&t=461.41999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, I always felt in all the times that I've worked with the Israelis back when I served [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxNA5PL6aJM&t=465.17999999999995s)]
*  as the director of the CIA's Near East Division that Israel just simply wouldn't exist if [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxNA5PL6aJM&t=469.82s)]
*  they didn't have this extraordinary intelligence capability, not only to detect threats, but [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxNA5PL6aJM&t=476.06s)]
*  to conduct these sorts of offensive operations. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxNA5PL6aJM&t=481.18s)]
*  And we've seen the results of many of them, including that Pager operation against Hezbollah [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxNA5PL6aJM&t=483.42s)]
*  operatives in Lebanon, and the ability that Israel has had with pinpoint precision to [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxNA5PL6aJM&t=488.7s)]
*  strike at leaders of Iran's proxy terrorists, including inside Iran. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxNA5PL6aJM&t=494.3s)]
*  Remember, they took out Ismail Hania in Tehran. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxNA5PL6aJM&t=500.14s)]
*  So they have this ability to fuse their military operations with intelligence collection [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxNA5PL6aJM&t=504.06s)]
*  in extraordinary ways in the region and beyond. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxNA5PL6aJM&t=510.94s)]
*  And I think that's exactly what they're doing right now. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxNA5PL6aJM&t=514.78s)]
*  And a lot of it we're not going to see, except for the results when there are dead Iranian [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxNA5PL6aJM&t=517.02s)]
*  senior military officials or Iranian nuclear facilities that have been blown up. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxNA5PL6aJM&t=522.3s)]
*  Much more to come today. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxNA5PL6aJM&t=529.34s)]
*  We'll watch it by the hour. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxNA5PL6aJM&t=531.42s)]
*  Dan Hoffman, thank you. Don't go far. We really appreciate your analysis. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxNA5PL6aJM&t=532.54s)]
