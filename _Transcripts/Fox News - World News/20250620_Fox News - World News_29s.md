# Trump on Middle-East negotiations: 'We'll see what happens' #shorts #politicsÂ #trump
**Fox News - World News:** [June 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_5zvvKaSqY)
*  The Iranian Foreign Minister this afternoon said if the US is serious about negotiations, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_5zvvKaSqY&t=0.0s)]
*  that you would call up Israel and request that they stop their airstrikes. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_5zvvKaSqY&t=7.04s)]
*  Will you make that request? [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_5zvvKaSqY&t=10.88s)]
*  Well, I think it's very hard to make that request right now. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_5zvvKaSqY&t=12.4s)]
*  If somebody's winning, it's a little bit harder to do than if somebody's losing. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_5zvvKaSqY&t=15.040000000000001s)]
*  But we're ready, willing and able, and we've been speaking to Iran, and we'll see what happens. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_5zvvKaSqY&t=20.080000000000002s)]
*  We'll see what happens. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_5zvvKaSqY&t=25.28s)]
