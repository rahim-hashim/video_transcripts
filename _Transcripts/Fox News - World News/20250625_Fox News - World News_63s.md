**Fox News - World News:** [June 25, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOOfmQfQLk8)
*  Mark Rutter, the NATO chief who is your friend, he called you daddy earlier. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOOfmQfQLk8&t=0.0s)]
*  Do you regard your NATO allies as kind of children? [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOOfmQfQLk8&t=7.88s)]
*  No, he likes me. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOOfmQfQLk8&t=11.76s)]
*  I think he likes me. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOOfmQfQLk8&t=12.76s)]
*  If he doesn't, I'll let you know. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOOfmQfQLk8&t=13.76s)]
*  I'll come back and I'll hit him hard, OK? [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOOfmQfQLk8&t=15.44s)]
*  He did. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOOfmQfQLk8&t=17.36s)]
*  He did it very affectionately. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOOfmQfQLk8&t=18.36s)]
*  Daddy, you're my daddy. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOOfmQfQLk8&t=19.36s)]
*  Do you regard your NATO allies, though, as kind of like children? [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOOfmQfQLk8&t=21.2s)]
*  And they're obviously listening to you and they're spending more. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOOfmQfQLk8&t=24.6s)]
*  And you're obviously appreciative of that. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOOfmQfQLk8&t=27.64s)]
*  But do you hope that actually they're going to be able to defend themselves, defend Europe [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOOfmQfQLk8&t=30.560000000000002s)]
*  on their own without being... [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOOfmQfQLk8&t=35.92s)]
*  I think they need help a little bit at the beginning and I think they'll be able to. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOOfmQfQLk8&t=37.400000000000006s)]
*  And I think they're going to remember this day. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOOfmQfQLk8&t=40.760000000000005s)]
*  And this was a big day for NATO. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOOfmQfQLk8&t=43.160000000000004s)]
*  This was a very big day. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOOfmQfQLk8&t=44.8s)]
*  They took it. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOOfmQfQLk8&t=45.8s)]
*  One of the gentlemen said, you know what, we've been trying to raise money for, raise [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOOfmQfQLk8&t=46.88s)]
*  the rate for 30 years, he said, 20 years from almost the beginning. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOOfmQfQLk8&t=50.32s)]
*  And he's been there for a long time. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOOfmQfQLk8&t=56.24s)]
*  And he said, until you came along, it never happened. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOOfmQfQLk8&t=57.48s)]
