*  Heroic thing that any American president has ever done in the Middle East. He showed the Iranian regime [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hg5KLkXjcHM&t=58.28s)]
*  You cannot chart death to America [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hg5KLkXjcHM&t=65.36s)]

*  But Israel is also going after Iran's ballistic missiles [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hg5KLkXjcHM&t=130.72s)]
*  The Iranian regime was building one ballistic missile for every square kilometer in Israel [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hg5KLkXjcHM&t=134.79999999999998s)]

*  So Israel is now hoping that it can continue taking out Iran ballistic missile launchers [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hg5KLkXjcHM&t=155.79999999999998s)]

*  Hoping the Iranians take President Trump's ultimatum [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hg5KLkXjcHM&t=167.24s)]
*  Now is the time to make peace this needs to be the finale of the regional war [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hg5KLkXjcHM&t=171.12s)]
