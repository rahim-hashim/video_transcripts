# Iran could pull out of planned talks with US: Report
**Fox News - World News:** [June 13, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUO_EEn7O2A)
*  All right, I want to turn now to our panel attorney and former chief counsel for the House Judiciary Committee Julian Epstein and [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUO_EEn7O2A&t=0.0s)]
*  Fox News contributor Kyron Skinner great to have you both here as always Kyron [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUO_EEn7O2A&t=7.2s)]
*  Let me start with you. So we hear the Iranian response is coming the [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUO_EEn7O2A&t=12.1s)]
*  Israeli air defense systems are [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUO_EEn7O2A&t=17.52s)]
*  Actively intercepting those drones that were launched right now as Steve was just saying [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUO_EEn7O2A&t=21.04s)]
*  This this could be days long weeks long for the Israeli people who've already been through so much [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUO_EEn7O2A&t=27.06s)]
*  How do you see this playing out in terms of time now? [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUO_EEn7O2A&t=32.78s)]
*  I think it definitely will take several days [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUO_EEn7O2A&t=38.06s)]
*  But we don't know but what we do know is that [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUO_EEn7O2A&t=42.1s)]
*  Iran's air defenses aren't as great as they thought they were [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUO_EEn7O2A&t=46.26s)]
*  This has been something that's been revealed over and over [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUO_EEn7O2A&t=51.019999999999996s)]
*  Since October 7th [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUO_EEn7O2A&t=55.699999999999996s)]
*  2023 when the horrific attacks against Israel began, you know immediately [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUO_EEn7O2A&t=59.26s)]
*  After October 7th, the Biden administration said Iran wasn't involved. This is Iran's war and [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUO_EEn7O2A&t=65.94s)]
*  What we have seen today is [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUO_EEn7O2A&t=73.62s)]
*  One more piece of evidence almost this time last year [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUO_EEn7O2A&t=76.9s)]
*  Was the beginning when Iran came out of the shadows and [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUO_EEn7O2A&t=81.77999999999999s)]
*  Made its confrontation with Israel [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUO_EEn7O2A&t=87.33999999999999s)]
*  With the West with the United States [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUO_EEn7O2A&t=90.69999999999999s)]
*  More of an open conflict. This is an open war now [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUO_EEn7O2A&t=93.94s)]
*  it's not a war just marked by cyber attacks and spies and [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUO_EEn7O2A&t=98.17999999999999s)]
*  Proxies [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUO_EEn7O2A&t=105.53999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, this is Iran attacking Israel and it's not going well and [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUO_EEn7O2A&t=106.74s)]
*  Julian I wonder talking of this as the opening of what seems like the real war between [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUO_EEn7O2A&t=112.94s)]
*  Israel and Iran [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUO_EEn7O2A&t=120.33999999999999s)]
*  How you see the US response here because it was really interesting to note that only [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUO_EEn7O2A&t=121.82s)]
*  Secretary of State Marco Rubio put out a statement. It was [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUO_EEn7O2A&t=127.58s)]
*  Making clear that the US was not involved in these attacks. What what's your read on that Julian? [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUO_EEn7O2A&t=132.22s)]
*  It's a diplomatic statement. It also implies quite clearly that the US supports it which the US should [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUO_EEn7O2A&t=140.98s)]
*  You know Jonathan and thanks for having me on we meet again at this wee hour on the same subject that we visited many times [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUO_EEn7O2A&t=148.1s)]
*  Now, you know 90 years ago [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUO_EEn7O2A&t=154.14s)]
*  Jonathan a [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUO_EEn7O2A&t=156.85999999999999s)]
*  genocidal [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUO_EEn7O2A&t=158.45999999999998s)]
*  Nationalist leader [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUO_EEn7O2A&t=159.82s)]
*  Pledged to kill all of the Jews and he ended up putting six million of them in ovens [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUO_EEn7O2A&t=161.38s)]
*  Today we have a similar genocidal ethno-nationalist leader [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUO_EEn7O2A&t=167.38s)]
*  The Iranian regime is the closest thing we have to the Nazi regime [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUO_EEn7O2A&t=172.42s)]
*  Which if they get a nuclear weapon, they will have the means to commit another Holocaust [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUO_EEn7O2A&t=176.66s)]
*  So what Israel is doing is not just self-defense. It's completely valid self-defense [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUO_EEn7O2A&t=181.5s)]
*  But I think the rest of the world those Israel a great debt of gratitude including the United States [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUO_EEn7O2A&t=186.78s)]
*  Because Iran doesn't just want to destroy [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUO_EEn7O2A&t=191.85999999999999s)]
*  Israel and kill all the Jews it wants to use the nuclear weapon to [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUO_EEn7O2A&t=194.94s)]
*  Colonize the Middle East and to control the Middle East. That's why Saudi that's why Jordan [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUO_EEn7O2A&t=199.73999999999998s)]
*  That's why UAE and that's why most of the rest of the Arab world is silently cheering [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUO_EEn7O2A&t=205.01999999999998s)]
*  The Israeli attack so to your question about the US the US is clearly supporting [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUO_EEn7O2A&t=210.7s)]
*  This they're not actively engaged in a tactical way, but they're clearly supporting this Trump made it very clear [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUO_EEn7O2A&t=216.54s)]
*  That the end of the Obama Biden policy of appeasement, which is what the [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUO_EEn7O2A&t=223.61999999999998s)]
*  2015 [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUO_EEn7O2A&t=229.1s)]
*  Agreement was the nuclear disarmament agreement, which was a bad agreement which allowed [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUO_EEn7O2A&t=231.1s)]
*  Iran just to put their nuclear program on the back burner [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUO_EEn7O2A&t=236.17999999999998s)]
*  Trump made it clear that we were seeing an end to that and this is the logical conclusion here because Iran was never going to bargain in [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUO_EEn7O2A&t=238.9s)]
*  Good faith. They weren't in good faith [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUO_EEn7O2A&t=245.9s)]
*  They want a nuclear weapon that they can use to terrorize Israel first and then the rest of the world [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUO_EEn7O2A&t=247.54000000000002s)]
*  And Kyra would we're getting some reporting now via our own Jillian Turner [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUO_EEn7O2A&t=252.38000000000002s)]
*  That Iran is announcing that it is pulling out of those planned talks [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUO_EEn7O2A&t=257.58000000000004s)]
*  With the US that would just scheduled for [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUO_EEn7O2A&t=262.78000000000003s)]
*  This weekend how significant is that if those talks do not happen [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUO_EEn7O2A&t=265.5s)]
*  It's expected that Iran would pull out of the talks given what has happened [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUO_EEn7O2A&t=272.54s)]
*  I don't know how significant it is because in fact [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUO_EEn7O2A&t=277.42s)]
*  You know Iran wasn't going to negotiate in good faith [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUO_EEn7O2A&t=282.02000000000004s)]
*  It's in fact [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUO_EEn7O2A&t=287.02000000000004s)]
*  Important that Donald Trump as the US president [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUO_EEn7O2A&t=289.02000000000004s)]
*  Attempted to negotiate in good faith. He's a peace strategist. He wanted to give Tehran an opportunity [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUO_EEn7O2A&t=291.58000000000004s)]
*  It failed [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUO_EEn7O2A&t=298.3s)]
*  Julian any chance here that [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUO_EEn7O2A&t=300.82s)]
*  Behind the scenes the US and Israel are actually doing this very deliberately the US slightly [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUO_EEn7O2A&t=303.94s)]
*  Distancing itself from these attacks [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUO_EEn7O2A&t=310.90000000000003s)]
*  In the hope that that pushes Israel to pull out of the talks [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUO_EEn7O2A&t=314.34000000000003s)]
*  Iran [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUO_EEn7O2A&t=317.86s)]
*  Towards more a more willingness to eventually come to the table [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUO_EEn7O2A&t=319.06s)]
*  And this is part of a diplomatic chess game [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUO_EEn7O2A&t=325.09999999999997s)]
*  Well, the US can [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUO_EEn7O2A&t=330.42s)]
*  Retain a position as a broker Jonathan here for sure [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUO_EEn7O2A&t=332.42s)]
*  They obviously have a lot of clout when it comes to Israel [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUO_EEn7O2A&t=336.02s)]
*  But you know, I think Karen makes a good point [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUO_EEn7O2A&t=338.65999999999997s)]
*  You even look at the IAEA report today on the nuclear issue [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUO_EEn7O2A&t=340.9s)]
*  The extent to which Iran has basically thumbed its nose at that treaty the way it was effectively using the [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUO_EEn7O2A&t=344.26s)]
*  2015 the JCPOA agreement with Obama to you know continue to build its nuclear program [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUO_EEn7O2A&t=350.42s)]
*  They are as Kyron properly points out a maniacal regime that is in bad faith [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUO_EEn7O2A&t=356.42s)]
*  So yes, if they are pummeled and if their nuclear stockpile is [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUO_EEn7O2A&t=361.7s)]
*  Completely destroyed, they're going to be in bad faith [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUO_EEn7O2A&t=366.65999999999997s)]
*  And if their nuclear stockpile is [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUO_EEn7O2A&t=370.18s)]
*  Completely destroyed and if then Iran Israel, for example, Jonathan were to go after [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUO_EEn7O2A&t=372.98s)]
*  the oil fields [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUO_EEn7O2A&t=378.74s)]
*  You know Iran is a paper tiger [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUO_EEn7O2A&t=381.46000000000004s)]
*  It is hated by 80 percent of its own people and the regime could topple [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUO_EEn7O2A&t=384.82000000000005s)]
*  So Iran could be brought to its knees very closely at which point it could come to the us and say [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUO_EEn7O2A&t=389.3s)]
*  We want to find a deal and at that point maybe maybe but they are a bad faith regime [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUO_EEn7O2A&t=394.58000000000004s)]
*  They have nothing but maniacal genocidal goals in the mid east against israel and against the west [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUO_EEn7O2A&t=399.62s)]
*  So I think trump is right to reject the obama-biden approach of appeasement and to go with this much stronger approach of backing israel [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUO_EEn7O2A&t=405.62s)]
*  unconditionally [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUO_EEn7O2A&t=413.20000000000005s)]
*  Okay, julian kyron. Uh, it is always an education to talk to you both. Thank you so much [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUO_EEn7O2A&t=414.34000000000003s)]
