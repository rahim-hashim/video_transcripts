# Iran gave the 'middle finger' to Trump: Ted Cruz
**Fox News - World News:** [June 12, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ET0F9BbTGJE)
*  Well, to me, Senator, you know more than I do, but my sources were very clear. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ET0F9BbTGJE&t=0.0s)]
*  The enrichment level was too great. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ET0F9BbTGJE&t=5.48s)]
*  The breakout time was less than a month. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ET0F9BbTGJE&t=8.620000000000001s)]
*  They would have the 15 nuclear weapons. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ET0F9BbTGJE&t=10.88s)]
*  The Israelis are not lying about it. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ET0F9BbTGJE&t=13.280000000000001s)]
*  And I have to believe those people that believe in a caliphate convert or die and threaten [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ET0F9BbTGJE&t=15.68s)]
*  to wipe Israel and the U.S. off the map, based on also being the number one state sponsor [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ET0F9BbTGJE&t=19.96s)]
*  of terror, if they got the weapon, they'd use it. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ET0F9BbTGJE&t=25.48s)]
*  Am I wrong? [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ET0F9BbTGJE&t=27.32s)]
*  You're not wrong. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ET0F9BbTGJE&t=28.32s)]
*  You're absolutely right. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ET0F9BbTGJE&t=31.16s)]
*  I believe this was inevitable and it was rendered more inevitable today by decisions of the [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ET0F9BbTGJE&t=32.16s)]
*  Ayatollah in Iran. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ET0F9BbTGJE&t=37.68s)]
*  Listen, President Trump has been clear for a long time that his red line is that Iran [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ET0F9BbTGJE&t=38.88s)]
*  must completely dismantle their nuclear capacity, must disassemble their nuclear centrifuges [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ET0F9BbTGJE&t=44.6s)]
*  where they are enriching uranium. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ET0F9BbTGJE&t=50.6s)]
*  President Trump made clear they could either do so peacefully through diplomacy or those [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ET0F9BbTGJE&t=53.36s)]
*  centrifuges would be dismantled kinetically through military conflict. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ET0F9BbTGJE&t=59.36s)]
*  We're seeing the latter tonight. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ET0F9BbTGJE&t=64.72s)]
*  And this morning, Iran publicly stated no, they would not dismantle their centrifuges. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ET0F9BbTGJE&t=67.04s)]
*  And in fact, they said they would build more, they would enrich more. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ET0F9BbTGJE&t=73.8s)]
*  The Ayatollah made the decision, we are going to plunge headfirst towards getting a nuclear [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ET0F9BbTGJE&t=78.0s)]
*  weapon. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ET0F9BbTGJE&t=83.6s)]
*  And basically, Iran gave the middle finger to President Trump and Iran told Israel, you [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ET0F9BbTGJE&t=84.6s)]
*  better strike us now because if you don't do it soon, we will have a nuclear weapon. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ET0F9BbTGJE&t=91.76s)]
*  And when we have a nuclear weapon, this is a theocratic zealot who chants death to America [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ET0F9BbTGJE&t=96.56s)]
*  and death to Israel. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ET0F9BbTGJE&t=102.48s)]
*  And they are building a nuclear weapon because they intend to be able to detonate a nuclear [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ET0F9BbTGJE&t=104.2s)]
*  weapon in the skies of Tel Aviv or New York or Los Angeles. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ET0F9BbTGJE&t=108.8s)]
*  And so Israel is acting to defend themselves. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ET0F9BbTGJE&t=113.4s)]
*  And Sean, tonight, we should stand unequivocally with the state of Israel. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ET0F9BbTGJE&t=116.08s)]
*  Senator, if I may interrupt you and then pick up your thought, Israeli news is reporting [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ET0F9BbTGJE&t=121.24000000000001s)]
*  that Iran's military chief of staff has been taken out. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ET0F9BbTGJE&t=125.84s)]
*  Now we can't confirm that, but Israeli news is reporting that at this hour. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ET0F9BbTGJE&t=130.0s)]
*  Look, Israel has an incredibly formidable military. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ET0F9BbTGJE&t=135.0s)]
*  They are surrounded by nations that would drive them into the sea and exterminate them. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ET0F9BbTGJE&t=139.96s)]
*  Iran's objective, the Ayatollah tells you what he wants to do when he leads mobs in [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ET0F9BbTGJE&t=145.52s)]
*  chanting death to Israel and death to America. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ET0F9BbTGJE&t=150.32s)]
*  He means it. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ET0F9BbTGJE&t=153.6s)]
*  Iran's nuclear program, who has since gone to meet his maker, many say at the hands of [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ET0F9BbTGJE&t=155.6s)]
*  the Mossad, he had written into his last will and testament that he wanted written on his [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ET0F9BbTGJE&t=160.51999999999998s)]
*  tombstone, here lies a man who seeks to annihilate Israel. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ET0F9BbTGJE&t=167.24s)]
*  That's the level of hate. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ET0F9BbTGJE&t=172.64s)]
*  And I will say tonight, I want to say to every one of your viewers, please, if you're a person [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ET0F9BbTGJE&t=174.34s)]
*  of faith, pray for Israel, pray for Jerusalem tonight. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ET0F9BbTGJE&t=178.76s)]
*  And let me say also, pray for US servicemen and women in the Middle East, in harm's way. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ET0F9BbTGJE&t=183.2s)]
*  And I want to give a message to the Ayatollah right now. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ET0F9BbTGJE&t=189.22s)]
*  If you strike at America, if you attack our military bases, if you kill one single American [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ET0F9BbTGJE&t=192.92s)]
*  serviceman or women, I have every confidence that President Trump will respond with overwhelming [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ET0F9BbTGJE&t=200.44s)]
*  force. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ET0F9BbTGJE&t=207.6s)]
*  That's a message the Ayatollah needs to understand. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ET0F9BbTGJE&t=209.48s)]
*  Right now, tonight, do not attack our American military men and women. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ET0F9BbTGJE&t=212.28s)]
*  If they are that foolish, they will pay the price. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ET0F9BbTGJE&t=215.96s)]
*  They are messing with the wrong guy. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ET0F9BbTGJE&t=219.0s)]
*  That bunch, I can tell you. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ET0F9BbTGJE&t=220.44s)]
*  Prime Minister Netanyahu just spoke for about a minute. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ET0F9BbTGJE&t=222.24s)]
*  Let's get his comments. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ET0F9BbTGJE&t=225.68s)]
*  Let's get your reaction on the other side. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ET0F9BbTGJE&t=226.68s)]
*  Let's play it. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ET0F9BbTGJE&t=228.12s)]
*  Moments ago, Israel launched Operation Rising Lion, a targeted military operation to roll [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ET0F9BbTGJE&t=229.76000000000002s)]
*  back the Iranian threat to Israel's very survival. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ET0F9BbTGJE&t=236.36s)]
*  This operation will continue for as many days as it takes to remove this threat. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ET0F9BbTGJE&t=241.08s)]
*  For decades, the tyrants of Tehran have brazenly, openly called for Israel's destruction. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ET0F9BbTGJE&t=246.74s)]
*  They've backed up their genocidal rhetoric with a program to develop nuclear weapons. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ET0F9BbTGJE&t=253.52s)]
*  In recent years, Iran has produced enough highly enriched uranium for nine atom bombs. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ET0F9BbTGJE&t=259.34000000000003s)]
*  Nine. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ET0F9BbTGJE&t=266.12s)]
*  In recent months, Iran has taken steps that it has never taken before, steps to weaponize [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ET0F9BbTGJE&t=267.36s)]
*  this enriched uranium. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ET0F9BbTGJE&t=273.64s)]
*  And if not stopped, Iran could produce a nuclear weapon in a very short time. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ET0F9BbTGJE&t=275.12s)]
*  It could be a year. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ET0F9BbTGJE&t=280.68s)]
*  It could be within a few months, less than a year. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ET0F9BbTGJE&t=281.72s)]
*  This is a clear and present danger to Israel's very survival. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ET0F9BbTGJE&t=284.98s)]
*  You know, it's also—Israel, in many ways, I think you can argue, Senator, is doing the [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ET0F9BbTGJE&t=290.36s)]
*  world a favor. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ET0F9BbTGJE&t=294.64s)]
*  If you go back to the 80s and they took out the Iraqi nuclear sites, it almost went undetected. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ET0F9BbTGJE&t=296.4s)]
*  You might recall that the Syrian nuclear program was in play, and they were able to fly under [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ET0F9BbTGJE&t=303.58s)]
*  the radar, take out those sites. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ET0F9BbTGJE&t=309.28s)]
*  Very few people even noticed or paid attention. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ET0F9BbTGJE&t=312.04s)]
*  And I know there's been a lot of back and forth, because this is Iran and what Iran [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ET0F9BbTGJE&t=315.56s)]
*  is going to do. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ET0F9BbTGJE&t=319.0s)]
*  There's one thing that I would argue. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ET0F9BbTGJE&t=320.0s)]
*  This is happening because our former president—that would be Joe Biden—he literally turned a [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ET0F9BbTGJE&t=322.28s)]
*  blind eye towards the sanctions that were bankrupting this country. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ET0F9BbTGJE&t=328.79999999999995s)]
*  And by doing so, he literally has enriched the country of Iran. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ET0F9BbTGJE&t=333.44s)]
*  He's given them money to foment terror, given them money to build out their nuclear [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ET0F9BbTGJE&t=338.96s)]
*  facilities even further. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ET0F9BbTGJE&t=344.64s)]
*  And that leads us to this moment where we are today. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ET0F9BbTGJE&t=346.44s)]
*  Now, if they ever got a nuclear weapon, I would argue it's Joe Biden's fault, but [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ET0F9BbTGJE&t=349.28s)]
*  I still would argue, too, that it can't happen on Donald Trump's watch either, and [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ET0F9BbTGJE&t=353.67999999999995s)]
*  he has said as much himself. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ET0F9BbTGJE&t=357.44s)]
*  Last word. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ET0F9BbTGJE&t=359.4s)]
*  Yeah, look, Sean, you're absolutely right, and it's even worse than that. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ET0F9BbTGJE&t=360.4s)]
*  Joe Biden didn't just turn a blind eye. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ET0F9BbTGJE&t=364.55999999999995s)]
*  He refused to enforce the sanctions against Iran, and he flowed over $100 billion to the [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ET0F9BbTGJE&t=367.0s)]
*  Ayatollah. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ET0F9BbTGJE&t=373.76s)]
*  He made them rich in cash. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ET0F9BbTGJE&t=374.8s)]
*  And understand, Iran provides 90 percent of the funding for Hamas and 90 percent of the [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ET0F9BbTGJE&t=376.36s)]
*  funding for Hezbollah. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ET0F9BbTGJE&t=380.96000000000004s)]
*  In a very real sense, Joe Biden and the Democrats funded the October 7th massacre. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ET0F9BbTGJE&t=382.44s)]
*  The death squads that murdered over 1,200 Israelis on October 7th were paid for by the [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ET0F9BbTGJE&t=387.76s)]
*  money Joe Biden allowed to go to the Ayatollah. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ET0F9BbTGJE&t=393.16s)]
*  And I will say the threat here tonight, Iran, they intend to do everything they can. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ET0F9BbTGJE&t=397.04s)]
*  It was interesting listening to you interview Mike Pompeo. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ET0F9BbTGJE&t=404.4s)]
*  Mike is a friend of mine. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ET0F9BbTGJE&t=406.71999999999997s)]
*  He mentioned Iran is trying to murder former U.S. senior officials. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ET0F9BbTGJE&t=407.71999999999997s)]
*  What he had the humility not to say is he is number one on that list. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ET0F9BbTGJE&t=411.32s)]
*  The Ayatollah is trying to murder Mike Pompeo, the former secretary of state. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ET0F9BbTGJE&t=415.96s)]
*  They're trying to murder John Bolton, President Trump's former national security adviser. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ET0F9BbTGJE&t=419.71999999999997s)]
*  Joe Biden was spending $2 million a month in security to protect them from Ayatollah's [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ET0F9BbTGJE&t=424.4s)]
*  murderous efforts. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ET0F9BbTGJE&t=430.64s)]
*  And by the way, let us not forget, Iran is trying to murder Donald J. Trump, and Israel [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ET0F9BbTGJE&t=431.96s)]
*  is doing a favor to America right now by taking out Iran's nuclear capacity. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ET0F9BbTGJE&t=438.28s)]
*  We don't know how this is going to end up, but a nuclear Iran would be a profound threat [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ET0F9BbTGJE&t=444.64s)]
*  to Israel and a profound threat to America. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ET0F9BbTGJE&t=449.2s)]
*  And so my prayers tonight are to every Israeli and every American in harm's way tonight that [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ET0F9BbTGJE&t=452.15999999999997s)]
*  God will keep them safe and that we will stand strong to prevent a nuclear Iran that [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ET0F9BbTGJE&t=456.92s)]
*  could commit vast acts of mass murder. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ET0F9BbTGJE&t=462.96000000000004s)]
*  Senator, I share that prayer with you. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ET0F9BbTGJE&t=465.92s)]
*  Our prayers are with all the people that are living through this tonight. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ET0F9BbTGJE&t=468.16s)]
