# Condoleezza Rice outlines why the US ‘HAS TO WIN’ AI race against China
**Fox News - World News:** [June 08, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBdOfr7m1S8)
*  Welcome back to my view. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBdOfr7m1S8&t=0.0s)]
*  By now it's clear, America doesn't get the luxury of falling behind. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBdOfr7m1S8&t=2.7600000000000002s)]
*  Not when China is infiltrating our universities with Communist Party loyalists, racing us [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBdOfr7m1S8&t=7.08s)]
*  in artificial intelligence, and gearing up for dominance on every global front. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBdOfr7m1S8&t=11.6s)]
*  And with wars raging abroad and technology transferring faster than government can keep [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBdOfr7m1S8&t=17.28s)]
*  up, the question isn't whether the world is changing, it's whether we're still strong [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBdOfr7m1S8&t=21.48s)]
*  enough to shape it. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBdOfr7m1S8&t=26.02s)]
*  Dr. Condoleezza Rice has seen the world from the Situation Room and the front lines of [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBdOfr7m1S8&t=27.72s)]
*  diplomacy. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBdOfr7m1S8&t=32.64s)]
*  As a former National Security Advisor and Secretary of State, she knows exactly what's [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBdOfr7m1S8&t=33.96s)]
*  at stake and what happens when America steps back instead of stepping up. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBdOfr7m1S8&t=38.92s)]
*  Dr. Rice joined me in studio this week to discuss student visas, the AI arms race already [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBdOfr7m1S8&t=43.8s)]
*  underway, and what it'll take for the United States to not only lead, but win. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBdOfr7m1S8&t=49.2s)]
*  Alright, well former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, thank you so much. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBdOfr7m1S8&t=55.56s)]
*  It's such an honor to have you here on my view. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBdOfr7m1S8&t=60.16s)]
*  Well thank you, it's a pleasure to be with you. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBdOfr7m1S8&t=62.72s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBdOfr7m1S8&t=64.84s)]
*  You know, you have such a history and have so much knowledge of, you know, the role of [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBdOfr7m1S8&t=65.84s)]
*  Secretary of State. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBdOfr7m1S8&t=70.62s)]
*  And I want to ask you initially about the pause in student visas. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBdOfr7m1S8&t=71.62s)]
*  You know Marco Rubio, our current Secretary of State, says that it is not a right, it's [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBdOfr7m1S8&t=75.88s)]
*  a privilege to have a visa. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBdOfr7m1S8&t=79.66s)]
*  We have certainly seen an escalation in violence. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBdOfr7m1S8&t=82.38s)]
*  There are a lot of concerns about these visas being handed out. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBdOfr7m1S8&t=84.42s)]
*  What is your take on that? [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBdOfr7m1S8&t=88.53999999999999s)]
*  Do you agree with that pause for the safety of Americans? [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBdOfr7m1S8&t=89.94s)]
*  Well, I've been both National Security Advisor and I am a professor. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBdOfr7m1S8&t=92.14s)]
*  And so I live in both, I've lived in both of these worlds. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBdOfr7m1S8&t=96.94s)]
*  And when I was National Security Advisor, we had to do additional vetting from time [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBdOfr7m1S8&t=100.14s)]
*  to time. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBdOfr7m1S8&t=104.5s)]
*  I'm not inside, so I can't answer why the vetting might be necessary, but I hope we [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBdOfr7m1S8&t=105.5s)]
*  get the vetting done. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBdOfr7m1S8&t=110.86s)]
*  There are an awful lot of students who have already been admitted to college who are hoping [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBdOfr7m1S8&t=112.48s)]
*  that they can come. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBdOfr7m1S8&t=115.9s)]
*  And we have to remember, most of these kids are coming for the right reasons. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBdOfr7m1S8&t=116.9s)]
*  They want to see this extraordinary country, which is the United States of America, experience [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBdOfr7m1S8&t=121.42s)]
*  its freedoms. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBdOfr7m1S8&t=126.84s)]
*  And we benefit from that. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBdOfr7m1S8&t=128.78s)]
*  But I understand that from time to time it's important. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBdOfr7m1S8&t=130.56s)]
*  I just hope that it can move along so that we can continue. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBdOfr7m1S8&t=133.98s)]
*  Well, you know, you've been very vocal about AI. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBdOfr7m1S8&t=138.7s)]
*  And I think this is certainly the next frontier. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBdOfr7m1S8&t=141.54s)]
*  It gives some of us some pause for sure. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBdOfr7m1S8&t=144.3s)]
*  I'm one of those people. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBdOfr7m1S8&t=145.94s)]
*  But it does feel like, to an extent, we are in an AI arms race in a lot of ways. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBdOfr7m1S8&t=147.38s)]
*  So maybe talk about why it's essential that the United States come out on top in that [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBdOfr7m1S8&t=152.92000000000002s)]
*  arms race for the future, and really for national security. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBdOfr7m1S8&t=158.66s)]
*  Well, it's extremely important. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBdOfr7m1S8&t=161.9s)]
*  These are transformational technologies that we're talking about now. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBdOfr7m1S8&t=163.94s)]
*  And not just AI, but synthetic biology and quantum and what we're doing in space. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBdOfr7m1S8&t=166.85999999999999s)]
*  There are some scary things about AI. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBdOfr7m1S8&t=172.78s)]
*  There's no doubt about it. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBdOfr7m1S8&t=174.7s)]
*  But the conversation between those who are on the frontiers and those of us who worry [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBdOfr7m1S8&t=176.16s)]
*  about society and national security, that has to be a constant conversation. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBdOfr7m1S8&t=182.38s)]
*  The reason I want to win the arms race is I want a democracy, and ours is the one to [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBdOfr7m1S8&t=187.56s)]
*  win that race. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBdOfr7m1S8&t=192.6s)]
*  Just imagine, do the thought experiment. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBdOfr7m1S8&t=194.32s)]
*  If the Soviet Union or Nazi Germany had won the race to the nuclear bomb, we'd live in [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBdOfr7m1S8&t=196.28s)]
*  a very different world. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBdOfr7m1S8&t=200.95999999999998s)]
*  Imagine how China would deal with something if it goes wrong, the way that they dealt [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBdOfr7m1S8&t=202.88s)]
*  with COVID. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBdOfr7m1S8&t=206.6s)]
*  They'll hide it. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBdOfr7m1S8&t=207.72s)]
*  They'll lie about it. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBdOfr7m1S8&t=208.72s)]
*  And so my view is that the United States has to win this race. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBdOfr7m1S8&t=209.72s)]
*  I want to win this race for sure. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBdOfr7m1S8&t=213.6s)]
*  Do you see a space where the government maybe should be working with the private sector? [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBdOfr7m1S8&t=215.16s)]
*  certain regulations may be appropriate here. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBdOfr7m1S8&t=220.52s)]
*  Do you see that as a private sector kind of coalition with the government? [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBdOfr7m1S8&t=223.4s)]
*  Oh, I absolutely see it as a private sector, a public-private discussion. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBdOfr7m1S8&t=226.92000000000002s)]
*  Because this is really very different than the nuclear age where the technology was within [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBdOfr7m1S8&t=232.92000000000002s)]
*  government circles. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBdOfr7m1S8&t=239.44s)]
*  The technology is now an open portal. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBdOfr7m1S8&t=240.92000000000002s)]
*  I will say one thing that I am concerned about is we have the innovation in the United States. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBdOfr7m1S8&t=243.67999999999998s)]
*  We don't want, for instance, Europe to be the regulatory state that's regulating our [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBdOfr7m1S8&t=250.44s)]
*  innovation. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBdOfr7m1S8&t=255.2s)]
*  And I say this to the Europeans all the time. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBdOfr7m1S8&t=256.2s)]
*  Push your own innovation frontiers. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBdOfr7m1S8&t=259.08s)]
*  Don't just regulate ours. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBdOfr7m1S8&t=260.84s)]
*  And so this is a moment when we absolutely have to have those public-private conversations. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBdOfr7m1S8&t=262.28s)]
*  I believe you'll find that the private sector wants to be responsible about the use of this [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBdOfr7m1S8&t=270.36s)]
*  kind of technology. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBdOfr7m1S8&t=277.64s)]
*  They know its power. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBdOfr7m1S8&t=278.72s)]
*  They know that there are potential downsides. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBdOfr7m1S8&t=280.32s)]
*  They know that human beings have often been better at the knowledge side than the wisdom [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBdOfr7m1S8&t=282.76s)]
*  side when it comes to technology. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBdOfr7m1S8&t=286.92s)]
*  I'm very excited about what AI can do, although I recognize that we face some challenges as [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBdOfr7m1S8&t=288.8s)]
*  society in trying to make sure that it's good. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBdOfr7m1S8&t=294.4s)]
*  I want to talk to you, you know, globally. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBdOfr7m1S8&t=297.08000000000004s)]
*  There's so much going on. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBdOfr7m1S8&t=299.36s)]
*  And obviously all of your experience. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBdOfr7m1S8&t=301.20000000000005s)]
*  I would love to get your take. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBdOfr7m1S8&t=302.48s)]
*  You see, obviously, a situation in the Middle East. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBdOfr7m1S8&t=303.52000000000004s)]
*  You see this war between Russia and Ukraine. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBdOfr7m1S8&t=306.08000000000004s)]
*  You see China building up its military as well. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBdOfr7m1S8&t=308.3s)]
*  Where do you think the United States needs to be overall? [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBdOfr7m1S8&t=312.72s)]
*  What advice would you give right now to, you know, the person who has served in many roles [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBdOfr7m1S8&t=316.04s)]
*  that you have and is now in those spaces? [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBdOfr7m1S8&t=322.32000000000005s)]
*  Well, let me first say that you've got awfully good people in those roles. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBdOfr7m1S8&t=325.03999999999996s)]
*  So I am somebody who believes that sometimes your advice isn't so great when you're outside. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBdOfr7m1S8&t=328.44s)]
*  You can't see. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBdOfr7m1S8&t=334.03999999999996s)]
*  But I will say this. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBdOfr7m1S8&t=335.64s)]
*  The United States of America is essential in all of these. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBdOfr7m1S8&t=337.12s)]
*  Great powers don't mind their own business. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBdOfr7m1S8&t=341.4s)]
*  They try to shape the world. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBdOfr7m1S8&t=343.32s)]
*  So the shaping of this will be important. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBdOfr7m1S8&t=345.84s)]
*  You're seeing in what President Trump is doing, you're seeing the fact that he had a call [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBdOfr7m1S8&t=348.88s)]
*  with Vladimir Putin. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBdOfr7m1S8&t=353.36s)]
*  He's trying to do Iran negotiations. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBdOfr7m1S8&t=354.92s)]
*  What does that show? [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBdOfr7m1S8&t=357.12s)]
*  It shows that the United States is essential to all of these. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBdOfr7m1S8&t=358.48s)]
*  And accepting that is extremely important. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBdOfr7m1S8&t=361.92s)]
*  I used to say that I felt like the secretary of state was the 911 for the world, that you [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBdOfr7m1S8&t=365.92s)]
*  got that call that said, there's a problem here. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBdOfr7m1S8&t=371.64s)]
*  I remember once Colin Powell was trying to solve something between Morocco and Spain. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBdOfr7m1S8&t=374.32s)]
*  I said, why are you doing that? [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBdOfr7m1S8&t=379.56s)]
*  Because it's 911 of the world. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBdOfr7m1S8&t=381.28s)]
*  We don't want to have to do it alone. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBdOfr7m1S8&t=385.11999999999995s)]
*  And one of the things that I admire about what we're hearing now from the administration [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBdOfr7m1S8&t=387.32s)]
*  is there does need to be a sharing of the burden with the allies. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBdOfr7m1S8&t=393.23999999999995s)]
*  I was one of those secretaries who went to NATO and to Brussels every year and begged [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBdOfr7m1S8&t=397.08s)]
*  for the 2%. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBdOfr7m1S8&t=401.91999999999996s)]
*  Well, we're getting there finally. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBdOfr7m1S8&t=402.91999999999996s)]
*  The countries are going to try to increase their defense spending. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBdOfr7m1S8&t=405.03999999999996s)]
*  And we will be stronger. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBdOfr7m1S8&t=409.61999999999995s)]
*  These are countries that I believe we can share the responsibility. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBdOfr7m1S8&t=411.16s)]
*  But the organization of it, the United States has to do that. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBdOfr7m1S8&t=417.44s)]
*  All right. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBdOfr7m1S8&t=420.56s)]
*  Well, final question. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBdOfr7m1S8&t=421.56s)]
*  You know, you, as I've pointed out, you had a long career. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBdOfr7m1S8&t=422.56s)]
*  There are so many young women who I think look to you and they say, what a role model. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBdOfr7m1S8&t=427.0s)]
*  You know, somebody to really look up to, what advice would you give to young women out there [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBdOfr7m1S8&t=432.32s)]
*  who are maybe looking to follow in your footsteps? [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBdOfr7m1S8&t=437.92s)]
*  Although I know they are big shoes to fill. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBdOfr7m1S8&t=440.48s)]
*  What would you say? [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBdOfr7m1S8&t=442.56s)]
*  Well, I could say start as a failed piano major, which is actually what happened. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBdOfr7m1S8&t=443.56s)]
*  I was supposed to be a concert pianist. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBdOfr7m1S8&t=448.24s)]
*  Wow. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBdOfr7m1S8&t=450.40000000000003s)]
*  I studied piano from the age of three. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBdOfr7m1S8&t=451.40000000000003s)]
*  But fortunately, I wandered into a course in international politics and I loved it. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBdOfr7m1S8&t=452.76s)]
*  And I knew what I wanted to be. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBdOfr7m1S8&t=458.58000000000004s)]
*  I didn't know what I wanted to do, but I knew I wanted to be somebody who did things international [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBdOfr7m1S8&t=460.20000000000005s)]
*  and diplomatic. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBdOfr7m1S8&t=464.52000000000004s)]
*  So the first thing I would say is find something you love. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBdOfr7m1S8&t=465.72s)]
*  Find something you're passionate about. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBdOfr7m1S8&t=468.16s)]
*  And then give it your all to be as good at it as you can possibly be, to be expert at [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBdOfr7m1S8&t=470.04s)]
*  it. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBdOfr7m1S8&t=475.68s)]
*  I'd also say there aren't that many barriers. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBdOfr7m1S8&t=476.68s)]
*  Even if it's a field in which you don't see people who look like you, you can break through [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBdOfr7m1S8&t=479.34000000000003s)]
*  those barriers. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBdOfr7m1S8&t=485.0s)]
*  Maybe you'll have to be the first. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBdOfr7m1S8&t=486.0s)]
*  And it's a marvelous thing when your talents and your passion come together. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBdOfr7m1S8&t=487.96000000000004s)]
*  A lot of life follows from that. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBdOfr7m1S8&t=492.64000000000004s)]
*  religious person and I've been enormously grateful that I've been given this opportunity. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBdOfr7m1S8&t=495.48s)]
*  It's a little bit improbable in some ways, but I'm grateful that I've found passion and [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBdOfr7m1S8&t=502.72s)]
*  the ability to do all of these things, including to represent the United States of America. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBdOfr7m1S8&t=510.36s)]
*  Wow. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBdOfr7m1S8&t=515.32s)]
*  Well, I didn't know this. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBdOfr7m1S8&t=516.32s)]
*  Next time we see each other, we'll have to do a little ditty on the piano. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBdOfr7m1S8&t=517.32s)]
*  You've got it. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBdOfr7m1S8&t=519.84s)]
*  Okay. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBdOfr7m1S8&t=520.84s)]

*  Thank you so much for being with us. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBdOfr7m1S8&t=523.84s)]
*  Real pleasure to be with you. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBdOfr7m1S8&t=524.84s)]
