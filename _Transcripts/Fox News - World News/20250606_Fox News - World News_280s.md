# 'FACING JUSTICE': Kilmar Abrego Garcia heading to US to face charges, reports says
**Fox News - World News:** [June 06, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RGbacFgDrs)
*  Welcome back. A Homeland Security Task Force, take a look at that, seizing nearly four tons [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RGbacFgDrs&t=0.0s)]
*  of methamphetamine out in San Diego this week. It happened at a border checkpoint. The three [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RGbacFgDrs&t=7.44s)]
*  men who are charged in the incident, all in the U.S. legally, according to government [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RGbacFgDrs&t=11.6s)]
*  records, one a felon convicted of spousal battery, false imprisonment. Let's bring in [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RGbacFgDrs&t=16.64s)]
*  Tricia McLaughlin, DHS Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs. Tricia, I mean, I'm not [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RGbacFgDrs&t=21.8s)]
*  an expert, but that looks like a lot of drugs. That's a lot of drugs, and that's a lot of [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RGbacFgDrs&t=26.64s)]
*  drugs off of our streets and out of American communities. But Jillian, I have to say this [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RGbacFgDrs&t=31.48s)]
*  underscores why it is so important that border crossings are down to historic lows under [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RGbacFgDrs&t=36.32s)]
*  President Trump and Secretary Noem's leadership, because our border patrol agents aren't stuck [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RGbacFgDrs&t=42.36s)]
*  at processing facilities bringing people into the interior of our country. Instead, they're [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RGbacFgDrs&t=47.32s)]
*  actually out on the field stopping cartels, stopping these CCP-backed groups who are trying [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RGbacFgDrs&t=52.4s)]
*  to bring illicit drugs into our country. Actually, earlier today, President Scheinbaum of Mexico [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RGbacFgDrs&t=57.88s)]
*  announced that fentanyl trafficking was down 40 percent since President Trump took office. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RGbacFgDrs&t=64.32s)]
*  Think of the number of families that's saving, the number of lives that's saving in this country. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RGbacFgDrs&t=70.6s)]
*  We're getting brand new reporting into the newsroom now. There is chatter that Kilmar [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RGbacFgDrs&t=75.76s)]
*  Abrego-Garcia is headed back to the U.S. now to face criminal charges. This, the man who the [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RGbacFgDrs&t=83.28s)]
*  Supreme Court determined was wrongfully deported and sent to El Salvador. What can you tell us? [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RGbacFgDrs&t=89.76s)]
*  Jillian, I'm not going to get ahead of the Department of Justice or ahead of the Attorney [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RGbacFgDrs&t=99.12s)]
*  General, but what I will say is that we have been saying for months at the Department of Homeland [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RGbacFgDrs&t=102.88s)]
*  Security that Kilmar Abrego-Garcia is not some innocent Maryland father as the media had liked [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RGbacFgDrs&t=108.0s)]
*  to portray him. He is an MS-13 gang member. He was involved in human trafficking. He was involved in [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RGbacFgDrs&t=114.08s)]
*  labor trafficking. And by his own wife's testimony, he also is a wife-beater. This is not somebody [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RGbacFgDrs&t=119.6s)]
*  that we want in our country. He is from El Salvador, and that is where he should end up. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RGbacFgDrs&t=126.39999999999999s)]
*  But I'll leave it to the Department of Justice to announce anything further at this time. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RGbacFgDrs&t=131.36s)]
*  Okay. Let's go back to the drug bust for a second. Talk to us about how you guys [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RGbacFgDrs&t=138.0s)]
*  kind of get, I mean, is this something that just unfolds in real time and agents have to deal with [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RGbacFgDrs&t=145.84s)]
*  it, or is it something that you kind of prepare for and strategize over for a long time before [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RGbacFgDrs&t=151.04000000000002s)]
*  you execute? Our Border Patrol agents are experts in this. They know the signs. They know what they're [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RGbacFgDrs&t=156.64s)]
*  looking for, and we also have strategies as far as from an investigative standpoint that, of course, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RGbacFgDrs&t=163.2s)]
*  I cannot get ahead of. But San Diego is one of the busiest ports of entry we have in this country, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RGbacFgDrs&t=169.76s)]
*  and this was our second largest meth bust in American history. So I think that Americans can [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RGbacFgDrs&t=176.72s)]
*  be incredibly proud of our Border Patrol agents, and we're seeing agent every day, the fact that [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RGbacFgDrs&t=182.8s)]
*  these politicians and the media go out of their way to vilify our law enforcement. We're seeing [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RGbacFgDrs&t=187.84s)]
*  a major uptick in assaults against ICE enforcement officers and even Border Patrol. It's disgusting. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RGbacFgDrs&t=193.52s)]
*  It's wrong. And these are people, these are law enforcement agents that we should be incredibly [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RGbacFgDrs&t=200.56s)]
*  proud of. They are cleaning up American streets and making sure that these lethal drugs don't [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RGbacFgDrs&t=205.76000000000002s)]
*  impact our children and don't impact American communities. Real quick, what do you say about [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RGbacFgDrs&t=211.92000000000002s)]
*  this push to get ICE agents to unmask while they're executing detentions, like the one on our screen [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RGbacFgDrs&t=216.48000000000002s)]
*  right now? I think Hakeem Jeffries and AOC and Tim Walz are giving really a hall pass to these [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RGbacFgDrs&t=222.64000000000001s)]
*  violent activists who are trying to dox our ICE enforcement agents. As I said before, our ICE [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RGbacFgDrs&t=231.44s)]
*  officers are facing a 400% increase in violent assaults against them. These men and women are [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RGbacFgDrs&t=237.36s)]
*  on the front lines risking their lives each and every day to get vicious gangs, to get murders, [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RGbacFgDrs&t=243.60000000000002s)]
*  to get rapists off of our streets. I'm so proud of them. I'm so proud to stand with them. And the [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RGbacFgDrs&t=248.96s)]
*  American people do too. This is gutter politics that Hakeem Jeffries is trying to play here. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RGbacFgDrs&t=255.12s)]
*  All right, Trisha, we're going to let you go. Thank you for taking time with us on this busy day. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RGbacFgDrs&t=261.20000000000005s)]
*  Thanks for having me. You bet. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RGbacFgDrs&t=266.48s)]
