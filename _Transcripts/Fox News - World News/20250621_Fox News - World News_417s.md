# HISTORIC night, the Israelis are ecstatic: Bret Baier
**Fox News - World News:** [June 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7YnYz-6-Uk)
*  We bring in the host of Special Report, Brett Baier is with us. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7YnYz-6-Uk&t=0.0s)]
*  Brett, thank you for being with us. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7YnYz-6-Uk&t=3.64s)]
*  I did have a conversation when you were breaking news live right here on Fox. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7YnYz-6-Uk&t=5.64s)]
*  I got some details as, again, you got on the air immediately. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7YnYz-6-Uk&t=11.28s)]
*  And the fact we had initially discussed at length and in great detail the issue of maybe [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7YnYz-6-Uk&t=16.84s)]
*  two Bunker Buster bombs being needed for this Fordell facility. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7YnYz-6-Uk&t=23.12s)]
*  It ends up six. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7YnYz-6-Uk&t=27.94s)]
*  It ends up that the Israelis had only gotten 75% of the other two nuclear sites that they [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7YnYz-6-Uk&t=29.54s)]
*  had been attacking on a regular basis. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7YnYz-6-Uk&t=35.14s)]
*  And Tomahawk missiles, the president reporting tonight, they were totally, all three of them, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7YnYz-6-Uk&t=37.7s)]
*  obliterated. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7YnYz-6-Uk&t=42.94s)]
*  Incredible news. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7YnYz-6-Uk&t=43.94s)]
*  There's history tonight here. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7YnYz-6-Uk&t=44.94s)]
*  Yeah, Sean, it's a historic night. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7YnYz-6-Uk&t=46.94s)]
*  It is, we'll see what the battle damage assessment is on the ground from Iran. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7YnYz-6-Uk&t=50.58s)]
*  But the Israelis are ecstatic. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7YnYz-6-Uk&t=56.18s)]
*  You saw that in the prime minister's statement saying that this is a pivot point, he believes, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7YnYz-6-Uk&t=58.040000000000006s)]
*  for the Middle East. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7YnYz-6-Uk&t=64.0s)]
*  The fact that there were six Bunker Buster bombs from those B-2s, 30 Tomahawk missiles [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7YnYz-6-Uk&t=65.0s)]
*  from the U.S. submarines hitting the Isfahan site, the Natanz site and Fordow. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7YnYz-6-Uk&t=69.66s)]
*  We talk a lot about Fordow being the most protected, and that's where a lot of those [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7YnYz-6-Uk&t=76.02000000000001s)]
*  Bunker Busters were focused. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7YnYz-6-Uk&t=80.02000000000001s)]
*  But the Isfahan site, believe it or not, is also really deep, I'm told from experts who [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7YnYz-6-Uk&t=83.02000000000001s)]
*  have been looking at it for years, and that's where they stored the highly enriched uranium. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7YnYz-6-Uk&t=87.82s)]
*  I think there's going to be a real question about what goes forward, what happens next. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7YnYz-6-Uk&t=93.13999999999999s)]
*  I've been in contact with some of our allies, leaders in the region and other countries [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7YnYz-6-Uk&t=98.41999999999999s)]
*  in the region, and one said this to me, Iran will have to respond. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7YnYz-6-Uk&t=104.38s)]
*  They have to save face. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7YnYz-6-Uk&t=110.53999999999999s)]
*  Their capabilities have been degraded, but they're not impotent. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7YnYz-6-Uk&t=112.3s)]
*  It's important to realize that while the president is saying that this is a tremendous [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7YnYz-6-Uk&t=116.98s)]
*  success and he believes they have been completely obliterated, the history will show that the [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7YnYz-6-Uk&t=121.18s)]
*  Iran leadership will not go down without swinging. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7YnYz-6-Uk&t=126.62s)]
*  What that swing looks like, you know, we've seen the missus. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7YnYz-6-Uk&t=130.34s)]
*  Brett, I can add some color to that. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7YnYz-6-Uk&t=133.34s)]
*  Yeah, go ahead. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7YnYz-6-Uk&t=134.34s)]
*  You know, no one could argue, I think, by any objective measure that this phase of this [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7YnYz-6-Uk&t=135.34s)]
*  operation was a complete success. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7YnYz-6-Uk&t=142.02s)]
*  But there is a part two, and they did game out all of this. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7YnYz-6-Uk&t=144.72s)]
*  And as you and I both know, there have been many, many meetings where these plans have [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7YnYz-6-Uk&t=148.5s)]
*  been discussed in great detail. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7YnYz-6-Uk&t=154.38s)]
*  And part two of this, though, is to protect American assets on the ground in the region. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7YnYz-6-Uk&t=156.18s)]
*  And that means people and that means specific locations. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7YnYz-6-Uk&t=161.98000000000002s)]
*  They are prepared for any retaliation. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7YnYz-6-Uk&t=165.54000000000002s)]
*  And the president was very clear, unambiguous. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7YnYz-6-Uk&t=167.86s)]
*  In his statement again tonight to the Iranians, what the consequences will be if they, in [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7YnYz-6-Uk&t=170.66s)]
*  fact, try to retaliate. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7YnYz-6-Uk&t=176.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7YnYz-6-Uk&t=178.06s)]
*  And I think that that's really important because in the region, as you and I know, strength [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7YnYz-6-Uk&t=179.06s)]
*  matters. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7YnYz-6-Uk&t=184.57999999999998s)]
*  And that's what talks over there. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7YnYz-6-Uk&t=185.82s)]
*  Peace through strength, but strength first. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7YnYz-6-Uk&t=188.57999999999998s)]
*  And I think that there, that's the signal the president was sending. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7YnYz-6-Uk&t=191.54s)]
*  If any U.S. citizen, any U.S. base, any U.S. facility comes under Iranian attack, all bets [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7YnYz-6-Uk&t=196.34s)]
*  are off as far as this being a limited type of strike. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7YnYz-6-Uk&t=201.82s)]
*  And you're right, they have a lot of plans going forward, if that's the case. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7YnYz-6-Uk&t=206.66s)]
*  One of the questions is, what does the opposition on the ground look like? [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7YnYz-6-Uk&t=212.28s)]
*  How does this all develop? [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7YnYz-6-Uk&t=216.88s)]
*  That's not something that I've heard that the U.S. is really focused on. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7YnYz-6-Uk&t=218.02s)]
*  Regime change, while it may be tangential, is for the Iranians to decide, much like the [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7YnYz-6-Uk&t=222.89999999999998s)]
*  president delivered that speech, Sean, in Saudi Arabia, which he said, we don't want [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7YnYz-6-Uk&t=229.14s)]
*  you to be our image. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7YnYz-6-Uk&t=234.1s)]
*  We want you to be your own countries, but we want to do deals with you. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7YnYz-6-Uk&t=235.78s)]
*  And we want to change the face of the Middle East and how it operates. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7YnYz-6-Uk&t=239.33999999999997s)]
*  But I think you are very wise in cautioning people. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7YnYz-6-Uk&t=244.01999999999998s)]
*  And I did this all week and remind people that there's no such thing as a military operation [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7YnYz-6-Uk&t=247.78s)]
*  that does not have great risk associated with it. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7YnYz-6-Uk&t=253.82s)]
*  At the end of the president's statement tonight, it was striking when he did thank God for [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7YnYz-6-Uk&t=259.06s)]
*  the safety and the safe return of our troops and just being appreciative that it was successful. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7YnYz-6-Uk&t=263.34s)]
*  There's always risk associated with it. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7YnYz-6-Uk&t=271.26s)]
*  There's always risk of retaliation. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7YnYz-6-Uk&t=273.34s)]
*  But there is no doubt tonight the Iranians no longer are nuclear power. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7YnYz-6-Uk&t=275.58000000000004s)]
*  There is no doubt we can say tonight that the world, I think you can say unequivocally, [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7YnYz-6-Uk&t=280.62s)]
*  is a safer place. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7YnYz-6-Uk&t=285.54s)]
*  It doesn't mean they still don't have their ballistic missiles. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7YnYz-6-Uk&t=287.22s)]
*  It doesn't mean that they will retreat. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7YnYz-6-Uk&t=289.98s)]
*  It doesn't mean that they will unconditionally surrender. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7YnYz-6-Uk&t=292.0s)]
*  It doesn't mean that the American military's job is done. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7YnYz-6-Uk&t=294.34000000000003s)]
*  They will protect American assets, interests and people that are in the region. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7YnYz-6-Uk&t=298.98s)]
*  That has been made very clear and the president made clear the consequences. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7YnYz-6-Uk&t=303.46s)]
*  So they do so at their own peril. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7YnYz-6-Uk&t=307.29999999999995s)]
*  They didn't listen to President Trump the first time. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7YnYz-6-Uk&t=309.06s)]
*  Let's see if they learn something before they strike back or attempt to. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7YnYz-6-Uk&t=311.97999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, I just am really struck by the operational security, Sean, of all of this. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7YnYz-6-Uk&t=315.85999999999996s)]
*  The fact that, you know, Iran really, the intelligence said, wanted to strike Israel [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7YnYz-6-Uk&t=321.34s)]
*  first and then the president came forward and said, let's negotiate, thinking there [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7YnYz-6-Uk&t=326.94s)]
*  could be a possibility for a path for negotiation. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7YnYz-6-Uk&t=332.52s)]
*  But he said 60 days, on day 61, Israel attacks first, changes the dynamic, really hits them [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7YnYz-6-Uk&t=335.71999999999997s)]
*  hard, takes out the surface air missiles, opens the door to the possibility. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7YnYz-6-Uk&t=342.84s)]
*  All the while the president's saying you could get back to the negotiation table. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7YnYz-6-Uk&t=347.84s)]
*  Then he says within two weeks, I'll make the decision. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7YnYz-6-Uk&t=352.52s)]
*  Well, two days is within two weeks. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7YnYz-6-Uk&t=355.03999999999996s)]
*  It wasn't lying, but it was about operational security. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7YnYz-6-Uk&t=357.56s)]
*  And when the six B-2 bombers go west, everybody's looking, they're covering it over there. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7YnYz-6-Uk&t=361.32s)]
*  It's look at the shiny thing. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7YnYz-6-Uk&t=366.48s)]
*  It was already in motion in the east. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7YnYz-6-Uk&t=368.64s)]
*  Yeah, no doubt about it. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7YnYz-6-Uk&t=371.2s)]
*  And I'm struck by the operational security. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7YnYz-6-Uk&t=372.2s)]
*  You know, but you've got to also say the day after the president mentioned within two weeks, [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7YnYz-6-Uk&t=373.2s)]
*  the next day, the Iranian foreign minister came out and said, nope, no interest in negotiating. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7YnYz-6-Uk&t=378.2s)]
*  That could have accelerated the timeline, but that would only be speculation on my part. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7YnYz-6-Uk&t=383.36s)]
*  That's right. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7YnYz-6-Uk&t=387.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7YnYz-6-Uk&t=389.12s)]
*  And they have the opportunity. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7YnYz-6-Uk&t=390.32s)]
*  They had it multiple times. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7YnYz-6-Uk&t=391.32s)]
*  The foreign minister shut it down in Europe. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7YnYz-6-Uk&t=393.0s)]
*  So we'll see what comes next. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7YnYz-6-Uk&t=395.48s)]
*  All right, Brett Baer, as always, we appreciate you being with us and special report every [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7YnYz-6-Uk&t=397.08s)]
*  weeknight, 6 Eastern, right here on the Fox News Channel. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7YnYz-6-Uk&t=401.8s)]
