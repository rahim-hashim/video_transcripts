# 'The Five' on Trump's response to Israel-Iran war
**Fox News - World News:** [June 17, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWC2Nak_0EQ)
*  So President Trump is now facing a big choice, either help Israel destroy Iran's nuke facility [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWC2Nak_0EQ&t=0.0s)]
*  or continue to negotiate. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWC2Nak_0EQ&t=4.96s)]
*  Axios reports that Trump is seriously considering joining the war on Iran and launching a strike [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWC2Nak_0EQ&t=6.72s)]
*  against its nuclear facilities. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWC2Nak_0EQ&t=11.44s)]
*  However, President Trump is still open to a deal, but says it could depend on his mood. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWC2Nak_0EQ&t=13.16s)]
*  Were you open to negotiating with the Iranians right now, or do you want to wait? [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWC2Nak_0EQ&t=18.68s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWC2Nak_0EQ&t=23.04s)]
*  I've been negotiating. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWC2Nak_0EQ&t=24.04s)]
*  I told them to do the deal. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWC2Nak_0EQ&t=25.04s)]
*  They should have done the deal. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWC2Nak_0EQ&t=26.36s)]
*  The cities have been blown to pieces. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWC2Nak_0EQ&t=28.16s)]
*  We've lost a lot of people. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWC2Nak_0EQ&t=29.96s)]
*  They should have done the deal. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWC2Nak_0EQ&t=32.32s)]
*  I told them do the deal. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWC2Nak_0EQ&t=33.32s)]
*  So I don't know. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWC2Nak_0EQ&t=35.64s)]
*  I'm not too much in a mood to negotiate. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWC2Nak_0EQ&t=36.64s)]
*  So Kayleigh, on the right, we have a big difference of opinion here, but unlike the left, we're [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWC2Nak_0EQ&t=39.32s)]
*  not afraid to show it. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWC2Nak_0EQ&t=44.96s)]
*  And you know all the players involved. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWC2Nak_0EQ&t=46.519999999999996s)]
*  So I guess I got to ask you, I want to talk about that thing. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWC2Nak_0EQ&t=48.6s)]
*  Should it matter that the mood of America, they voted for a guy who wanted to concentrate [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWC2Nak_0EQ&t=51.879999999999995s)]
*  on America first. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWC2Nak_0EQ&t=56.28s)]
*  We got the guy in, and now we're here almost participating in a war. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWC2Nak_0EQ&t=58.32s)]
*  How do you explain that, say, to your MAGA friends, you know, the Tuckers and the Bannons, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWC2Nak_0EQ&t=62.88s)]
*  you know, or then you have the other side, the Rubios and the Mike Waltzes. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWC2Nak_0EQ&t=70.08s)]
*  How do you, what do you say? [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWC2Nak_0EQ&t=73.8s)]
*  So I observed America first, upfront and personal in term one. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWC2Nak_0EQ&t=76.2s)]
*  And what I learned about President Trump, he's a man of action, not words. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWC2Nak_0EQ&t=80.8s)]
*  He's not a novell chamberlain. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWC2Nak_0EQ&t=83.86s)]
*  He is a Churchill. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWC2Nak_0EQ&t=85.48s)]
*  He is not someone who sits in a beach chair and lets history happen to him. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWC2Nak_0EQ&t=86.48s)]
*  He makes history. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWC2Nak_0EQ&t=90.72s)]
*  He acts strategically. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWC2Nak_0EQ&t=91.84s)]
*  He acts when it's in our interest. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWC2Nak_0EQ&t=92.84s)]
*  When he took out Soleimani, when he took out Al-Baghdadi, when he acted in Syria, when they [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWC2Nak_0EQ&t=94.7s)]
*  use chemical weapons on their own people. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWC2Nak_0EQ&t=99.54s)]
*  Every dictator in the world observed that. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWC2Nak_0EQ&t=101.56s)]
*  And you know what happened? [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWC2Nak_0EQ&t=103.48s)]
*  Putin, for the first time in four presidencies, did not invade a sovereign country. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWC2Nak_0EQ&t=104.84s)]
*  The last and final year of his presidency, not a single American troop died in Afghanistan. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWC2Nak_0EQ&t=109.30000000000001s)]
*  ISIS dismantled. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWC2Nak_0EQ&t=116.12s)]
*  He's not words, he is action. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWC2Nak_0EQ&t=117.88000000000001s)]
*  How is Bannon and the folks that you mentioned and the people advocating for just sitting [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWC2Nak_0EQ&t=120.60000000000001s)]
*  back and taking it easy, how are they any different than Biden's foreign policy? [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWC2Nak_0EQ&t=124.80000000000001s)]
*  Biden's foreign policy was, I say don't and Putin does. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWC2Nak_0EQ&t=129.56s)]
*  I say don't and the Taliban takes over Afghanistan. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWC2Nak_0EQ&t=133.20000000000002s)]
*  I say don't and two global wars start on my watch. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWC2Nak_0EQ&t=136.48000000000002s)]
*  That is the Biden foreign policy. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWC2Nak_0EQ&t=140.24s)]
*  That is by no definition America first. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWC2Nak_0EQ&t=142.45999999999998s)]
*  Iran has had five decades, five decades, almost half a century to talk. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWC2Nak_0EQ&t=145.22s)]
*  And what they've done instead, killed 609 American troops in Iraq. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWC2Nak_0EQ&t=149.0s)]
*  What they've done is put an assassination plot on President Trump's head. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWC2Nak_0EQ&t=153.2s)]
*  What they've done is take American hostages and wreak havoc on the world. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWC2Nak_0EQ&t=157.17999999999998s)]
*  America first is not sitting in a beach chair and using words. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWC2Nak_0EQ&t=161.33999999999997s)]
*  It's taking decisive action when we can take out Fordow, the one swoop of an airplane. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWC2Nak_0EQ&t=164.11999999999998s)]
*  All right, Jesse. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWC2Nak_0EQ&t=170.54000000000002s)]
*  We know from Trump's words and deeds, he's pretty stingy with blood and treasure. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWC2Nak_0EQ&t=172.5s)]
*  He's not a guy who's into wars. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWC2Nak_0EQ&t=177.14000000000001s)]
*  So what do you think he's going to do? [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWC2Nak_0EQ&t=179.46s)]
*  Is this going to be something highly specific? [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWC2Nak_0EQ&t=180.82000000000002s)]
*  If he gets involved, why isn't anybody asking what's next? [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWC2Nak_0EQ&t=182.74s)]
*  We are and some people on the right are asking that. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWC2Nak_0EQ&t=186.84s)]
*  The left isn't asking anything. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWC2Nak_0EQ&t=189.54000000000002s)]
*  They've just totally withdrawn themselves from this debate. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWC2Nak_0EQ&t=191.18s)]
*  So right now it's a maximum pressure campaign and we control the air and we have sanctions [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWC2Nak_0EQ&t=195.54s)]
*  and espionage activities and they have no proxies. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWC2Nak_0EQ&t=201.01999999999998s)]
*  So Donald Trump is saying to the Ayatollah, we know where you eat, we know where you sleep. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWC2Nak_0EQ&t=204.28s)]
*  I'm the one keeping you alive. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWC2Nak_0EQ&t=209.26s)]
*  Bibi, Bibi wants to knock you out and put you six feet under. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWC2Nak_0EQ&t=211.45999999999998s)]
*  I'm keeping you alive. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWC2Nak_0EQ&t=215.62s)]
*  So here are your options. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWC2Nak_0EQ&t=216.73999999999998s)]
*  Option number one is you come right to the negotiating table, you sign a deal and we [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWC2Nak_0EQ&t=217.94s)]
*  take your nuclear facilities offline and out of the country or we take them out with bunker [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWC2Nak_0EQ&t=223.34s)]
*  busters. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWC2Nak_0EQ&t=230.34s)]
*  We can do it the peaceful way or we can do it the violent way. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWC2Nak_0EQ&t=231.3s)]
*  It's actually a choice that Khomeini has to make himself. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWC2Nak_0EQ&t=234.12s)]
*  Now there are risks associated with using the bunker busters. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWC2Nak_0EQ&t=238.74s)]
*  You're basically taking out the only card that they have left to play. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWC2Nak_0EQ&t=244.12s)]
*  That's all their leverage. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWC2Nak_0EQ&t=247.94s)]
*  So they could lash out unpredictably, suicide bombers, dirty bombs, missile strikes against [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWC2Nak_0EQ&t=249.36s)]
*  naval assets or bases in there. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWC2Nak_0EQ&t=256.76s)]
*  But it looks like this is moving so fast. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWC2Nak_0EQ&t=259.44s)]
*  Our intelligence said that Netanyahu had decided he was going to strike Iran alone or with [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWC2Nak_0EQ&t=262.16s)]
*  the United States after October 7th. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWC2Nak_0EQ&t=267.92s)]
*  There was nothing we could say that would stop him, even if we were negotiating over [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWC2Nak_0EQ&t=269.76s)]
*  this deal. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWC2Nak_0EQ&t=273.78000000000003s)]
*  And so Trump was like no and told him to chill twice. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWC2Nak_0EQ&t=274.92s)]
*  Bibi asked for bunker busters. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWC2Nak_0EQ&t=278.6s)]
*  Trump told him to back off, didn't give them to him, but then felt the Iranians were stringing [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWC2Nak_0EQ&t=281.04s)]
*  him along during these negotiations. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWC2Nak_0EQ&t=285.12s)]
*  And after the deadline eclipsed, the day after he greenlit the Israelis to go in hard. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWC2Nak_0EQ&t=286.88s)]
*  And now he likes what they've done. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWC2Nak_0EQ&t=292.92s)]
*  They've been effective with this air campaign. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWC2Nak_0EQ&t=294.72s)]
*  And now is the choice, is he going to use these bunker busters to get the United States [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWC2Nak_0EQ&t=297.12s)]
*  evolved offensively in the campaign? [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWC2Nak_0EQ&t=301.98s)]
*  So far he's been very deliberate and he's keeping all options on the table and so far [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWC2Nak_0EQ&t=304.44s)]
*  so good. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWC2Nak_0EQ&t=309.64s)]
*  We hope he makes the right call. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWC2Nak_0EQ&t=310.64s)]
*  Emily, how do you reconcile the differences of opinion in the MAGA movement? [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWC2Nak_0EQ&t=312.24s)]
*  You have, I mean, I'm grappling with it. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWC2Nak_0EQ&t=318.08s)]
*  I was, you know, part of the charm for me was that we weren't going to deal with foreign [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWC2Nak_0EQ&t=320.48s)]
*  wars. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWC2Nak_0EQ&t=325.24s)]
*  But at the same time, I understand the threat. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWC2Nak_0EQ&t=326.24s)]
*  I don't know where to, and I don't want my opinion assigned to me from John Bolton, you [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWC2Nak_0EQ&t=328.72s)]
*  know, or whoever. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWC2Nak_0EQ&t=333.84s)]
*  To that point, I think we elected a certain individual to represent all of our interests. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWC2Nak_0EQ&t=336.03999999999996s)]
*  And we know that his primary or final objective is peace through strength and to have no eternal [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWC2Nak_0EQ&t=341.35999999999996s)]
*  wars. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWC2Nak_0EQ&t=347.71999999999997s)]
*  And so it would be that candidate, i.e. the commander in chief, President Trump, that [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWC2Nak_0EQ&t=348.71999999999997s)]
*  would hold our faith that we know come hell or high water, he's going to get to that [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWC2Nak_0EQ&t=352.79999999999995s)]
*  endpoint. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWC2Nak_0EQ&t=357.23999999999995s)]
*  But I agree with you. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWC2Nak_0EQ&t=358.23999999999995s)]
*  And that's why we see that kaleidoscope of opinions that people have, right? [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWC2Nak_0EQ&t=359.23999999999995s)]
*  Intervention. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWC2Nak_0EQ&t=362.2s)]
*  How much is that? [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWC2Nak_0EQ&t=363.56s)]
*  Right. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWC2Nak_0EQ&t=364.56s)]
*  There's different definitions, essentially, of intervention. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWC2Nak_0EQ&t=365.56s)]
*  Some consider even the use of 1B22, that that is indeed intervening, that that is potentially [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWC2Nak_0EQ&t=366.56s)]
*  risking blood and treasure. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWC2Nak_0EQ&t=373.28s)]
*  And there are others that say, no, this is exactly, you know, sort of a minimal step. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWC2Nak_0EQ&t=374.47999999999996s)]
*  And anything short of intense investment is less than what we're talking about here. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWC2Nak_0EQ&t=378.2s)]
*  But I think your question of what's next and asking that question, that's the right question. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWC2Nak_0EQ&t=383.88s)]
*  Because the reality is we inherited what we learned from this prior administration [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWC2Nak_0EQ&t=390.4s)]
*  is that inaction furthers the interests of our enemies. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWC2Nak_0EQ&t=393.67999999999995s)]
*  Iran has been emboldened and equipped and was incentivized to terrorize Israel and also [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWC2Nak_0EQ&t=397.84s)]
*  American interests over and over and over again. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWC2Nak_0EQ&t=403.76s)]
*  So we inherit that situation. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWC2Nak_0EQ&t=405.96s)]
*  Michael Warren said this, the Israeli former ambassador to the U.S., that with this scenario, [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWC2Nak_0EQ&t=407.67999999999995s)]
*  President Trump has the opportunity to become the greatest peacemaker of the century because [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWC2Nak_0EQ&t=412.47999999999996s)]
*  everyone else just tried to curb the nuclear threat. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWC2Nak_0EQ&t=416.41999999999996s)]
*  But here we're trying to potentially totally eradicate it. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWC2Nak_0EQ&t=419.56s)]
*  And then what if the result is actually the annihilation, the failure of the Islamic regime? [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWC2Nak_0EQ&t=423.47999999999996s)]
*  And then we ask what's next? [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWC2Nak_0EQ&t=427.84s)]
*  Well, what would be the positive? [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWC2Nak_0EQ&t=428.91999999999996s)]
*  Look, not irrespective of the big Charlie Foxtrot that that could be, an enemy whose [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWC2Nak_0EQ&t=430.24s)]
*  identity is based on the death and destruction of America, the great Satan and Israel, extinguished. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWC2Nak_0EQ&t=436.03999999999996s)]
*  Sovereignty of the countries around it and the demilitarization potentially of Yemen [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWC2Nak_0EQ&t=442.28s)]
*  and Gaza, expanding the Abraham Accords, the impact on our security and our global [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWC2Nak_0EQ&t=445.6s)]
*  economy is truly direct. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWC2Nak_0EQ&t=451.24s)]
*  So for me, I think the other alternative is waiting around for them to blackmail us, for [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWC2Nak_0EQ&t=453.56s)]
*  Iran to say, oh, guess what? [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWC2Nak_0EQ&t=458.64000000000004s)]
*  Oh, you're not going to do this? [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWC2Nak_0EQ&t=460.12s)]
*  Here's a nuke. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWC2Nak_0EQ&t=461.96000000000004s)]
*  So I think this, the only option for peace is some type of intervention. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWC2Nak_0EQ&t=462.96000000000004s)]
*  And I trust our commander in chief to represent that well. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWC2Nak_0EQ&t=466.28000000000003s)]
*  So Jessica, this is a situation where you find yourself on the same side as President [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWC2Nak_0EQ&t=469.24s)]
*  Trump. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWC2Nak_0EQ&t=474.74s)]
*  And both both of you have an affinity towards Israel, correct? [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWC2Nak_0EQ&t=475.74s)]
*  Definitely. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWC2Nak_0EQ&t=479.42s)]
*  So what is your take on what he's doing and what America should do and what's next? [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWC2Nak_0EQ&t=480.42s)]
*  So my take on what he's doing is that he's doing what Bibi wants to do. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWC2Nak_0EQ&t=489.54s)]
*  So he had made it clear over and over that he wanted a diplomatic path. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWC2Nak_0EQ&t=494.58s)]
*  And yes, it was day 61 and he had said you have 60 days, but he had been planning to [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWC2Nak_0EQ&t=498.7s)]
*  have his team meet just two days later on the Sunday to try to go through the sixth [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWC2Nak_0EQ&t=503.58s)]
*  round of talks. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWC2Nak_0EQ&t=507.9s)]
*  And he he wanted a new new deal, even though the parameters of it were basically just the [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWC2Nak_0EQ&t=508.9s)]
*  old deal that he had ripped up. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWC2Nak_0EQ&t=513.8199999999999s)]
*  So Bibi decided this is my chance. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWC2Nak_0EQ&t=515.48s)]
*  And Trump had no choice but to go along with it. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWC2Nak_0EQ&t=518.02s)]
*  And the New York Times is reporting today just to make everyone at the table feel a [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWC2Nak_0EQ&t=520.3s)]
*  little bit more powerful that not only was it that this is what Israel decided to do, [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWC2Nak_0EQ&t=523.9s)]
*  that Donald Trump liked Fox's coverage of the Operation Rising Lion. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWC2Nak_0EQ&t=528.22s)]
*  And everyone was talking about what genius it was because it was a genius operation on [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWC2Nak_0EQ&t=535.14s)]
*  the part of the Israelis and that he wanted to be able to claim some credit for himself [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWC2Nak_0EQ&t=538.74s)]
*  of that. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWC2Nak_0EQ&t=542.42s)]
*  And, you know, America first, I get it, Trump doctrines. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWC2Nak_0EQ&t=543.42s)]
*  He's not someone that deals in a ton of specificity. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWC2Nak_0EQ&t=546.78s)]
*  They can vary. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWC2Nak_0EQ&t=550.5s)]
*  It really is. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWC2Nak_0EQ&t=551.96s)]
*  Look at his choices. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWC2Nak_0EQ&t=552.96s)]
*  You've been in the situation room with him. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWC2Nak_0EQ&t=553.96s)]
*  I can read. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWC2Nak_0EQ&t=555.8199999999999s)]
*  He deals in complete specificity. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWC2Nak_0EQ&t=556.82s)]
*  OK, so the one he took out Soleimani, he took out Al-Baghdadi. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWC2Nak_0EQ&t=557.82s)]
*  I heard you and I heard that he was Winston Churchill. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWC2Nak_0EQ&t=561.5s)]
*  But if he's saying on Truth Social today. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWC2Nak_0EQ&t=564.1400000000001s)]
*  What was Joe Biden? [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWC2Nak_0EQ&t=565.86s)]
*  Did that work? [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWC2Nak_0EQ&t=566.86s)]
*  Did that work? [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWC2Nak_0EQ&t=567.86s)]
*  The beach chair foreign policy? [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWC2Nak_0EQ&t=568.86s)]
*  Just let me finish. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWC2Nak_0EQ&t=570.0200000000001s)]
*  It's not that bad. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWC2Nak_0EQ&t=571.4200000000001s)]
*  It's just two minutes. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWC2Nak_0EQ&t=572.4200000000001s)]
*  I'll be done. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWC2Nak_0EQ&t=573.4200000000001s)]
*  A minute and a half now. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWC2Nak_0EQ&t=574.4200000000001s)]
*  Probably just a minute. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWC2Nak_0EQ&t=575.4200000000001s)]
*  You're down to a minute fifteen. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWC2Nak_0EQ&t=576.4200000000001s)]
*  OK, so he's a minute. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWC2Nak_0EQ&t=577.4200000000001s)]
*  OK, he's posting using we. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWC2Nak_0EQ&t=579.94s)]
*  That's the pronoun that he's using for this. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWC2Nak_0EQ&t=584.5400000000001s)]
*  So he's saying we know where you are and we're deciding not to kill you. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWC2Nak_0EQ&t=585.98s)]
*  We're in control of the Iranian skies. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWC2Nak_0EQ&t=589.6600000000001s)]
*  We have the implication that we are now in this fight with them, that it has happened [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWC2Nak_0EQ&t=591.9200000000001s)]
*  already, whether or not we give them the B-2 bombers and take out the nuclear site that's [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWC2Nak_0EQ&t=596.3000000000001s)]
*  built into the mountain, Forto, I think it's called. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWC2Nak_0EQ&t=601.46s)]
*  What's also interesting about what's going on is that it appears that Tulsi Gabbard has [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWC2Nak_0EQ&t=604.6600000000001s)]
*  been iced out. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWC2Nak_0EQ&t=608.46s)]
*  So Peter Ducey was reporting earlier that there was a meeting last week at Camp David. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWC2Nak_0EQ&t=609.74s)]
*  He called the intel chiefs, Tulsi not invited. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWC2Nak_0EQ&t=614.78s)]
*  And Donald Trump yesterday, when he was speaking on Air Force One, someone said, you know, [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWC2Nak_0EQ&t=617.7s)]
*  Tulsi testified just back in March that Iran wasn't building a nuclear weapon. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWC2Nak_0EQ&t=622.74s)]
*  And he goes, I don't care what she said. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWC2Nak_0EQ&t=626.62s)]
*  And I have a lot of disagreements with Tulsi and her policy, but she is a very clear war [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWC2Nak_0EQ&t=628.9s)]
*  dove. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWC2Nak_0EQ&t=635.14s)]
*  Right. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWC2Nak_0EQ&t=636.14s)]
*  That was part of the reason I think like that. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWC2Nak_0EQ&t=637.14s)]
*  Why didn't you invite her? [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWC2Nak_0EQ&t=639.42s)]
*  She's a D. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWC2Nak_0EQ&t=640.42s)]
*  I'm saying is Trump's response was to the reporter, meaning I don't care. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWC2Nak_0EQ&t=641.4599999999999s)]
*  But it was about the question, not necessarily. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWC2Nak_0EQ&t=645.54s)]
*  Well, then why didn't she get to go to Camp David? [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWC2Nak_0EQ&t=647.5s)]
*  I mean, you're talking about gossip, Jessica. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWC2Nak_0EQ&t=649.02s)]
*  We're talking about war and peace, death and destruction. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWC2Nak_0EQ&t=650.66s)]
*  And you're talking about gossip. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWC2Nak_0EQ&t=654.18s)]
*  We asked you or he asked you what you thought of this situation. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWC2Nak_0EQ&t=656.9399999999999s)]
*  And it's all gossip. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWC2Nak_0EQ&t=660.8199999999999s)]
*  And like, it doesn't matter. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWC2Nak_0EQ&t=661.9399999999999s)]
*  All that stuff. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWC2Nak_0EQ&t=663.6999999999999s)]
*  I'm sorry that I didn't call it. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWC2Nak_0EQ&t=664.6999999999999s)]
*  What do you think we should do about Iran? [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWC2Nak_0EQ&t=665.6999999999999s)]
*  What do you think the commander in chief has done so far? [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWC2Nak_0EQ&t=667.86s)]
*  What do you think about our allies? [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWC2Nak_0EQ&t=670.54s)]
*  The balance of power in the Middle East? [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWC2Nak_0EQ&t=672.14s)]
*  You don't have anything to say. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWC2Nak_0EQ&t=674.1s)]
*  You're just dead. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWC2Nak_0EQ&t=675.58s)]
*  It sounds like us weakly. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWC2Nak_0EQ&t=676.58s)]
*  It's harder to defend two global wars and Jessica's defense in the losing of a country [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWC2Nak_0EQ&t=678.58s)]
*  to the Taliban. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWC2Nak_0EQ&t=682.22s)]
*  That's much harder to do. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWC2Nak_0EQ&t=683.22s)]
*  Totally capable of defending myself. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWC2Nak_0EQ&t=684.22s)]
*  And I did express what I thought about it. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWC2Nak_0EQ&t=685.94s)]
*  I think that Bibi is in charge of what's going on. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWC2Nak_0EQ&t=687.66s)]
*  And do you think that's good or bad, Jessica? [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWC2Nak_0EQ&t=690.42s)]
*  I think it is a lot easier to say that Iran deserves to lose its nuclear program and to [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWC2Nak_0EQ&t=692.38s)]
*  be wiped out than what's going on on the Gaza side. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWC2Nak_0EQ&t=696.94s)]
*  And he has a lot more support for that, including from the Republican base. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWC2Nak_0EQ&t=700.02s)]
*  There's interesting polling that the Senate, the GOP senators are using, which show actually [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWC2Nak_0EQ&t=703.22s)]
*  that the MAGA base is supportive of Kayleigh's nodding. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWC2Nak_0EQ&t=708.1s)]
*  So now we're in agreement. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWC2Nak_0EQ&t=710.7s)]
*  I agree with you. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWC2Nak_0EQ&t=711.7s)]
*  I agree with you. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWC2Nak_0EQ&t=712.7s)]
*  Very highly detailed conversation. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWC2Nak_0EQ&t=713.7s)]
