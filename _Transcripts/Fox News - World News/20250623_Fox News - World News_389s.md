# Here's what the Trump Doctrine looks like
**Fox News - World News:** [June 23, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBMmnkFRqK0)
*  In just 12 days, President Trump, in coordination with Israel and our Arab partners, he has [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBMmnkFRqK0&t=0.0s)]
*  totally reshaped the future of the Middle East and the world. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBMmnkFRqK0&t=5.96s)]
*  The naysayers, the isolationists, were dead wrong. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBMmnkFRqK0&t=9.44s)]
*  World War III is not happening. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBMmnkFRqK0&t=12.52s)]
*  Instead, President Trump, he stood up to the worst bully terrorist nation in the entire [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBMmnkFRqK0&t=14.24s)]
*  world and on the planet, and now peace is possible tonight. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBMmnkFRqK0&t=18.64s)]
*  Thankfully, the Islamic Republic of Iran has been totally defanged. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBMmnkFRqK0&t=22.96s)]
*  Their nuclear program has been obliterated. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBMmnkFRqK0&t=27.44s)]
*  Their scientists are dead. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBMmnkFRqK0&t=30.200000000000003s)]
*  Their top generals, many of them, are dead. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBMmnkFRqK0&t=31.94s)]
*  Most of their missile systems have been destroyed. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBMmnkFRqK0&t=34.68s)]
*  Their proxies are in tatters. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBMmnkFRqK0&t=37.120000000000005s)]
*  And the so-called elite Revolutionary Guard, they have been ripped to shreds, with more [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBMmnkFRqK0&t=39.480000000000004s)]
*  top generals being killed by the Israelis. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBMmnkFRqK0&t=43.88s)]
*  And after all of that, Iran is all of a sudden now ready to come to the table, because they [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBMmnkFRqK0&t=46.64s)]
*  have no leverage at all whatsoever. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBMmnkFRqK0&t=51.64s)]
*  This is what peace through strength, the Trump doctrine, actually looks like. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBMmnkFRqK0&t=54.58s)]
*  Can this be a lasting peace? [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBMmnkFRqK0&t=58.66s)]
*  I can't give you that answer tonight. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBMmnkFRqK0&t=60.3s)]
*  Only time will tell. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBMmnkFRqK0&t=62.22s)]
*  Now, of course, it is possible, as the Iranian regime, they may simply be trying to buy time [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBMmnkFRqK0&t=63.22s)]
*  so they can rearm. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBMmnkFRqK0&t=69.3s)]
*  The devil will be in the details of a final deal, and Secretary of State Marco Rubio and [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBMmnkFRqK0&t=70.94s)]
*  our Mideast envoy Steve Woodcock, they are now in the process of hammering these issues [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBMmnkFRqK0&t=76.5s)]
*  out. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBMmnkFRqK0&t=80.98s)]
*  A final deal, obviously, would insist on any place, anywhere, any time inspections. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBMmnkFRqK0&t=81.98s)]
*  The Iranians need to stop providing money and weaponry to all of their proxies. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBMmnkFRqK0&t=86.66s)]
*  That means Hamas, Hezbollah, Islamic Jihad. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBMmnkFRqK0&t=91.54s)]
*  That would be the militias in Syria, the militia in Iraq. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBMmnkFRqK0&t=95.14s)]
*  And that would be the Houthi rebels. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBMmnkFRqK0&t=99.78s)]
*  And frankly, they should recognize Israel's right to exist once and for all if we want [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBMmnkFRqK0&t=101.5s)]
*  a real and lasting peace. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBMmnkFRqK0&t=107.30000000000001s)]
*  Or, we will have to assume, they simply want to build out a bigger, more lethal ballistic [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBMmnkFRqK0&t=111.3s)]
*  missile system. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBMmnkFRqK0&t=115.22s)]
*  Remember, they have ballistic missiles now at 2,000 pounds. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBMmnkFRqK0&t=116.22s)]
*  They are looking and aiming to go to 4,000 pounds, and they are firing those missiles [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBMmnkFRqK0&t=120.34s)]
*  into heavily populated areas. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBMmnkFRqK0&t=124.89999999999999s)]
*  The fact that we can even discuss this tonight is only because of President Donald J. Trump. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBMmnkFRqK0&t=127.06s)]
*  This is what Obama and Biden could and never would do with their policies of appeasement. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBMmnkFRqK0&t=132.48s)]
*  Remember, that included bribing the Iranians with billions of dollars in cash and other [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBMmnkFRqK0&t=137.62s)]
*  currency being flown into Iran for the mullahs of Iran in cargo planes. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBMmnkFRqK0&t=142.54000000000002s)]
*  And in the case of Joe Biden not enforcing Donald Trump's sanctions that were bankrupting [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBMmnkFRqK0&t=148.62s)]
*  the Republic of Iran, their feckless diplomacy, their appeasement policies allowed the mullahs [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBMmnkFRqK0&t=153.98000000000002s)]
*  of Iran to get within weeks of a nuclear weapon. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBMmnkFRqK0&t=159.78s)]
*  It allowed them to build out their weaponry and foment terror all throughout the region [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBMmnkFRqK0&t=163.7s)]
*  and the world and kill Americans. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBMmnkFRqK0&t=167.88s)]
*  And of course, they developed these facilities with all that money deep underground, including [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBMmnkFRqK0&t=170.46s)]
*  the Fordow nuclear site that took years to build deep under this mountain that, of course, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBMmnkFRqK0&t=175.56s)]
*  is now obliterated. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBMmnkFRqK0&t=181.3s)]
*  But tonight, one thing is clear to the entire world. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBMmnkFRqK0&t=182.74s)]
*  The technology, the logistics, the skill of the U.S. military is unmatched. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBMmnkFRqK0&t=185.62s)]
*  No other country comes close. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBMmnkFRqK0&t=190.94s)]
*  After decades of being jerked around by and threatened by the Iranians, it took just a [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBMmnkFRqK0&t=192.98s)]
*  mere few hours for the USA to obliterate their nuclear ambitions. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBMmnkFRqK0&t=198.1s)]
*  Over the weekend, nine B-2 stealth bombers launched from Missouri. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBMmnkFRqK0&t=203.38s)]
*  Two were decoys that flew west. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBMmnkFRqK0&t=207.85999999999999s)]
*  Seven others flew east over the Atlantic. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBMmnkFRqK0&t=210.01999999999998s)]
*  And of course, these bombers were refueled midair, ultimately entered Iran's airspace [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBMmnkFRqK0&t=213.29999999999998s)]
*  completely undetected. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBMmnkFRqK0&t=218.42s)]
*  And according to my sources, the U.S. was even able to trigger false alerts and coordinates [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBMmnkFRqK0&t=220.34s)]
*  on Iran's air defense systems, causing them to shoot at what they thought were planes, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBMmnkFRqK0&t=225.94s)]
*  but was absolutely nothing in the sky. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBMmnkFRqK0&t=231.54000000000002s)]
*  Incredible, you know, misdirection on the part of our military. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBMmnkFRqK0&t=233.98000000000002s)]
*  The bombers then dropped, as Jennifer Griffin said, 14 massive bunker buster bombs while [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBMmnkFRqK0&t=237.98000000000002s)]
*  a single submarine hundreds of miles away was able to deliver a payload of 30 Tomahawk [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBMmnkFRqK0&t=244.26000000000002s)]
*  cruise missiles. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBMmnkFRqK0&t=250.1s)]
*  Deflection, precision and ultimate perfection. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBMmnkFRqK0&t=251.22s)]
*  None of the U.S. planes were fired upon. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBMmnkFRqK0&t=254.82s)]
*  None of the munitions were intercepted. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBMmnkFRqK0&t=257.14s)]
*  All of the targets were successfully hit. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBMmnkFRqK0&t=259.54s)]
*  All was destroyed. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBMmnkFRqK0&t=262.1s)]
*  And all of our U.S. servicemen and women thankfully made it out of Iran's airspace. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBMmnkFRqK0&t=263.7s)]
*  What is a very difficult military operation, thankfully, thank God, safe and sound. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBMmnkFRqK0&t=270.26s)]
*  Make no mistake. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBMmnkFRqK0&t=275.7s)]
*  President Trump didn't just decimate Iran's nuclear ambitions. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBMmnkFRqK0&t=276.97999999999996s)]
*  He sent a message the entire world was watching on Saturday night. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBMmnkFRqK0&t=281.14s)]
*  The United States of America can hit any target at any time, anywhere in the world, [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBMmnkFRqK0&t=285.78s)]
*  with precision, with planes sitting on a tarmac in the middle of America. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBMmnkFRqK0&t=291.21999999999997s)]
*  I promise you, Russia, China, North Korea, all of them were paying very close attention [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBMmnkFRqK0&t=295.7s)]
*  to what was unfolding on Saturday. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBMmnkFRqK0&t=302.02s)]
*  And meanwhile, Iran's supposedly powerful allies, Russia, China, nowhere to be found. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBMmnkFRqK0&t=304.34s)]
*  In fact, China even warned Iran not to block the straits of Hormuz one day after Secretary [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBMmnkFRqK0&t=310.34s)]
*  of State Marco Rubio urged China to do just that. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBMmnkFRqK0&t=317.38s)]
*  And thanks to President Trump, thanks to his team, thanks to our amazing military men and [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBMmnkFRqK0&t=321.14s)]
*  women, American strength is back and better than ever and stronger than ever. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBMmnkFRqK0&t=326.02s)]
*  And tonight, the world is thankfully a safer place. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBMmnkFRqK0&t=330.5s)]
*  As President Trump stated over and over and over again, and the Iranians would not listen, [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBMmnkFRqK0&t=333.78s)]
*  they must never and will never get a nuclear weapon. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBMmnkFRqK0&t=339.46s)]
*  Promise made, promise kept. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBMmnkFRqK0&t=342.58s)]
*  As for the peace deal, you've got to give the president a lot of credit for trying. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBMmnkFRqK0&t=344.65999999999997s)]
*  Once again, Iran, they have another opportunity if they choose it for peace. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBMmnkFRqK0&t=348.97999999999996s)]
*  How about they start by recognizing Israel and stop providing their proxies, [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBMmnkFRqK0&t=355.7s)]
*  the weaponry, so they're fomenting terror, not only in the region but around the world. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBMmnkFRqK0&t=360.9s)]
*  Now, only time will tell if they do, but trust, but verify peace through strength [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBMmnkFRqK0&t=366.34s)]
*  is now the foundation of President Donald Trump's doctrine. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBMmnkFRqK0&t=372.65999999999997s)]
