# We lock up toothpaste in a store but we don't lock up criminals: Curtis Sliwa
**Fox News - World News:** [June 26, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUQWFEnkX44)
*  Republican nominee Curtis Lee will join us right now. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUQWFEnkX44&t=0.0s)]
*  By the way, I'd even say to Andrew Cuomo, join. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUQWFEnkX44&t=3.1s)]
*  Run, Andrew, run. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUQWFEnkX44&t=6.04s)]
*  Because the more Democrats that run, that means the more—the vote will get split, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUQWFEnkX44&t=7.46s)]
*  and the odds of you becoming mayor, guess what, go up dramatically. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUQWFEnkX44&t=12.46s)]
*  And I know you're serious. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUQWFEnkX44&t=16.36s)]
*  Look, there are two people that I've walked the streets of New York with and been outside [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUQWFEnkX44&t=17.36s)]
*  with that get reaction like—you're with Donald Trump, and this is long before he ever [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUQWFEnkX44&t=22.48s)]
*  considered running for president. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUQWFEnkX44&t=27.979999999999997s)]
*  Trump, Trump, hey, you know, in New York style. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUQWFEnkX44&t=29.36s)]
*  Curtis, every time I've been in the subway with you, every time I've been in the streets [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUQWFEnkX44&t=33.699999999999996s)]
*  with you, you're loved in New York. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUQWFEnkX44&t=37.78s)]
*  Everyone knows you. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUQWFEnkX44&t=40.42s)]
*  You know what? [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUQWFEnkX44&t=41.42s)]
*  You would fix, you know, law and order, safety, security, the schools, make a better business [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUQWFEnkX44&t=42.42s)]
*  environment. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUQWFEnkX44&t=46.82s)]
*  Where do you see this? [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUQWFEnkX44&t=47.82s)]
*  John, that's why I need you and your audience, your vast audience, to help save New York [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUQWFEnkX44&t=48.82s)]
*  City. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUQWFEnkX44&t=54.62s)]
*  If you left because of this, so many others have left. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUQWFEnkX44&t=56.339999999999996s)]
*  Just coming up here to the studios again today, homeless people emotionally disturb garbage [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUQWFEnkX44&t=58.66s)]
*  everywhere, the quality of life miserable. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUQWFEnkX44&t=65.3s)]
*  One of the outtakes of the election is people were complaining about the lack of affordable [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUQWFEnkX44&t=67.78s)]
*  housing, the fact that the cost of living is skyrocketing, and the crime in New York [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUQWFEnkX44&t=72.58s)]
*  City, we lock up toothpaste in a drug store and we don't lock up criminals. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUQWFEnkX44&t=78.38s)]
*  People have had enough. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUQWFEnkX44&t=84.52s)]
*  I want to go back to these Democrats, and Sean, you know me from 46 years. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUQWFEnkX44&t=86.42s)]
*  I am the consummate New Yorker. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUQWFEnkX44&t=90.32s)]
*  I haven't fled or moved or gone anywhere else. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUQWFEnkX44&t=92.16s)]
*  I was birthed here in New York City, and my whole campaign is based on improve, don't [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUQWFEnkX44&t=95.11999999999999s)]
*  move. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUQWFEnkX44&t=100.28s)]
*  And what I have is a plan. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUQWFEnkX44&t=101.28s)]
*  You go to Sliwa4NYC.com. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUQWFEnkX44&t=102.67999999999999s)]
*  That's Sliwa4NYC.com. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUQWFEnkX44&t=106.16s)]
*  And help me save this city, because as goes New York, so goes America. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUQWFEnkX44&t=109.5s)]
*  We saw that in Chicago with Socialist Mayor Johnson. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUQWFEnkX44&t=114.32s)]
*  Everything that he did failed. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUQWFEnkX44&t=118.69999999999999s)]
*  And now Mondami is going to do exactly the same thing with the help of AOC, Bernie Sanders. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUQWFEnkX44&t=121.19999999999999s)]
*  And now there are Democrats jumping on board. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUQWFEnkX44&t=128.54s)]
*  Tonight, Bill Clinton endorsed Mondami. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUQWFEnkX44&t=131.28s)]
*  That's right, Bill Clinton, traditional Democrat, Chuck Schumer, they're all jumping on board. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUQWFEnkX44&t=136.1s)]
*  I'm the only one who can stop him, Sean. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUQWFEnkX44&t=141.64s)]
*  You, Mark Levin, the great one, Sid Rosenberg at WABC in the mornings, you all know that. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUQWFEnkX44&t=144.51999999999998s)]
*  You believe in me. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUQWFEnkX44&t=150.62s)]
*  I need you folks in America to help me bring New York City back to the greatness that it [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUQWFEnkX44&t=152.07999999999998s)]
*  used to have. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUQWFEnkX44&t=158.48s)]
*  And don't forget Mark Simone. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUQWFEnkX44&t=160.39999999999998s)]
*  Think of this. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUQWFEnkX44&t=161.67999999999998s)]
*  Rent-free, seized buildings from landlords, raised property taxes, which are already through [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUQWFEnkX44&t=162.67999999999998s)]
*  the roof, replaced police with social workers, government-operated—what's wrong with [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUQWFEnkX44&t=167.16s)]
*  Grustedes? [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUQWFEnkX44&t=172.28s)]
*  They don't have big profit margins. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUQWFEnkX44&t=173.28s)]
*  Government-operated grocery store, free buses, make life hard for corporations, free child [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUQWFEnkX44&t=174.88s)]
*  care, Green New Deal for schools, raise taxes, free gifts for each new parent in New York, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUQWFEnkX44&t=181.2s)]
*  promote the trans agenda, raise the minimum wage, shut down ICE, which is illegal. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUQWFEnkX44&t=187.32s)]
*  I mean, this is the most radical person ever. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUQWFEnkX44&t=191.96s)]
*  This is—he's to the left of AOC. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUQWFEnkX44&t=195.23999999999998s)]
*  How do you get to the left of her? [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUQWFEnkX44&t=198.35999999999999s)]
*  Well, just remember, the millennials now are the majority of the population. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUQWFEnkX44&t=200.04s)]
*  It's no longer the baby boomers. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUQWFEnkX44&t=205.23999999999998s)]
*  You have to have the ability to get millennials, which I have. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUQWFEnkX44&t=207.04s)]
*  As you know, Sean, I've recruited young people all over this country and all over the world [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUQWFEnkX44&t=210.26s)]
*  to be guardian angels, and for 46 years I've gotten them to voluntarily go out there, risk [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUQWFEnkX44&t=214.64s)]
*  their lives and take back the streets and the subways. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUQWFEnkX44&t=220.35999999999999s)]
*  I'm telling you, you go into the subway system tonight, you're taking your life into your [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUQWFEnkX44&t=224.48s)]
*  hands. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUQWFEnkX44&t=228.56s)]
*  The working women, who are the majority of the workers here, are afraid to take the subways [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUQWFEnkX44&t=229.56s)]
*  now. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUQWFEnkX44&t=233.96s)]
*  They have to grab a cab or Uber, and they can't afford that. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUQWFEnkX44&t=234.96s)]
*  And the small landlords and the small business owners are getting taxed, fees, fines, rates [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUQWFEnkX44&t=237.56s)]
*  that are out of control, that are driving them out of New York City. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUQWFEnkX44&t=244.16s)]
*  Just looking tonight, coming here, there were like eight storefronts that were abandoned. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUQWFEnkX44&t=248.0s)]
*  It's the Democrats who did that. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUQWFEnkX44&t=253.79999999999998s)]
*  You can thank de Blasio, you can thank Cuomo, and you can thank Adams. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUQWFEnkX44&t=255.07999999999998s)]
*  He's the mayor who's here now, and he's done nothing to correct that. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUQWFEnkX44&t=259.48s)]
*  On day one, I will make sure that New York City is a place that you can safely come and [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUQWFEnkX44&t=263.4s)]
*  visit, as it used to be years ago, and I will make sure that those who are already here [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUQWFEnkX44&t=268.2s)]
*  have an affordable way to live. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUQWFEnkX44&t=273.8s)]
*  We lower the cost of living, we give a quality of life, and we fix this school system that [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUQWFEnkX44&t=276.0s)]
*  we spend $41 billion in, in which 100,000 less students go there, one-third at Truance. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUQWFEnkX44&t=280.56s)]
*  They can't read at grade level, they can't do math at grade level, and we keep spending [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUQWFEnkX44&t=287.84s)]
*  more and more money. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUQWFEnkX44&t=291.96s)]
*  I'm the only candidate that says we have to cut the budget, we have to live within our [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUQWFEnkX44&t=293.0s)]
*  means. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUQWFEnkX44&t=297.36s)]
*  You know, Sean, I've done this my entire life. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUQWFEnkX44&t=298.36s)]
*  You can't buy me, you can't lease me, you can't rent me, I'm not for sale, you cut my [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUQWFEnkX44&t=300.7s)]
*  veins and arteries, I bleed New York. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUQWFEnkX44&t=305.76s)]
*  And more importantly, I'm the one Republican who can go into neighborhoods where the only [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUQWFEnkX44&t=308.76000000000005s)]
*  Republican they've ever seen in the 350 neighborhoods that make up New York City that I've been [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUQWFEnkX44&t=313.12s)]
*  in is Abraham Lincoln on a $5 bill. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUQWFEnkX44&t=317.48s)]
*  That's all true. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUQWFEnkX44&t=321.48s)]
*  You look, you'll be Mayor Rudy Giuliani 2.0. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUQWFEnkX44&t=322.48s)]
*  Rudy Giuliani saved New York, and then he was a hero on 9-11. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUQWFEnkX44&t=326.36s)]
*  You would implement a lot of the same policies. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUQWFEnkX44&t=331.70000000000005s)]
*  You're the right guy for the job. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUQWFEnkX44&t=333.86s)]
*  Make New York City great again. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUQWFEnkX44&t=336.36s)]
*  I have a lot of friends and colleagues there. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUQWFEnkX44&t=337.84000000000003s)]
*  Curtis, we're going to follow this race closely. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUQWFEnkX44&t=339.68s)]
*  I would hate to see that for New York, although it would benefit my free state of Florida. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUQWFEnkX44&t=343.12s)]
*  I'm not going to lie, but I care too much about my friends like you there, and we're [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUQWFEnkX44&t=347.8s)]
*  going to follow it closely. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUQWFEnkX44&t=352.04s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUQWFEnkX44&t=353.04s)]
