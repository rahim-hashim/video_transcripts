# 'RED WEDDING': Inside look at Israel's 'Game of Thrones' attack inside Tehran
**Fox News - World News:** [June 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naLUdnPMv4I)
*  Let's bring in retired U.S. Army Brigadier General Don Bulldock. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naLUdnPMv4I&t=0.0s)]
*  General, good morning to you. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naLUdnPMv4I&t=3.54s)]
*  So a lot of people waking up right now at the end of a truly remarkable week. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naLUdnPMv4I&t=4.54s)]
*  And yesterday we got incredible detail on Operation Midnight Hammer with General Kaine [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naLUdnPMv4I&t=8.84s)]
*  during his press briefing. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naLUdnPMv4I&t=15.040000000000001s)]
*  Listen to a portion of what he had to say here. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naLUdnPMv4I&t=16.36s)]
*  Operation Midnight Hammer was the culmination of those 15 years of incredible work. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naLUdnPMv4I&t=20.5s)]
*  We believe that this is the largest single Patriot engagement in U.S. military history. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naLUdnPMv4I&t=24.48s)]
*  Weapons 2, 3, 4, 5 were tasked to enter the main shaft, move down into the complex at [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naLUdnPMv4I&t=31.72s)]
*  greater than 1,000 feet per second, and explode in the mission space. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naLUdnPMv4I&t=41.0s)]
*  Here's what we know following the attacks and the strikes on Fordow. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naLUdnPMv4I&t=45.88s)]
*  First, that the weapons were built, tested, and loaded properly. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naLUdnPMv4I&t=50.0s)]
*  Two, the weapons were released on speed and on parameters. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naLUdnPMv4I&t=55.28s)]
*  Three, the weapons all guided to their intended targets and to their intended aim points. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naLUdnPMv4I&t=60.4s)]
*  Four, the weapons functioned as designed, meaning they exploded. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naLUdnPMv4I&t=66.16s)]
*  What stood out to you with the information he provided? [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naLUdnPMv4I&t=71.28s)]
*  Well, I think the transparency is to be recognized and to be applauded. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naLUdnPMv4I&t=75.36s)]
*  First of all, I fully support the strike. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naLUdnPMv4I&t=81.96s)]
*  I think it was necessary. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naLUdnPMv4I&t=84.6s)]
*  I think it was necessary to support our Israeli partners and send a message. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naLUdnPMv4I&t=85.6s)]
*  And it sent a big message. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naLUdnPMv4I&t=90.08s)]
*  These GBU-57s, deep penetration, delayed detonation, high explosive payload, precision guided, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naLUdnPMv4I&t=92.2s)]
*  And as the chairman pointed out, global positioning system and inertial navigation systems allowed [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naLUdnPMv4I&t=100.80000000000001s)]
*  it to come in on position, on velocity, and on orientation and destroy those targets. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naLUdnPMv4I&t=106.64s)]
*  They used them against the optimal target set, hardened facilities. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naLUdnPMv4I&t=114.36s)]
*  And the desire is to disable the enemy infrastructure and reduce its ability to wage war. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naLUdnPMv4I&t=119.64s)]
*  I think we accomplished that mission. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naLUdnPMv4I&t=127.32000000000001s)]
*  And I think that we need to really look forward to positive ceasefire. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naLUdnPMv4I&t=129.76s)]
*  And the entire world needs to get around it. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naLUdnPMv4I&t=136.84s)]
*  And members of Congress need to unite now and not divide themselves. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naLUdnPMv4I&t=139.64s)]
*  This is a time to get behind the president. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naLUdnPMv4I&t=145.04s)]
*  This is a time to get behind Israel and move forward to deter Iran, which has, prior to [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naLUdnPMv4I&t=146.84s)]
*  October 7th, really created a lot of problems in that region. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naLUdnPMv4I&t=157.52s)]
*  And really, when you look at how the geopolitical power has changed since October 7th with how [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naLUdnPMv4I&t=162.0s)]
*  Netanyahu and Israel has executed the war, how they have really neutralized Hamas and [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naLUdnPMv4I&t=168.24s)]
*  Hezbollah, Iran is now isolated. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naLUdnPMv4I&t=174.04s)]
*  These are all things that play into our favor going into any kind of negotiation. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naLUdnPMv4I&t=178.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naLUdnPMv4I&t=182.07999999999998s)]
*  Leading up to U.S. involvement, there were eight days of airstrikes by Israel inside [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naLUdnPMv4I&t=183.12s)]
*  Iran. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naLUdnPMv4I&t=187.88000000000002s)]
*  And the Wall Street Journal has just a fantastic article about all of that and the planning [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naLUdnPMv4I&t=188.88000000000002s)]
*  that transpired leading up to these operations. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naLUdnPMv4I&t=193.8s)]
*  It's called Inside Operation Narnia, the daring attack Israel feared it couldn't pull off. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naLUdnPMv4I&t=197.32000000000002s)]
*  At midnight on June 13th, Israel's generals gathered in a bunker beneath Israeli Air Force [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naLUdnPMv4I&t=202.32000000000002s)]
*  headquarters and watched as jets descended on Tehran in an operation they called Red [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naLUdnPMv4I&t=207.08s)]
*  Wedding. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naLUdnPMv4I&t=211.84s)]
*  Hours later and 1,000 miles away, Iran's top military commanders were dead, a mass [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naLUdnPMv4I&t=212.88s)]
*  killing much like the famous wedding scene from the show Game of Thrones. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naLUdnPMv4I&t=218.32s)]
*  They would also detail the simultaneous killing of Iran's top nuclear scientists, and they [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naLUdnPMv4I&t=222.76s)]
*  called it Operation Narnia because even they thought it was so fantastical, they weren't [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naLUdnPMv4I&t=227.76s)]
*  sure that they could pull this off. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naLUdnPMv4I&t=232.44s)]
*  So how different is the region now than it was a week ago? [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naLUdnPMv4I&t=234.4s)]
*  And how does President Trump make sure it stays this way? [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naLUdnPMv4I&t=238.88s)]
*  Well, I think it's very different. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naLUdnPMv4I&t=242.88s)]
*  And I think the balance of power has shifted to Israel. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naLUdnPMv4I&t=245.52s)]
*  That helps America support Israel and support the region in negotiations with Iran, who [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naLUdnPMv4I&t=250.12s)]
*  is clearly a country that is an existential threat to Israel and also a threat to the [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naLUdnPMv4I&t=257.76s)]
*  United States. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naLUdnPMv4I&t=267.0s)]
*  So what the president needs to do is continue to do exactly what he is doing, support Israel, [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naLUdnPMv4I&t=268.32s)]
*  bring Iran to the table. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naLUdnPMv4I&t=275.52s)]
*  They are primed for that now. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naLUdnPMv4I&t=277.92s)]
*  They are isolated. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naLUdnPMv4I&t=280.06s)]
*  Their proxies have been neutralized, so they can't bring a ground fight to Israel. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naLUdnPMv4I&t=283.06s)]
*  Gaza is the next question. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naLUdnPMv4I&t=290.08s)]
*  We need strong diplomacy. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naLUdnPMv4I&t=291.76s)]
*  We need to unite the Western world around this effort. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naLUdnPMv4I&t=293.32s)]
*  And we need to re-energize the Abraham Accords. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naLUdnPMv4I&t=298.24s)]
*  I've always been in favor of a regional solution, and I always thought that the Abraham Accords [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naLUdnPMv4I&t=300.76s)]
*  were an excellent way to bring that region together to develop stability and peace and [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naLUdnPMv4I&t=306.56s)]
*  to marginalize actors like Iran who just want to disrupt things and become the regional [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naLUdnPMv4I&t=313.6s)]
*  power and have everybody kowtow to them. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naLUdnPMv4I&t=320.56s)]
*  I think that's over. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naLUdnPMv4I&t=325.48s)]
*  I think we have the momentum. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naLUdnPMv4I&t=326.56s)]
*  We just need to pressure and pursue and stay on that momentum and don't let it up. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naLUdnPMv4I&t=328.18s)]
*  Keep on working towards it. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naLUdnPMv4I&t=333.64s)]
*  And you're right, that's the hope that more nations will sign on to the Abraham Accords. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naLUdnPMv4I&t=334.88s)]
*  And all of this could be leading up to that. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naLUdnPMv4I&t=338.12s)]
*  Yesterday, we learned that the U.S. and Iran, there's no date for us to meet with them to [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naLUdnPMv4I&t=340.6s)]
*  continue negotiations, but that effort is also ongoing. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naLUdnPMv4I&t=344.82s)]
*  General Bullock, thank you so much for joining us this morning. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naLUdnPMv4I&t=348.28s)]
