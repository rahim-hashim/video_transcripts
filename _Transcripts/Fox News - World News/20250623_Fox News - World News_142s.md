# BREAKING: US embassy in Qatar orders Americans to shelter in place
**Fox News - World News:** [June 23, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cq1J9zcJeo)
*  Meanwhile, President Trump is expected to sit down with his national security team at [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cq1J9zcJeo&t=0.0s)]
*  one o'clock Eastern time to discuss the next steps with Iran. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cq1J9zcJeo&t=4.22s)]
*  Alexandra Hoff joins us live from the White House with the details. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cq1J9zcJeo&t=7.86s)]
*  Good morning, Alex. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cq1J9zcJeo&t=10.78s)]
*  Well, good morning, too. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cq1J9zcJeo&t=11.78s)]
*  There are several topics up for discussion today, several fields that they will wish [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cq1J9zcJeo&t=13.18s)]
*  to explore during this meeting, global threats being one of them. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cq1J9zcJeo&t=16.98s)]
*  We do know now that Americans at the U.S. Embassy in Qatar have been told to shelter [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cq1J9zcJeo&t=20.8s)]
*  in place. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cq1J9zcJeo&t=24.740000000000002s)]
*  This was out of an abundance of caution, so says the embassy. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cq1J9zcJeo&t=26.54s)]
*  And we're not exactly sure the basis of this warning at this point, but there are global [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cq1J9zcJeo&t=29.099999999999998s)]
*  threats and whether or not they are related to Iran. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cq1J9zcJeo&t=33.96s)]
*  I mean, that's going to be talked about. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cq1J9zcJeo&t=36.74s)]
*  Another focus will be clearly the effectiveness of Operation Midnight Hammer. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cq1J9zcJeo&t=38.379999999999995s)]
*  The Pentagon says we aren't going to know the true impact for some time, but the president [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cq1J9zcJeo&t=41.94s)]
*  is defending his use of the word obliteration to describe the three nuclear sites. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cq1J9zcJeo&t=45.54s)]
*  He cited monumental damage as seen by satellite images. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cq1J9zcJeo&t=49.58s)]
*  And yesterday, Vice President Vance reiterated that it is Iran's nuclear program the U.S. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cq1J9zcJeo&t=53.699999999999996s)]
*  is fighting. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cq1J9zcJeo&t=58.059999999999995s)]
*  We're not at war with Iran. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cq1J9zcJeo&t=59.059999999999995s)]
*  We're at war with Iran's nuclear program. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cq1J9zcJeo&t=61.54s)]
*  And let me just say, Kristen, that we're incredibly grateful and proud of the American Air Force [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cq1J9zcJeo&t=63.98s)]
*  pilots who did an incredible job last night. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cq1J9zcJeo&t=69.67999999999999s)]
*  It's really an incredible operation, a testament to the power of American military. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cq1J9zcJeo&t=72.58s)]
*  And I think what shows what can happen when you have that great American military in the [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cq1J9zcJeo&t=77.06s)]
*  hands of capable presidential leadership. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cq1J9zcJeo&t=82.04s)]
*  And there are some questions this morning about President Trump's intentions when he [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cq1J9zcJeo&t=84.04s)]
*  wrote this, quote, It is not politically correct to use the term regime change, but if the [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cq1J9zcJeo&t=87.88000000000001s)]
*  current Iranian regime is unable to make Iran great again, why wouldn't there be a regime [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cq1J9zcJeo&t=92.88000000000001s)]
*  change? [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cq1J9zcJeo&t=97.64s)]
*  Well, administration officials had said that regime change is not the goal of any of this. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cq1J9zcJeo&t=98.64000000000001s)]
*  The Post has been interpreted in various different ways. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cq1J9zcJeo&t=102.92s)]
*  Some feel it's the president changing his position, not ruling it out. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cq1J9zcJeo&t=105.24000000000001s)]
*  the president is mulling the possibility of the Iranian people sparking change on their [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cq1J9zcJeo&t=109.44s)]
*  own. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cq1J9zcJeo&t=113.92s)]
*  And tomorrow the president is headed to the Netherlands for the NATO summit. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cq1J9zcJeo&t=114.92s)]
*  And while there, a U.S. official tells Fox that he intends to secure a historic 5% defense [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cq1J9zcJeo&t=118.75999999999999s)]
*  spending pledge with allies. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cq1J9zcJeo&t=124.56s)]
*  Timely. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cq1J9zcJeo&t=126.56s)]
*  Guys. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cq1J9zcJeo&t=127.56s)]
*  OK, I know we'll be covering that. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cq1J9zcJeo&t=128.56s)]
