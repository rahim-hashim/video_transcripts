# BREAKING: Israel eliminates new Iranian military commander
**Fox News - World News:** [June 17, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWtZx_pvRMI)
*  All right, to the Fox News alert, President Trump is back in Washington after cutting [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWtZx_pvRMI&t=0.0s)]
*  his time at the G7 summit in Canada short. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWtZx_pvRMI&t=4.68s)]
*  The commander in chief saying he has not reached out to Iran for peace talks. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWtZx_pvRMI&t=7.48s)]
*  Meanwhile, more than 300,000 Iranians being warned to evacuate Tehran, the capital, as [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWtZx_pvRMI&t=11.72s)]
*  Israel's operation rising line intensifies, striking dozens of targets overnight. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWtZx_pvRMI&t=17.72s)]
*  We have live team coverage. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWtZx_pvRMI&t=22.76s)]
*  Mark Meredith is at the White House tracking the administration's response. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWtZx_pvRMI&t=24.12s)]
*  But first we go to Mike Tobin. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWtZx_pvRMI&t=27.68s)]
*  He is live in Israel and Tel Aviv as the Israelis assess damage from Iranian missile [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWtZx_pvRMI&t=29.12s)]
*  strikes to military and civilian targets. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWtZx_pvRMI&t=34.2s)]
*  Hey, Mike. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWtZx_pvRMI&t=37.32s)]
*  Hi there, Ainsley. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWtZx_pvRMI&t=38.32s)]
*  The Iranian missile barrages are part of every day and night. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWtZx_pvRMI&t=40.480000000000004s)]
*  An Israeli military spokesman now says some 400 Iranian missiles have been fired at Israel. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWtZx_pvRMI&t=44.2s)]
*  What we saw in the overnight hours, however, was instead of the usual hundreds of missiles [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWtZx_pvRMI&t=51.16s)]
*  coming at Israel. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWtZx_pvRMI&t=56.36s)]
*  We have seen since the start of Operation Rising Lion about 20 came last night. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWtZx_pvRMI&t=57.839999999999996s)]
*  Four missiles got through hitting in the town of Herzliya, which is just north of Tel Aviv. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWtZx_pvRMI&t=62.6s)]
*  One of them set a bus on fire in a parking lot. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWtZx_pvRMI&t=67.68s)]
*  Another set a structure on fire, but no injuries reported thus far. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWtZx_pvRMI&t=70.2s)]
*  Many times Israeli officials says the IDF has not done hitting targets inside Iran. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWtZx_pvRMI&t=75.48s)]
*  Yesterday, the Iranian state TV building was burning after it was hit by an Israeli strike. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWtZx_pvRMI&t=80.64s)]
*  A hit that happened while they were live on the air. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWtZx_pvRMI&t=85.48s)]
*  Israel also says Iran's wartime chief of staff was killed. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWtZx_pvRMI&t=98.28s)]
*  Ali Shadmani was his name. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWtZx_pvRMI&t=101.96000000000001s)]
*  He was the most senior military commander closest to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWtZx_pvRMI&t=103.48s)]
*  But he only had the job for four days. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWtZx_pvRMI&t=108.52000000000001s)]
*  He was appointed after his predecessor was killed in the early days of Operation Rising [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWtZx_pvRMI&t=110.72s)]
*  Lion. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWtZx_pvRMI&t=114.92s)]
*  We still do not know who will be the substitute's replacement. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWtZx_pvRMI&t=115.92s)]
*  I would advise anyone who is offered the position to consider carefully. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWtZx_pvRMI&t=121.48s)]
*  If he agrees to take it, he is advised to be extremely cautious. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWtZx_pvRMI&t=125.36s)]
*  And that same Israeli military official says that 10 Iranian scientists essential to Iran's [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWtZx_pvRMI&t=130.92000000000002s)]
*  nuclear program have been killed since the start of the operation. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWtZx_pvRMI&t=136.92000000000002s)]
*  Ainsley? [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWtZx_pvRMI&t=140.68s)]
*  Mike, you showed the video of the Iranian state TV and we saw that blast while the lady was anchoring. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWtZx_pvRMI&t=142.44s)]
*  She was speaking Farsi during that explosion. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWtZx_pvRMI&t=149.16s)]
*  I was told that a man off camera was saying, Allah Akbar. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWtZx_pvRMI&t=151.88s)]
*  And Benjamin Netanyahu, the Prime Minister of Israel, says the TV station was not a legitimate [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWtZx_pvRMI&t=155.4s)]
*  news outlet but a tool of the totalitarian regime. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWtZx_pvRMI&t=159.76000000000002s)]
*  Was the lady that we saw, was she the one that was killed? [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWtZx_pvRMI&t=163.08s)]
*  I know a lady did die. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWtZx_pvRMI&t=165.48000000000002s)]
*  I know that woman who you see on TV there has now popped up on billboards all across [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWtZx_pvRMI&t=169.28s)]
*  Tehran. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWtZx_pvRMI&t=174.72s)]
*  She is being hailed as a hero. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWtZx_pvRMI&t=175.72s)]
*  We only know through Iranian TV that one woman was said to have been killed. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWtZx_pvRMI&t=177.39999999999998s)]
*  But if you look at the woman who was in that video, she doesn't appear to be hit by anything [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWtZx_pvRMI&t=182.45999999999998s)]
*  in the initial phases of the strike. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWtZx_pvRMI&t=188.48s)]
*  Just frightened very badly. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWtZx_pvRMI&t=191.39999999999998s)]
*  Alright, and lastly, have you heard any credible reports of stirring on the streets against [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWtZx_pvRMI&t=193.28s)]
*  the Ayatollah regime? [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWtZx_pvRMI&t=200.48s)]
*  No credible reports. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWtZx_pvRMI&t=206.28s)]
*  What I'm hearing coming out of Tehran right now are just reports that people are very [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWtZx_pvRMI&t=208.0s)]
*  afraid and they also don't have international reporters inside of Tehran. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWtZx_pvRMI&t=213.04s)]
*  So they don't feel, they feel very isolated. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWtZx_pvRMI&t=217.64s)]
*  They don't feel that they have anyone to run to but they're extremely fearful at this point, Brian. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWtZx_pvRMI&t=220.16s)]
*  Right, thanks so much Mike. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWtZx_pvRMI&t=225.16s)]
*  Did you have a question? [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWtZx_pvRMI&t=226.16000000000003s)]
*  All good Mike, appreciate it. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWtZx_pvRMI&t=227.16000000000003s)]
*  I just want to point to something that the administration, they're going on the offense [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWtZx_pvRMI&t=229.28s)]
*  because there's been several attacks saying that the president has changed his position [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWtZx_pvRMI&t=233.04000000000002s)]
*  although you can go to the record of them saying they can't have a nuclear weapon but [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWtZx_pvRMI&t=236.66000000000003s)]
*  they cite this report that they gave to Congress on June 10th and it says that it is estimated [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWtZx_pvRMI&t=240.48000000000002s)]
*  that the current stockpile and the available centrifuges across several enrichment plants [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWtZx_pvRMI&t=247.20000000000002s)]
*  are sufficient to produce this first 25 kilogram of weapon-grazed material in roughly one week [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWtZx_pvRMI&t=250.92000000000002s)]
*  and enough for up to 10 nuclear weapons in three weeks. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWtZx_pvRMI&t=256.96000000000004s)]
*  So they're saying, look, we've been warning for a while that it was getting this close, [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWtZx_pvRMI&t=260.68s)]
*  this is why we put so much pressure to get a peace deal done. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWtZx_pvRMI&t=264.68s)]
*  You know why? [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWtZx_pvRMI&t=268.6s)]
*  Because last night, the Daily Show, had Jon Stewart roll back some Netanyahu clips where [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWtZx_pvRMI&t=269.6s)]
*  the Iranians were close back to 2010 and 2015. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWtZx_pvRMI&t=274.24s)]
*  So they're saying essentially, and so are the president's right-wing critics, he says [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWtZx_pvRMI&t=277.76s)]
*  the maga-wing, which he's the head of, say that well, you know, they always say they [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWtZx_pvRMI&t=283.08s)]
*  were close to enrichment but they weren't. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWtZx_pvRMI&t=287.68s)]
*  But IAEA just sanctioned them for the first time in 20 years saying they've gone flying [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWtZx_pvRMI&t=289.16s)]
*  past the threshold. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWtZx_pvRMI&t=294.2s)]
*  And for those people to think, well, if the president didn't tear up the deal, they wouldn't [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWtZx_pvRMI&t=295.2s)]
*  have a nuclear program. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWtZx_pvRMI&t=299.96000000000004s)]
*  The deal would have expired. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWtZx_pvRMI&t=301.38s)]
*  It only lasted 10 years. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWtZx_pvRMI&t=303.18s)]
*  And those were during the Obama years. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWtZx_pvRMI&t=305.14s)]
*  So if you're just waking up, the president left the G7 summit and he was asked about [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWtZx_pvRMI&t=306.86s)]
*  the ceasefire. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWtZx_pvRMI&t=312.22s)]
*  And he said, Macron is saying, you heard these reports, Macron is saying that President Trump's [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWtZx_pvRMI&t=313.42s)]
*  leaving early to go handle a ceasefire with the two countries. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWtZx_pvRMI&t=318.42s)]
*  And the president said, no, he is wrong. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWtZx_pvRMI&t=321.22s)]
*  That's not what's happening. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWtZx_pvRMI&t=323.14s)]
*  Then the president is calling a meeting with his, with the National Security Council. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWtZx_pvRMI&t=324.14s)]
*  So what does that tell us? [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWtZx_pvRMI&t=328.74s)]
*  He's wrong. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWtZx_pvRMI&t=329.98s)]
*  We're not working on a ceasefire. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWtZx_pvRMI&t=330.98s)]
*  We gave them a shot. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWtZx_pvRMI&t=332.08s)]
*  We gave them 60 days. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWtZx_pvRMI&t=333.08s)]
*  Now on day 61, you saw what happened. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWtZx_pvRMI&t=334.56s)]
*  So it sounds like ceasefire options off the table, unless for some reason, maybe Iran [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWtZx_pvRMI&t=337.65999999999997s)]
*  comes back because Pete Hegseth kind of alluded to that, that we would be willing to sit down [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWtZx_pvRMI&t=342.35999999999996s)]
*  and talk. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWtZx_pvRMI&t=347.08s)]
*  So maybe if they're smart enough to come and do this. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWtZx_pvRMI&t=348.08s)]
*  But many people have said, Iran is so ambitious with nuclear weapons and they're so arrogant, [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWtZx_pvRMI&t=350.47999999999996s)]
*  the Ayatollah and the regime, that they probably won't even do that. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWtZx_pvRMI&t=355.26s)]
*  They're willing to sacrifice their own people so that, so that Israel doesn't get their [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWtZx_pvRMI&t=358.56s)]
*  hands on nuclear weapons or destroy their nuclear weapons. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWtZx_pvRMI&t=362.42s)]
*  They can always rebuild as long as they have the, the ability to enrich. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWtZx_pvRMI&t=365.8s)]
*  All I know is the grand Ayatollah has got to get a new contact list because many of [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWtZx_pvRMI&t=369.66s)]
*  the people who are his favorite, you know, a dial, you know, rapid dial are dead. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWtZx_pvRMI&t=373.54s)]
*  Right. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWtZx_pvRMI&t=379.82s)]
*  So I don't know who's going to be there to rescue the regime. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWtZx_pvRMI&t=380.82s)]
*  The people are not in favor of the regime. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWtZx_pvRMI&t=382.26s)]
*  The majority of the people there. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWtZx_pvRMI&t=384.06s)]
*  They don't like it. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWtZx_pvRMI&t=385.34000000000003s)]
*  And many of them are leaving Tehran. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWtZx_pvRMI&t=386.34000000000003s)]
*  You saw leaving in droves because president Trump said leave immediately. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWtZx_pvRMI&t=387.54s)]
*  What does that tell you too? [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWtZx_pvRMI&t=391.16s)]
*  That's the question. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWtZx_pvRMI&t=392.16s)]
*  What's about to happen? [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWtZx_pvRMI&t=393.16s)]
*  If there are demonstrations in the streets, do the cops break it up? [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWtZx_pvRMI&t=394.16s)]
*  That's right. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWtZx_pvRMI&t=396.52000000000004s)]
*  Or do the cops disappear? [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWtZx_pvRMI&t=397.52000000000004s)]
