# Iran will turn missiles toward Europe then Manhattan, Israeli official warns
**Fox News - World News:** [June 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flR0p8On_t0)
*  Israeli ambassador to the United Nations, Danny Denon, speaking out on Iran's attacks [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flR0p8On_t0&t=0.0s)]
*  at the UN on Friday. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flR0p8On_t0&t=5.2s)]
*  Take a listen. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flR0p8On_t0&t=6.28s)]
*  Iran has proven its ability to strike strategic targets with accuracy. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flR0p8On_t0&t=7.28s)]
*  This was a deliberate act. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flR0p8On_t0&t=14.24s)]
*  It is a blatant violation of international law, a war crime, and a calculated attempt [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flR0p8On_t0&t=18.68s)]
*  to murder the most vulnerable. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flR0p8On_t0&t=24.72s)]
*  Let this Council understand what that missile really signified. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flR0p8On_t0&t=28.2s)]
*  That no one is safe. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flR0p8On_t0&t=32.68s)]
*  That if Iran will target a hospital with a ballistic missile, it will target anyone, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flR0p8On_t0&t=34.68s)]
*  anywhere with anything they have. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flR0p8On_t0&t=42.44s)]
*  Today it was Be'er Sheva. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flR0p8On_t0&t=45.84s)]
*  Tomorrow it could be Brussels. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flR0p8On_t0&t=48.28s)]
*  Soon it could be Boston. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flR0p8On_t0&t=51.120000000000005s)]
*  Iran is rapidly expanding its ballistic missile arsenal. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flR0p8On_t0&t=54.52s)]
*  We have seen diplomatic talks for the last few decades and look at the results. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flR0p8On_t0&t=58.6s)]
*  So you know, if there will be a genuine effort to dismantle the capabilities of Iran, then [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flR0p8On_t0&t=63.32000000000001s)]
*  that's something we can consider. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flR0p8On_t0&t=68.96000000000001s)]
*  But it is going to be like another session and debates. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flR0p8On_t0&t=71.04s)]
*  That's not going to work. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flR0p8On_t0&t=74.64s)]
*  Let's bring in now Efere Kunis. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flR0p8On_t0&t=80.80000000000001s)]
*  He is the Council General of Israel here in New York. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flR0p8On_t0&t=82.24s)]
*  Sir, I'm so glad you were able to be here today. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flR0p8On_t0&t=85.28s)]
*  Thank you for having me. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flR0p8On_t0&t=87.36s)]
*  It's very important to reflect the truth about the current situation in the Middle East. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flR0p8On_t0&t=88.36s)]
*  Well, I want to get your insight. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flR0p8On_t0&t=94.0s)]
*  We just listened to the General, General Petard, giving his insights into what it could mean [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flR0p8On_t0&t=95.36s)]
*  for the United States to join this conflict in a more forward military posture. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flR0p8On_t0&t=99.96s)]
*  Your thoughts on what he had to say. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flR0p8On_t0&t=105.19999999999999s)]
*  First of all, we will not take decisions for the American administration and for the American [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flR0p8On_t0&t=106.64s)]
*  people. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flR0p8On_t0&t=112.48s)]
*  But I want to remind you all that from 1979, the Ayatollahs, the Iranian regime, they are [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flR0p8On_t0&t=113.48s)]
*  saying that through Israel, that to America. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flR0p8On_t0&t=121.68s)]
*  And I think that this is the main point. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flR0p8On_t0&t=125.84s)]
*  They want this place. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flR0p8On_t0&t=128.08s)]
*  They are talking about the small Satan. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flR0p8On_t0&t=129.6s)]
*  It's Israel. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flR0p8On_t0&t=131.68s)]
*  Now they are targeting hospitals, kindergartens, civilians on Tel Aviv, Be'er Sheva, as we [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flR0p8On_t0&t=132.76000000000002s)]
*  just heard, Haifa. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flR0p8On_t0&t=138.76000000000002s)]
*  By the way, they hit yesterday a mosque in Haifa, a Muslim mosque in the city of Haifa [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flR0p8On_t0&t=140.12s)]
*  in the north. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flR0p8On_t0&t=146.20000000000002s)]
*  So they're seeing Israel as the small Satan. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flR0p8On_t0&t=147.56s)]
*  And the big Satan is you, my American friends. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flR0p8On_t0&t=150.36s)]
*  And I want you to know it. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flR0p8On_t0&t=154.60000000000002s)]
*  They want to destroy us. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flR0p8On_t0&t=155.92000000000002s)]
*  And I'm talking about the United States of America, the state of Israel. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flR0p8On_t0&t=157.92000000000002s)]
*  And in the middle, Europe. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flR0p8On_t0&t=161.96s)]
*  You know, we've been watching this big uptick in military assets, U.S. military assets joining [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flR0p8On_t0&t=165.08s)]
*  there in the Middle East in defense of Israel. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flR0p8On_t0&t=171.16s)]
*  We've been working to head off some of the missiles. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flR0p8On_t0&t=174.52s)]
*  Sadly, some of these missiles have struck there in Israel tragically. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flR0p8On_t0&t=176.92000000000002s)]
*  Do you think that posture matters? [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flR0p8On_t0&t=182.92000000000002s)]
*  Does that send a message to Iran? [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flR0p8On_t0&t=184.64000000000001s)]
*  And will they get that message? [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flR0p8On_t0&t=186.32s)]
*  I don't think so. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flR0p8On_t0&t=187.32s)]
*  I must be honest with you. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flR0p8On_t0&t=188.32s)]
*  We gave them a chance, 60 days, according to the president of the United States decision, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flR0p8On_t0&t=190.92s)]
*  to negotiate with the Ayatollahs, with the Iranian regime. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flR0p8On_t0&t=198.0s)]
*  They said no. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flR0p8On_t0&t=203.32s)]
*  Two days before we launched the operation. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flR0p8On_t0&t=204.35999999999999s)]
*  They said we will not do nothing with our nuclear sites and with our ballistic—they [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flR0p8On_t0&t=207.57999999999998s)]
*  said it, of course—with our ballistic missiles. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flR0p8On_t0&t=214.76s)]
*  I want you to understand that their ballistic missiles, through Tel Aviv now or other places [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flR0p8On_t0&t=217.44s)]
*  around the state of Israel, it's just the beginning. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flR0p8On_t0&t=222.88s)]
*  What's the reason that the Iranian regime wants intercontinental ballistic missiles? [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flR0p8On_t0&t=226.24s)]
*  They don't need intercontinental ballistic missiles to hit Tel Aviv. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flR0p8On_t0&t=232.0s)]
*  They can use the ordinary ballistic missiles to hit Tel Aviv. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flR0p8On_t0&t=236.44s)]
*  They want their intercontinental ballistic missiles to use them, first of all, as I said, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flR0p8On_t0&t=239.68s)]
*  toward Europe and then toward Manhattan. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flR0p8On_t0&t=246.88s)]
*  That's what they want. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flR0p8On_t0&t=250.35999999999999s)]
*  But I want to be clear with you. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flR0p8On_t0&t=251.35999999999999s)]
*  They are saying it. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flR0p8On_t0&t=252.76s)]
*  They are saying it very honestly. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flR0p8On_t0&t=253.76s)]
*  It's we, the Ayatollahs, the Iranian regime, versus the Western world. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flR0p8On_t0&t=255.72s)]
*  We don't want your values. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flR0p8On_t0&t=260.54s)]
*  We don't want your democracy. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flR0p8On_t0&t=262.6s)]
*  We don't want your freedom here in Manhattan or in California, Florida, or in Canada, or [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flR0p8On_t0&t=264.4s)]
*  even in United Kingdom. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flR0p8On_t0&t=270.88s)]
*  They want their ideas all around the world. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flR0p8On_t0&t=273.84s)]
*  And they are saying it, as I said, from 1970. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flR0p8On_t0&t=276.96s)]
*  You know what we learned from the history? [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flR0p8On_t0&t=279.03999999999996s)]
*  That when a fascist regime saying that he wants to destroy you, you better believe them. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flR0p8On_t0&t=281.44s)]
*  And I think that Israel now is in the same situation like United Kingdom. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flR0p8On_t0&t=288.32s)]
*  I'm talking about May 1940. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flR0p8On_t0&t=293.47999999999996s)]
*  So this is May 1940. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flR0p8On_t0&t=296.08s)]
*  Israel, for now. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flR0p8On_t0&t=298.4s)]
*  We are standing alone against the Iranian regime and the Ayatollahs. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flR0p8On_t0&t=300.32s)]
*  And our people find to, must find a place to protect themselves in the shelters, just [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flR0p8On_t0&t=306.28s)]
*  like London in 1940. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flR0p8On_t0&t=312.28s)]
*  When you talk about alone, there's this very sensitive period right now. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flR0p8On_t0&t=315.15999999999997s)]
*  The president has said two weeks. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flR0p8On_t0&t=318.92s)]
*  We don't know necessarily that if a strike does come from the U.S. that it will be sooner [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flR0p8On_t0&t=321.2s)]
*  than two weeks. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flR0p8On_t0&t=325.14s)]
*  That's not a final deadline. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flR0p8On_t0&t=326.14s)]
*  It seems to be a window of opportunity for Iran. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flR0p8On_t0&t=327.97999999999996s)]
*  However, they haven't changed their posture over the course of multiple negotiations, [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flR0p8On_t0&t=330.62s)]
*  five, six rounds, direct and indirect, regarding what they're willing to do, what they're willing [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flR0p8On_t0&t=335.21999999999997s)]
*  to give up. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flR0p8On_t0&t=339.9s)]
*  What do you make of this opportunity that's been handed to Iran that's ticking? [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flR0p8On_t0&t=340.9s)]
*  The clock is ticking right now. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flR0p8On_t0&t=344.78s)]
*  I will say we are not believe them. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flR0p8On_t0&t=346.14s)]
*  We are not believe the Iranian regime and the Ayatollahs because they say time after [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flR0p8On_t0&t=349.32s)]
*  time after time, we'll keep our nuclear sites. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flR0p8On_t0&t=354.14s)]
*  We'll keep our nuclear abilities. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flR0p8On_t0&t=357.62s)]
*  We want to use them. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flR0p8On_t0&t=361.06s)]
*  By the way, I saw the map. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flR0p8On_t0&t=362.06s)]
*  It's still here. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flR0p8On_t0&t=363.58s)]
*  You can see Yemen here. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flR0p8On_t0&t=364.74s)]
*  Yemen. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flR0p8On_t0&t=366.38s)]
*  It's not, there is no territorial debate between Israel and Yemen. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flR0p8On_t0&t=367.38s)]
*  And they want to smuggle the nuclear bomb, one nuclear bomb to Yemen through the Persian [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flR0p8On_t0&t=371.53999999999996s)]
*  Gulf, okay, and to fire the nuclear bomb, one bomb state. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flR0p8On_t0&t=376.86s)]
*  Israel is a one bomb state, toward Israel. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flR0p8On_t0&t=382.86s)]
*  So I don't believe them. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flR0p8On_t0&t=384.82s)]
*  My suggestion to my beloved American people, really, and I really admire the American society [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flR0p8On_t0&t=387.4s)]
*  and the American culture, don't believe them. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flR0p8On_t0&t=394.26s)]
*  They're all liars and they are cruel and they will not miss the opportunity to fire the [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flR0p8On_t0&t=397.5s)]
*  ballistic missiles. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flR0p8On_t0&t=403.5s)]
*  First of all, they're doing it toward Israel, then toward the Western world in the home. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flR0p8On_t0&t=404.5s)]
*  And part of these negotiations is to work towards getting them to give up this power [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flR0p8On_t0&t=409.2s)]
*  that they have across the Middle East and across these proxies, as you mentioned, including [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flR0p8On_t0&t=413.12s)]
