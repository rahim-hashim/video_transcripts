# 'Zero chance' Iran's nuclear facility survives this: Thiessen
**Fox News - World News:** [June 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_UpGHJmtik)
*  We're looking live at Haifa, Israel. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_UpGHJmtik&t=0.0s)]
*  This is where rescue crews are on the ground right now. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_UpGHJmtik&t=5.04s)]
*  An Iranian missile hit this area, and so the crews are there to try to make sure people [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_UpGHJmtik&t=8.48s)]
*  are OK and rescue anyone that needs help. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_UpGHJmtik&t=12.72s)]
*  Meanwhile, President Trump is leaving the door open for a diplomatic solution with Iran, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_UpGHJmtik&t=15.24s)]
*  but the clock is ticking. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_UpGHJmtik&t=19.78s)]
*  The White House says he will make a decision within two weeks on whether to take military [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_UpGHJmtik&t=21.32s)]
*  action against Iran. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_UpGHJmtik&t=26.0s)]
*  All this, as about 40,000 U.S. troops currently deployed in the Middle East are there, but [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_UpGHJmtik&t=27.64s)]
*  Mark Thiessen, who is joining us now, you have some thoughts about all of this. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_UpGHJmtik&t=32.4s)]
*  Let's first start with this idea about the two weeks. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_UpGHJmtik&t=36.56s)]
*  There's been a lot of discussion about it. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_UpGHJmtik&t=39.2s)]
*  How do you read it? [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_UpGHJmtik&t=41.160000000000004s)]
*  I think that Donald Trump has never wavered from the ultimate objective, which is that [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_UpGHJmtik&t=44.16s)]
*  the Iranian nuclear program has to end, it has to be dismantled, it has to be destroyed. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_UpGHJmtik&t=48.0s)]
*  The only question has been whether it's done militarily or whether it's done voluntarily. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_UpGHJmtik&t=52.28s)]
*  He gave them a 60-day deadline. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_UpGHJmtik&t=56.44s)]
*  They let the deadline pass, and so Israel began bombing on day 61. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_UpGHJmtik&t=59.879999999999995s)]
*  And now he is basically holding out, this is your last chance. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_UpGHJmtik&t=63.92s)]
*  Time for negotiation is over. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_UpGHJmtik&t=67.48s)]
*  There's not going to be any kind of deal. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_UpGHJmtik&t=68.72s)]
*  This is a question of whether Iran cries amu, which is Persian for uncle, and allows the [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_UpGHJmtik&t=70.64s)]
*  U.S. to come in and blow up Fordow from inside, or we do it from without, from the skies above [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_UpGHJmtik&t=76.96s)]
*  with B-2 bombers. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_UpGHJmtik&t=81.72s)]
*  But I think there is zero chance that the Fordow nuclear facility survives this encounter [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_UpGHJmtik&t=82.76s)]
*  with Iran. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_UpGHJmtik&t=89.44s)]
*  Here's what President Trump's White House said yesterday about not looking for a ceasefire. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_UpGHJmtik&t=90.44s)]
*  The ceasefire means like everything's going swimmingly, we'll take a little time off. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_UpGHJmtik&t=98.64s)]
*  It's not. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_UpGHJmtik&t=102.28s)]
*  We're not looking for a ceasefire. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_UpGHJmtik&t=103.28s)]
*  We're looking for a total, complete victory. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_UpGHJmtik&t=104.28s)]
*  Again, you know what the victory is. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_UpGHJmtik&t=107.2s)]
*  No nuclear weapon. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_UpGHJmtik&t=109.88s)]
*  Mark, he's been consistent on that. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_UpGHJmtik&t=113.2s)]
*  We've shown that all week. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_UpGHJmtik&t=115.03999999999999s)]
*  Do you think that the suggestion that there is disgruntlement amongst the ranks of the [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_UpGHJmtik&t=116.4s)]
*  Republican Party writ large are overblown or on target? [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_UpGHJmtik&t=120.56s)]
*  Oh, completely overblown. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_UpGHJmtik&t=124.56s)]
*  I mean, the idea that there's a schism in the Republican Party or that the Trump coalition [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_UpGHJmtik&t=127.08s)]
*  is breaking up is completely absurd. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_UpGHJmtik&t=131.84s)]
*  The Reagan Institute is coming out with a new poll this weekend. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_UpGHJmtik&t=134.32s)]
*  I've seen the numbers in advance. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_UpGHJmtik&t=137.12s)]
*  90 percent of self-described mega-Republicans say Iran cannot have a nuclear weapon. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_UpGHJmtik&t=139.16s)]
*  80 percent say that Israel's security is vital to our security. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_UpGHJmtik&t=144.96s)]
*  64 percent support Israel bombing the nuclear facilities. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_UpGHJmtik&t=151.8s)]
*  There is absolutely no daylight between Donald Trump and the MAGA movement. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_UpGHJmtik&t=155.8s)]
*  What there are is a small, tiny, loud but tiny cabal of Republican isolationists on [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_UpGHJmtik&t=159.44s)]
*  Capitol Hill and in the Commentariat who are completely disconnected from Donald Trump [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_UpGHJmtik&t=165.52s)]
*  and the MAGA movement. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_UpGHJmtik&t=171.04s)]
*  The MAGA movement is absolutely behind Donald Trump in getting rid of this nuclear program. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_UpGHJmtik&t=172.04s)]
*  I wanted to ask you about this because some of the friends of Iran are sort of way in [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_UpGHJmtik&t=178.04s)]
*  the background. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_UpGHJmtik&t=184.56s)]
*  And the Wall Street Journal says this. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_UpGHJmtik&t=185.68s)]
*  We have a map as well. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_UpGHJmtik&t=187.28s)]
*  The axis of resistance and the militias that they're looking to, why Iran's axis of [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_UpGHJmtik&t=188.6s)]
*  resistance is missing in action. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_UpGHJmtik&t=193.72s)]
*  Militia groups allied with Tehran have mostly stayed out of its war with Israel. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_UpGHJmtik&t=195.84s)]
*  One of the things I think about this is that there are facts on the ground and there's [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_UpGHJmtik&t=200.72s)]
*  also just two weeks ago President Trump was in the region. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_UpGHJmtik&t=204.48s)]
*  And I think a lot of those countries in the region have been strategically quiet. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_UpGHJmtik&t=207.88s)]
*  And China and Russia might try to help Iran, but they're being fairly quiet about it. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_UpGHJmtik&t=212.48s)]
*  Jim Garrity writes about that this morning over at National Review. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_UpGHJmtik&t=218.12s)]
*  What's your take on it? [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_UpGHJmtik&t=221.64s)]
*  Well, first of all, the axis of resistance in the region has been destroyed. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_UpGHJmtik&t=223.55999999999997s)]
*  It's gone since October 7th. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_UpGHJmtik&t=228.83999999999997s)]
*  I mean, you know, one of the ridiculous arguments you're hearing from the isolationists, right, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_UpGHJmtik&t=230.6s)]
*  is we don't want to get drawn into another Middle Eastern war. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_UpGHJmtik&t=235.55999999999997s)]
*  Nobody's talking about sending 160,000 U.S. troops to occupy Tehran. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_UpGHJmtik&t=238.2s)]
*  What we're talking about is something more akin to what Donald Trump did in 2020 when [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_UpGHJmtik&t=244.35999999999999s)]
*  he took out Qasem Soleimani, right? [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_UpGHJmtik&t=247.04s)]
*  Back then, Iran didn't retaliate, and it had its whole axis of resistance intact. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_UpGHJmtik&t=249.56s)]
*  Since then, Hezbollah has been destroyed. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_UpGHJmtik&t=255.12s)]
*  You notice there's no Hezbollah rockets flying down on Israel, because Israel took them all [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_UpGHJmtik&t=257.76s)]
*  out and took out its entire leadership. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_UpGHJmtik&t=261.96000000000004s)]
*  Hamas has been destroyed. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_UpGHJmtik&t=263.8s)]
*  Trump pummeled the Houthis. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_UpGHJmtik&t=266.12s)]
*  Syria is no longer an Iranian ally, and it's actually allowing its skies to be used to [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_UpGHJmtik&t=268.64s)]
*  shoot down Iranian missiles heading for Israel. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_UpGHJmtik&t=272.8s)]
*  And so, this entire—and Russia is completely occupied in Ukraine and is pulling out its [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_UpGHJmtik&t=275.59999999999997s)]
*  forces from Syria. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_UpGHJmtik&t=281.24s)]
*  So there's no axis of resistance to turn back to. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_UpGHJmtik&t=283.28s)]
*  So the risk of Iranian retaliation, half of their ballistic missile launchers are gone, [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_UpGHJmtik&t=285.52s)]
*  their air defenses are completely destroyed. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_UpGHJmtik&t=290.0s)]
*  Iran has never been weaker. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_UpGHJmtik&t=292.35999999999996s)]
*  And so, you know, the idea that Donald Trump can't execute this operation at will is [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_UpGHJmtik&t=294.44s)]
*  absurd, and the idea that the man who killed Qasem Soleimani is going to be afraid to take [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_UpGHJmtik&t=299.4s)]
*  out Netanze—I'm sorry, to take out Fordow, a nuclear enrichment plant, is ridiculous. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_UpGHJmtik&t=303.32s)]
*  Mark Thiessen, thank you. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_UpGHJmtik&t=308.88s)]
*  I'm sure we'll be seeing you over the weekend and next week too. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_UpGHJmtik&t=311.79999999999995s)]
*  Thank you, Dana. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_UpGHJmtik&t=316.08s)]
