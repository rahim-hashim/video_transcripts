# BREAKING: Trump announces Iran, Israel have agreed to 'complete and total ceasefire' #news #shorts
**Fox News - World News:** [June 23, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cL91W9bGJ2c)
*  What does that mean? How did it come about? What's the development? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cL91W9bGJ2c&t=0.0s)]
*  Yeah, well we were actually working on that just as I left the White House to come over here. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cL91W9bGJ2c&t=4.0s)]
*  So that's good news that the president was able to get that across the finish line. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cL91W9bGJ2c&t=7.0s)]
*  I think what it means, Brett, is quite simple. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cL91W9bGJ2c&t=10.0s)]
*  First of all, the president, without knock on wood, having a single American casualty, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cL91W9bGJ2c&t=12.0s)]
*  obliterated the Iranian nuclear program. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cL91W9bGJ2c&t=18.0s)]
*  We are now in a place where we weren't a week ago. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cL91W9bGJ2c&t=21.0s)]
*  A week ago, Iran was very close to having a nuclear weapon. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cL91W9bGJ2c&t=23.0s)]
*  Now, Iran is incapable of building a nuclear weapon with the equipment they have because we destroyed it. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cL91W9bGJ2c&t=26.0s)]
*  So that's a very, very big thing. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cL91W9bGJ2c&t=32.0s)]
*  Now, what that means, I think, is we have to talk to Iran and, of course, to Israel about what the future holds. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cL91W9bGJ2c&t=34.0s)]
*  Because while we have obliterated the Iranian nuclear program, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cL91W9bGJ2c&t=39.0s)]
*  our hope and our expectation is that they're not going to try to rebuild that program. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cL91W9bGJ2c&t=42.0s)]
