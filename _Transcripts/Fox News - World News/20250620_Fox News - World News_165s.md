# Putin's BOLD warning concerning Israel-Iran conflict
**Fox News - World News:** [June 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-iMEpdw6uM)
*  A short time ago, Russian President Vladimir Putin [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-iMEpdw6uM&t=0.0s)]
*  was asked if he is worried that the world could be heading [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-iMEpdw6uM&t=2.1s)]
*  toward World War III in this situation. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-iMEpdw6uM&t=5.44s)]
*  Here's what he said. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-iMEpdw6uM&t=8.38s)]
*  It is disturbing. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-iMEpdw6uM&t=12.48s)]
*  I am speaking without any irony, without any jokes. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-iMEpdw6uM&t=13.620000000000001s)]
*  Of course, there is a lot of conflict potential. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-iMEpdw6uM&t=16.56s)]
*  It is growing, and it is right under our noses, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-iMEpdw6uM&t=19.78s)]
*  and it affects us directly. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-iMEpdw6uM&t=23.3s)]
*  And this requires, of course, not only our careful attention [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-iMEpdw6uM&t=25.560000000000002s)]
*  to the events taking place, but also the search for solutions, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-iMEpdw6uM&t=29.54s)]
*  the search for solutions, preferably by peaceful means. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-iMEpdw6uM&t=34.24s)]
*  All right, very interesting. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-iMEpdw6uM&t=40.42s)]
*  Let's bring in Fox News senior correspondent Benjamin Hall, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-iMEpdw6uM&t=41.48s)]
*  host of American Exceptionalism, available on Fox Nation. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-iMEpdw6uM&t=44.18s)]
*  Ben, always good to have you with us. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-iMEpdw6uM&t=47.32s)]
*  You know, this builds, this statement by Putin [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-iMEpdw6uM&t=49.06s)]
*  builds upon a statement by his spokesperson, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-iMEpdw6uM&t=51.620000000000005s)]
*  Dmitry Peskov, who said, you know, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-iMEpdw6uM&t=55.46s)]
*  don't even think about killing Khamenei, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-iMEpdw6uM&t=56.94s)]
*  that that would be opening Pandora's box, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-iMEpdw6uM&t=59.8s)]
*  and that he believed there would be an outpouring of support [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-iMEpdw6uM&t=62.099999999999994s)]
*  for the Iranian regime. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-iMEpdw6uM&t=64.98s)]
*  Your thoughts on where this stands, and Russia's bold talk, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-iMEpdw6uM&t=66.64s)]
*  but not a lot of action on behalf of Iran. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-iMEpdw6uM&t=69.44s)]
*  Yeah, Martha, it's fascinating. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-iMEpdw6uM&t=73.42s)]
*  We hadn't heard as much as we expected to from Russia [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-iMEpdw6uM&t=74.68s)]
*  until the last few days. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-iMEpdw6uM&t=77.02s)]
*  But look, Russia is looking at one of its closest allies [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-iMEpdw6uM&t=78.12s)]
*  right now. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-iMEpdw6uM&t=80.82s)]
*  Iran is part of that coalition between Russia, Iran, North [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-iMEpdw6uM&t=81.66s)]
*  Korea, and if Iran were to fall, and everyone's looking not [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-iMEpdw6uM&t=85.74s)]
*  just at the nuclear deal, but perhaps if it were to fall, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-iMEpdw6uM&t=89.69999999999999s)]
*  that takes a big ally away from Russia, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-iMEpdw6uM&t=92.14s)]
*  and they would do everything they can to try and shore them [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-iMEpdw6uM&t=94.33999999999999s)]
*  up. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-iMEpdw6uM&t=96.14s)]
*  On top of that, we know that China is also really interested [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-iMEpdw6uM&t=96.94s)]
*  in having Iran on the table. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-iMEpdw6uM&t=100.14s)]
*  And now we're seeing China planes flying into Iran, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-iMEpdw6uM&t=101.64s)]
*  perhaps to pull people out, but also a real awareness [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-iMEpdw6uM&t=105.28s)]
*  of the 1.3 million barrels of oil a day [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-iMEpdw6uM&t=108.06s)]
*  that go from Iran to China. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-iMEpdw6uM&t=110.82s)]
*  So you suddenly have this coalition of countries [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-iMEpdw6uM&t=112.22s)]
*  that have supported Iran who are pushing back against it. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-iMEpdw6uM&t=114.36s)]
*  And of course, when Dmitry Peskov earlier said that if the Ayatollah [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-iMEpdw6uM&t=117.48s)]
*  was assassinated, then that would lead to severe consequences, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-iMEpdw6uM&t=121.16s)]
*  they are thinking about Putin as well. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-iMEpdw6uM&t=124.76s)]
*  They do not want to send a message that you can get rid [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-iMEpdw6uM&t=126.96s)]
*  of the leader of a country because you are at war with them, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-iMEpdw6uM&t=129.44s)]
*  because of course, that is Putin's own spokesman when [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-iMEpdw6uM&t=131.66s)]
*  he says that. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-iMEpdw6uM&t=134.88s)]
*  So those countries looking really, really closely, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-iMEpdw6uM&t=135.44s)]
*  and I think would do whatever they can to keep the Ayatollah [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-iMEpdw6uM&t=138.44s)]
*  in power. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-iMEpdw6uM&t=142.44s)]
*  Benjamin Hall, great coverage. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-iMEpdw6uM&t=145.12s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-iMEpdw6uM&t=146.96s)]
*  Good to see you. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-iMEpdw6uM&t=148.08s)]
