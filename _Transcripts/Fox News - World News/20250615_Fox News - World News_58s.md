# Damage reported after Iranian ballistic missiles strike residential buildings in Central Israel #new
**Fox News - World News:** [June 15, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PMAh8p5y8Nc)
*  When these attacks happen in the middle of the night, it's challenging. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PMAh8p5y8Nc&t=0.0s)]
*  Sometimes people are so exhausted they sleep through the alarms. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PMAh8p5y8Nc&t=3.3000000000000003s)]
*  They don't see the attacks. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PMAh8p5y8Nc&t=6.6000000000000005s)]
*  Or they simply just don't go to the shelter. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PMAh8p5y8Nc&t=8.5s)]
*  And it can be deadly. As we saw today, they were pulling bodies out of the rubble of this apartment building. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PMAh8p5y8Nc&t=11.0s)]
*  And again, I just want to show you the scene here, Ashley, as the sun rises here in Tel Aviv. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PMAh8p5y8Nc&t=17.3s)]
*  You can see the aftermath of this strike more clearly. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PMAh8p5y8Nc&t=24.1s)]
*  I have been to this area, and I'm being again very careful about talking about this. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PMAh8p5y8Nc&t=28.900000000000002s)]
*  I've been to this area countless times. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PMAh8p5y8Nc&t=33.1s)]
*  It is an area with coffee shops. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PMAh8p5y8Nc&t=35.5s)]
*  It is an area filled with a very popular spot to live as a young person in Tel Aviv. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PMAh8p5y8Nc&t=36.9s)]
*  Because you can run, you can end up going to areas where other people gather. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PMAh8p5y8Nc&t=41.7s)]
*  And it is now the site of a ballistic missile attack and a tragedy for the Israeli people. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PMAh8p5y8Nc&t=47.6s)]
