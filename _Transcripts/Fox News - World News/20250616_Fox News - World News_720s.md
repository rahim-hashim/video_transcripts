# Israel's president sends stern message: 'Get the g------ nukes out of Iran's hands'
**Fox News - World News:** [June 16, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdEwYDEyg5I)
*  The Israeli air forces controls the skies over Tehran. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdEwYDEyg5I&t=0.0s)]
*  This changes the entire campaign. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdEwYDEyg5I&t=4.96s)]
*  We are on the path to achieving our two objectives, eliminating the nuclear threat and eliminating [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdEwYDEyg5I&t=7.16s)]
*  the missile threat. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdEwYDEyg5I&t=12.48s)]
*  When we control the skies over Tehran, we strike those targets, regime targets, unlike [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdEwYDEyg5I&t=14.02s)]
*  the criminal Iranian regime that targets our civilians. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdEwYDEyg5I&t=19.12s)]
*  Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu is speaking at an air base this morning. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdEwYDEyg5I&t=23.88s)]
*  The IDF says it destroyed more than 20 surface-to-surface missiles in an overnight strike. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdEwYDEyg5I&t=27.119999999999997s)]
*  It says a third of the regime's missile launchers have now been dismantled. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdEwYDEyg5I&t=32.16s)]
*  A long line of cars seen leaving Tehran as the fighting intensifies. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdEwYDEyg5I&t=36.08s)]
*  You can see that there. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdEwYDEyg5I&t=40.48s)]
*  And this all comes as Israel looks to cripple the regime's nuclear program, which it calls [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdEwYDEyg5I&t=41.839999999999996s)]
*  an existential threat. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdEwYDEyg5I&t=46.64s)]
*  Israeli President Isaac Herzog joins us from Jerusalem. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdEwYDEyg5I&t=48.8s)]
*  There is a slight delay, so bear with us. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdEwYDEyg5I&t=51.56s)]
*  And sir, thank you so much. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdEwYDEyg5I&t=53.519999999999996s)]
*  Prime Minister Netanyahu says that you're close to achieving the two objectives in this mission. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdEwYDEyg5I&t=56.04s)]
*  Do you need American military support in order to complete those objectives? [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdEwYDEyg5I&t=62.72s)]
*  So, thank you, Dana, and thank you, Bill, from Jerusalem. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdEwYDEyg5I&t=68.2s)]
*  I'm calling you and speaking to you. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdEwYDEyg5I&t=74.76s)]
*  And I believe that, you know, your viewers and you, you know that Israel is the closest [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdEwYDEyg5I&t=77.16s)]
*  ally of the United States of America. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdEwYDEyg5I&t=82.6s)]
*  And America is the closest ally of the state of Israel. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdEwYDEyg5I&t=85.32s)]
*  And we share joint national security interests on many fields. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdEwYDEyg5I&t=88.67999999999999s)]
*  But the American administration will take its decisions, and Israel will take its decisions. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdEwYDEyg5I&t=93.72s)]
*  We had no choice. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdEwYDEyg5I&t=98.91999999999999s)]
*  We had a clear and imminent threat on an American, on an Iranian nuclear program that has rushed [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdEwYDEyg5I&t=100.03999999999999s)]
*  to the bomb. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdEwYDEyg5I&t=109.63999999999999s)]
*  In recent months, broke almost into the bomb by both armament and enrichment. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdEwYDEyg5I&t=110.96s)]
*  And as President Donald Trump himself reiterated time and again that Iran must not have the [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdEwYDEyg5I&t=117.55999999999999s)]
*  bomb and must not have this capability, we saw that whilst they were negotiating, they [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdEwYDEyg5I&t=123.24s)]
*  also were doing undercover operations to get to the bomb. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdEwYDEyg5I&t=129.28s)]
*  And that is why we took this decision following a historic change of Israeli governments who've [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdEwYDEyg5I&t=133.92s)]
*  taken this decision in the past to make sure that none of our enemies have the bomb. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdEwYDEyg5I&t=140.67999999999998s)]
*  Mr. President, during this war, can Iran go nuclear? [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdEwYDEyg5I&t=146.48s)]
*  Can they fuel a bomb amidst this war on day four already? [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdEwYDEyg5I&t=150.64s)]
*  As far as I know, I don't think it's feasible. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdEwYDEyg5I&t=158.35999999999999s)]
*  I think that would be, you know, a very dangerous development. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdEwYDEyg5I&t=160.79999999999998s)]
*  We are trying with all our might and capabilities and our heroic fighters and pilots to make [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdEwYDEyg5I&t=165.16s)]
*  sure that they don't get there, but rather that we delay, postpone, undermine their capability [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdEwYDEyg5I&t=172.88s)]
*  of getting to the bomb. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdEwYDEyg5I&t=178.64000000000001s)]
*  We've carried out a massive operation. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdEwYDEyg5I&t=180.36s)]
*  This operation strengthens the security and well-being of the free world, not only Israel. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdEwYDEyg5I&t=183.28s)]
*  This operation prevents Iran from being on the doorstep of Europe with a huge nuclear [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdEwYDEyg5I&t=189.88s)]
*  program. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdEwYDEyg5I&t=196.28s)]
*  And let's understand, we know for 80 years, the world has decided and made clear that [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdEwYDEyg5I&t=197.64s)]
*  nukes are the most dangerous of all and has decided and made clear for decades already [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdEwYDEyg5I&t=203.28s)]
*  that Iran must not have a nuclear capability. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdEwYDEyg5I&t=209.88s)]
*  And even recently, just a few days ago, the International Atomic Agency in Vienna made [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdEwYDEyg5I&t=213.07999999999998s)]
*  clear in a decision of its board of governors, a historic, unprecedented decision, that Iran [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdEwYDEyg5I&t=219.32s)]
*  is violating all its agreements with the international community in this respect. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdEwYDEyg5I&t=225.2s)]
*  That is why we had to take this operation. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdEwYDEyg5I&t=229.96s)]
*  We did not seek that war. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdEwYDEyg5I&t=232.16s)]
*  We never want this war. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdEwYDEyg5I&t=234.04s)]
*  But unfortunately, since October 7th, we've been dealing with an empire of evil all orchestrated [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdEwYDEyg5I&t=235.76s)]
*  from Tehran. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdEwYDEyg5I&t=241.68s)]
*  The proxies of Iran have been degraded, mostly thanks to the work of Israel, Hezbollah, Hamas. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdEwYDEyg5I&t=243.95999999999998s)]
*  And I'm curious if you have any update on the discussions about the hostages who are [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdEwYDEyg5I&t=251.72s)]
*  still being held in Gaza. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdEwYDEyg5I&t=257.4s)]
*  So, you know, we have 53 hostages. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdEwYDEyg5I&t=259.76s)]
*  And I'm grateful to President Trump and his administration for working tirelessly to get [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdEwYDEyg5I&t=265.28s)]
*  them out of Gaza, including, of course, our people, our negotiating teams. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdEwYDEyg5I&t=271.20000000000005s)]
*  We've accepted all offers of the mediators in the last few months. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdEwYDEyg5I&t=276.36s)]
*  We said yes, and Hamas said no. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdEwYDEyg5I&t=281.0s)]
*  So we're operating in Gaza to bring them back home. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdEwYDEyg5I&t=283.36s)]
*  But the lesson of Gaza is a lesson to the entire free world, which is convening in Kadanda [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdEwYDEyg5I&t=286.76000000000005s)]
*  today at the G7 summit. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdEwYDEyg5I&t=291.72s)]
*  Let's understand, if you enable such an enemy to raise its head and develop such an infrastructure [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdEwYDEyg5I&t=294.24s)]
*  for decades, then you wake up one morning and you see that the jihadist ideology of [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdEwYDEyg5I&t=302.16s)]
*  trying to reign over the Middle East to be its ruler is moving forward. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdEwYDEyg5I&t=308.44s)]
*  And what we are doing right now is we are trying to move away and enable other peace [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdEwYDEyg5I&t=314.88s)]
*  forces, other nations in the region, together with Israel, to offer a better hope. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdEwYDEyg5I&t=321.68s)]
*  I sincerely want our Palestinian neighbors to have a better life. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdEwYDEyg5I&t=327.44s)]
*  I sincerely want our Arab neighbors to have a better life. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdEwYDEyg5I&t=332.08000000000004s)]
*  But we in Israel are bombarded day in, day out by Iranian missiles and before that by [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdEwYDEyg5I&t=335.76000000000005s)]
*  Houthi Yemenite missiles and before that with Hezbollah missiles and before that Hamas [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdEwYDEyg5I&t=341.84000000000003s)]
*  missiles. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdEwYDEyg5I&t=348.0s)]
*  It's all started in Tehran. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdEwYDEyg5I&t=349.0s)]
*  It's all financed by Tehran. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdEwYDEyg5I&t=352.44s)]
*  It's all armed by Tehran. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdEwYDEyg5I&t=354.28000000000003s)]
*  And we have to understand this is a clear threat to world stability and Middle East [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdEwYDEyg5I&t=356.16s)]
*  stability. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdEwYDEyg5I&t=361.40000000000003s)]
*  Sir, I don't know what the latest numbers are. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdEwYDEyg5I&t=362.40000000000003s)]
*  The numbers I have is 300 ballistic missiles approximately fired toward Israel, of which [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdEwYDEyg5I&t=364.56s)]
*  many have intercepted, but others have gotten through and caused casualties on the ground [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdEwYDEyg5I&t=369.36s)]
*  there. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdEwYDEyg5I&t=374.64s)]
*  Perhaps the Iranians have a thousand more. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdEwYDEyg5I&t=375.64s)]
*  Maybe the number is higher. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdEwYDEyg5I&t=377.32s)]
*  I do not know. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdEwYDEyg5I&t=378.32s)]
*  But eventually Iran runs out of ballistic missiles. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdEwYDEyg5I&t=379.44s)]
*  Israel is not going to occupy the country of Iran. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdEwYDEyg5I&t=384.04s)]
*  What happens when they reach the end of the line of the ballistic missile threat to Israel? [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdEwYDEyg5I&t=387.88s)]
*  So as Prime Minister Netanyahu said today, our pilots are flying all over Iran. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdEwYDEyg5I&t=395.92s)]
*  Indeed, these missiles are machines to kill citizens. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdEwYDEyg5I&t=403.76s)]
*  I mean, they're like spraying Israel with missiles every night in order to harass Israelis. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdEwYDEyg5I&t=407.84s)]
*  Unfortunately, innocent lives were taken, innocent Israelis killed in their bedrooms, [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdEwYDEyg5I&t=413.88s)]
*  in their shelters, from toddlers to old age 94 year old Holocaust survivor today. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdEwYDEyg5I&t=419.84s)]
*  So we have to understand that this is a war which we are trying to eradicate a threat. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdEwYDEyg5I&t=426.92s)]
*  They are trying to kill civilians. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdEwYDEyg5I&t=434.32000000000005s)]
*  And all I say is to the world, if you want to de-escalate, get the goddamn nukes out [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdEwYDEyg5I&t=436.48s)]
*  of Tehran's hands and bring a new change, bring a new direction, bring a different direction [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdEwYDEyg5I&t=441.88000000000005s)]
*  for the day after. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdEwYDEyg5I&t=447.8s)]
*  We should think about the day after. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdEwYDEyg5I&t=448.88000000000005s)]
*  And I am confident and I trust the administration, the US administration, for moving forward [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdEwYDEyg5I&t=451.2s)]
*  with plans. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdEwYDEyg5I&t=458.71999999999997s)]
*  But for that, we all have to show unanimity, unanimity in our cause and objective to make [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdEwYDEyg5I&t=459.71999999999997s)]
*  sure that Iran does not have nuclear weapons. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdEwYDEyg5I&t=465.88s)]
*  President Trump shares that. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdEwYDEyg5I&t=469.48s)]
*  And he said this yesterday at the White House. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdEwYDEyg5I&t=471.32s)]
*  Mr. President, can you give us a sense of what your feelings are about the escalation [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdEwYDEyg5I&t=473.91999999999996s)]
*  between Iran and Israel? [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdEwYDEyg5I&t=478.91999999999996s)]
*  Well, I hope there's going to be a deal. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdEwYDEyg5I&t=480.92s)]
*  I think it's time for a deal and we'll see what happens. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdEwYDEyg5I&t=482.96000000000004s)]
*  But sometimes they have to fight it out. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdEwYDEyg5I&t=485.76s)]
*  But we're going to see what happens. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdEwYDEyg5I&t=488.6s)]
*  I think there's a good chance there'll be a deal. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdEwYDEyg5I&t=490.28000000000003s)]
*  Given the reality on the ground right now and in the air, as you just said, what do [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdEwYDEyg5I&t=493.36s)]
*  you think the chances of a deal are for Iran at this point? [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdEwYDEyg5I&t=498.24s)]
*  Look, it's a psychological and physical and emotional challenge. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdEwYDEyg5I&t=503.48s)]
*  But we are a very strong and resilient nation. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdEwYDEyg5I&t=513.12s)]
*  And we've shown immense capabilities. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdEwYDEyg5I&t=515.88s)]
*  And that is why at the end, the Iranians will have to understand that they cannot go through [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdEwYDEyg5I&t=518.72s)]
*  terror again. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdEwYDEyg5I&t=526.32s)]
*  They cannot spread havoc and terror for decades in the Middle East. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdEwYDEyg5I&t=527.32s)]
*  They cannot radicalize nations. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdEwYDEyg5I&t=531.56s)]
*  They cannot plant terror cells all over the world. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdEwYDEyg5I&t=534.12s)]
*  And they cannot go nuclear. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdEwYDEyg5I&t=537.88s)]
*  And I hope that the Iranian people will wake up because they are coerced by a terrible [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdEwYDEyg5I&t=541.28s)]
*  regime. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdEwYDEyg5I&t=546.52s)]
*  And I hope they will raise their voices clear and loud. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdEwYDEyg5I&t=547.92s)]
*  So I think now when the G7 summit is convening in Canada, it should be top priority on two [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdEwYDEyg5I&t=551.56s)]
*  things. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdEwYDEyg5I&t=558.04s)]
*  No way Iran going nuclear. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdEwYDEyg5I&t=559.12s)]
*  Secondly, bring back our hostages as soon as possible. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdEwYDEyg5I&t=561.16s)]
*  I believe that bringing the hostages back home will be the key to the door to opening [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdEwYDEyg5I&t=564.2s)]
*  a different horizon in our region. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdEwYDEyg5I&t=570.6s)]
*  That is what I told world leaders. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdEwYDEyg5I&t=573.08s)]
*  You want to change reality everywhere, also in Gaza. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdEwYDEyg5I&t=575.04s)]
*  We want to. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdEwYDEyg5I&t=578.64s)]
*  But for that, bring our hostages and bring a path forward. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdEwYDEyg5I&t=579.68s)]
*  Mr. President, one last question here. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdEwYDEyg5I&t=583.64s)]
*  The Ayatollah is in charge of the Iranian country and the Iranian people now. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdEwYDEyg5I&t=585.88s)]
*  Is there a back channel of communications by which Israel can communicate effectively [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdEwYDEyg5I&t=592.28s)]
*  with the Iranian leadership now? [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdEwYDEyg5I&t=598.04s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdEwYDEyg5I&t=603.2s)]
*  We are dealing with very cruel people who have spread terror. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdEwYDEyg5I&t=605.76s)]
*  So I don't know if there's any way of a dialogue. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdEwYDEyg5I&t=611.28s)]
*  But you know that there are countries that are willing to speak to the Iranian leadership [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdEwYDEyg5I&t=614.64s)]
*  and find a way and a path forward. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdEwYDEyg5I&t=621.04s)]
*  We never had war with the Iranian people. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdEwYDEyg5I&t=623.72s)]
*  On the contrary, we always had great respect for them. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdEwYDEyg5I&t=625.76s)]
*  They're a huge people. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdEwYDEyg5I&t=628.88s)]
*  They're a nation with great history. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdEwYDEyg5I&t=629.88s)]
*  Many Jews came from Iran. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdEwYDEyg5I&t=633.76s)]
*  which is really inquisitive for me in terms of how I see facts. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdEwYDEyg5I&t=636.68s)]
*  Yesterday, I visited a beautiful city in the heart of Israel which was bombarded by missiles. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdEwYDEyg5I&t=642.16s)]
*  And I visited a family of three generations who were saved by a miracle from the missile [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdEwYDEyg5I&t=648.9599999999999s)]
*  that totally, totally eradicated their home. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdEwYDEyg5I&t=654.9599999999999s)]
*  They came from Isfahan. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdEwYDEyg5I&t=658.16s)]
*  There are Jews who came from Isfahan originally, from Iran. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdEwYDEyg5I&t=659.16s)]
*  So I think, you know, at the end, we should all live in peace in this region. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdEwYDEyg5I&t=663.04s)]
*  But for that, you have to stop an empire of evil because that's what they do all day long. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdEwYDEyg5I&t=667.0799999999999s)]
*  They take people's money and spend it on killing people all over the region. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdEwYDEyg5I&t=673.0799999999999s)]
*  Why would a small, tiny tribe like the Houthis in Yemen have 50,000 people, have ballistic [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdEwYDEyg5I&t=678.1999999999999s)]
*  missiles, have cruise missiles? [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdEwYDEyg5I&t=684.88s)]
*  They've been fed up and filled up with ammunition of empires, of big countries. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdEwYDEyg5I&t=687.44s)]
*  That means that the world has to rise up and say to the Iranians, no more. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdEwYDEyg5I&t=695.32s)]
*  Sir, thank you for your time. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdEwYDEyg5I&t=701.0400000000001s)]
