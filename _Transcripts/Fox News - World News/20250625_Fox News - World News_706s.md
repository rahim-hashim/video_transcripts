# ‘TOUGH LOVE’: Trump is forcing Europe to ‘have a backbone’
**Fox News - World News:** [June 25, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMjZS7MUm6Q)
*  And welcome to Hannity. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMjZS7MUm6Q&t=0.0s)]
*  And tonight, a major triumph for the USA in Europe, as NATO members hail President Trump's [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMjZS7MUm6Q&t=1.72s)]
*  leadership. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMjZS7MUm6Q&t=8.32s)]
*  And everyone but Spain, they agreed to pay their fair share to NATO, a huge win for President [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMjZS7MUm6Q&t=9.32s)]
*  Trump. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMjZS7MUm6Q&t=14.88s)]
*  There is no doubt at all whatsoever who the leader of the free world is tonight. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMjZS7MUm6Q&t=15.88s)]
*  Now, meanwhile, back at home, big trouble for America's biggest city. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMjZS7MUm6Q&t=20.6s)]
*  We will show you how Donald Trump responded to the communist lunatic that the Democrats [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMjZS7MUm6Q&t=24.400000000000002s)]
*  nominated to run New York City as the radical Democratic Party lurches even farther to the [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMjZS7MUm6Q&t=29.439999999999998s)]
*  left. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMjZS7MUm6Q&t=35.24s)]
*  Plus, the city's Republican mayoral candidate, Curtis Llewa, who now has a real shot in the [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMjZS7MUm6Q&t=36.24s)]
*  general election due to a crowded field of liberals and Democrats and radicals, he will [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMjZS7MUm6Q&t=40.68s)]
*  weigh in. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMjZS7MUm6Q&t=45.68s)]
*  And later, Joy Reid thinks there is one person, one, who can save the Democratic Party. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMjZS7MUm6Q&t=46.68s)]
*  Her name? [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMjZS7MUm6Q&t=52.56s)]
*  Jasmine Crockett. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMjZS7MUm6Q&t=53.56s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMjZS7MUm6Q&t=54.56s)]
*  Who cares what the party label is? [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMjZS7MUm6Q&t=56.32s)]
*  Give me an effective fighter. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMjZS7MUm6Q&t=58.120000000000005s)]
*  If Jasmine Crockett is the most effective fighter, give me Jasmine Crockett. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMjZS7MUm6Q&t=59.96s)]
*  And I really don't care what you have to move around or who you have to disappoint in order [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMjZS7MUm6Q&t=63.36s)]
*  to give me her. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMjZS7MUm6Q&t=67.8s)]
*  Just give me her, because we need a leader. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMjZS7MUm6Q&t=69.32000000000001s)]
*  I agree with Joy Reid. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMjZS7MUm6Q&t=73.0s)]
*  Jasmine Crockett for president. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMjZS7MUm6Q&t=74.28s)]
*  We'll have much more of the sad state of affairs with the Democratic Party. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMjZS7MUm6Q&t=75.80000000000001s)]
*  That's coming up first. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMjZS7MUm6Q&t=79.68s)]
*  What a difference a new year, a new president can make. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMjZS7MUm6Q&t=81.04s)]
*  Wow. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMjZS7MUm6Q&t=83.92s)]
*  This was our sad reality less than 12 months ago. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMjZS7MUm6Q&t=85.08s)]
*  Remember that moment? [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMjZS7MUm6Q&t=88.0s)]
*  NATO, let me go take a walk. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMjZS7MUm6Q&t=89.0s)]
*  Lost, dazed, confused, confounded in Europe. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMjZS7MUm6Q&t=91.16s)]
*  Joe Biden wandering off while European leaders awkwardly—come on back, Joe. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMjZS7MUm6Q&t=94.24000000000001s)]
*  Over here. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMjZS7MUm6Q&t=99.76s)]
*  Yeah, come back. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMjZS7MUm6Q&t=100.76s)]
*  Come back to the fold, Joe. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMjZS7MUm6Q&t=101.88s)]
*  We've got to take a picture. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMjZS7MUm6Q&t=102.88s)]
*  Anyway, thanks to President Trump, American leadership is back in a big, big way. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMjZS7MUm6Q&t=103.88s)]
*  Now, after Trump took a decisive action to obliterate Iran's nuclear program and then [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMjZS7MUm6Q&t=108.64s)]
*  negotiate a ceasefire between Israel and Iran after only 12 days at war, NATO's general [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMjZS7MUm6Q&t=114.08000000000001s)]
*  secretary or secretary general called him a man of strength, a man of peace. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMjZS7MUm6Q&t=120.4s)]
*  But he also made headlines today for preferring—this cracked me up—to our president as daddy. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMjZS7MUm6Q&t=125.80000000000001s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMjZS7MUm6Q&t=133.28s)]
*  They fought like hell, and then they said, let's stop. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMjZS7MUm6Q&t=134.28s)]
*  And they're going to build themselves. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMjZS7MUm6Q&t=137.68s)]
*  And I really see it as sticking—I mean, we may do papers on it, Marco. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMjZS7MUm6Q&t=138.92000000000002s)]
*  Maybe we're going to do papers. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMjZS7MUm6Q&t=142.60000000000002s)]
*  I don't even know if you need them. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMjZS7MUm6Q&t=144.16s)]
*  They're not going to be fighting each other. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMjZS7MUm6Q&t=145.16s)]
*  They've had it. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMjZS7MUm6Q&t=147.16s)]
*  They've had a big fight, like two kids at a schoolyard. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMjZS7MUm6Q&t=148.16s)]
*  You know they fight like hell. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMjZS7MUm6Q&t=150.96s)]
*  You can't stop them. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMjZS7MUm6Q&t=152.44s)]
*  Let them fight for about two, three minutes. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMjZS7MUm6Q&t=153.44s)]
*  Then it's easy to stop them. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMjZS7MUm6Q&t=155.04s)]
*  And daddy has to sometimes use strong language to do against them. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMjZS7MUm6Q&t=156.76s)]
*  You have to use strong language. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMjZS7MUm6Q&t=159.76s)]
*  Every once in a while, you have to use a certain word. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMjZS7MUm6Q&t=160.76s)]
*  All right. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMjZS7MUm6Q&t=163.76s)]
*  Now, in case you were wondering, here is how President Trump responded to the new title [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMjZS7MUm6Q&t=164.76s)]
*  after being asked a question by Sky News. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMjZS7MUm6Q&t=171.08s)]
*  And watch Secretary of State Marco Rubio in the background laughing hysterically. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMjZS7MUm6Q&t=173.96s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMjZS7MUm6Q&t=178.36s)]
*  Mark Rutter, the NATO chief who is your friend, he called you daddy earlier. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMjZS7MUm6Q&t=179.36s)]
*  Do you regard your NATO allies as kind of children? [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMjZS7MUm6Q&t=187.28s)]
*  No, he likes me. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMjZS7MUm6Q&t=191.04000000000002s)]
*  I think he likes me. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMjZS7MUm6Q&t=192.16000000000003s)]
*  If he doesn't, I'll let you know. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMjZS7MUm6Q&t=193.16000000000003s)]
*  I'll come back and I'll hit him hard. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMjZS7MUm6Q&t=194.84s)]
*  Okay? [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMjZS7MUm6Q&t=196.44s)]
*  He did. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMjZS7MUm6Q&t=197.44s)]
*  He did it very affectionately. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMjZS7MUm6Q&t=198.44s)]
*  Daddy, you're my daddy. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMjZS7MUm6Q&t=199.44s)]
*  That is hilarious. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMjZS7MUm6Q&t=201.07999999999998s)]
*  Anyway, maybe, just maybe, a father figure is exactly what NATO needed. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMjZS7MUm6Q&t=203.28s)]
*  The huge takeaway, NATO members now have finally agreed to pay their fair share, increase their [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMjZS7MUm6Q&t=208.24s)]
*  defense spending to 5 percent of their GDP. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMjZS7MUm6Q&t=214.92s)]
*  That more than doubles their previous requirement. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMjZS7MUm6Q&t=218.12s)]
*  Why? [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMjZS7MUm6Q&t=221.24s)]
*  All because all of you elected Donald Trump. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMjZS7MUm6Q&t=222.24s)]
*  He insisted on peace through strength. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMjZS7MUm6Q&t=224.86s)]
*  He insisted now our allies adopt the Trump doctrine. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMjZS7MUm6Q&t=227.04s)]
*  Unfortunately, there is one country that doesn't want to play ball. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMjZS7MUm6Q&t=231.08s)]
*  At least not yet. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMjZS7MUm6Q&t=234.48s)]
*  And now Donald Trump is vowing to respond with a little bit of tough love. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMjZS7MUm6Q&t=235.52s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMjZS7MUm6Q&t=238.76s)]
*  Oh, I think Spain's terrible what they've done. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMjZS7MUm6Q&t=239.76s)]
*  No, I do. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMjZS7MUm6Q&t=242.64s)]
*  They're the only country that won't pay the full up. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMjZS7MUm6Q&t=243.64s)]
*  They want to stay at 2 percent. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMjZS7MUm6Q&t=247.0s)]
*  I think it's terrible. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMjZS7MUm6Q&t=248.2s)]
*  And you know, they're doing very well. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMjZS7MUm6Q&t=249.2s)]
*  The economy is very well. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMjZS7MUm6Q&t=250.3s)]
*  And that economy could be blown right out of the water with something bad happening. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMjZS7MUm6Q&t=252.44s)]
*  You know, Spain is the only country that... [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMjZS7MUm6Q&t=255.84s)]
*  Are you from Spain? [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMjZS7MUm6Q&t=257.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMjZS7MUm6Q&t=258.6s)]
*  Good, congratulations. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMjZS7MUm6Q&t=259.6s)]
*  You're the only country that is not paying. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMjZS7MUm6Q&t=260.6s)]
*  I don't know what the problem is. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMjZS7MUm6Q&t=263.48s)]
*  I think it's too bad. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMjZS7MUm6Q&t=265.08s)]
*  So we'll make it up. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMjZS7MUm6Q&t=266.68s)]
*  You know what we're going to do? [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMjZS7MUm6Q&t=267.68s)]
*  We're negotiating with Spain on a trade deal. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMjZS7MUm6Q&t=268.68s)]
*  We're going to make them pay twice as much. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMjZS7MUm6Q&t=271.1s)]
*  And I'm actually serious about that. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMjZS7MUm6Q&t=272.84000000000003s)]
*  It really is nobody else like him. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMjZS7MUm6Q&t=275.44s)]
*  Anyway, at the end of the day, this is about peace through strength and keeping the world [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMjZS7MUm6Q&t=276.8s)]
*  safer. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMjZS7MUm6Q&t=280.96s)]
*  I think that's a good point. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMjZS7MUm6Q&t=282.96s)]
*  I think that's a good point. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMjZS7MUm6Q&t=283.96s)]

*  Where are you from? [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMjZS7MUm6Q&t=304.96s)]
*  I'm from Ukraine. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMjZS7MUm6Q&t=305.96s)]
*  Oh. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMjZS7MUm6Q&t=306.96s)]
*  So my question to you is whether or not the U.S. is ready to sell anti-air missile systems [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMjZS7MUm6Q&t=307.96s)]
*  patriot to Ukraine. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMjZS7MUm6Q&t=316.44s)]
*  We know that Russia has been pounding Ukraine really heavily right now. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMjZS7MUm6Q&t=318.0s)]
*  Are you living yourself now in Ukraine? [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMjZS7MUm6Q&t=321.96s)]
*  My husband is there. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMjZS7MUm6Q&t=323.96s)]
*  Wow. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMjZS7MUm6Q&t=325.96s)]
*  I can see you're very, you know, it's amazing. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMjZS7MUm6Q&t=326.96s)]
*  And me with the kids, I'm in Warsaw actually because he wanted me to be. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMjZS7MUm6Q&t=328.71999999999997s)]
*  Is your husband a soldier now? [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMjZS7MUm6Q&t=333.56s)]
*  He's. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMjZS7MUm6Q&t=335.56s)]
*  He's there now? [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMjZS7MUm6Q&t=336.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMjZS7MUm6Q&t=337.56s)]
*  Wow. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMjZS7MUm6Q&t=338.56s)]
*  That's rough stuff, right? [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMjZS7MUm6Q&t=339.56s)]
*  That's tough. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMjZS7MUm6Q&t=340.56s)]
*  And you're living here? [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMjZS7MUm6Q&t=341.56s)]
*  In Warsaw. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMjZS7MUm6Q&t=342.56s)]
*  And you're a reporter? [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMjZS7MUm6Q&t=343.56s)]
*  I am. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMjZS7MUm6Q&t=344.56s)]
*  Good. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMjZS7MUm6Q&t=345.56s)]
*  So let me just tell you, they do want to have the anti-missile missiles, okay, as they call [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMjZS7MUm6Q&t=346.56s)]
*  them, the Patriots. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMjZS7MUm6Q&t=351.96s)]
*  And we're going to see if we can make some available. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMjZS7MUm6Q&t=354.72s)]
*  Now, can you believe Democrats, the state-run legacy media mob, tried to smear President [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMjZS7MUm6Q&t=358.6s)]
*  Trump as some kind of warmonger? [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMjZS7MUm6Q&t=363.12s)]
*  Nothing, as we all can see every day, can be further from the truth. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMjZS7MUm6Q&t=365.64s)]
*  Nobody, no world leader, is putting more effort, no world leader in modern history has put [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMjZS7MUm6Q&t=370.08s)]
*  more effort into bringing about peace around the globe than President Donald J. Trump. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMjZS7MUm6Q&t=376.24s)]
*  Unfortunately, the truth doesn't really matter to the raging lunatics on the left. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMjZS7MUm6Q&t=382.68s)]
*  They will say they will do anything to disparage the president. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMjZS7MUm6Q&t=387.16s)]
*  They wanted to impeach him after taking out the nuclear sites of the number one state [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMjZS7MUm6Q&t=390.08s)]
*  sponsor of terror. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMjZS7MUm6Q&t=394.12s)]
*  That kind of tells you a lot. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMjZS7MUm6Q&t=395.12s)]
*  Let's take a look at the latest bogus so-called reporting surrounding the U.S. strike on Iran's [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMjZS7MUm6Q&t=396.32s)]
*  nuclear sites. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMjZS7MUm6Q&t=401.88s)]
*  A fake news CNN reporter named Natasha Bertrand now triumphantly claims that the president's [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMjZS7MUm6Q&t=403.12s)]
*  strikes did not obliterate Iran's nuclear sites at all. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMjZS7MUm6Q&t=410.44s)]
*  Now, keep in mind, this is the very same reporter who confidently authored this untrue story [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMjZS7MUm6Q&t=413.84000000000003s)]
*  in 2020 with the headline, Hunter Biden's Story is Russian Disinformation, Dozens of [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMjZS7MUm6Q&t=419.72s)]
*  Former Intel Officials Say. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMjZS7MUm6Q&t=425.6s)]
*  The same reporter also somehow believed that actual Russian disinformation in the Hillary [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMjZS7MUm6Q&t=427.88s)]
*  Clinton bought and paid for dirty Russian dossier was totally legit. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMjZS7MUm6Q&t=434.08000000000004s)]
*  The op-ed in The Washington Post accused her of bootstrapping the dossier into an MSDNC [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMjZS7MUm6Q&t=438.58s)]
*  gig in 2018. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMjZS7MUm6Q&t=444.74s)]
*  Natasha even suggested that Putin was having buyer's remorse for helping Donald Trump [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMjZS7MUm6Q&t=446.85999999999996s)]
*  win the election. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMjZS7MUm6Q&t=451.86s)]
*  Can't make it up. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMjZS7MUm6Q&t=452.86s)]
*  She still has a job. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMjZS7MUm6Q&t=453.86s)]
*  What a shock. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMjZS7MUm6Q&t=454.86s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMjZS7MUm6Q&t=455.86s)]
*  Well, I think you hear a lot of talk about Russia having buyer's remorse, about how [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMjZS7MUm6Q&t=456.86s)]
*  they kind of regret helping to elect Donald Trump because they—Donald Trump really has [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMjZS7MUm6Q&t=462.34s)]
*  not been the kind of partner that they could have wanted or hoped for. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMjZS7MUm6Q&t=467.14000000000004s)]
*  But you also have to remember that Donald Trump has not chosen to implement sanctions. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMjZS7MUm6Q&t=471.26000000000005s)]
*  He has not exactly been a hypercritical, you know, leader on the world stage of Russia. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMjZS7MUm6Q&t=476.5s)]
*  So in that sense, you know, you kind of—Russia kind of lucked out. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMjZS7MUm6Q&t=484.42s)]
*  But if you take, for example, the Steele dossier at kind of face value or you take that as [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMjZS7MUm6Q&t=488.24s)]
*  There was a lot of internal dissent within the Russian government about whether or not [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMjZS7MUm6Q&t=493.8s)]
*  and to what extent the Russians should interfere in the U.S. election and coordinate with Donald [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMjZS7MUm6Q&t=498.68s)]
*  Trump. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMjZS7MUm6Q&t=504.44s)]
*  And there were some that were saying that it was too ambitious. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMjZS7MUm6Q&t=505.44s)]
*  There was just—they were going to get caught. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMjZS7MUm6Q&t=507.96000000000004s)]
*  It was just not a good idea. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMjZS7MUm6Q&t=509.76s)]
*  And apparently, you know, Putin was very, very set on this project. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMjZS7MUm6Q&t=511.24s)]
*  Now this anti-Trump hack has zero credibility, and so do her Trump-hating sources. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMjZS7MUm6Q&t=518.36s)]
*  In a statement today, the CIA debunked Bertrand's reporting, quote, [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMjZS7MUm6Q&t=523.4s)]
*  Meanwhile, over on Truth Social, President Trump called for Natasha to be fired from [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMjZS7MUm6Q&t=548.36s)]
*  fake news CNN. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMjZS7MUm6Q&t=554.36s)]
*  They wonder why they're called fake news. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMjZS7MUm6Q&t=555.8000000000001s)]
*  Anyway, quote, [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMjZS7MUm6Q&t=557.6s)]
*  And hit pay dirt, total obliteration. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMjZS7MUm6Q&t=578.36s)]
*  Not only did President Trump eliminate the nuclear threat from Iran and negotiate a ceasefire [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMjZS7MUm6Q&t=582.16s)]
*  in the region, but he also galvanized his base. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMjZS7MUm6Q&t=587.12s)]
*  Look at this, a whopping 90 percent of Trump voters approve of his strikes on Iran. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMjZS7MUm6Q&t=590.84s)]
*  But it's not just his base. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMjZS7MUm6Q&t=596.8000000000001s)]
*  We have new polls out from Robert Cahalian, Trafalgar, and Matt Towery, Insider Advantage. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMjZS7MUm6Q&t=598.5s)]
*  We'll get an update from them in a minute. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMjZS7MUm6Q&t=604.48s)]
*  A large majority of the American people approve of Donald Trump's actions in the Middle East. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMjZS7MUm6Q&t=607.04s)]
*  And of course, the president had a very strong partner in Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMjZS7MUm6Q&t=613.4s)]
*  But according to President Trump, Netanyahu, he continues to face his own witch hunt in [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMjZS7MUm6Q&t=618.8s)]
*  Israel and has been summoned to court on Monday. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMjZS7MUm6Q&t=623.72s)]
*  Well, President Trump, he's rightly mad. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMjZS7MUm6Q&t=627.8s)]
*  And he is now calling on Israel to cancel the trial while praising the prime minister. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMjZS7MUm6Q&t=631.34s)]
*  He said, [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMjZS7MUm6Q&t=636.2199999999999s)]
*  Trump continued. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMjZS7MUm6Q&t=654.16s)]
*  be allowed. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMjZS7MUm6Q&t=665.8s)]
*  And I will echo those statements. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMjZS7MUm6Q&t=667.18s)]
*  How ungrateful it would be for the people of Israel, after all the prime minister did, [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMjZS7MUm6Q&t=669.3199999999999s)]
*  after all that President Trump did, to take away the biggest existential threat and a [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMjZS7MUm6Q&t=675.16s)]
*  nuclear-armed Iran to turn around the week—the next week and put your prime minister, a hero, [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMjZS7MUm6Q&t=680.9s)]
*  on trial? [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMjZS7MUm6Q&t=688.3199999999999s)]
*  That is madness beyond what Donald Trump went through here, and it was madness here. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMjZS7MUm6Q&t=689.76s)]
