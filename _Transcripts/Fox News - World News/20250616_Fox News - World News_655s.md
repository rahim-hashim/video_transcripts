# Watters: Iran is begging for mercy
**Fox News - World News:** [June 16, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUINVeAMB3o)
*  Fox News alert Donald Trump leaving the G7 early and returning to Washington where he's [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUINVeAMB3o&t=0.0s)]
*  requesting the National Security Council be prepared in the situation room after a deadly [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUINVeAMB3o&t=13.84s)]
*  weekend in the Middle East. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUINVeAMB3o&t=19.16s)]
*  In Israel 24 fatalities 600 wounded the death count even higher in Iran 224 dead and counting [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUINVeAMB3o&t=21.0s)]
*  Iran retaliating by firing over 370 missiles at the Jewish state but Israel's hitting back [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUINVeAMB3o&t=29.94s)]
*  harder. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUINVeAMB3o&t=36.14s)]
*  Overnight Iranian missiles struck an Israeli oil refinery and a power grid. This morning a state TV [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUINVeAMB3o&t=70.14s)]
*  outlet in Tehran was bombed during a live broadcast. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUINVeAMB3o&t=77.14s)]
*  Tehla Veev is claiming full aerial superiority over Iranian airspace. They downed two Iranian fighter [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUINVeAMB3o&t=82.14s)]
*  jets today after top Iranian military officials were taken out Friday. Israel says they've already [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUINVeAMB3o&t=103.14s)]
*  destroyed a third of Iran's missile launchers and nuclear sites are getting pummeled so badly [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUINVeAMB3o&t=110.14s)]
*  that residents are being warned of radiation spillage. The IDF is warning that Iran will pay [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUINVeAMB3o&t=115.14s)]
*  the price and they've scheduled this campaign to last two weeks. Their plan is to degrade the [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUINVeAMB3o&t=121.14s)]
*  Iranian nuclear program and destroy their ballistic missile stockpiles. The mullahs are getting [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUINVeAMB3o&t=127.14s)]
*  battered and they don't have the military capacity to trade endless missile strikes with Israel. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUINVeAMB3o&t=133.14s)]
*  They need a breather and are crossing their fingers that we don't provide the bunker busters that [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUINVeAMB3o&t=138.14s)]
*  could eliminate their nuclear sites deep underground. So they're begging Trump to come back to the [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUINVeAMB3o&t=143.14s)]
*  negotiation table hoping that the US doesn't get involved militarily and that Netanyahu will take [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUINVeAMB3o&t=148.14s)]
*  his finger off the trigger. Trump signaling that he'd prefer a deal over death. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUINVeAMB3o&t=154.14s)]
*  Have you heard any signals or seen any messages from intermediaries that Iran wishes to de-escalate the conflict? [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUINVeAMB3o&t=160.14s)]
*  Yeah. What have you heard from the Iranians? They'd like to talk, but they should have done that [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUINVeAMB3o&t=168.14s)]
*  before. I had 60 days and they had 60 days and on the 61st day I said we don't have a deal. They have [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUINVeAMB3o&t=175.14s)]
*  to make a deal and it's painful for both parties but I'd say Iran is not winning this war and they [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUINVeAMB3o&t=182.14s)]
*  should talk and they should talk immediately before it's too late. Democrats call Trump the taco [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUINVeAMB3o&t=190.14s)]
*  president aka Trump always chickens out, but he gave the Iranians a deadline for a deal and they [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUINVeAMB3o&t=196.14s)]
*  missed the deadline so he let Netanyahu go at him. Now Iran's begging for mercy and they're not going to [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUINVeAMB3o&t=202.14s)]
*  get a good deal now. The whole world witnessed that. That sends a strong message everywhere. Even on trade. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUINVeAMB3o&t=209.14s)]
*  Now Iran's lost leverage. They're at their weakest point in decades. Israel's neutralized their proxies. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUINVeAMB3o&t=217.14s)]
*  Hamas in Gaza, Hezbollah in Lebanon and Assad in Syria. The Iranians don't have much of a navy. Their [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUINVeAMB3o&t=224.14s)]
*  air force is ancient and their army's sitting ducks if they cross the border on foot into Iraq. They [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUINVeAMB3o&t=230.14s)]
*  can't project power. The only thing keeping the Ayatollah alive is his nuclear program and he's clinging [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUINVeAMB3o&t=236.14s)]
*  onto it so that he doesn't get Gaddafi'd. You remember Gaddafi gave up his nuclear program and then Barack [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUINVeAMB3o&t=243.14s)]
*  Hillary and the Europeans killed him anyway. Trump says it's very simple. I want to see no nuclear [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUINVeAMB3o&t=249.14s)]
*  weapon in Iran and we're well on our way to making sure that happens. America can't let Iran acquire a [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUINVeAMB3o&t=256.14s)]
*  nuclear weapon. Or any other country. Americans can't get blackmailed by rogue states. And stopping the [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUINVeAMB3o&t=263.14s)]
*  spread of nuclear weapons has been American policy since Oppenheimer made one. Trump originally put Net [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUINVeAMB3o&t=270.14s)]
*  Yahoo on ice and told them not to strike. But NBC reports Trump had a change of heart after the [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUINVeAMB3o&t=276.14s)]
*  International Atomic Energy Agency said Iran was cheating. 47 didn't want to be the president on whose [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUINVeAMB3o&t=283.14s)]
*  watch it was able to obtain a nuclear weapon. So the Pentagon started to quietly move resources to the region [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUINVeAMB3o&t=290.14s)]
*  deploying reconnaissance aircraft to conduct surveillance and provide intelligence to Israel. Moved [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUINVeAMB3o&t=297.14s)]
*  anti-drone and anti-missile systems from Ukraine to the Middle East. A carrier strike group from the [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUINVeAMB3o&t=303.14s)]
*  Pacific to the Eastern Mediterranean and they're assisting Israel with refueling flights. We're helping [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUINVeAMB3o&t=309.14s)]
*  Israel intercept Iranian strikes and defending American soldiers and assets in the region. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUINVeAMB3o&t=315.14s)]
*  So you were closely coordinating with the U.S. throughout this process? Look, we're fully coordinated, [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUINVeAMB3o&t=321.14s)]
*  but understand that America under President Trump will make the decisions that are best for America. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUINVeAMB3o&t=329.14s)]
*  And that's the way it is. He understands that I as the Prime Minister of Israel, the one and only Jewish [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUINVeAMB3o&t=335.14s)]
*  state, must make the decisions that are important for the survival of my country and he will do what is [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUINVeAMB3o&t=341.14s)]
*  best for America. That is a relationship of mutual respect and mutual confidence. Israel has its own [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUINVeAMB3o&t=347.14s)]
*  agenda. They're looking out for their own interests and sometimes those interests align with ours and [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUINVeAMB3o&t=354.14s)]
*  sometimes they don't. Israel isn't interested in talks with Iran. Netanyahu called the nuclear [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUINVeAMB3o&t=359.14s)]
*  negotiations between Iran and Washington fake. Trump disagrees. He'd rather negotiate a settlement [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUINVeAMB3o&t=365.14s)]
*  than settle it with airstrikes. Israel wants regime change. Reports say Trump told Netanyahu no when [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUINVeAMB3o&t=372.14s)]
*  they asked to assassinate Iran's Supreme Leader, Khomeini. Officials say, have the Iranians killed an [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUINVeAMB3o&t=380.14s)]
*  American yet? No. Until they do. We're not even talking about going after the political leadership. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUINVeAMB3o&t=386.14s)]
*  Bibi says Iran tried to kill Trump. These people who chant death to America try to assassinate [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUINVeAMB3o&t=393.14s)]
*  President Trump twice. Do you want these people to have nuclear weapons and the means to deliver them [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUINVeAMB3o&t=401.14s)]
*  to your cities? Of course not. So we're defending ourselves but we're also defending the world. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUINVeAMB3o&t=407.14s)]
*  You just said Iran tried to assassinate President Trump twice. Do you have intel that the assassination [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUINVeAMB3o&t=411.14s)]
*  attempts on President Trump were directly from Iran? Through proxies, yes. Through their intel, yes. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUINVeAMB3o&t=418.14s)]
*  They want to kill him. Whoa. Well, we know Iran tried to kill Trump but we never knew Ruth and Crooks [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUINVeAMB3o&t=425.14s)]
*  were Iranian proxies. Either Netanyahu just shared intelligence that hasn't been shared with the [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUINVeAMB3o&t=433.14s)]
*  American people or he's spinning. Remember, there's always propaganda when missiles are flying and as [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUINVeAMB3o&t=438.14s)]
*  critical as it is to prevent Iran from having a nuclear weapon, we've seen the risks of regime change. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUINVeAMB3o&t=445.14s)]
*  What comes next is the question. Iran's a theocracy. You can take out the Ayatollah but there's still [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUINVeAMB3o&t=451.14s)]
*  30,000 radical clerics. You can't kill them all. So who takes over after a decapitation strike? [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUINVeAMB3o&t=458.14s)]
*  Someone even more dangerous? Does the country disintegrate into militia infighting? Do insurgents [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUINVeAMB3o&t=465.14s)]
*  take over the oil sector? Do jihadists pour in from all over the world and force Iranian refugees to pour out? [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUINVeAMB3o&t=472.14s)]
*  And then who takes them? Israel doesn't have to manage that chaos. That'll fall to the United States. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUINVeAMB3o&t=479.14s)]
*  We've overthrown Iranian leaders before. We installed the Shah and he was a great ally against the Soviets [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUINVeAMB3o&t=486.14s)]
*  and kept the oil flowing but he was so unpopular there was a revolution and these fundamentalists took over. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUINVeAMB3o&t=493.14s)]
*  Their paramilitary groups laid siege to the region and they started enriching uranium. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUINVeAMB3o&t=499.14s)]
*  It's who we're dealing with now. You never really know what happens after you topple a leader. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUINVeAMB3o&t=504.14s)]
*  You'd rather have ships sailing from Europe to the Indian Ocean without any trouble. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUINVeAMB3o&t=510.14s)]
*  So far oil prices haven't spiked too much. Oil in the 60s is what's kept inflation at bay this year. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUINVeAMB3o&t=514.14s)]
*  Let's keep it that way. There's two key things to look for to tell you how this conflict's going to play out. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUINVeAMB3o&t=523.14s)]
*  If the Israelis start targeting Iranian oil refineries, that could tell you regime change could be next [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUINVeAMB3o&t=529.14s)]
*  because a domestic energy crisis will turn the streets against Iranian leadership. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUINVeAMB3o&t=536.14s)]
*  And also look for whether bunker busters will be used. Israel has them but they don't go as deep as the American ones. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUINVeAMB3o&t=541.14s)]
*  And if the U.S. delivers them to Israel or uses them ourselves, that'll cripple the only card Iranians have left [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUINVeAMB3o&t=548.14s)]
*  and could lead to the Iranians lashing out wildly in a last-ditch effort to preserve their power. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUINVeAMB3o&t=555.14s)]
*  Or it could force them to sign a settlement where they swear off enrichment. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUINVeAMB3o&t=561.14s)]
*  Or the settlement opens up their country for inspections so invasive that it makes it almost impossible for the regime [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUINVeAMB3o&t=566.14s)]
*  to retain legitimacy and hurts their ability to control their own population, which is their main goal. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUINVeAMB3o&t=574.14s)]
*  At that point, you could have a revolution or anything could happen. This is a fast-moving story. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUINVeAMB3o&t=580.14s)]
*  Trump just posted on Truth Social, everyone should immediately evacuate Tehran. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUINVeAMB3o&t=587.14s)]
*  This country elected President Trump because they trust him as commander-in-chief, more than they trusted Joe Biden, [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUINVeAMB3o&t=594.14s)]
*  and much more than they would have trusted Kamala Harris. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUINVeAMB3o&t=601.14s)]
*  One of the reasons he won the Republican primary in 16 was because he called the Iraq War dumb. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUINVeAMB3o&t=605.14s)]
*  But Trump has also shown his willingness to take strong and decisive action to eliminate foreign threats. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUINVeAMB3o&t=611.14s)]
*  So far the risks to American soldiers have been minimal, and we hope it stays that way. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUINVeAMB3o&t=618.14s)]
*  Because if we can achieve a peaceful solution to the Iranian issue, the rest of the president's Mideast agenda falls into place. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUINVeAMB3o&t=624.14s)]
*  The Abraham Accords, low energy prices, free shipping lanes, and an AI market that relies on U.S. tech. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUINVeAMB3o&t=631.14s)]
*  We can then finally pivot to Asia and back here to the homeland to confront more immediate challenges. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUINVeAMB3o&t=639.14s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUINVeAMB3o&t=654.14s)]
