# 'COMPLETELY DISGUSTING': Acting ICE director tears into sanctuary city mayor
**Fox News - World News:** [June 06, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv-v-mUPCNg)
*  So, Democrats have a new problem with President Trump's border enforcement. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv-v-mUPCNg&t=0.0s)]
*  ICE agents wear masks. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv-v-mUPCNg&t=5.12s)]
*  And Boston Mayor Michelle Wu is even comparing them to a neo-Nazi group. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv-v-mUPCNg&t=7.12s)]
*  Watch. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv-v-mUPCNg&t=11.64s)]
*  I don't know of any police department that routinely wears masks. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv-v-mUPCNg&t=12.64s)]
*  We know that there are other groups that routinely wear masks. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv-v-mUPCNg&t=20.16s)]
*  NSC 131 routinely wears masks. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv-v-mUPCNg&t=22.96s)]
*  What I said is that Boston police and no police department that I know of at the local [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv-v-mUPCNg&t=25.08s)]
*  level routinely wears masks. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv-v-mUPCNg&t=38.76s)]
*  This comes as ICE agents are facing a 413 percent spike in assault. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv-v-mUPCNg&t=41.84s)]
*  Acting Director of ICE Todd Lyons joins us now. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv-v-mUPCNg&t=46.519999999999996s)]
*  Mr. Director, thanks so much for joining the program this morning. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv-v-mUPCNg&t=48.44s)]
*  Thanks a lot. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv-v-mUPCNg&t=51.519999999999996s)]
*  Thanks for having me. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv-v-mUPCNg&t=52.519999999999996s)]
*  We're going to get some of the data that you guys have released. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv-v-mUPCNg&t=53.96s)]
*  We've got to get your reaction to not only the Mayor of Boston, Michelle Wu, but what [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv-v-mUPCNg&t=55.2s)]
*  the minority leader, Hakeem Jeffries, said, which is he's going to identify all of your [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv-v-mUPCNg&t=59.400000000000006s)]
*  agents, whether you guys like it or not. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv-v-mUPCNg&t=65.60000000000001s)]
*  What's your reaction? [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv-v-mUPCNg&t=68.88s)]
*  Well, Lawrence, I used to say that I was pretty disheartened by some of the political rhetoric, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv-v-mUPCNg&t=69.88s)]
*  but I've totally changed to it. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv-v-mUPCNg&t=74.88s)]
*  It's outright disgusting. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv-v-mUPCNg&t=76.44s)]
*  What Mayor Wu said is completely disgusting. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv-v-mUPCNg&t=78.02000000000001s)]
*  She actually compared us to a neo-Nazi group. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv-v-mUPCNg&t=79.92s)]
*  And here I am on January 6, where many of the men of ICE, brave men and women that were [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv-v-mUPCNg&t=83.24s)]
*  veterans on the day, Great Day in Military History, when we defeated the Germans and [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv-v-mUPCNg&t=87.52s)]
*  the Nazi Party, we have elected officials comparing the brave men and women of law enforcement [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv-v-mUPCNg&t=92.11999999999999s)]
*  to Nazis. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv-v-mUPCNg&t=97.36s)]
*  It's completely disgusting. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv-v-mUPCNg&t=98.36s)]
*  And I have said it before, to the mayor and to the congressman, I'm a victim of that doxing. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv-v-mUPCNg&t=100.03999999999999s)]
*  Last administration, I had mass protests that show up at my house at 3 a.m., coming from [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv-v-mUPCNg&t=107.24s)]
*  other states, because my name and address got leaked. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv-v-mUPCNg&t=112.52s)]
*  So I know what the men and women of ICE go through every day. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv-v-mUPCNg&t=114.8s)]
*  So while they may not like it, what the men and women of ICE are doing in Massachusetts [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv-v-mUPCNg&t=118.0s)]
*  and all over this country is making communities safer. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv-v-mUPCNg&t=121.88s)]
*  And under Secretary Noem, she is giving us her vision and her leadership to go out there [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv-v-mUPCNg&t=125.4s)]
*  and make these communities safer. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv-v-mUPCNg&t=129.64000000000001s)]
*  And that's what ICE is doing. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv-v-mUPCNg&t=131.24s)]
*  So to call us Nazis, to compare us to one of the worst groups in history is disgusting [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv-v-mUPCNg&t=132.8s)]
*  and just outright wrong. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv-v-mUPCNg&t=138.18s)]
*  Mr. Director, just, and I know you, I know the men and women of ICE, the men, all the [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv-v-mUPCNg&t=140.0s)]
*  men and women of law enforcement, they don't want to beat the story here. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv-v-mUPCNg&t=143.48s)]
*  But to paint a picture for our audience, how many, just an estimate of your agents have [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv-v-mUPCNg&t=147.48s)]
*  been doxed so far? [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv-v-mUPCNg&t=153.92s)]
*  You know, Lawrence, there's so many ongoing investigations going on right now across this [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv-v-mUPCNg&t=155.24s)]
*  whole nation. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv-v-mUPCNg&t=161.48s)]
*  Our partners at the Department of Justice have been great. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv-v-mUPCNg&t=162.79999999999998s)]
*  We're bringing cases against these individuals that doxed. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv-v-mUPCNg&t=165.2s)]
*  But we have, I would say, if not hundreds, thousands. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv-v-mUPCNg&t=167.6s)]
*  Look in Massachusetts alone, we had an officer, his photo went viral everywhere. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv-v-mUPCNg&t=171.0s)]
*  One of the best officers, most mild-mannered, nicest human beings on the planet. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv-v-mUPCNg&t=176.28s)]
*  Yet he was described in the worst way with his photo taped to every street corner, to [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv-v-mUPCNg&t=180.44s)]
*  telephone poles, you know, identifying him just for doing his job. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv-v-mUPCNg&t=186.08s)]
*  I want to talk about your operation. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv-v-mUPCNg&t=192.08s)]
*  It's supposed to be the best nationwide arrest record in history. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv-v-mUPCNg&t=194.76s)]
*  Over 2,300 of those folks were arrested in one day. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv-v-mUPCNg&t=199.95999999999998s)]
*  How were you able to do that? [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv-v-mUPCNg&t=205.16s)]
*  Well, Lawrence, I think the best thing we have right now is a whole-of-government approach. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv-v-mUPCNg&t=206.44s)]
*  The whole entire federal law enforcement system understands that President Trump and his administration [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv-v-mUPCNg&t=210.79999999999998s)]
*  sees this as a national security crisis. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv-v-mUPCNg&t=215.76s)]
*  We have had so many unknown individuals that have been released into this country over [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv-v-mUPCNg&t=217.72s)]
*  the past four years, that it's situations like just happened in Boulder and it's situations [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv-v-mUPCNg&t=222.4s)]
*  like the heinous crimes that you've seen us take care of in Massachusetts that are happening [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv-v-mUPCNg&t=227.64000000000001s)]
*  daily, that we need to go out there with a whole-of-government approach between us, the [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv-v-mUPCNg&t=232.12s)]
*  ATF, the U.S. Marshals, DEA, Coast Guard, and make sure we're taking these public safety [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv-v-mUPCNg&t=236.24s)]
*  threats out of the street. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv-v-mUPCNg&t=240.48000000000002s)]
*  And that's what we're doing. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv-v-mUPCNg&t=241.8s)]
*  We're being given all the tools to actually do our law enforcement mission. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv-v-mUPCNg&t=242.8s)]
*  You know, Mr. Director, there's been all of this reporting that's been put out there. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv-v-mUPCNg&t=246.48000000000002s)]
*  I know the president, Tom Holman, have said they are targeting the criminals, and worse [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv-v-mUPCNg&t=251.07999999999998s)]
*  of the worse. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv-v-mUPCNg&t=254.84s)]
*  We just had a terrorist, just had an overstayed visa. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv-v-mUPCNg&t=255.84s)]
*  So we realize that there are real national security threats going on in our country. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv-v-mUPCNg&t=258.28s)]
*  Some reporting has suggested that you guys are going to work sites and all of that. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv-v-mUPCNg&t=263.84s)]
*  Can you give us some context of how you decide which place you're going to target, Mr. Director? [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv-v-mUPCNg&t=267.94s)]
*  Well, Lawrence, I think what we do is we look at the, you know, like I said, the whole situation [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv-v-mUPCNg&t=274.24s)]
*  and the whole scope of that case. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv-v-mUPCNg&t=278.32s)]
*  When people say immigration, they always think it's not a crime. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv-v-mUPCNg&t=280.52s)]
*  It is a crime. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv-v-mUPCNg&t=283.44s)]
*  It's federal law that's being broken when someone violates our immigration laws. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv-v-mUPCNg&t=284.44s)]
*  So while we are focusing on the worst of the worst, and a majority of our resources are [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv-v-mUPCNg&t=289.08s)]
*  prioritized on those public safety threats, ICE isn't going to walk away from anyone that's [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv-v-mUPCNg&t=293.15999999999997s)]
*  here in the country illegally. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv-v-mUPCNg&t=297.64s)]
*  If you enter the country illegally, if you're a U.S. business and you're hiring or exploiting [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv-v-mUPCNg&t=298.64s)]
*  illegal aliens that are working, that's a crime. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv-v-mUPCNg&t=304.65999999999997s)]
*  We are going to take that in. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv-v-mUPCNg&t=307.06s)]
*  And of course, Mr. Director, that means these folks have final deportation orders. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv-v-mUPCNg&t=309.20000000000005s)]
*  I got about 15 seconds, right? [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv-v-mUPCNg&t=313.92s)]
*  Yes, sir. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv-v-mUPCNg&t=315.92s)]
*  Yeah, and what, you know, Lawrence, what we're doing is we're focusing on those ones that [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv-v-mUPCNg&t=316.92s)]
*  have final orders and that have stayed for so long and that we need to get out of the country. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv-v-mUPCNg&t=319.72s)]
*  Thank you, sir. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv-v-mUPCNg&t=323.16s)]
*  Be safe out there. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv-v-mUPCNg&t=324.16s)]
