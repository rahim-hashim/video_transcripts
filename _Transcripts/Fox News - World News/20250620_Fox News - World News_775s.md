# JUST NOW: Trump shares latest on potential Iran strike
**Fox News - World News:** [June 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx46TuPYQwo)
*  All about Rwanda and the Congo will be doing a beach settlement probably coming in [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx46TuPYQwo&t=0.0s)]
*  On Monday or Tuesday, we're going to be signing it up and we've stopped the very vicious war [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx46TuPYQwo&t=6.16s)]
*  So that was an honor for me to be involved. I want to thank [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx46TuPYQwo&t=11.78s)]
*  JD Vinson for [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx46TuPYQwo&t=15.66s)]
*  great job and also [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx46TuPYQwo&t=18.080000000000002s)]
*  Our Secretary of State Marco Rubio has done a fantastic job [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx46TuPYQwo&t=20.32s)]
*  So Rwanda long-term war with the Congo a very bloody war they're all bloody but this was a really bloody one [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx46TuPYQwo&t=24.8s)]
*  is going to be making peace with Congo and [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx46TuPYQwo&t=31.560000000000002s)]
*  they could get on to making trade deals with the United States and other places and [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx46TuPYQwo&t=35.0s)]
*  Have a much more normal form of life. We're very honored by that [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx46TuPYQwo&t=40.1s)]
*  As you know, we did a very great job with India and Pakistan [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx46TuPYQwo&t=44.84s)]
*  And we had India in it looks like we're going to be making the trade deal with India [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx46TuPYQwo&t=49.32s)]
*  We had Pakistan in it looks like we're going to be making a trade deal with Pakistan [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx46TuPYQwo&t=54.12s)]
*  And it's a beautiful thing to watch the Serbia Kosovo likewise [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx46TuPYQwo&t=58.72s)]
*  They've been fighting for years and as you know, we brought that one to a conclusion and now we have a [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx46TuPYQwo&t=62.980000000000004s)]
*  Couple of big ones. We have Russia Ukraine, which is making a little bit of progress and [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx46TuPYQwo&t=69.88s)]
*  We have Israel and nobody really knows what that one is all about. We're gonna find out pretty soon [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx46TuPYQwo&t=75.16s)]
*  The Iranian foreign mr. President the Iranian foreign minister this afternoon said if the US is serious about negotiations [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx46TuPYQwo&t=81.88000000000001s)]
*  That you would call up Israel and request that they stop their airstrikes. Will you make that request? [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx46TuPYQwo&t=88.84s)]
*  Well, I think it's very hard to make that request right now if somebody's winning [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx46TuPYQwo&t=94.28s)]
*  It's a little bit harder to do than if somebody's losing [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx46TuPYQwo&t=98.52000000000001s)]
*  But we're ready willing and able and we've been speaking to Iran and we'll see what happens [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx46TuPYQwo&t=102.12s)]
*  Just a time to see whether or not people come to their senses [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx46TuPYQwo&t=111.52000000000001s)]
*  They didn't help no 20 grand doesn't want to speak to Europe they want they want to speak to us [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx46TuPYQwo&t=120.76s)]
*  Europe is not going to be able to help in this 20 years ago [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx46TuPYQwo&t=126.76s)]
*  You were skeptical of a Republican administration that attacked the Middle East country on the idea of questionable intelligence of weapons of mass destruction [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx46TuPYQwo&t=130.08s)]
*  How is this moment different with Iran? [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx46TuPYQwo&t=138.08s)]
*  Well, there were no weapons of mass destruction [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx46TuPYQwo&t=140.08s)]
*  I never thought there were and that was somewhat pre-nuclear, you know was there was a nuclear age [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx46TuPYQwo&t=142.2s)]
*  But nothing like it is today and it looked like I'm right about [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx46TuPYQwo&t=148.6s)]
*  The material that they've gathered already [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx46TuPYQwo&t=153.56s)]
*  It's a tremendous amount of material and I think within a matter of weeks or certainly within a matter of months [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx46TuPYQwo&t=155.72s)]
*  They're gonna be able to have a nuclear weapon. We can't let that happen [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx46TuPYQwo&t=161.92000000000002s)]
*  I was very much opposed to Iraq. I was I said it loud and clear, but I was a civilian [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx46TuPYQwo&t=165.24s)]
*  But I guess I got a lot of publicity [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx46TuPYQwo&t=170.88s)]
*  But I was very much opposed to the Iraq war and I actually did say don't go in don't go in don't go in [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx46TuPYQwo&t=173.12s)]
*  But I said if you're going to go in keep the oil, but they didn't do that [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx46TuPYQwo&t=180.12s)]
*  What intelligence you have that Iran is building a nuclear weapon your intelligence community [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx46TuPYQwo&t=184.12s)]
*  It said they have no evidence that they are at this point [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx46TuPYQwo&t=188.0s)]
*  Well, then my intelligence community is wrong who in the intelligence community said that your director of national intelligence Tulsi Gabbard she's wrong [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx46TuPYQwo&t=190.4s)]
*  They say that they're there to take people out [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx46TuPYQwo&t=207.8s)]
*  But I can't tell you about that. I get along very well with China get along very well with President Xi [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx46TuPYQwo&t=211.04000000000002s)]
*  I like him. He likes me. We have a very good relationship. We'll see what happens [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx46TuPYQwo&t=217.72s)]
*  I can't imagine them getting involved that you need to make on Iran whether to strike militarily [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx46TuPYQwo&t=222.44s)]
*  Is this the biggest decision you'll have to make as president? [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx46TuPYQwo&t=227.92000000000002s)]
*  Well, I can't tell you that I have to see what happens I can't you know really say that [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx46TuPYQwo&t=232.28s)]
*  It depends what the decision is, but I wouldn't really be able to tell you that now [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx46TuPYQwo&t=237.04000000000002s)]
*  I'll tell you in about a year from now [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx46TuPYQwo&t=241.8s)]
*  Maybe five years or ten years from now never know about decisions you never really know [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx46TuPYQwo&t=243.64s)]
*  I might depending on the circumstance would you? [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx46TuPYQwo&t=252.2s)]
*  Very hard to stop. I will say this it's very hard to stop when you look at it [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx46TuPYQwo&t=256.28s)]
*  Israel's doing well in terms of war and I think you would say that Iran is doing less. Well [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx46TuPYQwo&t=262.47999999999996s)]
*  It's a little bit hard to get somebody to stop [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx46TuPYQwo&t=269.0s)]
*  Former congressman Matt Gaetz throughout an interesting idea [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx46TuPYQwo&t=273.8s)]
*  Suggesting that if if you were to broker a deal where nuclear inspectors go into both Israel and Iran [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx46TuPYQwo&t=276.96s)]
*  That you can win a Nobel Peace Prize and they might even rename it the Trump Peace Prize. Did you hear those? [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx46TuPYQwo&t=283.56s)]
*  What do you think of that? Well, they should give me the Nobel Prize for Rwanda and [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx46TuPYQwo&t=287.91999999999996s)]
*  If you look the Congo or you could say Serbia Kosovo, you could say a lot of them you could say [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx46TuPYQwo&t=292.4s)]
*  I mean the big one is India and [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx46TuPYQwo&t=298.47999999999996s)]
*  Pakistan you could I should have gotten it four or five times. They should get it for the [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx46TuPYQwo&t=302.44s)]
*  I would think the Abraham Accords would be a good one, too [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx46TuPYQwo&t=307.64s)]
*  They won't give me a Nobel Peace Prize because they only give it to liberals [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx46TuPYQwo&t=311.12s)]
*  Would you support Iran being able to have nuclear would you support Iran being able to have civilian nuclear energy? [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx46TuPYQwo&t=314.47999999999996s)]
*  Capabilities up to three point seven six percent [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx46TuPYQwo&t=321.79999999999995s)]
*  You know, they're sitting on the top of one of the largest piles of oil in the world [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx46TuPYQwo&t=323.68s)]
*  I just don't know why they need that for civilian work, you know [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx46TuPYQwo&t=328.08000000000004s)]
*  It's one thing for certain countries to say hey [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx46TuPYQwo&t=331.72s)]
*  I want to have a certain amount where I could go nuclear a little bit because we need it for electricity [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx46TuPYQwo&t=334.22s)]
*  We need it for air conditioners, etc [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx46TuPYQwo&t=339.96000000000004s)]
*  But when you're sitting on one of the largest oil piles anywhere in the world [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx46TuPYQwo&t=343.0s)]
*  It's a little bit hard to see why you did that. Yeah [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx46TuPYQwo&t=347.96000000000004s)]
*  You [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx46TuPYQwo&t=350.2s)]
*  Would wage terror attacks against American targets abroad if you order military action [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx46TuPYQwo&t=353.8s)]
*  We're always concerned about that and we have to take them out and be very strong [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx46TuPYQwo&t=359.24s)]
*  You're even in danger talking to me right now. Do you know that you are in danger talking to me right now? [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx46TuPYQwo&t=363.48s)]
*  So I should probably get out of here, but you guys are actually in danger. Can you believe it? [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx46TuPYQwo&t=369.91999999999996s)]
*  One more [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx46TuPYQwo&t=375.44s)]
*  Still your expectation that NATO countries spent five percent of their GDP on defense spending. I think they should do that [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx46TuPYQwo&t=377.12s)]
*  I don't think we should but I think they should we've been spending we've been supporting NATO so long [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx46TuPYQwo&t=383.36s)]
*  In many cases, I believe paying almost a hundred percent the cost so I don't think we should but I think that the NATO country should [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx46TuPYQwo&t=389.64s)]
*  Absolutely what? [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx46TuPYQwo&t=397.08s)]
*  Oh [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx46TuPYQwo&t=399.32s)]
*  NATO is gonna have to deal with Spain Spain's been a very low payer. They were always a very low payer [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx46TuPYQwo&t=401.0s)]
*  They were either good negotiators or they weren't doing the right thing [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx46TuPYQwo&t=407.15999999999997s)]
*  I mean, I think Spain has to pay what everybody else has to pay Spain has been notorious for low pay [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx46TuPYQwo&t=411.62s)]
*  You know who else was a low payer that just about the lowest a place called Canada [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx46TuPYQwo&t=417.26s)]
*  Because Canada said why should we pay when the United States will protect us free? [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx46TuPYQwo&t=422.47999999999996s)]
*  Ice [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx46TuPYQwo&t=429.4s)]
*  Mike Pompeo where they're on the ground in Ukraine seemingly doing the opposite try to provoke the Ukrainians to keep fighting [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx46TuPYQwo&t=435.4s)]
*  What do you think of that? Well, we're gonna see and people have to be very careful with what they say [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx46TuPYQwo&t=441.56s)]
*  They're gonna be very careful with their mouth because their mouth can get them into a lot of trouble one more ice [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx46TuPYQwo&t=446.24s)]
*  Ice has said that they're trying to arrest up to 3,000 individuals a day [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx46TuPYQwo&t=453.4s)]
*  There are some communities that are saying they are fearful of being wrongfully detained or separating some families [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx46TuPYQwo&t=457.76s)]
*  Even if they're undocumented is the fear in some of these communities worth? [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx46TuPYQwo&t=463.24s)]
*  The deportations of these undocumented individuals a mass deportation program is a tough subject because look we have farmers [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx46TuPYQwo&t=468.0s)]
*  I love farmers [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx46TuPYQwo&t=474.8s)]
*  I won 80% 85% of the farmers and I love them and I'm never gonna do anything to hurt our farmers [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx46TuPYQwo&t=475.68s)]
*  And you can also say the leisure business etc. There are some businesses where [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx46TuPYQwo&t=481.86s)]
*  You have a disproportionate amount of people that are the people that you're talking about [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx46TuPYQwo&t=487.12s)]
*  At the same time we have to get the criminals out of our country and we're looking at doing something where [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx46TuPYQwo&t=491.88s)]
*  in the case of good reputable farmers, they can take [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx46TuPYQwo&t=497.72s)]
*  Responsibility for the people that they hire and let them have responsibility because we can't put the farms out of business [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx46TuPYQwo&t=501.6s)]
*  and at the same time we don't want to [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx46TuPYQwo&t=507.56s)]
*  Hurt people that aren't criminals most of the people that came in over the last three years under Biden [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx46TuPYQwo&t=510.32000000000005s)]
*  I would say probably three and a half to four years [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx46TuPYQwo&t=516.64s)]
*  Those people you have a lot of criminals. You have a lot of I mean, we're looking at that very closely [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx46TuPYQwo&t=519.6s)]
*  You've had people that have worked on farms for 20 years. It's very hard to go in there and say, you know [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx46TuPYQwo&t=524.48s)]
*  Yeah, you're coming out [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx46TuPYQwo&t=529.9200000000001s)]
*  But we're gonna let the farmers take responsibility. They're great people they'll do it. They know the good and the bad [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx46TuPYQwo&t=531.64s)]
*  So the hard part about this is not like a normal war that where people wear uniforms [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx46TuPYQwo&t=538.0400000000001s)]
*  They don't wear uniforms, but we have murderers that came out of the last four years. We have murderers. We have drug lords [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx46TuPYQwo&t=542.8399999999999s)]
*  We have people that we don't want it. We have prisoners. They emptied out Venezuela in many countries [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx46TuPYQwo&t=549.8399999999999s)]
*  They emptied out their prisons into the United States. We have to get those people out, but we have stone-cold murders [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx46TuPYQwo&t=554.76s)]
*  11,888 murders we've already gotten a lot of them out of here, but we don't want them so we have to be careful [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx46TuPYQwo&t=563.3599999999999s)]
*  But I never want to hurt our farmers our farmers are great people [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx46TuPYQwo&t=569.16s)]
*  They keep us happy and healthy and fat. Are there other cities that you're gonna try to replicate what you've done in Los Angeles [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx46TuPYQwo&t=573.28s)]
*  Well, I mean we had a big victory last night in the court Court of Appeals [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx46TuPYQwo&t=578.76s)]

*  He's just doing a terrible job between his fires [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx46TuPYQwo&t=591.24s)]
*  Between all the houses burning down his forest fires and now Los Angeles if we didn't go to Los Angeles [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx46TuPYQwo&t=595.28s)]
*  And the sheriff admitted it he had no control. He would have lost control [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx46TuPYQwo&t=601.6s)]
*  we saved Los Angeles by having the military go in and [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx46TuPYQwo&t=606.08s)]
*  The second night was much better. The third night was nothing much and the fourth night nobody bothered even coming [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx46TuPYQwo&t=610.72s)]
*  We put out that fire. We did a great job of it. He sued us for going in and for helping him [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx46TuPYQwo&t=618.32s)]
*  We went and helped him right now. You'd have Los Angeles burning to the ground largely. It would have already been destroyed [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx46TuPYQwo&t=624.36s)]

*  I'm giving them a period of time [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx46TuPYQwo&t=660.6800000000001s)]
*  we're gonna see what that period of time is but I'm giving them a period of time and [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx46TuPYQwo&t=662.12s)]
*  I would say two weeks would be the maximum [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx46TuPYQwo&t=666.04s)]
*  Should start focusing on criminals and that's what we've been focused on very bad criminals dangerous [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx46TuPYQwo&t=675.08s)]

*  Unhappy Prime Minister [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx46TuPYQwo&t=712.08s)]
*  One more Prime Minister Netanyahu said that they had the capacity to take out all of Iran's nuclear facilities [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx46TuPYQwo&t=717.68s)]
*  So what role would the US be able to play and why would they if Israel says that they have all of the abilities their [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx46TuPYQwo&t=723.52s)]
*  own military said that but [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx46TuPYQwo&t=729.92s)]

*  They could break through a little section, but they can't go down very deep [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx46TuPYQwo&t=734.84s)]
*  They don't have that capacity and we'll have to see what happens maybe it won't be necessary maybe it won't be this [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx46TuPYQwo&t=738.48s)]
