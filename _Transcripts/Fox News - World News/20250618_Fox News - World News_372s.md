# Iran warned to return to negotiating table 'if they're smart'
**Fox News - World News:** [June 18, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Buf-9-sBtfY)
*  Anyway, joining us now with reaction, we have the Senate Majority Leader John Thune is with [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Buf-9-sBtfY&t=0.0s)]
*  us. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Buf-9-sBtfY&t=4.5200000000000005s)]
*  Majority Leader Thune, welcome back. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Buf-9-sBtfY&t=6.140000000000001s)]
*  Appreciate it. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Buf-9-sBtfY&t=7.96s)]
*  Number one state sponsor of terror, tens, if not hundreds of thousands through their [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Buf-9-sBtfY&t=8.96s)]
*  proxies and themselves, missiles fired into Israel. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Buf-9-sBtfY&t=14.4s)]
*  How many missiles would it take for Americans to get up in arms if they were fired into [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Buf-9-sBtfY&t=17.72s)]
*  American towns and cities? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Buf-9-sBtfY&t=24.32s)]
*  I don't think the number would be high. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Buf-9-sBtfY&t=25.92s)]
*  Only one would do it. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Buf-9-sBtfY&t=28.08s)]
*  No, it wouldn't take many, Sean. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Buf-9-sBtfY&t=29.4s)]
*  That's what Israel is facing on a daily basis. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Buf-9-sBtfY&t=32.8s)]
*  That's what the rest of the world will be facing if Iran continues its reign of terror. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Buf-9-sBtfY&t=34.96s)]
*  They have menaced that region and the world now for 50 years. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Buf-9-sBtfY&t=39.92s)]
*  It's high time that that stopped. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Buf-9-sBtfY&t=44.519999999999996s)]
*  I think President Trump is in a position, whether by diplomacy or supporting Israel [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Buf-9-sBtfY&t=45.92s)]
*  and what they're doing, whether it comes forcefully or voluntarily, Iran needs to end its nuclear [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Buf-9-sBtfY&t=52.04s)]
*  program. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Buf-9-sBtfY&t=57.6s)]
*  It's as simple as that. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Buf-9-sBtfY&t=58.6s)]
*  That's got to be the end state. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Buf-9-sBtfY&t=59.6s)]
*  Let me go to this one big beautiful bill. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Buf-9-sBtfY&t=62.2s)]
*  There are differences in the House and Senate version. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Buf-9-sBtfY&t=64.2s)]
*  For example, President Trump said no tax on tips, no tax on overtime. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Buf-9-sBtfY&t=67.28s)]
*  The Senate version creates new deductions for taxes on tips and overtime pay and car [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Buf-9-sBtfY&t=72.08s)]
*  loan interest, but does not make them fully deductible. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Buf-9-sBtfY&t=78.44s)]
*  Tips are up to 25,000 through 2028. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Buf-9-sBtfY&t=82.04s)]
*  I would imagine there's going to be in conference some tension over that. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Buf-9-sBtfY&t=85.88s)]
*  Your thoughts? [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Buf-9-sBtfY&t=88.88s)]
*  Well, look, I think, Sean, on all those, those are the president's priorities. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Buf-9-sBtfY&t=89.88s)]
*  They were incorporated in the House bill. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Buf-9-sBtfY&t=93.88s)]
*  We incorporated them in the Senate bill. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Buf-9-sBtfY&t=94.88s)]
*  We've got draft text out there. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Buf-9-sBtfY&t=96.88s)]
*  Obviously, we think that there's some income, putting some income limitations on those things [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Buf-9-sBtfY&t=99.88s)]
*  doesn't help. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Buf-9-sBtfY&t=105.6s)]
*  We've got a lot of money that's going to be spent on that. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Buf-9-sBtfY&t=106.6s)]
*  I think for the most part, this is designed to help working Americans, people who are [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Buf-9-sBtfY&t=109.96s)]
*  getting up every day, going to work, and this gives them some relief. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Buf-9-sBtfY&t=114.96s)]
*  I think that's what the president was focused on, is delivering relief for working class [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Buf-9-sBtfY&t=118.96s)]
*  families. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Buf-9-sBtfY&t=122.96s)]
*  That's why we lock in the rates, the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act rates. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Buf-9-sBtfY&t=123.96s)]
*  We have a lot of money that's going to be spent on that. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Buf-9-sBtfY&t=127.96s)]
*  We have a lot of money that's going to be spent on that. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Buf-9-sBtfY&t=130.95999999999998s)]
*  We have a lot of money that's going to be spent on that. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Buf-9-sBtfY&t=133.95999999999998s)]
*  We've got 17 tax cuts and jobs act rates. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Buf-9-sBtfY&t=137.32000000000002s)]
*  We make permanent the expanded child tax credit and the increased standard deduction, and [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Buf-9-sBtfY&t=140.32000000000002s)]
*  then you add those four things that the president campaigned on. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Buf-9-sBtfY&t=146.32s)]
*  This will be a good, strong bill for middle income Americans when it comes to tax relief. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Buf-9-sBtfY&t=149.32s)]
*  Then, of course, there are all kinds of other things, as you know, in it that we think it [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Buf-9-sBtfY&t=154.32s)]
*  needs to be passed. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Buf-9-sBtfY&t=158.32s)]
*  We believe that the president and the House and the Senate are all going to be on the [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Buf-9-sBtfY&t=159.32s)]
*  side of the bill that he believes it needs to be passed. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Buf-9-sBtfY&t=164.68s)]
*  He will be happy with it, and the American people will benefit from it. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Buf-9-sBtfY&t=166.68s)]
*  It will make us both stronger and more prosperous. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Buf-9-sBtfY&t=169.68s)]
*  Let's talk about Medicaid, and the Democrats are trying to demagoguage it. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Buf-9-sBtfY&t=174.68s)]
*  You'd cap provider taxes at 3.5 percent by 2031, down from the current 6 percent. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Buf-9-sBtfY&t=178.68s)]
*  There's an increase in spending, but you are removing fraud as part of the process. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Buf-9-sBtfY&t=183.68s)]
*  there are restrictions if you're able-bodied, et cetera. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Buf-9-sBtfY&t=191.68s)]
*  Little variation from the House version. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Buf-9-sBtfY&t=195.96s)]
*  Where do you see that ultimately landing in conference there? [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Buf-9-sBtfY&t=198.12s)]
*  We want to make sure that we are rooting out [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Buf-9-sBtfY&t=201.76000000000002s)]
*  the Biden-era waste, fraud, and abuse in the Medicaid program [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Buf-9-sBtfY&t=204.4s)]
*  and making sure that it's targeted and directed, Sean, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Buf-9-sBtfY&t=208.92000000000002s)]
*  at the people for whom it was intended. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Buf-9-sBtfY&t=212.04000000000002s)]
*  And if you're an illegal immigrant [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Buf-9-sBtfY&t=214.48000000000002s)]
*  or you're somebody who's ineligible for the program [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Buf-9-sBtfY&t=216.32s)]
*  or you're an able-bodied adult who should be working [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Buf-9-sBtfY&t=218.72s)]
*  to benefit from it, those are reforms [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Buf-9-sBtfY&t=221.12s)]
*  that root out waste, fraud, and abuse. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Buf-9-sBtfY&t=223.44s)]
*  And the provider tax is something that's been gamed [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Buf-9-sBtfY&t=225.44s)]
*  by a lot of states through the years. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Buf-9-sBtfY&t=227.72s)]
*  And so, yeah, we tighten some things up. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Buf-9-sBtfY&t=230.12s)]
*  We make the program more workable, strengthened, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Buf-9-sBtfY&t=232.28s)]
*  and improved, and targeted the people who really need it. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Buf-9-sBtfY&t=234.88s)]
*  And it was designed to help out pregnant moms [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Buf-9-sBtfY&t=238.04000000000002s)]
*  and disabled and elderly Americans. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Buf-9-sBtfY&t=240.76s)]
*  That's what Medicaid is there for. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Buf-9-sBtfY&t=243.20000000000002s)]
*  It's gotten way out of context. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Buf-9-sBtfY&t=244.8s)]
*  And by the way, it does increase at a slower rate. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Buf-9-sBtfY&t=246.64000000000001s)]
*  And everybody's talking, the Democrats are out there [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Buf-9-sBtfY&t=250.16s)]
*  clamoring, screaming about cutting Medicaid. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Buf-9-sBtfY&t=251.68s)]
*  It doesn't cut Medicaid. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Buf-9-sBtfY&t=254.0s)]
*  It slows the rate of growth. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Buf-9-sBtfY&t=255.20000000000002s)]
*  And we've got to slow the rate of growth, [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Buf-9-sBtfY&t=257.04s)]
*  but that program's gonna be unsustainable, [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Buf-9-sBtfY&t=258.76s)]
*  just like a lot of other federal programs [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Buf-9-sBtfY&t=260.48s)]
*  that have been growing out of control. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Buf-9-sBtfY&t=262.64s)]
*  This is the most important. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Buf-9-sBtfY&t=263.48s)]
*  Slow the rate of growth means that's important [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Buf-9-sBtfY&t=264.52s)]
*  because you're growing the programs. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Buf-9-sBtfY&t=266.68s)]
*  You're not cutting anything. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Buf-9-sBtfY&t=268.48s)]
*  And you are putting in work requirements [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Buf-9-sBtfY&t=269.92s)]
*  for able-bodied people. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Buf-9-sBtfY&t=272.0s)]
*  But you're still increasing spending, [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Buf-9-sBtfY&t=273.4s)]
*  but you're making it more manageable [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Buf-9-sBtfY&t=275.24s)]
*  so it doesn't head towards insolvency. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Buf-9-sBtfY&t=277.12s)]
*  I think that's an important distinction. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Buf-9-sBtfY&t=278.96000000000004s)]
*  Let me ask you about two last things. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Buf-9-sBtfY&t=281.2s)]
*  The SALT deduction, state and local tax deductions. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Buf-9-sBtfY&t=283.92s)]
*  It was a big deal for blue state Republicans [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Buf-9-sBtfY&t=286.52000000000004s)]
*  up for reelection, obviously, in 26. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Buf-9-sBtfY&t=289.68s)]
*  The House version goes to 40,000. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Buf-9-sBtfY&t=292.52000000000004s)]
*  The Senate version goes to 10,000. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Buf-9-sBtfY&t=294.40000000000003s)]
*  I imagine there'll be some negotiation there. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Buf-9-sBtfY&t=296.52000000000004s)]
*  And you were very clear this week [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Buf-9-sBtfY&t=299.6s)]
*  that you plan to keep the Senate open [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Buf-9-sBtfY&t=301.48s)]
*  through the 4th of July recess, [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Buf-9-sBtfY&t=303.16s)]
*  I assume the 4th of July also, if necessary, [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Buf-9-sBtfY&t=304.96000000000004s)]
*  to get this thing across the finish line. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Buf-9-sBtfY&t=308.08000000000004s)]
*  Is that still the plan? [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Buf-9-sBtfY&t=310.28000000000003s)]
*  It is. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Buf-9-sBtfY&t=311.92s)]
*  And the SALT is something that we will negotiate. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Buf-9-sBtfY&t=312.76000000000005s)]
*  We realize we gotta pass a bill through the House. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Buf-9-sBtfY&t=315.52000000000004s)]
*  You now live in a low-tax state, Sean, [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Buf-9-sBtfY&t=320.04s)]
*  so you might probably share the view that I do [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Buf-9-sBtfY&t=321.88s)]
*  that we shouldn't have low-tax states subsidizing [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Buf-9-sBtfY&t=323.88s)]
*  high-tax states on the East and West Coast. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Buf-9-sBtfY&t=326.6s)]
*  So that's kinda where the Senate is, [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Buf-9-sBtfY&t=328.84000000000003s)]
*  but we know we gotta get 218 in the House. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Buf-9-sBtfY&t=330.48s)]
*  So we're gonna be negotiating this [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Buf-9-sBtfY&t=332.24s)]
*  with our House colleagues. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Buf-9-sBtfY&t=334.56s)]
*  And obviously the White House, the President, [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Buf-9-sBtfY&t=336.04s)]
*  and his team will be involved with that. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Buf-9-sBtfY&t=338.32s)]
*  And we'll get there. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Buf-9-sBtfY&t=339.24s)]
*  But these are all, it's a work in progress, [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Buf-9-sBtfY&t=340.32s)]
