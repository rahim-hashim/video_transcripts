# Trump thanks Tehran for 'early warning' before launching 'weak' attack on US airbase
**Fox News - World News:** [June 23, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R10JMExIf5Q)
*  President Trump reacting for the first time after Iran launched a barrage of retaliatory [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R10JMExIf5Q&t=0.0s)]
*  missiles at a U.S. base in Qatar. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R10JMExIf5Q&t=5.66s)]
*  Trump called it a quote, very weak response, which we expected and have very effectively [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R10JMExIf5Q&t=7.92s)]
*  countered. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R10JMExIf5Q&t=13.0s)]
*  And he goes on to say this, I am pleased to report that no Americans were harmed and hardly [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R10JMExIf5Q&t=14.32s)]
*  any damage was done. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R10JMExIf5Q&t=18.48s)]
*  Most importantly, they've gotten it all out of their system and there will hopefully be [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R10JMExIf5Q&t=19.64s)]
*  no further hate. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R10JMExIf5Q&t=23.84s)]
*  I want to thank Iran for giving us early notice, which made it possible for no lives to be [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R10JMExIf5Q&t=25.080000000000002s)]
*  lost and nobody to be injured. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R10JMExIf5Q&t=29.68s)]
*  I want to go to Jennifer Griffin. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R10JMExIf5Q&t=32.28s)]
*  She is at the Pentagon. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R10JMExIf5Q&t=34.28s)]
*  Will give us an update before we kick off the five. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R10JMExIf5Q&t=35.28s)]
*  Hi Jennifer. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R10JMExIf5Q&t=37.28s)]
*  Hi Dana. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R10JMExIf5Q&t=38.28s)]
*  Well, it was extremely tense at U.S. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R10JMExIf5Q&t=39.28s)]
*  air bases across the Middle East about four hours ago. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R10JMExIf5Q&t=41.480000000000004s)]
*  Fortunately now things are a lot calmer. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R10JMExIf5Q&t=45.28s)]
*  But earlier today the Iranians fired at least 14 missiles, some of them ballistic, at the [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R10JMExIf5Q&t=48.28s)]
*  U.S. air base at Al Udeid. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R10JMExIf5Q&t=56.04s)]
*  It's the largest military base in the Middle East. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R10JMExIf5Q&t=58.08s)]
*  Normally there are five to 10,000 U.S. troops at that base. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R10JMExIf5Q&t=60.6s)]
*  Nobody was injured. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R10JMExIf5Q&t=65.03999999999999s)]
*  All but one of the missiles were intercepted by air defenses inside Qatar. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R10JMExIf5Q&t=66.64s)]
*  The president, as you mentioned, thanked Iran for giving the U.S. a heads up. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R10JMExIf5Q&t=72.32s)]
*  That may come as a surprise to the Iranians, but it does appear that the U.S. had advanced [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R10JMExIf5Q&t=78.4s)]
*  warning. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R10JMExIf5Q&t=83.64s)]
*  aircraft and individuals and people out of that air base. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R10JMExIf5Q&t=85.64s)]
*  And many at the U.S. embassy were told to shelter in place. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R10JMExIf5Q&t=89.8s)]
*  No American injuries, no American deaths. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R10JMExIf5Q&t=92.96000000000001s)]
*  And so now the president is calling for Iran, Israel and others to come back to the negotiating [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R10JMExIf5Q&t=95.76s)]
*  table. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R10JMExIf5Q&t=101.03999999999999s)]
*  But it's not clear whether Iran will take that offer. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R10JMExIf5Q&t=102.2s)]
*  The response by Iran was in effect because of that U.S. that very, very stealthy and [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R10JMExIf5Q&t=105.52s)]
*  successful B-2 bombing raid on three Iranian nuclear sites this weekend. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R10JMExIf5Q&t=112.16s)]
*  There were 14 massive ordnance penetrators. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R10JMExIf5Q&t=119.48s)]
*  Those are 30,000-pound bombs dropped on two of Iran's nuclear sites. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R10JMExIf5Q&t=122.28s)]
*  And then 30 Tomahawk missiles fired from a submarine at a third site in Isfahan. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R10JMExIf5Q&t=128.64s)]
*  So right now we wait and see what happens next. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R10JMExIf5Q&t=134.8s)]
*  There are indications that Israel also might be looking to wind up their operations in [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R10JMExIf5Q&t=137.44s)]
*  Iran in the coming days. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R10JMExIf5Q&t=142.4s)]
*  And now we wait and see what Iran does next. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R10JMExIf5Q&t=145.23999999999998s)]
*  All right, Jennifer, thank you for being here throughout all of this. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R10JMExIf5Q&t=147.64s)]
