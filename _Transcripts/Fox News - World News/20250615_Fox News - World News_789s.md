# Israeli man reveals how he takes cover in a Tel Aviv bomb shelter
**Fox News - World News:** [June 15, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rE6WhgFoH38)
*  Joining us now is former Israeli government spokesman [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rE6WhgFoH38&t=0.0s)]
*  Elon levy who is currently taking over in a bomb. He's taking cover by the way in a bomb shelter in Tel Aviv as we speak [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rE6WhgFoH38&t=3.24s)]
*  welcome [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rE6WhgFoH38&t=11.72s)]
*  Tell us what you're good morning. Good morning. Tell us what's happening on the ground right now [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rE6WhgFoH38&t=13.200000000000001s)]
*  Well just minutes ago we had a siren in Tel Aviv and everyone had to run into a bomb shelter or find a public shelter [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rE6WhgFoH38&t=19.52s)]
*  I'm here now surrounded by neighbors who came down but also random people from the street who came in [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rE6WhgFoH38&t=25.74s)]
*  Everyone has had to run to seek shelter because these Iranian ballistic missiles are being deliberately targeted at civilian areas [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rE6WhgFoH38&t=34.58s)]
*  Overnight we had a whole buildings flattened and so Israelis know when the siren sounds you cannot take any risks [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rE6WhgFoH38&t=42.099999999999994s)]
*  You can't just wait in the stairwell [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rE6WhgFoH38&t=48.379999999999995s)]
*  You have to go deep into a bomb shelter and wait till you get the all clear to come out [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rE6WhgFoH38&t=50.26s)]
*  Does it tell you anything that these missiles are being launched in broad daylight versus the middle of the night? [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rE6WhgFoH38&t=54.66s)]
*  Yeah, this is the first time that we've had Iranian ballistic missiles being fired in the middle of the day as opposed to the middle [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rE6WhgFoH38&t=61.14s)]
*  Of the night catching everyone off because they thought they would have until the evening [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rE6WhgFoH38&t=67.7s)]
*  Israelis are well drilled [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rE6WhgFoH38&t=72.25999999999999s)]
*  Unfortunately, they know what it is like to run into bomb shelters because Israel has been under attack by Iran's proxy armies for so many [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rE6WhgFoH38&t=74.02s)]
*  Years, but this threat is very different [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rE6WhgFoH38&t=81.30000000000001s)]
*  We know the Iranian regime is launching dozens of missiles at the same time to try to overwhelm Israel's missile defenses [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rE6WhgFoH38&t=83.78s)]
*  And then it is deliberately aiming at Israel's civilian area and civilian buildings [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rE6WhgFoH38&t=91.08000000000001s)]
*  And Israel has made some amazing achievements in the last few days. We control the airspace over Tehran and [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rE6WhgFoH38&t=97.10000000000001s)]
*  The leaders of the regime in Iran need to think very carefully before they continue to bombard Israel's population centers. I [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rE6WhgFoH38&t=103.5s)]
*  As a former government official spokesperson [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rE6WhgFoH38&t=110.5s)]
*  I really would love your opinion on this because I think this is the question that really needs to be asked the most and that's [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rE6WhgFoH38&t=113.61999999999999s)]
*  You know, Donald Trump says hey come to the negotiation table [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rE6WhgFoH38&t=119.58s)]
*  Israel has shown they have the resilience to stick to this plan of attack [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rE6WhgFoH38&t=122.82s)]
*  They have now Iran has will say escalated their attacks attacking city centers in the daylight [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rE6WhgFoH38&t=126.5s)]
*  Is there a future at all with this regime in charge of Iran that doesn't include pursuing nuclear weapons? [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rE6WhgFoH38&t=132.88s)]
*  And supplying terrorist organizations that eventually attack Israel in the US [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rE6WhgFoH38&t=139.24s)]
*  You hit the nail on the head that the root cause of the conflict in the Middle East is that Iran is governed by a radical [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rE6WhgFoH38&t=145.4s)]
*  fundamentalist religious regime that is trying to oppress the entire region in pursuit of its vision of [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rE6WhgFoH38&t=152.24s)]
*  destroying Israel and Israel has now launched this operation to eliminate the twin threats of an Iranian nuclear bomb and [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rE6WhgFoH38&t=159.28s)]
*  ballistic missiles [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rE6WhgFoH38&t=166.8s)]
*  Because it understands that the regime is committed to Israel's destruction [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rE6WhgFoH38&t=167.92s)]
*  That's the root of the conflict between us Israel wants to exist and the Iranian regimes doesn't want us to exist [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rE6WhgFoH38&t=172.04s)]
*  So, you know the regime now has two choices and I hope it acts rationally [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rE6WhgFoH38&t=179.01999999999998s)]
*  Either it takes about president Trump's offer to negotiate the peaceful dismantling of its uranium enrichment [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rE6WhgFoH38&t=183.76s)]
*  And the end of its aggression or Israel will dismantle its nuclear facilities from the sky [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rE6WhgFoH38&t=190.6s)]
*  So on you're now facing two two fronts of the war you have you still have the war in in Gaza now [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rE6WhgFoH38&t=196.42000000000002s)]
*  You're at war and in a bunker [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rE6WhgFoH38&t=202.12s)]
*  With Iran, what is the mood of the people in the room with you right now? What is happening? How do they feel about? [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rE6WhgFoH38&t=204.96s)]
*  Being in this position on both sides here [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rE6WhgFoH38&t=213.26000000000002s)]
*  It's more than a two-front war since Hamas invaded with the October 7th massacre [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rE6WhgFoH38&t=218.58s)]
*  Israel has been under attack on eight fronts including attacks on Jews and Israelis around the world [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rE6WhgFoH38&t=223.98s)]
*  Including in the United States yesterday [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rE6WhgFoH38&t=231.18s)]
*  We had combined missile fire from Yemen and Iran at the same time [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rE6WhgFoH38&t=233.46s)]
*  Because Iran has surrounded Israel with proxy armies people here in the room are there's a quiet resilience [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rE6WhgFoH38&t=238.74s)]
*  People are used to this they know how to just try to get on with their day and not get too scared [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rE6WhgFoH38&t=245.46s)]
*  But hey for people with kids elderly people who can't run down the stairs in 90 seconds. It's scary [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rE6WhgFoH38&t=251.34s)]
*  These are the missiles we're used to these are long-range ballistic missiles with half a ton of TNT in them [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rE6WhgFoH38&t=257.18s)]
*  They can destroy entire buildings and people know when they run down into the bomb shelter [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rE6WhgFoH38&t=264.2s)]
*  There's a real chance there isn't going to be a home to go back to when we go back upstairs [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rE6WhgFoH38&t=268.76s)]
*  And that's why Israel has said we have to take out this threat of the Iranian ballistic missiles when they have only [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rE6WhgFoH38&t=272.46s)]
*  2,000 missiles and not wait for them to have 20,000 missiles [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rE6WhgFoH38&t=279.44s)]
*  You know one of the things that you commonly hear is that there are a lot of your neighbors [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rE6WhgFoH38&t=282.56s)]
*  neighboring countries who see Iran as a [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rE6WhgFoH38&t=289.56s)]
*  belligerent [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rE6WhgFoH38&t=294.72s)]
*  problem in the region and that they privately are hoping that [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rE6WhgFoH38&t=295.8s)]
*  You all are successful and that you eliminate the regime that controls [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rE6WhgFoH38&t=300.72s)]
*  Iran and that you prevent them from getting a nuclear bomb [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rE6WhgFoH38&t=305.8s)]
*  Why is it that those kind and some of those countries like Jordan and Saudi Arabia have been helping? [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rE6WhgFoH38&t=309.92s)]
*  Shoot down some of these ballistic missiles that Iran has been firing it at Israel [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rE6WhgFoH38&t=316.04s)]
*  Why but why aren't those countries at a moment like that your neighbors? [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rE6WhgFoH38&t=322.40000000000003s)]
*  stepping up and [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rE6WhgFoH38&t=327.88s)]
*  more vocally and openly [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rE6WhgFoH38&t=329.68s)]
*  Supporting your effort to finally put Iran in its place [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rE6WhgFoH38&t=332.36s)]
*  That's an excellent question and maybe you should ask those Arab countries to explain that hypocrisy because it's clear that in private [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rE6WhgFoH38&t=338.72s)]
*  Everyone is celebrating Israel holding Iran to account for years of regional aggression and the threat of going nuclear [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rE6WhgFoH38&t=345.92s)]
*  No one wants to see Iran getting a nuclear bomb and no one wants to see it continuing to sow [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rE6WhgFoH38&t=353.8s)]
*  Destruction and chaos across the Middle East the key the path to peace runs through [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rE6WhgFoH38&t=360.40000000000003s)]
*  dismantling Iranian aggression and when you three countries like Lebanon and Syria from the yoke of Iranian oppression and other [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rE6WhgFoH38&t=367.0s)]
*  Countries don't have to look over their shoulder [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rE6WhgFoH38&t=374.40000000000003s)]
*  We can expand the Abraham Accords like President Trump's wants to do and have peace in the Middle East [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rE6WhgFoH38&t=376.36s)]
*  But for now, maybe they just don't have the courage to come out and say what everyone knows privately [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rE6WhgFoH38&t=381.88s)]
*  They're gunning for Israel to win this [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rE6WhgFoH38&t=387.48s)]
*  So [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rE6WhgFoH38&t=390.16s)]
*  Israel is very well equipped [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rE6WhgFoH38&t=391.32s)]
*  We've had guests on all morning that said if it stayed a war between Israel and Iran [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rE6WhgFoH38&t=393.32s)]
*  No other countries involved are arming Israel outmatches Iran when it comes to military [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rE6WhgFoH38&t=397.40000000000003s)]
*  But for all intents and purposes Israel is still fighting a war or at least an operation in Gaza [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rE6WhgFoH38&t=401.8s)]
*  And some of the some of the analysis is that if Iran is further debilitated in their conventional military they support [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rE6WhgFoH38&t=406.44s)]
*  What we would call guerrilla warfare or terrorist tactics [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rE6WhgFoH38&t=413.6s)]
*  Is there enough of Hamas left either in Gaza or anywhere in the territory to create a problem while Israel is distracted? [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rE6WhgFoH38&t=416.3s)]
*  Basically looking up at the sky right now [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rE6WhgFoH38&t=422.7s)]
*  Yeah, just take a look at [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rE6WhgFoH38&t=426.34000000000003s)]
*  Ordinary change in the Middle East since the beginning of the October 7th war Iran [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rE6WhgFoH38&t=428.62s)]
*  Surrounded Israel with a ring of fire and wanted to watch it burn [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rE6WhgFoH38&t=434.3s)]
*  It's surrounded Israel with proxy armies that could attack [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rE6WhgFoH38&t=437.90000000000003s)]
*  At the same time and protect Iran's illegal nuclear weapons program now [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rE6WhgFoH38&t=441.82s)]
*  Hamas is still holding 55 hostages 20 of them are still alive and being starved and tortured in dungeons under Gaza [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rE6WhgFoH38&t=447.46s)]
*  But Hamas isn't managing to fire rockets at Israel as Bala is sitting this out [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rE6WhgFoH38&t=455.02s)]
*  The Assad regime is nowhere to be seen and Iran has been left completely [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rE6WhgFoH38&t=459.66s)]
*  Completely alone and the Iranian regime its nuclear project and its ballistic missiles are now completely [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rE6WhgFoH38&t=464.1s)]
*  Exposed to Israeli air power as we hold the Islamic Republic to accounts for its years of regional aggression [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rE6WhgFoH38&t=471.3s)]
*  Is there is there frustration among people where you are right now in that bomb shelter? [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rE6WhgFoH38&t=478.02s)]
*  That maybe Iran has succeeded at overwhelming the Iron Dome [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rE6WhgFoH38&t=483.34000000000003s)]
*  Or is there frustration that the Iron Dome is not working as well as maybe it should [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rE6WhgFoH38&t=487.68s)]
*  Is do you sense any of that from the people you're with? [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rE6WhgFoH38&t=492.62s)]
*  When people are down in the bomb shelter [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rE6WhgFoH38&t=498.06s)]
*  They're anxious because we don't know when the missiles are going to land and you can expect [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rE6WhgFoH38&t=499.82s)]
*  Statistically some of Iran's missiles are going to get through so people are always listening to hear the booms and trying to work out hang [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rE6WhgFoH38&t=504.62s)]
*  On was that an interception was that an impact? How far away was it? [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rE6WhgFoH38&t=510.84s)]
*  of course if you're deep underground where I am two floors underground the [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rE6WhgFoH38&t=514.4s)]
*  The booms are very muffled but for people who are much closer to the interceptions and can make the whole building shake [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rE6WhgFoH38&t=519.3s)]
*  And then you really know whether it was an interception or whether a rocket just landed nearby [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rE6WhgFoH38&t=525.0600000000001s)]
*  So Reuters is reporting that there are in fact explosions going off all around [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rE6WhgFoH38&t=529.78s)]
*  Tel Aviv right now [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rE6WhgFoH38&t=535.58s)]
*  What are you hearing right now as we speak? Do you hear any of those sounds that could be interceptions or could be? [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rE6WhgFoH38&t=537.5s)]
*  Missiles landing [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rE6WhgFoH38&t=546.38s)]
*  Right now I'm not hearing anything because I have air pods in both my ears and I'm hearing the broadcast with you [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rE6WhgFoH38&t=548.62s)]
*  But I'm yet to fill up on the news of what has been happening [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rE6WhgFoH38&t=554.38s)]
*  We have a very good connection how is that you are you connected to a hard line or do you all have? [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rE6WhgFoH38&t=559.14s)]
*  cell reception down there [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rE6WhgFoH38&t=565.24s)]
*  One neighbor with great ingenuity managed to install Wi-Fi and the bomb shelter [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rE6WhgFoH38&t=568.14s)]
*  It's an absolute lifesaver because we're able to keep up with with news outside. That's imperative in this moment [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rE6WhgFoH38&t=573.02s)]
*  Absolutely, I've got a good I've got a good friend in Tel Aviv [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rE6WhgFoH38&t=578.94s)]
*  because of the nature of what he does can't really be a part of our own air, but [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rE6WhgFoH38&t=582.86s)]
*  He was saying he's been there for a while a few weeks and he was saying just a couple days ago [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rE6WhgFoH38&t=587.78s)]
*  How remarkably and surprisingly on I? [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rE6WhgFoH38&t=592.38s)]
*  Guess resilient or or there's no state of panic among the people even in Tel Aviv when this happens [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rE6WhgFoH38&t=596.86s)]
*  Is it that you live life in Tel Aviv knowing this can happen at any moment [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rE6WhgFoH38&t=603.94s)]
*  Is it that the people of Tel Aviv understand the situation? [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rE6WhgFoH38&t=608.0600000000001s)]
*  So there's no reason to pay what makes the people in Tel Aviv right now according to him [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rE6WhgFoH38&t=611.6600000000001s)]
*  You kind of stone-faced and understanding [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rE6WhgFoH38&t=617.26s)]
*  Yeah, there is no panic [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rE6WhgFoH38&t=620.62s)]
*  I mean yesterday I went for a walk on the beach and the boardwalk was parked and people were playing volleyball and even swimming in [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rE6WhgFoH38&t=621.98s)]
*  The sea and Israelis don't panic for two reasons one [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rE6WhgFoH38&t=628.1400000000001s)]
*  We know that if there is a siren, we're going to get here. I see everyone leaving [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rE6WhgFoH38&t=631.5400000000001s)]
*  So we must have just received an alert that the sirens are over [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rE6WhgFoH38&t=635.98s)]
*  Israelis know that before a siren will get an advance warning as much as half an hour before telling us to seek shelter [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rE6WhgFoH38&t=640.1800000000001s)]
*  Because Israel sees when the Iranian regime is about to fire missiles, so they know there's no need to panic [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rE6WhgFoH38&t=648.02s)]
*  You'll have plenty of time to find shelter [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rE6WhgFoH38&t=654.1s)]
*  But also this is just something that comes with experience [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rE6WhgFoH38&t=656.1s)]
*  We have had weeks where the Houthis in Yemen will fire a missile at Israel [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rE6WhgFoH38&t=659.54s)]
*  Basically every single night waking the whole country up [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rE6WhgFoH38&t=665.34s)]
*  So it's tragic that Israelis are used to this but this is 20 months into a seven front wall [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rE6WhgFoH38&t=668.42s)]
*  and after many more years of rocket fire from Hezbollah and Hamas and Israelis have become used to the [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rE6WhgFoH38&t=675.1s)]
*  Unthinkable, but we absolutely can't let anyone think that this reality is normal [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rE6WhgFoH38&t=681.9399999999999s)]
*  And what Israel is fighting to do now is to restore security [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rE6WhgFoH38&t=686.1s)]
*  So we don't have to treat it as normal that we get a missile siren at any moment and have to run for shelter [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rE6WhgFoH38&t=689.78s)]
*  Because that's not normal if you can can you tell us where specifically you are in Tel Aviv? [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rE6WhgFoH38&t=695.1s)]
*  And or are you in the central part of Tel Aviv? Are you near the beach now or are you in the outskirts kind of I? [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rE6WhgFoH38&t=700.66s)]
*  Am in my apartment building in central Tel Aviv [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rE6WhgFoH38&t=708.46s)]
*  New buildings in Israel built since 1992 have their own bomb shelters in each apartment [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rE6WhgFoH38&t=712.02s)]
*  It's crazy. If you go around with a realtor to rent an apartment and they say your house has a bomb shelter [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rE6WhgFoH38&t=718.18s)]
*  That's a big bonus and you you sign that that rental contract straightaway [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rE6WhgFoH38&t=723.3s)]
*  all the buildings have a bomb shelter in the basement like this one and [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rE6WhgFoH38&t=726.9799999999999s)]
*  Some buildings don't have a bomb shelter at all and then people have to go to public bomb shelters [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rE6WhgFoH38&t=731.7399999999999s)]
*  You can see the information online Tel Aviv the whole country is completely filled with public bomb shelters [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rE6WhgFoH38&t=736.5799999999999s)]
*  But this is this is the basement of my building in Tel Aviv. All right [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rE6WhgFoH38&t=741.86s)]
*  Well, you know, we really hope that you stay safe [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rE6WhgFoH38&t=745.3399999999999s)]
*  Our thoughts and prayers are with you and everybody in the region [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rE6WhgFoH38&t=747.62s)]
*  There are children all across the region right now that are hearing sirens in Israel and also in Iran [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rE6WhgFoH38&t=750.78s)]
*  And these are scary times that can really escalate. We hope it doesn't and we hope things resolve quickly [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rE6WhgFoH38&t=757.92s)]
*  I'm thank you for spending so much time with us in the middle of this crisis really appreciate it. Absolutely [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rE6WhgFoH38&t=765.02s)]
