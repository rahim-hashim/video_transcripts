# BREAKING: Trump huddles with national security team after Iran missile strike injures 20
**Fox News - World News:** [June 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGwMrSQzbM)
*  Let's go to senior correspondent Mike Tobin on the ground in Tel Aviv with the very latest Mike [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGwMrSQzbM&t=0.0s)]
*  And Kaley as the direct combat between Israel and Iran now enters its second week Iran continues to lob missiles at Israel [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGwMrSQzbM&t=6.48s)]
*  Earlier today the sirens were sounding here from the north to the south of the country [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGwMrSQzbM&t=14.120000000000001s)]
*  We were able to watch the missile interceptions overhead here in Tel Aviv [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGwMrSQzbM&t=18.240000000000002s)]
*  One missile did get through in the Tel Aviv area striking down causing no injuries [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGwMrSQzbM&t=22.52s)]
*  Another missile landed to the south the town of Beersheba that's been under fire lately [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGwMrSQzbM&t=27.2s)]
*  Also resulting in no injuries a different story in the northern port city of Haifa where a missile came down more than 20 people [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGwMrSQzbM&t=31.24s)]
*  Were injured three of those injuries said to be seriously included serious including a 16 year old who took shrapnel to the chest [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGwMrSQzbM&t=38.56s)]
*  One woman did die, but she died of a heart attack running to the bomb shelters [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGwMrSQzbM&t=45.28s)]
*  the director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency says Iran was not taking the final steps toward making a bomb and [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGwMrSQzbM&t=49.879999999999995s)]
*  Despite the recent warfare diplomacy. He says could still prevent Iran from getting that bomb [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGwMrSQzbM&t=57.04s)]
*  We have confirmed that Iran does have even now [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGwMrSQzbM&t=63.12s)]
*  Enough material for several warheads, but this should not be equated with a nuclear weapon [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGwMrSQzbM&t=67.84s)]
*  We do not have at this point if you ask me at this point any [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGwMrSQzbM&t=74.68s)]
*  tangible [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGwMrSQzbM&t=79.68s)]
*  Prove that there is a program or a plan to [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGwMrSQzbM&t=81.0s)]
*  Fabricate to manufacture a nuclear weapon [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGwMrSQzbM&t=85.44s)]
*  Now in response to the missile strikes Israel's defense minister promised increased activity of the air campaign in Iran last night and today [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGwMrSQzbM&t=90.52s)]
*  Israeli fighter jets were active both above central and western Iran the IDF says the targets were missiles and [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGwMrSQzbM&t=98.11999999999999s)]
*  Military infrastructure Kayleigh back to you. Thank you. My keep us updated [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGwMrSQzbM&t=105.6s)]
*  Well general jack team here's where I want to start it [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGwMrSQzbM&t=109.76s)]
*  It's very clear to me why Iran can never have a nuclear weapon for myriad reasons [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGwMrSQzbM&t=112.24000000000001s)]
*  You look at Pakistan the fears of a non-state actor getting a nuclear weapon. There's the question of if Iran's rational [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGwMrSQzbM&t=116.0s)]
*  There's the idea that we don't want nuclear proliferation among rogue regimes [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGwMrSQzbM&t=121.24000000000001s)]
*  But I'm wondering if you can explain very clearly [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGwMrSQzbM&t=125.2s)]
*  Why it is in the US national interest to prevent this from happening? Yeah. Well first of all [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGwMrSQzbM&t=128.24s)]
*  Look at Iran's behavior in a language. They've used for 40 years [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGwMrSQzbM&t=134.96s)]
*  Their theme is [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGwMrSQzbM&t=138.6s)]
*  dominating control of Middle East and the flow of oil out of the Persian Gulf [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGwMrSQzbM&t=140.6s)]
*  Drive the United States military out of the region [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGwMrSQzbM&t=146.2s)]
*  So we lose our influence in the region and destroy the state of Israel [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGwMrSQzbM&t=148.76s)]
*  Now when they used to say that you know in the early days of the regime back in the 80s [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGwMrSQzbM&t=153.56s)]
*  People would roll their eyes and say well that they're not really serious about that [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGwMrSQzbM&t=158.51999999999998s)]
*  They are dead serious about it and [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGwMrSQzbM&t=162.68s)]
*  Acquiring a nuclear weapon gives them two things and the first thing is the destruction of the state of Israel and [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGwMrSQzbM&t=164.88s)]
*  the state of Israel has [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGwMrSQzbM&t=172.16s)]
*  Has to take that existential threat seriously based on the language and the rhetoric that they've exercised for all these years and their [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGwMrSQzbM&t=174.88s)]
*  determination to have a weapon and [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGwMrSQzbM&t=181.88s)]
*  Secondly, it leads to a nuclear arms race if they get a weapon [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGwMrSQzbM&t=184.52s)]
*  in the region Henry Kissinger who [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGwMrSQzbM&t=188.4s)]
*  after the war [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGwMrSQzbM&t=191.08s)]
*  After a number of years on the Defense Policy Board with him some 12 years [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGwMrSQzbM&t=193.08s)]
*  We actually developed a friendship which I was honored to have and he told me he said Jack [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGwMrSQzbM&t=197.68s)]
*  You know the most serious challenge in my lifetime that we're facing is not the calamity of World War two [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGwMrSQzbM&t=202.56s)]
*  It's Iran having a nuclear weapon and the Arabs acquiring a weapon obviously [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGwMrSQzbM&t=209.24s)]
*  To prevent them using it and it would likely given the volatility of that area [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGwMrSQzbM&t=215.88000000000002s)]
*  Lead to the first nuclear exchange in the world [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGwMrSQzbM&t=220.79999999999998s)]
*  So it is in US national interest [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGwMrSQzbM&t=223.88s)]
*  They run not to have a nuclear weapon certainly our ally is threatened by it [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGwMrSQzbM&t=227.2s)]
*  But the world is threatened by them having a nuclear weapon because of who they are [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGwMrSQzbM&t=232.16s)]
*  Yeah, this is a diabolical threatening regime the fact that they're mullahs and cleric is is a fraud [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGwMrSQzbM&t=236.76s)]
*  These are thugs and killers who are running this this regime for 45 years. Yeah who want nuclear weapons [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGwMrSQzbM&t=243.39999999999998s)]
*  I want to speak to this precise moment in time, and I want to play a clip [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGwMrSQzbM&t=249.6s)]
*  I heard last night from Rahm Emanuel. He talks about a different moment in the situation room Bill Clinton [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGwMrSQzbM&t=253.04s)]
*  1994 an opportunity the United States had that was not taken listen to this [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGwMrSQzbM&t=259.24s)]
*  I'm haunted by two things not haunted, but I have a flashing yellow light in [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGwMrSQzbM&t=263.92s)]
*  1994 same room situation room mm-hmm Bill Clinton was getting very basically his security team [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGwMrSQzbM&t=269.08s)]
*  bomb North Korea [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGwMrSQzbM&t=275.44s)]
*  Carter president Carter having gone there messed it up and messed up that opportunity and now you have a nuclear North Korea [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGwMrSQzbM&t=278.08s)]
*  Is that a lesson we should look to we could have stopped North Korea in 1994 and here we are again history repeating itself [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGwMrSQzbM&t=284.2s)]
*  With the fanatical regime. Yeah. Yeah, absolutely [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGwMrSQzbM&t=290.8s)]
*  I mean you have grossing on here and others saying well [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGwMrSQzbM&t=292.6s)]
*  We haven't even people in our Intel community saying well Iran hasn't made a decision to have a nuclear weapon. Are you kidding me? [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGwMrSQzbM&t=295.84s)]
*  The [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGwMrSQzbM&t=303.94s)]
*  The only industry they spend more money on is oil. This is an enterprise [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGwMrSQzbM&t=304.94s)]
*  It's at 12 sites some of the buildings have there's 25 to 30 buildings on some of these nuclear sites their academic [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGwMrSQzbM&t=309.41999999999996s)]
*  Universities are all tied to it in terms of research that's done with it [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGwMrSQzbM&t=318.9s)]
*  This is a major major enterprise and now they're within two weeks of being able to weaponize [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGwMrSQzbM&t=322.14s)]
*  And because they haven't made the decision to do that [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGwMrSQzbM&t=328.58s)]
*  We're absolutely in the same condition that we're in in North Korea. They made the decision. Let's say today two weeks later now [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGwMrSQzbM&t=331.98s)]
*  They have nine weapons [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGwMrSQzbM&t=338.6s)]
*  Now they're a nuclear power. Isn't that what happened to us and to suggest that well, maybe we shouldn't do anything [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGwMrSQzbM&t=340.38s)]
*  Because they haven't officially made the decision a weapon they for 25 years. They've taken every step [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGwMrSQzbM&t=347.86s)]
*  That's humanly possible [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGwMrSQzbM&t=354.54s)]
*  Not only to develop a nuclear weapon [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGwMrSQzbM&t=356.42s)]
*  But also they put into this major enterprise and and this is what some people don't get [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGwMrSQzbM&t=358.94s)]
*  Is the ayatollah has built an enterprise that's redundant and resilient [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGwMrSQzbM&t=365.26s)]
*  because he knows at some point it would be attacked and he wants to [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGwMrSQzbM&t=370.26s)]
*  absorb that attack [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGwMrSQzbM&t=375.34000000000003s)]
*  survive it [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGwMrSQzbM&t=377.02000000000004s)]
*  recover and rebuild and [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGwMrSQzbM&t=378.86s)]
*  He is never going to voluntarily [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGwMrSQzbM&t=381.62s)]
*  Dismantle this program with verification because it's gone [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGwMrSQzbM&t=385.38s)]
*  He believes some of it will be left and I can recover and rebuild that's really where we are [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGwMrSQzbM&t=388.82s)]
*  That's why no progress and negotiations have been made and that's why the only way to deal with this is you have to forcibly [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGwMrSQzbM&t=395.42s)]
*  Dismantle the program Sandra. What could you tell us general keen about what the president may be weighing in this very moment? [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGwMrSQzbM&t=403.58s)]
*  We know that [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGwMrSQzbM&t=410.74s)]
*  Caroline Levitt at the White House press briefing yesterday made the news of laying out within two weeks [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGwMrSQzbM&t=411.97999999999996s)]
*  We'll know how the president plans to proceed [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGwMrSQzbM&t=417.34s)]
*  I want to also add that we just learned through sources to Fox that Senate Majority Leader John Thune [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGwMrSQzbM&t=420.06s)]
*  Has now scheduled an all senators classified briefing on Iran Israel on the conflict that's set for next [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGwMrSQzbM&t=425.62s)]
*  Tuesday June 24th. So within two weeks means we could have the president tell us how he's gonna move forward [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGwMrSQzbM&t=433.34s)]
*  In an hour. It could be in a couple days. It could be in two weeks [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGwMrSQzbM&t=440.7s)]
*  We know he's meeting with his national security team this morning. We don't know if he's emerged from that yet [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGwMrSQzbM&t=443.7s)]
*  But what options do you think he is seriously having to weigh in this moment? [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGwMrSQzbM&t=449.82s)]
*  yeah, certainly well, he's had four or five meetings and and [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGwMrSQzbM&t=455.38s)]
*  these are very detailed meetings in terms of [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGwMrSQzbM&t=459.5s)]
*  What should what is our policy overall? [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGwMrSQzbM&t=462.9s)]
*  And I think when you strategically look at it [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGwMrSQzbM&t=465.32s)]
*  I would assume some like Secretary Rubio is saying given what the Israelis have done to the Iranians and [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGwMrSQzbM&t=469.04s)]
*  How back on their heels they really are, you know, they took down [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGwMrSQzbM&t=476.0s)]
*  70 of their air defense batteries. There's none left. They've hit 45 military sites [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGwMrSQzbM&t=480.32s)]
*  They've hit every single one of the nuclear sites all 12 plus of them either damaged or destroyed them [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGwMrSQzbM&t=486.15999999999997s)]
*  There is no Air Force. It is completely destroyed. They decapitated their military and scientific leaders as you know and listen to this [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGwMrSQzbM&t=493.8s)]
*  Where are the proxies who have missiles and rockets not a single one of them is coming to their defense. I [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGwMrSQzbM&t=502.68s)]
*  Asked an Israeli general what's going on with Hezbollah that they still have missiles. He said yes general [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGwMrSQzbM&t=510.24s)]
*  They do they have they have thousands of missiles and why aren't they coming? Why aren't they defend they? [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGwMrSQzbM&t=516.4s)]
*  The the Iranians organized Hezbollah [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGwMrSQzbM&t=522.26s)]
*  primary mission to defend Iran they pumped [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGwMrSQzbM&t=525.98s)]
*  Billions and billions of dollars 150,000 rockets and missiles. Why haven't they fired any of those in defense of Iran? [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGwMrSQzbM&t=529.0600000000001s)]
*  He said they have lost their will and they believe that Iran is about to be finished [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGwMrSQzbM&t=535.62s)]
*  Where is Russia in China and North Korea their strategic partners? [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGwMrSQzbM&t=541.86s)]
*  That then they have been cooperating [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGwMrSQzbM&t=546.3s)]
*  Coordinating and collaborating with each other for four years during a Biden administration [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGwMrSQzbM&t=549.5799999999999s)]
*  Where is the assistance coming to Iran given the situation they're in they have plenty of ballistic missiles [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGwMrSQzbM&t=554.62s)]
*  They have plenty of rockets. They have all sorts of things that can come to Iran's aid not going near it [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGwMrSQzbM&t=560.42s)]
*  Yeah, it is isolated and most vulnerable. It's been in 45 years [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGwMrSQzbM&t=566.74s)]
*  So I think Rubio would likely say this is a strategic opportunity [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGwMrSQzbM&t=572.0600000000001s)]
*  For us to remove not to remove but to end Iran's [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGwMrSQzbM&t=576.34s)]
*  Domination of the region in their adverse behavior that has been going on for all of these years [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGwMrSQzbM&t=581.3000000000001s)]
*  We can come close right now to ending that and maybe in the long run the Iranians themselves [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGwMrSQzbM&t=587.22s)]
*  Internally will make a change themselves in terms of their direction [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGwMrSQzbM&t=595.1s)]
*  Yeah, and you know, I think President Trump gets that and you know this two weeks deadline and when we just have a few moments [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGwMrSQzbM&t=599.06s)]
*  Here general keen but I do want to put it in the context of some of the reporting that came out [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGwMrSQzbM&t=605.7399999999999s)]
*  But from the times of Israel how an Israeli American deception campaign lulled Iran into a false sense of security [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGwMrSQzbM&t=610.3s)]
*  Is it your view that this two weeks language the public? [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGwMrSQzbM&t=617.38s)]
*  Broadcasting of where President Trump's head at could be a part of a strategic plan [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGwMrSQzbM&t=621.9399999999999s)]
*  Maybe to either lull Iran into a place of comfort or there's some four-dimensional chess going on with what's being publicly broadcast [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGwMrSQzbM&t=626.14s)]
*  And then privately discussed behind the scenes. Yeah. Well certainly that could be the case and you know, I didn't fully answer your question [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGwMrSQzbM&t=633.42s)]
*  I just dealt with the policy issue, but getting back to what's happening here [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGwMrSQzbM&t=639.62s)]
*  The he gets briefed on what the military option is or options [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGwMrSQzbM&t=643.9399999999999s)]
*  And what the risk is to executing those options and then they will take the president down the path of [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGwMrSQzbM&t=649.06s)]
*  What is Iran's most likely reaction to it? What are they probably going to do? What's their most dangerous? [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGwMrSQzbM&t=655.5s)]
*  Course of action they would take for us and then they'll walk him through what we would do to deal with all of that [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGwMrSQzbM&t=662.46s)]
*  So those things are clearly out there in terms of the two weeks [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGwMrSQzbM&t=669.8199999999999s)]
*  I think the carrier strike group may be a factor here [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGwMrSQzbM&t=673.42s)]
*  Yeah, you know it's coming from the Pacific Ocean it arrives this weekend. I don't think it has much to do with [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGwMrSQzbM&t=677.0s)]
*  protecting our forces as much as it has to do with [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGwMrSQzbM&t=684.7s)]
*  Retaliation against Iran if they make the decision to strike our forces now, obviously they can thicken the defense [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGwMrSQzbM&t=689.3000000000001s)]
*  But I think that extra combat power is for that reason and also [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGwMrSQzbM&t=695.42s)]
*  Let the Iranians see it. Yeah, and [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGwMrSQzbM&t=701.42s)]
*  so the two weeks [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGwMrSQzbM&t=704.58s)]
*  Obviously he advertised it as he wanted to see if they're willing to make a deal [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGwMrSQzbM&t=707.7s)]
*  Well, they've already answered that question. It goes right back to what I said at the outset [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGwMrSQzbM&t=711.8s)]
*  They are not going to give up their program [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGwMrSQzbM&t=716.3199999999999s)]
*  They are willing to accept this this attack David we say 60 days to make a deal [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGwMrSQzbM&t=719.24s)]
*  But they've had nearly half a century since 1979. Hey everyone [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roGwMrSQzbM&t=724.12s)]
