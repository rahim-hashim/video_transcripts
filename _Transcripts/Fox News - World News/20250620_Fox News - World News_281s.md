# China and Russia have ‘abandoned’ Iran as tensions rise
**Fox News - World News:** [June 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRhKMlaD4OA)
*  Former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo joins us now. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRhKMlaD4OA&t=0.0s)]
*  We did just find out that an all-clear has been given to people who are in their bunkers [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRhKMlaD4OA&t=2.88s)]
*  there in Israel. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRhKMlaD4OA&t=7.96s)]
*  So, they go back and forth, and they are on their toes. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRhKMlaD4OA&t=8.96s)]
*  This just in from Reuters, saying that Iranian officials are saying they will discuss limits [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRhKMlaD4OA&t=12.200000000000001s)]
*  on uranium enrichment. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRhKMlaD4OA&t=17.68s)]
*  However, the official quoted his words, saying, a zero-enrichment proposal will be rejected, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRhKMlaD4OA&t=20.0s)]
*  especially after Israel's attack. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRhKMlaD4OA&t=25.88s)]
*  So how does that square with what President Trump has said, which is they have to surrender [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRhKMlaD4OA&t=27.92s)]
*  at all? [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRhKMlaD4OA&t=32.660000000000004s)]
*  Well, Dana, good morning. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRhKMlaD4OA&t=33.660000000000004s)]
*  Thanks for having me on. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRhKMlaD4OA&t=35.660000000000004s)]
*  It doesn't square. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRhKMlaD4OA&t=37.2s)]
*  It doesn't remotely square. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRhKMlaD4OA&t=38.2s)]
*  Indeed, as the first I've heard of that statement, I don't see that statement as being remotely [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRhKMlaD4OA&t=39.64s)]
*  different from what they've been saying for weeks. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRhKMlaD4OA&t=44.34s)]
*  They've always said they'll have limits. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRhKMlaD4OA&t=46.96s)]
*  Indeed, they've had limits, and they've violated. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRhKMlaD4OA&t=48.120000000000005s)]
*  They've cheated on those very limits for years and years and years. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRhKMlaD4OA&t=50.760000000000005s)]
*  So for the Iranians to say, no, we still want to have some limited amount of enrichment [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRhKMlaD4OA&t=54.8s)]
*  means they're still headed down this same path. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRhKMlaD4OA&t=58.199999999999996s)]
*  And I think President Trump will clearly see that. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRhKMlaD4OA&t=61.32s)]
*  You're right. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRhKMlaD4OA&t=63.239999999999995s)]
*  He has said zero enrichment. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRhKMlaD4OA&t=64.24s)]
*  He has also talked about unconditional surrender. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRhKMlaD4OA&t=65.24s)]
*  It doesn't sound like the Iranians are anywhere near that. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRhKMlaD4OA&t=67.75999999999999s)]
*  And I'm confident that the negotiations that continue will be done, as Secretary of State [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRhKMlaD4OA&t=71.16s)]
*  Schultz called it, in the shadow of power, because absent that, without what President [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRhKMlaD4OA&t=75.67999999999999s)]
*  Trump has done to set up these conditions where the Iranians know that they could lose [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRhKMlaD4OA&t=79.88s)]
*  it all, without that risk, without that power being prevalent and visible, negotiations [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRhKMlaD4OA&t=83.88s)]
*  are just another euphemism for surrender and capitulation. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRhKMlaD4OA&t=90.11999999999999s)]
*  Listen to Senator Tom Cotton about Fordow. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRhKMlaD4OA&t=95.88s)]
*  This is that main enrichment facility where the weaponization would take place. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRhKMlaD4OA&t=98.39999999999999s)]
*  This is what he says. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRhKMlaD4OA&t=102.78s)]
*  For 25 years, American presidents have been pledging that Iran cannot get a nuclear weapon. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRhKMlaD4OA&t=104.62s)]
*  But only one, Donald Trump, actually has done something about it and has said that we're [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRhKMlaD4OA&t=109.94s)]
*  going to bring this chapter to a close soon. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRhKMlaD4OA&t=115.46000000000001s)]
*  So as you put it, Fordow, their deeply buried underground nuclear bunker, has to be closed [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRhKMlaD4OA&t=118.46000000000001s)]
*  one way or the other. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRhKMlaD4OA&t=124.74000000000001s)]
*  It can be closed the easy way. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRhKMlaD4OA&t=125.94s)]
*  But it has to be immediately. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRhKMlaD4OA&t=126.94s)]
*  Or it can be closed the hard way. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRhKMlaD4OA&t=127.94s)]
*  What are your thoughts on that? [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRhKMlaD4OA&t=128.94s)]
*  Yeah, I think Senator Cotton captured perfectly. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRhKMlaD4OA&t=132.9s)]
*  It was great to hear his voice. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRhKMlaD4OA&t=135.18s)]
*  He and I have been working on this for a long time together. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRhKMlaD4OA&t=136.9s)]
*  He and I are the ones that discovered that John Kerry, Barack Obama's secret side deals [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRhKMlaD4OA&t=139.34s)]
*  now, gosh, almost a decade ago, which reminds us all that it is time to put this to rest, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRhKMlaD4OA&t=143.18s)]
*  to get all of the enrichment out of Iran, to finally put Israel in a place where it [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRhKMlaD4OA&t=148.9s)]
*  can be secure and, most importantly, for the American people to make sure that we are safe [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRhKMlaD4OA&t=152.98000000000002s)]
*  and we don't have to live under the threat of a nuclear-armed Iranian regime that has [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRhKMlaD4OA&t=157.06s)]
*  for years talked about death to our nation and done everything it can to facilitate that. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRhKMlaD4OA&t=160.9s)]
*  I want to show you this headline from The Telegraph today, that China sends mystery [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRhKMlaD4OA&t=166.46s)]
*  transport planes into Iran. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRhKMlaD4OA&t=172.06s)]
*  You had a column in the New York Post this week saying that by defanging Iran, Trump [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRhKMlaD4OA&t=175.42000000000002s)]
*  would also bloody China and Russia. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRhKMlaD4OA&t=179.54000000000002s)]
*  What do we need to know about that connection and those relationships between Russia, China [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRhKMlaD4OA&t=181.98000000000002s)]
*  and Iran? [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRhKMlaD4OA&t=187.58s)]
*  Both Vladimir Putin and Xi Jinping, the leader of those two countries, have made pledges [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRhKMlaD4OA&t=190.82000000000002s)]
*  to the Iranian regime. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRhKMlaD4OA&t=195.06s)]
*  They have said we are lifelong friends, we have deep security relationships, and of course [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRhKMlaD4OA&t=196.06s)]
*  to date, while Iran's regime is threatened, they have done almost nothing to support them. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRhKMlaD4OA&t=200.26000000000002s)]
*  Not surprising. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRhKMlaD4OA&t=205.66000000000003s)]
*  They picked a loser and now can see that. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRhKMlaD4OA&t=206.66000000000003s)]
*  I have seen this report that they are moving cargo of some sort into Iran. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRhKMlaD4OA&t=209.62s)]
*  I don't know if that is true or exactly what it might be, but if the Chinese or the Russians [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRhKMlaD4OA&t=213.86s)]
*  were serious, they would have put their troops there, they would have done what they could [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRhKMlaD4OA&t=218.34s)]
*  with their defense systems, they would have created trouble somewhere else in the world [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRhKMlaD4OA&t=222.17999999999998s)]
*  and instead they have abandoned their erstwhile ally, their regime in Iran. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRhKMlaD4OA&t=225.42s)]
*  They are clearly net losers from what Israel has done so far and completing this task will [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRhKMlaD4OA&t=230.57999999999998s)]
*  accomplish two things. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRhKMlaD4OA&t=234.94s)]
*  One, it will take down their nuclear weapons efforts, ballistic missiles, all of the development [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRhKMlaD4OA&t=235.94s)]
*  work that goes alongside of that. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRhKMlaD4OA&t=240.34s)]
*  And second, it will demonstrate to Xi Jinping, who is thinking about Taiwan, and to Vladimir [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRhKMlaD4OA&t=242.26s)]
*  Putin, who has already invaded Europe, they will recognize that President Trump is someone [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRhKMlaD4OA&t=247.14s)]
*  that is not to be trifled with and is prepared to do the hard work to deter them from further [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRhKMlaD4OA&t=251.01999999999998s)]
*  aggression. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRhKMlaD4OA&t=256.7s)]
*  Much more to come on all of this and I'm sure we'll be talking to you next week as President [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRhKMlaD4OA&t=259.14s)]
*  Trump heads to the NATO summit on Monday. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRhKMlaD4OA&t=263.0s)]
*  Foreign policy, a huge issue going into the weekend. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRhKMlaD4OA&t=265.94s)]
*  Thank you so much, Secretary. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRhKMlaD4OA&t=269.14s)]
*  I'm Steve Ducey. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRhKMlaD4OA&t=270.14s)]
