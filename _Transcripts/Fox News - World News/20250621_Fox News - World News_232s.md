# Trump to return to White House for national security briefing
**Fox News - World News:** [June 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgXg6pme8GI)
*  Lucas Tomlinson live at the White House with more on all of that. Lucas. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgXg6pme8GI&t=0.0s)]
*  And John, the key word from the president there is within two weeks now the president has ordered [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgXg6pme8GI&t=4.0s)]
*  B-2 stealth bombers to launch from Whiteman Air Force Base, Missouri. They are currently on their way [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgXg6pme8GI&t=10.0s)]
*  to the US island territory of Guam in the Western Pacific, all part of President Trump's likely [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgXg6pme8GI&t=16.0s)]
*  negotiating strategy with Ron to get them to stop enriching uranium, a key component to make nuclear weapons. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgXg6pme8GI&t=22.0s)]
*  Here is the president yesterday. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgXg6pme8GI&t=28.0s)]
*  What was the thought process behind two weeks time? [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgXg6pme8GI&t=30.0s)]
*  Just time to see whether or not people come to their senses. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgXg6pme8GI&t=36.0s)]
*  Giving them a period of time, we're going to see what that period of time is, but I'm giving them a period of time. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgXg6pme8GI&t=40.0s)]
*  And I would say two weeks would be the maximum. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgXg6pme8GI&t=44.0s)]
*  Now, speaking of distance, John, the distance between Tel Aviv and Tehran is about the same distance between Minneapolis and New York. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgXg6pme8GI&t=48.0s)]
*  These B-2s you see launching from Whiteman Air Force Base is file footage, of course, much longer distance than around 11 a.m. Eastern time. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgXg6pme8GI&t=57.0s)]
*  The two formations of B-2s refueled near Hawaii on their way to Guam. It's notable after taking off from Whiteman in Missouri, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgXg6pme8GI&t=65.0s)]
*  they were refueled by a group of tankers assigned. They were carrying those heavy 15-ton bunker busting bombs. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgXg6pme8GI&t=72.0s)]
*  Each B-2 can carry two of them. American fighter jets, including fifth generation F-22s, are also headed to the Middle East, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgXg6pme8GI&t=77.0s)]
*  which could serve as escorts, could also strike targets in Iran themselves if ordered. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgXg6pme8GI&t=84.0s)]
*  And I stress if ordered, John, because if President Trump orders a strike on Iran's uranium enrichment site of Fordow, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgXg6pme8GI&t=89.0s)]
*  buried deep underground two hours south of Tehran, it might require more than one strike. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgXg6pme8GI&t=95.0s)]
*  Here's the former head of U.S. forces, the Middle East General Joe Votel, who commanded the U.S. Central Command when U.S. forces defeated ISIS. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgXg6pme8GI&t=100.0s)]
*  So he will know. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgXg6pme8GI&t=107.0s)]
*  We don't just ever just drop bombs and then forget about it. We assess. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgXg6pme8GI&t=109.0s)]
*  We look at that. We make assessments on the damage you've done. And then oftentimes we re-attack. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgXg6pme8GI&t=113.0s)]
*  And so it's likely that we will need to do this. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgXg6pme8GI&t=118.0s)]
*  The General Votel saying more than one strike might be necessary to strike Fordow. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgXg6pme8GI&t=123.0s)]
*  Now, the top Democrat on the House Armed Services Committee is urging President Trump not to strike. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgXg6pme8GI&t=127.0s)]
*  I think the U.S. should get directly involved in this conflict. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgXg6pme8GI&t=136.0s)]
*  We have bases in Qatar and Bahrain, in Iraq, UAE, and even some troops in Syria. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgXg6pme8GI&t=139.0s)]
*  And those proxy forces could very aggressively target U.S. interests. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgXg6pme8GI&t=144.0s)]
*  And President Trump is returning to the White House. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgXg6pme8GI&t=152.0s)]
*  He will land on the South Lawn and have a meeting of his national security team inside the White House at 6 p.m. Eastern, likely weighing whether to strike Iran. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgXg6pme8GI&t=154.0s)]
*  John. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgXg6pme8GI&t=162.0s)]
*  So two weeks is the president's self-imposed deadline or time limit, if you will, Lucas. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgXg6pme8GI&t=163.0s)]
*  Within two weeks, John, is what the president said. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgXg6pme8GI&t=169.0s)]
*  That's why there were a lot of people watching this formation of two groups of B-2 bombers leaving Whiteman Air Force Base in Missouri going to Guam. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgXg6pme8GI&t=172.0s)]
*  That could be a staging area for a potential strike. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgXg6pme8GI&t=180.0s)]
*  It does appear that this would be the go-no-go site for any potential strike in Iran using the B-2 bombers. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgXg6pme8GI&t=183.0s)]
*  And of course, you can't forget those fighter jets that have left the United States, including the F-22s from Langley, Virginia, that went to the United Kingdom now there in the Middle East. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgXg6pme8GI&t=190.0s)]
*  I've also seen some jets leave some bases in the Middle East and Qatar and next door in the United Arab Emirates. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgXg6pme8GI&t=198.0s)]
*  Some of those jets have left. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgXg6pme8GI&t=203.0s)]
*  We're seeing a big buildup in Saudi Arabia, though, John. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgXg6pme8GI&t=205.0s)]
*  All right. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgXg6pme8GI&t=208.0s)]
*  Lucas Tomlinson reporting from the White House. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgXg6pme8GI&t=209.0s)]
*  And the president will be returning there about three hours from now. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgXg6pme8GI&t=210.0s)]
*  Lucas, thank you. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgXg6pme8GI&t=214.0s)]
*  Hey, everyone. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgXg6pme8GI&t=215.0s)]
