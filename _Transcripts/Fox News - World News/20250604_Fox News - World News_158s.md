**Fox News - World News:** [June 04, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XKVYTd5akU)
*  First, a Chinese couple charged with smuggling a potential agro-terrorism weapon into the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XKVYTd5akU&t=0.0s)]
*  U.S. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XKVYTd5akU&t=6.0s)]
*  The feds say the woman works in a lab at the University of Michigan and had a statement [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XKVYTd5akU&t=7.0s)]
*  on her phone pledging loyalty to the Chinese Communist Party. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XKVYTd5akU&t=10.68s)]
*  Her boyfriend allegedly had an article on his phone about plant pathogen warfare. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XKVYTd5akU&t=15.120000000000001s)]
*  The feds says the fungus they are accused of smuggling causes head blight. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XKVYTd5akU&t=21.16s)]
*  It's a disease that infects wheat, barley, maize, and rice. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XKVYTd5akU&t=25.560000000000002s)]
*  It then causes vomiting, liver damage, reproductive defects, too, in humans and livestock. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XKVYTd5akU&t=29.56s)]
*  First on all this, we go to senior national correspondent Rich Edson with all the details [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XKVYTd5akU&t=35.6s)]
*  in Washington. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XKVYTd5akU&t=39.92s)]
*  Hey, Rich. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XKVYTd5akU&t=40.92s)]
*  Good afternoon, Jillian. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XKVYTd5akU&t=41.92s)]
*  Well, FBI Director Cash Patel called this a direct threat to national security. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XKVYTd5akU&t=42.92s)]
*  End quote. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XKVYTd5akU&t=46.72s)]
*  This case is a sobering reminder that the Chinese Communist Party continues to deploy [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XKVYTd5akU&t=47.879999999999995s)]
*  operatives and researchers to infiltrate our institutions and target our food supply, an [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XKVYTd5akU&t=52.32s)]
*  act that could cripple our economy and endanger American lives. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XKVYTd5akU&t=58.36s)]
*  Federal prosecutors have charged the Chinese couple, Yang Qing Jian and Zan Yong Liu, with [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XKVYTd5akU&t=62.92s)]
*  smuggling a dangerous biological pathogen. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XKVYTd5akU&t=67.64s)]
*  The government says in July, Liu flew from China to Detroit, where customs officials [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XKVYTd5akU&t=70.92s)]
*  found a fungus stashed in his backpack, one prosecutors call a potential agro-terrorism [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XKVYTd5akU&t=75.54s)]
*  weapon. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XKVYTd5akU&t=81.4s)]
*  They say Liu wanted to conduct research on it at the University of Michigan, where his [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XKVYTd5akU&t=82.4s)]
*  girlfriend Jian worked. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XKVYTd5akU&t=86.08s)]
*  The FBI says it searched Jian's phone and found a form describing her membership in [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XKVYTd5akU&t=88.08s)]
*  and loyalty to the Chinese Communist Party and that she previously tried smuggling this [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XKVYTd5akU&t=92.92s)]
*  same substance into the United States. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XKVYTd5akU&t=97.67999999999999s)]
*  Some Republicans say the U.S. should prohibit any foreign national affiliated with the Chinese [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XKVYTd5akU&t=100.62s)]
*  Communist Party from getting a student visa. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XKVYTd5akU&t=104.52s)]
*  The University of Michigan says it's cooperating with law enforcement. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XKVYTd5akU&t=107.4s)]
*  End quote. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XKVYTd5akU&t=110.36s)]
*  We strongly condemn any actions that seek to cause harm, threaten national security. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XKVYTd5akU&t=111.36s)]
*  It is important to note that the university has received no funding from the Chinese government [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XKVYTd5akU&t=115.88000000000001s)]
*  in relation to research conducted by the accused individuals. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XKVYTd5akU&t=121.12s)]
*  Jian is in federal custody pending a hearing tomorrow afternoon. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XKVYTd5akU&t=124.76s)]
*  Officials say Liu, her boyfriend, was denied entry into the U.S. last year and returned [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XKVYTd5akU&t=128.32s)]
*  to China after customs officials seized his backpack. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XKVYTd5akU&t=132.32s)]
*  The Chinese embassy in D.C. says the Chinese government requires its citizens to abide [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XKVYTd5akU&t=135.36s)]
*  by local laws. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XKVYTd5akU&t=140.2s)]
*  Jillian? [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XKVYTd5akU&t=141.2s)]
