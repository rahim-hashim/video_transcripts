# NEW: We are just getting started, Israeli official says
**Fox News - World News:** [June 12, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRTIPbQ6oFk)
*  Trey was talking about a message from America, a message from Iran. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRTIPbQ6oFk&t=0.0s)]
*  We just got this crossing from Reuters, Iran's Supreme Leader Khamenei is alive, briefed [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRTIPbQ6oFk&t=5.16s)]
*  about the situation, following Israeli strike security sources telling Reuters. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRTIPbQ6oFk&t=10.96s)]
*  So Tehran, Iran is kind of letting the world know that the Supreme Leader Khamenei is in [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRTIPbQ6oFk&t=16.36s)]
*  fact alive, but as we reported earlier, the leader of the IRGC was reportedly taken out [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRTIPbQ6oFk&t=24.12s)]
*  and Iran has not. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRTIPbQ6oFk&t=31.84s)]
*  In fact, they have kind of confirmed, the Iranian news agency, they have kind of confirmed [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRTIPbQ6oFk&t=33.120000000000005s)]
*  that he was taken out. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRTIPbQ6oFk&t=38.3s)]
*  I want to bring in Danny Danon, the Israeli ambassador to the United Nations. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRTIPbQ6oFk&t=39.3s)]
*  And Danny Danon, if you can give us some kind of comments on, one, what you think about [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRTIPbQ6oFk&t=45.040000000000006s)]
*  happening tonight in your, or early in the morning in your home country and about this [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRTIPbQ6oFk&t=49.56s)]
*  response from Iran and what their statements are saying. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRTIPbQ6oFk&t=55.160000000000004s)]
*  What do you make of all this? [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRTIPbQ6oFk&t=58.64s)]
*  Trey said tonight is a historic night. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRTIPbQ6oFk&t=59.64s)]
*  Israel took preemptive actions against Iran. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRTIPbQ6oFk&t=63.040000000000006s)]
*  We have been saying it for years that we will not allow Iran to obtain nuclear weapons and [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRTIPbQ6oFk&t=67.0s)]
*  now we're actually taking actions against Iran. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRTIPbQ6oFk&t=71.88s)]
*  And we have two goals in this operation, to make sure they cannot put together a bomb [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRTIPbQ6oFk&t=75.04s)]
*  and also we want, we will destroy the ballistic missile capabilities. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRTIPbQ6oFk&t=80.24000000000001s)]
*  What we have seen, it's only the beginning. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRTIPbQ6oFk&t=85.64s)]
*  We will continue and we will go all the way until Iran will not pose a threat, not only [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRTIPbQ6oFk&t=87.72s)]
*  to Israel, but to the entire Western civilization. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRTIPbQ6oFk&t=93.04s)]
*  You know, many times people condemn us, but I'm sure, you know, when they will learn in [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRTIPbQ6oFk&t=96.52000000000001s)]
*  the history books, 20, 50, 100 years from tonight, they will realize it was a historic [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRTIPbQ6oFk&t=100.8s)]
*  decision of the Israeli government. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRTIPbQ6oFk&t=106.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRTIPbQ6oFk&t=109.32s)]
*  One more, while I've got you, Ambassador. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRTIPbQ6oFk&t=110.32s)]
*  Marco Rubio issued the following statement, quoting here, tonight Israel took unilateral [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRTIPbQ6oFk&t=112.36s)]
*  action against Iran. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRTIPbQ6oFk&t=116.84s)]
*  We are not involved in strikes against Iran and our top priority is protecting American [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRTIPbQ6oFk&t=118.08s)]
*  forces in the region. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRTIPbQ6oFk&t=122.75999999999999s)]
*  Israel advised us that they believe this action was necessary for its self-defense. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRTIPbQ6oFk&t=124.52s)]
*  President Trump and the administration have taken all necessary steps to protect our forces [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRTIPbQ6oFk&t=129.16s)]
*  and remain in close contact with our regional partners. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRTIPbQ6oFk&t=133.48s)]
*  Let me be clear, Iran should not target U.S. interests or personnel. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRTIPbQ6oFk&t=136.8s)]
*  Ambassador, when you look and you hear the statement from Secretary of State Marco Rubio, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRTIPbQ6oFk&t=142.56s)]
*  is there anything that makes you believe that maybe America can remain out of this, that [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRTIPbQ6oFk&t=148.44s)]
*  Israel knew that America wanted to stay out and went forward anyway? [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRTIPbQ6oFk&t=154.2s)]
*  Well, this was a decision that was made by Israel and not for the first time. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRTIPbQ6oFk&t=159.11999999999998s)]
*  You know, also when we attacked the nuclear reactor in Iraq and in Syria, it was an independent [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRTIPbQ6oFk&t=163.2s)]
*  decision and it was the right decision. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRTIPbQ6oFk&t=168.51999999999998s)]
*  Same tonight. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRTIPbQ6oFk&t=171.07999999999998s)]
*  You know, we talk with our allies in Washington, in other capitals, but at the end of the day [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRTIPbQ6oFk&t=172.07999999999998s)]
*  we take our own decisions. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRTIPbQ6oFk&t=177.0s)]
*  But you know, we have heard the threats coming from Tehran, threatening the allies of the [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRTIPbQ6oFk&t=178.95999999999998s)]
*  United States in the region. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRTIPbQ6oFk&t=183.16s)]
*  We are ready. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRTIPbQ6oFk&t=185.72s)]
*  You know, the people in Israel woke up a few hours ago. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRTIPbQ6oFk&t=187.0s)]
*  They are all waiting to see what will happen, what will be the retaliation. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRTIPbQ6oFk&t=189.84s)]
*  It will not be easy for us, but we are willing to pay the price. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRTIPbQ6oFk&t=193.20000000000002s)]
*  We are determined to protect ourselves. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRTIPbQ6oFk&t=197.36s)]
*  And you know, trace, 80 years ago, the allies liberated the death camps, including Auschwitz. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRTIPbQ6oFk&t=200.20000000000002s)]
*  Today we are not counting on the allies to protect Israel. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRTIPbQ6oFk&t=206.28s)]
*  We have our own country, our own military, and we are capable to make sure that this [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRTIPbQ6oFk&t=210.12s)]
*  Holocaust will not happen again. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRTIPbQ6oFk&t=216.04s)]
*  So this was an act of self-defense and I think that we all pray for the brave pilots and soldiers [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRTIPbQ6oFk&t=217.96s)]
*  who are protecting Israel tonight. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRTIPbQ6oFk&t=225.56s)]
