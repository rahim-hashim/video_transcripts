# Will Iranian supreme leader ‘drink the poison chalice’ or fight til his ‘last stand’?
**Fox News - World News:** [June 22, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0WC86vGkAY)
*  I want to bring in Mark Dubowitz, if I can here, because it's interesting. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0WC86vGkAY&t=0.0s)]
*  Yesterday, Mark, you had the Ayatollah Khamenei saying that there would be no surrender, period. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0WC86vGkAY&t=4.12s)]
*  It was not going to do it. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0WC86vGkAY&t=10.84s)]
*  And I'm wondering if that feeling has changed. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0WC86vGkAY&t=12.280000000000001s)]
*  I'm wondering what the next step is, what tomorrow brings diplomatically in your mind. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0WC86vGkAY&t=14.36s)]
*  Do you think it takes a few days before there's any type of response, Mark, or do you think [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0WC86vGkAY&t=19.64s)]
*  this is something that is already kind of fomenting in Iran as we speak? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0WC86vGkAY&t=24.080000000000002s)]
*  I think the Iranian President, the Iranian Supreme Leader, who with the Iranian President [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0WC86vGkAY&t=29.16s)]
*  at the time, Rafsanjani, went to Ayatollah Khamenei and the Iran-Iraq war. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0WC86vGkAY&t=35.24s)]
*  They had fought a brutal war with Iraq. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0WC86vGkAY&t=40.32s)]
*  Eight years, a million Iranians and Iraqis had been killed. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0WC86vGkAY&t=42.4s)]
*  The United States accidentally shot down an Iranian civilian passenger airline and promised [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0WC86vGkAY&t=45.760000000000005s)]
*  compensation, apologized. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0WC86vGkAY&t=52.04s)]
*  But Khamenei and Rafsanjani went to Khamenei and said, the United States is about to intervene [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0WC86vGkAY&t=54.120000000000005s)]
*  militarily on behalf of the Iraqis. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0WC86vGkAY&t=59.04s)]
*  We have to sue for peace. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0WC86vGkAY&t=61.0s)]
*  And they told Khomeini, who famously said, I drank the poison chalice, and he agreed [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0WC86vGkAY&t=62.760000000000005s)]
*  to a ceasefire. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0WC86vGkAY&t=68.0s)]
*  Well, that was Khamenei 40 years ago. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0WC86vGkAY&t=69.0s)]
*  Khamenei today is in a bunker. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0WC86vGkAY&t=70.76s)]
*  And the United States has just intervened militarily, not accidentally, but intentionally. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0WC86vGkAY&t=72.68s)]
*  And he's got to be asking himself, do I drink the poison chalice? [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0WC86vGkAY&t=77.64s)]
*  Do I go back to Amman with my diplomats and agree to the peaceful deal that President [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0WC86vGkAY&t=80.88s)]
*  Trump has repeatedly offered me? [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0WC86vGkAY&t=85.16s)]
*  Or am I going to fight my last stand? [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0WC86vGkAY&t=87.03999999999999s)]
*  And I think President Trump made it very clear tonight. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0WC86vGkAY&t=88.84s)]
*  I should say, it surprised me that this isn't just about the nuclear sites, that if you [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0WC86vGkAY&t=91.24s)]
*  escalate and you don't go back to a peaceful agreement, we are going to use the U.S. military [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0WC86vGkAY&t=95.88s)]
*  to go after other military and security targets. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0WC86vGkAY&t=101.03999999999999s)]
*  So Khamenei is facing a choice between his survival and his nuclear program. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0WC86vGkAY&t=103.72s)]
*  He's told the nuclear program get almost obliterated tonight. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0WC86vGkAY&t=110.2s)]
*  He's got to be asking himself about his survival. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0WC86vGkAY&t=113.64s)]
