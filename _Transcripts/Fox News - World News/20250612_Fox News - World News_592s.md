# BREAKING: Air India plane crashes after takeoff with hundreds on board
**Fox News - World News:** [June 12, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kerkWw1NVT8)
*  the air. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kerkWw1NVT8&t=0.0s)]
*  Straight to a Fox News alert. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kerkWw1NVT8&t=1.0s)]
*  An Air India plane with 244 [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kerkWw1NVT8&t=3.0s)]
*  people on board bound for [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kerkWw1NVT8&t=6.0s)]
*  London Gatwick Airport [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kerkWw1NVT8&t=8.0s)]
*  crashing shortly after takeoff [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kerkWw1NVT8&t=10.0s)]
*  into a residential area in India. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kerkWw1NVT8&t=13.0s)]
*  A huge plume of thick black smoke [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kerkWw1NVT8&t=15.0s)]
*  you can see filling the sky. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kerkWw1NVT8&t=18.0s)]
*  Yeah, we're seeing a lot of this [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kerkWw1NVT8&t=20.0s)]
*  for the first time too. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kerkWw1NVT8&t=21.0s)]
*  The aircraft is a Boeing 787 [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kerkWw1NVT8&t=22.0s)]
*  and received the last signal [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kerkWw1NVT8&t=24.0s)]
*  just seconds after takeoff [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kerkWw1NVT8&t=26.0s)]
*  at 625 feet. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kerkWw1NVT8&t=28.0s)]
*  According to Flight Radar, that is [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kerkWw1NVT8&t=30.0s)]
*  India's aviation ministry also says [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kerkWw1NVT8&t=32.0s)]
*  the nation is on the highest alert [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kerkWw1NVT8&t=34.0s)]
*  and rescue teams have been mobilized. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kerkWw1NVT8&t=36.0s)]
*  So this is what we know. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kerkWw1NVT8&t=39.0s)]
*  All flights are currently suspended [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kerkWw1NVT8&t=40.0s)]
*  at that airport in India [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kerkWw1NVT8&t=41.0s)]
*  until further notice. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kerkWw1NVT8&t=44.0s)]
*  There is no word on any casualties yet. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kerkWw1NVT8&t=45.0s)]
*  And the airline says that they will share [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kerkWw1NVT8&t=48.0s)]
*  more details when they are available. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kerkWw1NVT8&t=50.0s)]
*  Britain is working with Indian authorities [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kerkWw1NVT8&t=52.0s)]
*  to urgently establish the facts. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kerkWw1NVT8&t=54.0s)]
*  Yeah, and it looks so. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kerkWw1NVT8&t=58.0s)]
*  Another issue will be where it crashed [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kerkWw1NVT8&t=60.0s)]
*  in a residential neighborhood. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kerkWw1NVT8&t=62.0s)]
*  And that's you wonder what's happening. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kerkWw1NVT8&t=64.0s)]
*  People in their homes, almost like Lockerbie. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kerkWw1NVT8&t=66.0s)]
*  There were people that were hurt [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kerkWw1NVT8&t=69.0s)]
*  as the plane exploded in midair. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kerkWw1NVT8&t=71.0s)]
*  All right, let's bring in Mike Boyd. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kerkWw1NVT8&t=73.0s)]
*  He's an aviation consultant. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kerkWw1NVT8&t=74.0s)]
*  Mike, thanks for getting up this morning. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kerkWw1NVT8&t=76.0s)]
*  I know this just happened. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kerkWw1NVT8&t=77.0s)]
*  You probably don't know more [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kerkWw1NVT8&t=78.0s)]
*  than what we just talked about. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kerkWw1NVT8&t=80.0s)]
*  But have you heard about any fatalities [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kerkWw1NVT8&t=82.0s)]
*  and what do you think went wrong? [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kerkWw1NVT8&t=84.0s)]
*  Another problem for Boeing. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kerkWw1NVT8&t=86.0s)]
*  Well, it is. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kerkWw1NVT8&t=88.0s)]
*  The first 787 fatal crash in history. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kerkWw1NVT8&t=89.0s)]
*  That's going to make Boeing not too happy. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kerkWw1NVT8&t=93.0s)]
*  But you're just looking at the pictures [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kerkWw1NVT8&t=95.0s)]
*  that are there and you got as much as I do. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kerkWw1NVT8&t=96.0s)]
*  It looks like the airplane took off, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kerkWw1NVT8&t=98.0s)]
*  lost power and went down. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kerkWw1NVT8&t=100.0s)]
*  There are other videos coming out. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kerkWw1NVT8&t=101.0s)]
*  It's confused where they show survivors. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kerkWw1NVT8&t=104.0s)]
*  So maybe there's good news here. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kerkWw1NVT8&t=106.0s)]
*  But the real issue now is what caused [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kerkWw1NVT8&t=108.0s)]
*  this airplane to go down [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kerkWw1NVT8&t=110.0s)]
*  and everything is speculation. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kerkWw1NVT8&t=111.0s)]
*  The only thing we know for sure is it did go down. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kerkWw1NVT8&t=112.0s)]
*  And the question is what is Boeing going to be doing? [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kerkWw1NVT8&t=115.0s)]
*  Believe me, they'll be all over [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kerkWw1NVT8&t=117.0s)]
*  because up until now this airplane is at a spotless safety record. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kerkWw1NVT8&t=119.0s)]
*  So Mike, for what we know on most of the crashes that happened, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kerkWw1NVT8&t=122.0s)]
*  we later found out that most of them happened [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kerkWw1NVT8&t=127.0s)]
*  because of human error. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kerkWw1NVT8&t=129.0s)]
*  I know you don't know a lot about this crash. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kerkWw1NVT8&t=131.0s)]
*  We're still learning this. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kerkWw1NVT8&t=134.0s)]
*  It's a very fluid situation. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kerkWw1NVT8&t=136.0s)]
*  But what is the first thing that comes to mind [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kerkWw1NVT8&t=138.0s)]
*  when you see a crash like this that could have happened? [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kerkWw1NVT8&t=140.0s)]
*  Well, when we see the video of an airplane obviously on takeoff [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kerkWw1NVT8&t=143.0s)]
*  and then slowly going down, the first thing, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kerkWw1NVT8&t=146.0s)]
*  they lost power obviously somehow. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kerkWw1NVT8&t=148.0s)]
*  So the first thing that comes up is, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kerkWw1NVT8&t=150.0s)]
*  you mentioned human error. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kerkWw1NVT8&t=152.0s)]
*  Everything is human error. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kerkWw1NVT8&t=153.0s)]
*  These things are made by the hand of man. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kerkWw1NVT8&t=154.0s)]
*  So something must have happened like that. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kerkWw1NVT8&t=156.0s)]
*  And we don't know, but we'll know going forward. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kerkWw1NVT8&t=158.0s)]
*  The real issue is Boeing will be all over this. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kerkWw1NVT8&t=161.0s)]
*  The NDSB will be all over it. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kerkWw1NVT8&t=163.0s)]
*  The Indian authorities will be all over it. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kerkWw1NVT8&t=165.0s)]
*  Because up until now, again, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kerkWw1NVT8&t=167.0s)]
*  it's been an incredibly safe airplane. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kerkWw1NVT8&t=168.0s)]
*  So they've been looking at the human factors as well. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kerkWw1NVT8&t=170.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kerkWw1NVT8&t=173.0s)]
*  You've got to worry about people on the ground [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kerkWw1NVT8&t=174.0s)]
*  as well as the people on the jet. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kerkWw1NVT8&t=175.0s)]
*  The Indian Air Force and Army are engaged in rescue operations. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kerkWw1NVT8&t=177.0s)]
*  That's what you're seeing on the left side of your screen. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kerkWw1NVT8&t=180.0s)]
*  Mike, I'd like to bring you to something, facts we do know. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kerkWw1NVT8&t=182.0s)]
*  You know, we always say 30,000 feet is where a jet wants to go. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kerkWw1NVT8&t=185.0s)]
*  This jet got as high as 625 feet. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kerkWw1NVT8&t=188.0s)]
*  And according to eyewitnesses, if they pan out to be correct, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kerkWw1NVT8&t=191.0s)]
*  it ended up going immediately vertically right into the ground. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kerkWw1NVT8&t=195.0s)]
*  If you can visualize in your mind taking off, getting to 625, [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kerkWw1NVT8&t=200.0s)]
*  and then going straight down to the ground, is that intentional? [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kerkWw1NVT8&t=205.0s)]
*  Is that one of the things that pops to your mind? [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kerkWw1NVT8&t=210.0s)]
*  It could be. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kerkWw1NVT8&t=213.0s)]
*  The one video I saw, we're all well informed here, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kerkWw1NVT8&t=214.0s)]
*  but the one video I saw simply showed the airplanes [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kerkWw1NVT8&t=216.0s)]
*  that are gradually going down and then out of sight. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kerkWw1NVT8&t=219.0s)]
*  So it might have nosed down after that. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kerkWw1NVT8&t=221.0s)]
*  But you know, the first thing you think of, it lost power somehow. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kerkWw1NVT8&t=223.0s)]
*  But again, that's all speculation right now. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kerkWw1NVT8&t=226.0s)]
*  And again, it's likely something to do mechanically with the airplane. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kerkWw1NVT8&t=229.0s)]
*  Any other thing could be in there. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kerkWw1NVT8&t=234.0s)]
*  Can I ask you, Mike, if it did lose power, wouldn't it glide? [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kerkWw1NVT8&t=236.0s)]
*  Yeah, but they're not going very fast to start with, and it did glide. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kerkWw1NVT8&t=241.0s)]
*  It glided to point of impact. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kerkWw1NVT8&t=246.0s)]
*  So Mike, for pilots, do they try to, I mean, [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kerkWw1NVT8&t=249.0s)]
*  I would imagine they would try to avoid, if they are crashing, [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kerkWw1NVT8&t=253.0s)]
*  into buildings, into residential areas where other people on the ground could be affected. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kerkWw1NVT8&t=256.0s)]
*  Does a pilot have any control over that? [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kerkWw1NVT8&t=261.0s)]
*  Probably not in India, probably not at this airport, [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kerkWw1NVT8&t=264.0s)]
*  which is an airport tightly surrounded by population. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kerkWw1NVT8&t=266.0s)]
*  I mean, wherever it was going to go down, people were going to be there probably in this city. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kerkWw1NVT8&t=270.0s)]
*  Mike, forgive my ignorance, but what could cause a plane to lose power so fast after takeoff? [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kerkWw1NVT8&t=275.0s)]
*  Probably about a thousand different things. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kerkWw1NVT8&t=282.0s)]
*  Really? [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kerkWw1NVT8&t=285.0s)]
*  Contaminated fuel, lack of fuel, a mechanical problem that caused one engine or two engines to lose power. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kerkWw1NVT8&t=286.0s)]
*  There are a thousand things that could cause that to happen. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kerkWw1NVT8&t=292.0s)]
*  So it's really speculative right now, but it's not a simple issue. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kerkWw1NVT8&t=296.0s)]
*  It could be a combination of things that happen and cause the chain reaction. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kerkWw1NVT8&t=300.0s)]
*  We'll know before long, but again, we don't have much time to talk about it. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kerkWw1NVT8&t=304.0s)]
*  It wasn't in the air very long. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kerkWw1NVT8&t=307.0s)]
*  787 Dreamliner, it's a Boeing plane. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kerkWw1NVT8&t=308.0s)]
*  Now, when you buy a Boeing plane, whether you're Delta, United, Air France, [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kerkWw1NVT8&t=312.0s)]
*  when does it become the responsibility? [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kerkWw1NVT8&t=318.0s)]
*  When do these different airlines put their stamp on that plane? [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kerkWw1NVT8&t=320.0s)]
*  So I'm Boeing and I sell it to you, but it's up to Air India to maintain it, number one, [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kerkWw1NVT8&t=325.0s)]
*  and maybe some different countries or different airlines decide to put their own emblem, [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kerkWw1NVT8&t=330.0s)]
*  their own rules and regulations to it, correct? [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kerkWw1NVT8&t=337.0s)]
*  That's true, but they're all approved. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kerkWw1NVT8&t=342.0s)]
*  The Indian air transportation system is a wild west marketing wise, [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kerkWw1NVT8&t=344.0s)]
*  but in terms of safety, that's always been there. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kerkWw1NVT8&t=349.0s)]
*  But the airlines imprint on that airplane is basically when they order the thing [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kerkWw1NVT8&t=352.0s)]
*  because they're working with Boeing on how to spec it out. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kerkWw1NVT8&t=356.0s)]
*  Air India has been with this airplane probably since they signed the order document. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kerkWw1NVT8&t=359.0s)]
*  So from that perspective, I don't think we have to look at maybe India being sloppy. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kerkWw1NVT8&t=364.0s)]
*  As a matter of fact, India is not sloppy. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kerkWw1NVT8&t=368.0s)]
*  So Mike, what happens next in the investigation? [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kerkWw1NVT8&t=371.0s)]
*  Well, right now, it's going to be happening. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kerkWw1NVT8&t=374.0s)]
*  There's a lot of talk like this, what happened, what happened, but under the scenes, [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kerkWw1NVT8&t=376.0s)]
*  I'm pretty sure the US NTSB will get involved. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kerkWw1NVT8&t=379.0s)]
*  Those people are magicians, can find out all kinds of things. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kerkWw1NVT8&t=382.0s)]
*  And let's remember, it wasn't in the air very long. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kerkWw1NVT8&t=386.0s)]
*  They say there was a Mayday call, which I would find surprising on takeoff like that, [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kerkWw1NVT8&t=388.0s)]
*  but maybe there was. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kerkWw1NVT8&t=393.0s)]
*  And you've got cockpit voice recorders, [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kerkWw1NVT8&t=394.0s)]
*  and you've got other recorder documents on- or machinery on-side that airplane. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kerkWw1NVT8&t=397.0s)]
*  We're going to know fairly soon, but they're not going to announce it to you and I [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kerkWw1NVT8&t=401.0s)]
*  until they're really sure about it. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kerkWw1NVT8&t=405.0s)]
*  But I'm confident the NTSB is on an airplane right now, heading there. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kerkWw1NVT8&t=406.0s)]
*  Mike, can you explain, when you just said that there's some reports of there was a Mayday call, [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kerkWw1NVT8&t=410.0s)]
*  and you said you would find that strange, why would you find that strange? [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kerkWw1NVT8&t=415.0s)]
*  Because at that point in time, you know, takeoff, you know, the airplane- [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kerkWw1NVT8&t=420.0s)]
*  the pilots have their hands full of airplane on any takeoff like that. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kerkWw1NVT8&t=423.0s)]
*  And, you know, to make a Mayday call, it's possible, no question about it. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kerkWw1NVT8&t=427.0s)]
*  But, you know, they were probably busy with a whole lot of other things. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kerkWw1NVT8&t=432.0s)]
*  They want to figure out what is wrong with this airplane. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kerkWw1NVT8&t=434.0s)]
*  Speculation only, but we'll see what happens. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kerkWw1NVT8&t=436.0s)]
*  But if you're in India and you take off and you go down, [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kerkWw1NVT8&t=440.0s)]
*  again, someone is going to be on the ground and running up. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kerkWw1NVT8&t=443.0s)]
*  So this is my worry being ever since 9-11. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kerkWw1NVT8&t=445.0s)]
*  If you want to find out if this was terrorism, I don't care if it's 10% or 90%, [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kerkWw1NVT8&t=449.0s)]
*  that's where we need global communication, right? [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kerkWw1NVT8&t=455.0s)]
*  Because a lot of times, if these are plans and plots, we need to be aware of what's happening. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kerkWw1NVT8&t=459.0s)]
*  And we saw, we know famously what went down on Flight 93 [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kerkWw1NVT8&t=464.0s)]
*  and how they got a tip off what would happen with Flight 11 and other things. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kerkWw1NVT8&t=468.0s)]
*  So can you give us an idea where the communication lies with other countries, other towers, other airports? [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kerkWw1NVT8&t=472.0s)]
*  Mike, do we have you? [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kerkWw1NVT8&t=485.0s)]
*  Yeah, sounds like he froze. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kerkWw1NVT8&t=488.0s)]
*  I'm wondering how old these planes are. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kerkWw1NVT8&t=489.0s)]
*  When we get on a plane, how old are they? [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kerkWw1NVT8&t=491.0s)]
*  Are they decades old? [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kerkWw1NVT8&t=494.0s)]
*  And how often do they have to go in maintenance, [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kerkWw1NVT8&t=495.0s)]
*  where they take all the parts out and rebuild the plane essentially? [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kerkWw1NVT8&t=498.0s)]
*  My next question that I was going to ask Mike was, [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kerkWw1NVT8&t=501.0s)]
*  I know, and we hear this when we're always on a plane, [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kerkWw1NVT8&t=503.0s)]
*  you hear them doing the safety checks going through. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kerkWw1NVT8&t=507.0s)]
*  What are they looking for when it comes to power or anything like that? [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kerkWw1NVT8&t=510.0s)]
*  But it sounds like, from Mike, that it could be a thousand different issues, even if it's just power alone. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kerkWw1NVT8&t=514.0s)]
*  So we're still getting information this morning. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kerkWw1NVT8&t=521.0s)]
*  We're working our sources to try to see. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kerkWw1NVT8&t=524.0s)]
*  These pictures on the ground are extremely vividing [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kerkWw1NVT8&t=526.0s)]
*  as we look at the situation. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kerkWw1NVT8&t=529.0s)]
*  All right. So it crashed near the airport in India. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kerkWw1NVT8&t=532.0s)]
*  It had just taken off. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kerkWw1NVT8&t=536.0s)]
*  Brian said it was at 625 feet. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kerkWw1NVT8&t=537.0s)]
*  And you know, you can start using the Internet when you're in the air at 10,000. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kerkWw1NVT8&t=539.0s)]
*  The goal is 30,000. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kerkWw1NVT8&t=543.0s)]
*  So it was taking off and then heading to the UK. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kerkWw1NVT8&t=545.0s)]
*  We're not sure about who was on board, if most of those passengers were from India, [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kerkWw1NVT8&t=548.0s)]
*  and if there were any fatalities. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kerkWw1NVT8&t=553.0s)]
*  But you heard our guests say that he was watching some video, [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kerkWw1NVT8&t=555.0s)]
*  and it looks like there were some survivors. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kerkWw1NVT8&t=557.0s)]
*  Yeah, 1 10 in the afternoon, their time 3 40 in the morning Eastern time. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kerkWw1NVT8&t=559.0s)]
*  So we'll stay on top of this with 242 people aboard. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kerkWw1NVT8&t=563.0s)]
*  And then you wonder how many people go into work or in their apartment building were shocked to hear the noise. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kerkWw1NVT8&t=566.0s)]
*  But you would think in the afternoon there'll be less people in dwellings. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kerkWw1NVT8&t=571.0s)]
*  But we'll find out. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kerkWw1NVT8&t=574.0s)]
*  I mean, we've got the story on the ground and the story in the air and the story with the plane. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kerkWw1NVT8&t=575.0s)]
*  That building right there, it looks like it was under construction. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kerkWw1NVT8&t=579.0s)]
*  Or does it just look like that because it caught on fire? [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kerkWw1NVT8&t=582.0s)]
*  Yeah, we just found out no Americans aboard the plane. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kerkWw1NVT8&t=585.0s)]
*  We're going to be following it all morning long as we get more information. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kerkWw1NVT8&t=588.0s)]
