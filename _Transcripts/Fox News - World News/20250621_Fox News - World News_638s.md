# Trump announces successful US strike on 3 Iranian nuclear sites
**Fox News - World News:** [June 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LVqf4fQ-Atw)
*  Do we have Jennifer Griffin at the Pentagon? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LVqf4fQ-Atw&t=0.0s)]
*  Can we get her up and we can talk through what we're hearing from military sources? [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LVqf4fQ-Atw&t=2.94s)]
*  Yes, please put me— [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LVqf4fQ-Atw&t=8.36s)]
*  Jennifer Griffin is live at the Pentagon. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LVqf4fQ-Atw&t=10.040000000000001s)]
*  Let's bring Jennifer in. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LVqf4fQ-Atw&t=12.44s)]
*  Jennifer, we're just getting word, obviously, with the president's announcement, what [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LVqf4fQ-Atw&t=14.44s)]
*  this looks like. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LVqf4fQ-Atw&t=19.44s)]
*  Well, Brett, we knew that there was something afoot this morning when we woke and heard [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LVqf4fQ-Atw&t=20.44s)]
*  six B-2 bombers that had been seen leaving Whiteman Air Force Base last night at midnight. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LVqf4fQ-Atw&t=26.28s)]
*  And so those planes, we were told, were heading towards Guam. Now, Guam would have been an [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LVqf4fQ-Atw&t=35.0s)]
*  18-hour flight into Iran, so it is likely that it was a different set of B-2 bombers [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LVqf4fQ-Atw&t=39.56s)]
*  that were used to bomb the sites, the three sites that the president mentioned tonight [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LVqf4fQ-Atw&t=46.56s)]
*  and then another underground facility. Remember, before FORDO was built in 2006, Natanz had [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LVqf4fQ-Atw&t=81.16s)]
*  been the main enrichment site. It was also built underground. Israeli jets had been targeting [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LVqf4fQ-Atw&t=87.36s)]
*  it in the last week, but they had not been able to penetrate underground. So those U.S. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LVqf4fQ-Atw&t=93.52s)]
*  B-2 bombers which flew out of Whiteman Air Force Base in Missouri, they would have taken [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LVqf4fQ-Atw&t=100.52s)]
*  out that underground facility. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LVqf4fQ-Atw&t=107.92s)]
*  Natanz is interesting. You'll remember, Brett, it was the site of the Stuxnet virus, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LVqf4fQ-Atw&t=109.72s)]
*  the cyberattack on those centrifuges years ago. But again, it was back up and running. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LVqf4fQ-Atw&t=114.47999999999999s)]
*  And what is surprising, I think, tonight is that the president announced that it was not [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LVqf4fQ-Atw&t=121.47999999999999s)]
*  one site but three underground sites and sites inside Iran's nuclear program that were [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LVqf4fQ-Atw&t=126.0s)]
*  struck by the U.S. Air Force tonight. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LVqf4fQ-Atw&t=134.0s)]
*  Yeah, and it is something. We'll go back to that Truth Social and eventually a control [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LVqf4fQ-Atw&t=137.48s)]
*  room if we can put it up there just so that everybody can see it on the screen. The fact [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LVqf4fQ-Atw&t=142.88s)]
*  that this, first of all, this announcement comes from Truth Social. This is a president [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LVqf4fQ-Atw&t=147.68s)]
*  who has put out a lot of announcements, big announcements, through Truth Social, and this [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LVqf4fQ-Atw&t=152.92000000000002s)]
*  is the biggest of them, probably his biggest decision. The completed, the very successful [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LVqf4fQ-Atw&t=159.28s)]
*  attack on three nuclear sites, as you said, Fordow, Natanz and Esfahan, getting very specific [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LVqf4fQ-Atw&t=165.84s)]
*  there. And the payload, he says a full payload of bombs dropped on the primary site, Fordow. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LVqf4fQ-Atw&t=173.2s)]
*  That suggests, Jennifer, as we had been saying for many days, that they may have made several [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LVqf4fQ-Atw&t=180.36s)]
*  passes at Fordow considering that the experts were saying that just one probably wouldn't [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LVqf4fQ-Atw&t=185.26s)]
*  have gotten to the heart of that facility. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LVqf4fQ-Atw&t=193.01999999999998s)]
*  Well, remember, Brett, we've been reporting in recent days that Fordow is interesting [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LVqf4fQ-Atw&t=196.54s)]
*  because it has two entrance points. And we were told by experts who have followed the [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LVqf4fQ-Atw&t=201.29999999999998s)]
*  planning for this kind of strike for a long time that it would take at least two bombs [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LVqf4fQ-Atw&t=207.94s)]
*  from the B-2s, those MOPs, the Massive Ordnance Penetrators. Those are 30,000 pound bombs, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LVqf4fQ-Atw&t=214.17999999999998s)]
*  and each B-2 can carry two of them. Usually the way it works is that one of the MOP, 30,000 [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LVqf4fQ-Atw&t=220.17999999999998s)]
*  pound bunker busters, is dropped. It goes into a hole that's about a radius of about [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LVqf4fQ-Atw&t=227.45999999999998s)]
*  25 feet, I'm told. And then the second bomb is dropped in the same hole. And so at first [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LVqf4fQ-Atw&t=232.78s)]
*  that 30,000 pound bunker buster will go down about 200 feet, explode, and then make way [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LVqf4fQ-Atw&t=240.3s)]
*  for the second bomb, which falls into that exact 25 foot radius hole. And, of course, [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LVqf4fQ-Atw&t=246.48s)]
*  people are calling right now, so just a moment. And so what's interesting about it, Brett, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LVqf4fQ-Atw&t=254.82s)]
*  is that you would have had to have at least two B-2s, but I believe that it was likely [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LVqf4fQ-Atw&t=261.38s)]
*  a package of six B-2s that would be flying. They each had two MOP, Massive Ordnance Penetrators, [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LVqf4fQ-Atw&t=267.3s)]
*  on board at the time, and they would have hit both those entrances at Fordow. The president [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LVqf4fQ-Atw&t=274.94s)]
*  saying that the complete package was struck, that is significant, because that means, as [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LVqf4fQ-Atw&t=280.74s)]
*  you said, that it would probably be multiple passes and multiple bombs dropped there. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LVqf4fQ-Atw&t=287.09999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, so as we get ready, remember, they are, let's see, seven hours ahead, and this would [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LVqf4fQ-Atw&t=292.58000000000004s)]
*  have been the window to pull this off. The president, again, saying that it was very [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LVqf4fQ-Atw&t=300.62s)]
*  successful in three different sites. We should point out that the Israelis have worked, really, [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LVqf4fQ-Atw&t=305.94s)]
*  as we've been reporting over the last week plus, very hard to take out the air defenses [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LVqf4fQ-Atw&t=312.54s)]
*  of Iran. Already, in a first wave of runs back in October, the Israeli military and [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LVqf4fQ-Atw&t=318.28s)]
*  air force took out a lot of those surface-to-air missiles. Now, with this latest bombing run [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LVqf4fQ-Atw&t=326.4s)]
*  over the past few days, Jennifer, they have essentially eliminated it. And to talk to [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LVqf4fQ-Atw&t=333.82s)]
*  Israeli officials, they said they have control of the skies, really a full path to Tehran, [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LVqf4fQ-Atw&t=338.84s)]
*  and they've been taking out sites and targets at their will, they suggested. And this led [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LVqf4fQ-Atw&t=346.15999999999997s)]
*  the way for this bombing run tonight. Well, the Israeli air force has just been unbelievable [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LVqf4fQ-Atw&t=352.88s)]
*  in terms of their success. Since June 12th, they have been carrying out nonstop runs and [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LVqf4fQ-Atw&t=358.64s)]
*  strikes against Iranian targets, including the first night, 14 Iranian nuclear scientists [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LVqf4fQ-Atw&t=365.08s)]
*  who were taken off the battlefield, as well as about 50 top generals in the Iranian military, [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LVqf4fQ-Atw&t=372.28s)]
*  including the head of their air force, their ballistic missiles, their drone capabilities, [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LVqf4fQ-Atw&t=379.96s)]
*  their IRGC, the Revolutionary Guard Corps. So they have really had incredible success [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LVqf4fQ-Atw&t=386.03999999999996s)]
*  in terms of all of the spots and all of the above-ground spots that an F-16 or an F-35 [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LVqf4fQ-Atw&t=392.5s)]
*  could take out. They said a few days ago that they had air superiority. That then opens [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LVqf4fQ-Atw&t=399.98s)]
*  the way for the—and what that means is that they've taken out most of the air defense [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LVqf4fQ-Atw&t=404.98s)]
*  systems on the ground so that then their planes could really fly with impunity. And that also [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LVqf4fQ-Atw&t=410.7s)]
*  opened the way for those very, very, you know, the stealth bombers, the B-2 bombers, which [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LVqf4fQ-Atw&t=416.26s)]
*  also are escorted, we're told, by F-22s and F-16s, and also the EA-18 Growlers. They [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LVqf4fQ-Atw&t=424.26s)]
*  play a very significant role. That's an electronic warfare jammer that flies with [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LVqf4fQ-Atw&t=431.26s)]
*  the B-2. And remember that second aircraft carrier, the USS Nimitz, had just gotten into [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LVqf4fQ-Atw&t=436.86s)]
*  the region earlier today. You had the USS Vinson. Those EA-18 Growlers are on board [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LVqf4fQ-Atw&t=442.62s)]
*  those aircraft carriers. They are absolutely essential for the B-2 to fly over Iran, even [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LVqf4fQ-Atw&t=449.14s)]
*  though the Israelis had air superiority over the country. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LVqf4fQ-Atw&t=455.02s)]
*  Jennifer, stand by if you would. Do I have Greg Palkot in Tel Aviv control room? Is he [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LVqf4fQ-Atw&t=458.21999999999997s)]
*  up and running? Okay. All right. We're going to get him up and running. Interestingly [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LVqf4fQ-Atw&t=466.34s)]
*  enough, Jen, we have seen a lot of Israeli missiles and drones coming in, really night [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LVqf4fQ-Atw&t=472.66s)]
*  after night, into Israel. This night has not seen that much of that. There have been a [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LVqf4fQ-Atw&t=479.74s)]
*  few warnings, but not the same volley that we've heard in recent days. In addition [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LVqf4fQ-Atw&t=487.06s)]
*  to taking out the surface-air missiles and clearing the way for the ability to take out [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LVqf4fQ-Atw&t=493.06s)]
*  targets inside Iran, they've also really managed to take out a lot of missile sites [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LVqf4fQ-Atw&t=497.98s)]
*  and places that have been threats for missiles fired from Iran. There is a sense even that [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LVqf4fQ-Atw&t=504.54s)]
*  they were taking out the trucks that moved the missiles, as precise as the Israeli military [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LVqf4fQ-Atw&t=511.74s)]
*  targeting has been. You've been reporting on that over the last few days. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LVqf4fQ-Atw&t=518.42s)]
*  It's really extraordinary because when this started, the Israelis estimated that the Iranians [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LVqf4fQ-Atw&t=523.6600000000001s)]
*  had about 100 mobile ballistic missile launchers. They have taken out, they think, about 55% [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LVqf4fQ-Atw&t=531.98s)]
*  of any of the missile launchers that the Iranians have access to now. The Iranians have blown [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LVqf4fQ-Atw&t=540.62s)]
*  through quite a bit of their missile stockpile. They had about, I think, about a hundred missiles [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LVqf4fQ-Atw&t=545.5s)]
*  and about 3,000 ballistic missiles when this started, maybe between 1,000 to 2,000 that [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LVqf4fQ-Atw&t=552.7s)]
*  could reach Israel. I think that they fired about 500. Most importantly, the IDF and the [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LVqf4fQ-Atw&t=558.38s)]
*  Israeli Air Force have been able to take out, as you mentioned, almost half of the missile [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LVqf4fQ-Atw&t=565.7s)]
*  launchers. Each night, we've seen fewer and fewer ballistic missiles being fired at Israel. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LVqf4fQ-Atw&t=571.82s)]
*  All of the drones that have been fired at Israel have been taken out. We understand [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LVqf4fQ-Atw&t=578.58s)]
*  that Israeli pilots, along with American fighter pilots, have been taking down those drones [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LVqf4fQ-Atw&t=582.1800000000001s)]
*  each night. American pilots have been helping, as well as along with those U.S. Navy destroyers. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LVqf4fQ-Atw&t=587.58s)]
*  There are five U.S. Navy destroyers in the eastern Med off the coast of Israel who have [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LVqf4fQ-Atw&t=594.0600000000001s)]
*  been using their Aegis defense systems to shoot down ballistic missiles over Israel. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LVqf4fQ-Atw&t=598.74s)]
*  The U.S. has been very involved, along with U.S. soldiers who are on the ground. There [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LVqf4fQ-Atw&t=604.7s)]
*  are about 300 U.S. soldiers that are working at, who are manning the THAAD and the Patriot [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LVqf4fQ-Atw&t=608.6600000000001s)]
*  PAK-3 missiles that are defending cities within Israel, and those are operated by U.S. soldiers, [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LVqf4fQ-Atw&t=616.58s)]
*  about a hundred soldiers per THAAD missile. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LVqf4fQ-Atw&t=622.9000000000001s)]
