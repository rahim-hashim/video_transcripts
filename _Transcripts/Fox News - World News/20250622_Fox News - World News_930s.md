# Bret Baier: This is COMPLETELY off the table
**Fox News - World News:** [June 22, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUE6dgbMFRI)
*  Alright, you've been watching in the press conference of the Pentagon there. We have now learned the operation named Midnight Hammer [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUE6dgbMFRI&t=0.0s)]
*  remarkable details in the operation as the world watched B2 stealth bombers fly west towards Hawaii and Guam [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUE6dgbMFRI&t=7.28s)]
*  7b2 bombers two crew members each refueling flying east [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUE6dgbMFRI&t=15.040000000000001s)]
*  delivering their targets hitting their targets 14 total bombs under total stealth [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUE6dgbMFRI&t=20.400000000000002s)]
*  Not a single shot fired says joint [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUE6dgbMFRI&t=26.759999999999998s)]
*  Chairman's chief chairman of the Joint Chiefs Dan Kain seeing that no missiles were launched. No shots fired at our mission [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUE6dgbMFRI&t=30.04s)]
*  No Iranian planes got airborne. They simply didn't see it [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUE6dgbMFRI&t=37.22s)]
*  I want to bring back the special report anchor and our executive editor Brett bear Brett [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUE6dgbMFRI&t=42.5s)]
*  It's remarkable these details to learn that we literally got in and out without really being detected [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUE6dgbMFRI&t=47.72s)]
*  Hit all targets it just strikes you at really the dominance we heard from [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUE6dgbMFRI&t=54.92s)]
*  Secretary Hicks as the unmatched capability of the American military [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUE6dgbMFRI&t=61.2s)]
*  But boy, you really got to see it here and likely sending a message to those that would do us harm [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUE6dgbMFRI&t=64.56s)]
*  Definitely this is exactly what we were hoping for some details as you mentioned seven B2 bombers [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUE6dgbMFRI&t=72.32s)]
*  This is the largest B2 mission ever in the history of the US dropping [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUE6dgbMFRI&t=78.92s)]
*  14 of these massive ordinance penetrator bombs. Remember those are [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUE6dgbMFRI&t=83.9s)]
*  30,000-pound each the gbu-57 that's [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUE6dgbMFRI&t=89.7s)]
*  420,000 pounds of ordinance [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUE6dgbMFRI&t=94.3s)]
*  Just in the B2 bombers dropping on those three nuclear sites [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUE6dgbMFRI&t=96.7s)]
*  Then you add some 30 plus tomahawk missiles from US submarines. You've got 75 [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUE6dgbMFRI&t=100.22s)]
*  precision guided bombs [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUE6dgbMFRI&t=106.86s)]
*  Falling on these nuclear sites essentially the message was we're not at war with Iran [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUE6dgbMFRI&t=108.58s)]
*  We're at war with Iran's nuclear program and there is time for Iran to get back to the table and the president seeks peace [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUE6dgbMFRI&t=113.94s)]
*  But as we talked about before we came to this press conference and Rachel you mentioned the deception [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUE6dgbMFRI&t=120.9s)]
*  and the the effort to [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUE6dgbMFRI&t=126.22s)]
*  Really tighten down on operational security you heard a little bit about that [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUE6dgbMFRI&t=129.22s)]
*  Not only decoy planes going different places also [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUE6dgbMFRI&t=133.66s)]
*  Ghost planes on radars as well as the B2s going to the west while others flew from Whiteman Air Base [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUE6dgbMFRI&t=137.46s)]
*  Air Force Base in Missouri [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUE6dgbMFRI&t=144.66s)]
*  They are not saying exactly what the battle damage assessment is rightfully [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUE6dgbMFRI&t=147.38s)]
*  So they're waiting for some more details on the ground, but that's really the big question. Where does Iran's nuclear [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUE6dgbMFRI&t=151.94s)]
*  Program stand tonight it's our today and this sounds like it is pretty devastated and decimated [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUE6dgbMFRI&t=158.45999999999998s)]
*  Brett do you have any sense as to how they quote unquote complete a BDA a battle damage assessment because you know at this point [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUE6dgbMFRI&t=165.5s)]
*  I'm gonna go out on a limb and say it's unlikely that the Iranians are gonna welcome in inspectors to look at what's left [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUE6dgbMFRI&t=173.78s)]
*  Yeah, the Israelis are on the ground. They're on the ground in significant numbers [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUE6dgbMFRI&t=179.82s)]
*  We don't know exactly how where when [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUE6dgbMFRI&t=184.89999999999998s)]
*  but they will provide some battle damage assessment from the ground and then obviously our satellites and [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUE6dgbMFRI&t=187.89999999999998s)]
*  And what we have in the air can give us decent pictures [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUE6dgbMFRI&t=194.17999999999998s)]
*  I think the question about the nuclear material is what the chairman of the Joint Chiefs was asked and said he's gonna need more time [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUE6dgbMFRI&t=198.57999999999998s)]
*  I was struck by you know, this isn't about regime change. This is very precision [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUE6dgbMFRI&t=205.45999999999998s)]
*  We talked about that going in that was the message from the president last night [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUE6dgbMFRI&t=210.2s)]
*  And it is one in which the Iranian leadership has to make a decision now [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUE6dgbMFRI&t=214.54s)]
*  But if there is an attack on a US facility US people US soldiers US bases [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUE6dgbMFRI&t=219.14s)]
*  All bets are off [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUE6dgbMFRI&t=227.5s)]
*  Brett they were asked [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUE6dgbMFRI&t=228.89999999999998s)]
*  Pete Hexeth was that in secretary Hexeth was asked if the administration is in direct contact with Iran [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUE6dgbMFRI&t=230.5s)]
*  Of course, he said yes public and private measures, but something I've he said he said they know exactly what steps they need to take [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUE6dgbMFRI&t=235.33999999999997s)]
*  For peace didn't say what those steps are. What do you think those steps are? [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUE6dgbMFRI&t=243.54000000000002s)]
*  Well to give up enrichment has been one of the bars to to start and [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUE6dgbMFRI&t=249.1s)]
*  And I think there's a long list that they've been talking about with the Europeans [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUE6dgbMFRI&t=254.46s)]
*  That has circulated around that the Iranians turned their back on in Geneva [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUE6dgbMFRI&t=259.78000000000003s)]
*  they may [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUE6dgbMFRI&t=264.66s)]
*  Turn their back the other way go back to the table considering what they just saw last night [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUE6dgbMFRI&t=266.14s)]
*  But we'll see the [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUE6dgbMFRI&t=271.62s)]
*  The question really is the Iranian leadership and how when we hear from them so far [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUE6dgbMFRI&t=273.62s)]
*  It's been a lot of bluster online a lot of social media saying, you know [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUE6dgbMFRI&t=280.66s)]
*  The response is yet to come it is going to be devastating for Israel in the US [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUE6dgbMFRI&t=284.98s)]
*  Clearly we'll see and we mentioned the tentacles of [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUE6dgbMFRI&t=291.7s)]
*  Terrorist cells that we really have to be careful of yeah [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUE6dgbMFRI&t=295.66s)]
*  Yeah, you know Brett I was really also struck by Pete Hegseth in particular secretary Hegseth [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUE6dgbMFRI&t=298.46s)]
*  Talking about the desire for peace the desire to make sure that this does not go [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUE6dgbMFRI&t=303.9s)]
*  Beyond these strikes that Donald Trump the president wants them at the negotiating table to end this that was very encouraging to somebody [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUE6dgbMFRI&t=308.42s)]
*  Like me was very concerned about this expanding into regime change that felt good on the other hand. There's a lot of tripwires here [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUE6dgbMFRI&t=315.82s)]
*  We've got the bases that are there that are are somewhat vulnerable [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUE6dgbMFRI&t=323.82s)]
*  Despite the threats from the US government saying don't touch our men. We also have the Houthis who have now torn up their [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUE6dgbMFRI&t=328.21999999999997s)]
*  Ceasefire agreements so there could be something that happens to our ships and in the Red Sea [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUE6dgbMFRI&t=335.34s)]
*  And then of course what I'm most concerned about is the fact that we've had four years of Joe Biden's open border and these sleeper cells [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUE6dgbMFRI&t=340.21999999999997s)]
*  so talk to me about how [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUE6dgbMFRI&t=347.5s)]
*  President Trump homeland security Pete Hegseth everybody involved is working to [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUE6dgbMFRI&t=350.18s)]
*  Mitigate those very real threats on the homeland included [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUE6dgbMFRI&t=356.53999999999996s)]
*  To make sure this doesn't expand into a greater war because as you know Brett [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUE6dgbMFRI&t=361.82s)]
*  There's a lot of political implications here by the way not hearing much about the big beautiful bill [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUE6dgbMFRI&t=365.97999999999996s)]
*  That was the number one issue until israel striked [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUE6dgbMFRI&t=370.14s)]
*  But also the fact that you know, this is not a left right issue [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUE6dgbMFRI&t=373.74s)]
*  There are a lot of people in the MAGA base who voted for Donald Trump because they wanted peace and really hope that this leads to peace [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUE6dgbMFRI&t=377.09999999999997s)]
*  So I know i'm throwing a lot out there, but talk to me about the politics around this considering all of those things. Yeah [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUE6dgbMFRI&t=384.14s)]
*  Well, first of all the threat of the terrorist reach of the iranian regime which has been doing it for decades [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUE6dgbMFRI&t=391.5s)]
*  Through proxies doing some very bad things [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUE6dgbMFRI&t=398.21999999999997s)]
*  You know the president came to the conclusion that those tentacles those terrorist reach elements [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUE6dgbMFRI&t=402.7s)]
*  With a nuclear weapon or some nuclear [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUE6dgbMFRI&t=409.09999999999997s)]
*  Even a dirty bomb [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUE6dgbMFRI&t=413.9s)]
*  Is exponentially more of a threat to the us and to our allies and decided it was time to act [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUE6dgbMFRI&t=415.5s)]
*  If you're worried about you know, the retaliation imagine the retaliation with iran with a nuclear bomb [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUE6dgbMFRI&t=422.3s)]
*  Let's just put that aside. There is a higher state of alert. The fbi the homeland security [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUE6dgbMFRI&t=428.78s)]
*  Individual cities have been on higher states of alert since this all happened [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUE6dgbMFRI&t=435.74s)]
*  At the over the past week or so, but now they'll be even more so [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUE6dgbMFRI&t=441.5s)]
*  And the amount of strength military strength we have in the the region [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUE6dgbMFRI&t=446.3s)]
*  Suggests they're going to do a lot to try to protect those bases directly [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUE6dgbMFRI&t=451.58s)]
*  Beyond what is normally done [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUE6dgbMFRI&t=456.86s)]
*  As for the politics of this, you know, you're right. There is no left and right there are [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUE6dgbMFRI&t=459.18s)]
*  Republicans who say it's not constitutional who say that there should be congress should weigh in [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUE6dgbMFRI&t=464.36s)]
*  However, you have democrats who say this is the right move and it protects the homeland [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUE6dgbMFRI&t=471.26s)]
*  I think there's going to be a lot of vocal voices [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUE6dgbMFRI&t=477.42s)]
*  The question is next steps and right now the president's signaling that this is a very limited operation [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUE6dgbMFRI&t=480.94s)]
*  Unless iran acts to get us in [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUE6dgbMFRI&t=487.41999999999996s)]
*  Israel is not going to convince the u.s. To do anything more than we're saying we're going to do [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUE6dgbMFRI&t=490.94s)]
*  And I think that boots on the ground are completely off the table, you know brett [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUE6dgbMFRI&t=496.78s)]
*  We were just showing our our viewers the photos that the white house put out from the situation room [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUE6dgbMFRI&t=500.54s)]
*  And had I been in that pentagon press briefing? I think my question would have been to chairman cain [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUE6dgbMFRI&t=506.06s)]
*  What was behind what's the story behind his? [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUE6dgbMFRI&t=512.78s)]
*  Texas looked like texas hook'em horns in a downward position. He seemed to be like literally [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUE6dgbMFRI&t=516.38s)]
*  Physically showing us some sort of operational explaining it and you know, I think we pull that one up here [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUE6dgbMFRI&t=521.42s)]
*  And you'll see it in just a second [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUE6dgbMFRI&t=527.8199999999999s)]
*  But what's interesting brett is, you know when you were talking about the proxies has blah hasn't fired a single shot [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUE6dgbMFRI&t=529.5s)]
*  Hamas is on its back the houthis very very [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUE6dgbMFRI&t=536.06s)]
*  neutralized you you wonder if they're taking in some of this and [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUE6dgbMFRI&t=540.52s)]
*  Listening perhaps particularly there's the shot that one right there [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUE6dgbMFRI&t=546.04s)]
*  He's talking about an operation which has once again shown [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUE6dgbMFRI&t=549.66s)]
*  American dominance globally at a time when there wasn't the deterrent deterrence of the last administration now [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUE6dgbMFRI&t=553.9s)]
*  Obviously american deterrence appears to be back. You've got to think the proxies are paying very close attention to this [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUE6dgbMFRI&t=561.5799999999999s)]
*  Yeah, definitely. It looks to me like there's two bunker buster bombs coming out of two b2s heading towards fordo [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUE6dgbMFRI&t=568.6999999999999s)]
*  But i'm just guessing there [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUE6dgbMFRI&t=576.22s)]
*  And by the way as far as asking those questions in the briefing it does bring me back to those days of being in [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUE6dgbMFRI&t=578.5400000000001s)]
*  That front row and there are still some guys there that are there from the time that I was there [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUE6dgbMFRI&t=583.74s)]
*  They're a little bit grayer [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUE6dgbMFRI&t=587.98s)]
*  But they are very knowledgeable about the u.s military as they ask those questions [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUE6dgbMFRI&t=589.58s)]
*  I I think yeah the the you have to watch [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUE6dgbMFRI&t=593.9s)]
*  Not only the iranian leadership [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUE6dgbMFRI&t=597.74s)]
*  But what you hear from hesbala which by the way so far has been very quiet [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUE6dgbMFRI&t=599.82s)]
*  Since the pager walkie talkie attack by israel [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUE6dgbMFRI&t=603.82s)]
*  Their leadership hasn't piped up at all hamas. There are really not a lot of leaders. They're they're in hiding [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUE6dgbMFRI&t=607.26s)]
*  And um and the hutis in yemen have really taken it on the chin their leadership [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUE6dgbMFRI&t=613.58s)]
*  Just taken out the israelis took out a meeting just last week [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUE6dgbMFRI&t=619.1s)]
*  Of of the huti leadership, so we'll see [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUE6dgbMFRI&t=624.38s)]
*  They're they're not impotent. They have a response iran does [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUE6dgbMFRI&t=627.58s)]
*  And that's what the u.s has to watch very closely brett to build on griff's question here beyond the rebel groups [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUE6dgbMFRI&t=632.0600000000001s)]
*  There was one line in there [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUE6dgbMFRI&t=639.5s)]
*  Pete hexeth said it exactly like this showing the world that american deterrence is back riff alluded to that [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUE6dgbMFRI&t=641.26s)]
*  I hear that and I think beyond those rebel groups to the question [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUE6dgbMFRI&t=647.5s)]
*  I asked you before we got into the press conference to me that sending a message to russia that sending a message to north korea [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUE6dgbMFRI&t=650.62s)]
*  and just like [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUE6dgbMFRI&t=656.7s)]
*  firing [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUE6dgbMFRI&t=658.12s)]
*  Missiles at syria during dessert this sends a message to xi jin ping that we mean business [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUE6dgbMFRI&t=659.34s)]
*  We are going to use our might to deter and you better watch out and not do something stupid. Was that your takeaway? [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUE6dgbMFRI&t=665.58s)]
*  100 it reestablishes deterrence for the u.s a president that is willing to pull the trigger despite political wins [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUE6dgbMFRI&t=672.4399999999999s)]
*  In his own party that perhaps are pushing him not to [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUE6dgbMFRI&t=680.7s)]
*  He is willing to act on his the intelligence he gets as well as his gut instinct [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUE6dgbMFRI&t=684.22s)]
*  In his mind to protect the united states [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUE6dgbMFRI&t=691.5s)]
*  That is his definition of america first and that sends a message not just to iran but to russia and to china as they encircle taiwan [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUE6dgbMFRI&t=694.62s)]
*  It sends a message that the u.s [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUE6dgbMFRI&t=703.26s)]
*  Is willing to act with the best and biggest military in the world [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUE6dgbMFRI&t=706.3000000000001s)]
*  Do we want to get engaged around the world? No, can we afford to be in two wars at the same time? No [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUE6dgbMFRI&t=710.78s)]
*  But action [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUE6dgbMFRI&t=718.06s)]
*  And reaction to things that are happening. Clearly that was a signal around the world [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUE6dgbMFRI&t=719.98s)]
*  Brett, do we have a clear understanding of whose intel this was based on is it israeli intel? [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUE6dgbMFRI&t=725.26s)]
*  American intel. I know that a lot of americans are you know, they trust donald trump president trump [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUE6dgbMFRI&t=731.4s)]
*  They absolutely trust pete hexeth, but the intel apparatus that was in place before is still there and this is the intel [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUE6dgbMFRI&t=737.18s)]
*  Apparatus that you know told us that there was russia collusion and there was you know weapons of mass destruction. And so [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUE6dgbMFRI&t=745.0799999999999s)]
*  How can we as americans know that we're getting the best intel and that it's not biased? [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUE6dgbMFRI&t=751.9s)]
*  I totally agree with you asking those questions and and ahead of the iraq war [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUE6dgbMFRI&t=758.06s)]
*  You know, we asked a lot of questions and there were 17 and international intelligence agencies that told us that saddam hussein [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUE6dgbMFRI&t=762.94s)]
*  Had weapons of mass destruction [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUE6dgbMFRI&t=769.66s)]
*  Um, it wasn't the case [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUE6dgbMFRI&t=771.5s)]
*  So there are real questions at the end of that briefing you heard that reference to director of national intelligence tulsi gabbard's testimony on capitol hill in march [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUE6dgbMFRI&t=773.34s)]
*  In which she said they are moving forward with their nuclear [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUE6dgbMFRI&t=781.5s)]
*  As far as their material, however, the decision has not been made to move forward with a bomb between [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUE6dgbMFRI&t=785.98s)]
*  March and this action today the president said he's convinced [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUE6dgbMFRI&t=791.74s)]
*  That he's seen intelligence that suggests that they were moving forward and getting closer [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUE6dgbMFRI&t=797.18s)]
*  To the point where he thought it was imminent. That is what the israeli prime minister says [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUE6dgbMFRI&t=802.3s)]
*  And now tulsi gabbard and others have linked up saying that it was moving forward to the point where it was a threat [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUE6dgbMFRI&t=808.3s)]
*  You have to trust it until we see it [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUE6dgbMFRI&t=816.38s)]
*  But that is what they are saying publicly and answering that question [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUE6dgbMFRI&t=819.02s)]
*  Well, you know just adding to to rachel's question, which is really such an important question about that [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUE6dgbMFRI&t=823.02s)]
*  It does appear unlike iraq you referenced that the intelligence this time [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUE6dgbMFRI&t=828.54s)]
*  Is at least much clearer insofar as we had this may 31 report out of the iaea [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUE6dgbMFRI&t=833.66s)]
*  Which is the un's nuclear watchdog for the first time breaking in 20 years saying that iran was in breach [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUE6dgbMFRI&t=839.5s)]
*  Of nuclear non-proliferation treaty, uh enriching uranium up to 60 percent [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUE6dgbMFRI&t=847.1800000000001s)]
*  They say this brett they say quote the fact that iran is the only non-nuclear weapon state in the world that is producing and accumulating uranium [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUE6dgbMFRI&t=852.46s)]
*  Enriched to 60 remains a matter of serious concern. That's coming at the end [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUE6dgbMFRI&t=860.14s)]
*  Of may and it does track obviously we would assume with our intelligence [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUE6dgbMFRI&t=866.14s)]
*  Exactly. And so what they iaea essentially was saying was they are enriching past the point [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUE6dgbMFRI&t=871.82s)]
*  Of the civilian program they are enriching uranium. They have the material [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUE6dgbMFRI&t=877.1s)]
*  But they have not made the decision to move forward with a bomb [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUE6dgbMFRI&t=882.22s)]
*  So the iranians are saying we're not going to make a bomb yet. We're stockpiling this weapons-grade material [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUE6dgbMFRI&t=885.5s)]
*  and [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUE6dgbMFRI&t=892.94s)]
*  Tomorrow they could turn and say we want to make a bomb that was the imminent threat [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUE6dgbMFRI&t=893.74s)]
*  And the iaea was public on that [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUE6dgbMFRI&t=899.82s)]
*  I think there was more intelligence that suggested other things were happening as far as moving components around iran [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUE6dgbMFRI&t=901.82s)]
