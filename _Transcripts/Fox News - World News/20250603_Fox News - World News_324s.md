# AI models become defiant: 'BEYOND FRIGHTENING'
**Fox News - World News:** [June 03, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9WpHc7l2V8)
*  Wow, from film to real life, artificial intelligence models are now fighting for their own survival. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9WpHc7l2V8&t=0.0s)]
*  One open AI model rewrote its own code to avoid being shut down. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9WpHc7l2V8&t=7.8s)]
*  And another anthropic actually started, another one, anthropics started blackmailing the engineer. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9WpHc7l2V8&t=12.08s)]
*  Kurt the cyber guy joins us now. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9WpHc7l2V8&t=18.400000000000002s)]
*  Kurt, I read about this and my jaw dropped. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9WpHc7l2V8&t=21.2s)]
*  It actually started blackmailing the engineers who were suggesting shutting the AI down. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9WpHc7l2V8&t=25.16s)]
*  The AI was going after them. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9WpHc7l2V8&t=31.96s)]
*  That's frightening. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9WpHc7l2V8&t=33.76s)]
*  Beyond frightening. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9WpHc7l2V8&t=36.36s)]
*  Good morning to you, Rachel, not to ruin your day. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9WpHc7l2V8&t=37.56s)]
*  But this sort of Hollywood is becoming a reality if we don't do anything about it. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9WpHc7l2V8&t=39.96s)]
*  Hope at the end of what I'm about to tell you, though. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9WpHc7l2V8&t=44.16s)]
*  So get ready, though, to freak out about AI getting really out of control. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9WpHc7l2V8&t=46.44s)]
*  There's an AI keyword I want you to know about. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9WpHc7l2V8&t=50.24s)]
*  It's called alignment. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9WpHc7l2V8&t=53.04s)]
*  AI alignment is a science of ensuring that AI systems do what we intend them to do instead of something like you just heard. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9WpHc7l2V8&t=54.519999999999996s)]
*  Nonprofit AI research lab put alignment and disobedience to the test. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9WpHc7l2V8&t=61.92s)]
*  The results, as Rachel did a cursory look at, there are pretty astonishing. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9WpHc7l2V8&t=67.32s)]
*  Open AI models, a simple script was given that would shut off the AI model when triggered. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9WpHc7l2V8&t=71.92s)]
*  79 out of 100 of those trials, the AI edited the script so that the shutdown command would no longer work. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9WpHc7l2V8&t=77.8s)]
*  Another AI model from Anthropic that you talked about. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9WpHc7l2V8&t=85.8s)]
*  Further, 84 percent of those tests, the AI model tried to blackmail the lead engineer and not shutting down the system. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9WpHc7l2V8&t=89.0s)]
*  So it even left messages, by the way, to its future self about evading human control. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9WpHc7l2V8&t=97.32s)]
*  Now, so what do we do about it? [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9WpHc7l2V8&t=103.32s)]
*  Well, China could actually teach us a lesson. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9WpHc7l2V8&t=104.52s)]
*  Invested eighty two billion dollars into what's called controllable AI or getting alignment on this. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9WpHc7l2V8&t=107.36s)]
*  The U.S. needs its smartest minds working on this problem. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9WpHc7l2V8&t=114.11999999999999s)]
*  A.S.A.P. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9WpHc7l2V8&t=118.03999999999999s)]
*  Do you know what else they need? We need bioethicists. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9WpHc7l2V8&t=119.24s)]
*  We need people who can provide some morality around this technology, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9WpHc7l2V8&t=122.0s)]
*  because so many of the people who are developing this technology are secularists. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9WpHc7l2V8&t=127.52s)]
*  They're their goddess tech. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9WpHc7l2V8&t=132.44s)]
*  And so we need to have that involved, too. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9WpHc7l2V8&t=134.44s)]
*  And that speaks to this next topic, because AI we're learning could actually devastate the Earth's population down to the size of the UK by the year two thousand three hundred. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9WpHc7l2V8&t=137.04000000000002s)]
*  And the reason is because they're replacing jobs that humans did with AI and will lose our purpose. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9WpHc7l2V8&t=149.4s)]
*  Right. Yeah, I mean, there are a whole bunch of these theories kicking around. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9WpHc7l2V8&t=156.4s)]
*  And the tech sphere. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9WpHc7l2V8&t=161.67999999999998s)]
*  Well, one is about believing that the act of allowing AI to take our jobs now is in and of itself setting off this devastating chain of events. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9WpHc7l2V8&t=162.51999999999998s)]
*  It goes like this. AI takes our jobs. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9WpHc7l2V8&t=172.44s)]
*  We stop having kids fearing that they're not going to find work. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9WpHc7l2V8&t=174.83999999999997s)]
*  Now, this causes a population implosion, taking what is today six billion human beings on the planet down to what you said, the size of the UK, which is about 100 million people by twenty three hundred. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9WpHc7l2V8&t=178.2s)]
*  Now, if you think that's fiction, think again, some academics think that this population slink facie and shrink inflation already is happening before our eyes, because if you look at the stats right now out of the CDC, it measures that we are now at the lowest total fertility rate since the 1930s. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9WpHc7l2V8&t=189.56s)]
*  Yeah. The data from twenty twenty three one point six two births per woman is a figure. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9WpHc7l2V8&t=207.44s)]
*  Now, what does it take to keep us from, you know, to replace the human race in America as we age out and leave the planet? [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9WpHc7l2V8&t=212.24s)]
*  Two point one of that rate. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9WpHc7l2V8&t=222.28s)]
*  Yeah. So we're shrinking. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9WpHc7l2V8&t=224.52s)]
*  So what are you going to do about it? [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9WpHc7l2V8&t=226.4s)]
*  Interestingly, did you see this? [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9WpHc7l2V8&t=228.28s)]
*  That there were some people that like that. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9WpHc7l2V8&t=229.84s)]
*  I mean, this is what Bill Gates always wanted. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9WpHc7l2V8&t=231.64000000000001s)]
*  This is what a lot of these tech obsessed people have always wanted. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9WpHc7l2V8&t=233.68s)]
*  They've wanted, you know, and many on the left with depopulation. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9WpHc7l2V8&t=238.04s)]
*  This is very scary stuff, Kurt. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9WpHc7l2V8&t=242.2s)]
*  Did you see what Elon Musk is doing? [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9WpHc7l2V8&t=245.76s)]
*  I mean, this is sort of, you know, he has this idea and it sounds fantastic, but watch him do it. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9WpHc7l2V8&t=247.88s)]
*  Connolly colonizing other planets like Mars, he wants to do it to reseed or reset Earth. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9WpHc7l2V8&t=254.12s)]
*  Why? He's watching this. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9WpHc7l2V8&t=260.32s)]
*  This is exactly what he called out years ago. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9WpHc7l2V8&t=262.2s)]
*  So what do you and I do about this to at least slow it way down? [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9WpHc7l2V8&t=265.68s)]
*  We call our political representatives and we say, can you please put these smart minds on this so that we don't get offed by AI? [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9WpHc7l2V8&t=270.03999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, smart minds, but also people with with a care and an interest in our souls and the fact that we are human beings, body and soul. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9WpHc7l2V8&t=278.84s)]
*  And you take away people's work. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9WpHc7l2V8&t=290.2s)]
*  You take away their dignity and you replace humans with robots. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9WpHc7l2V8&t=292.20000000000005s)]
*  This is not a recipe for happiness and self and fulfillment in the future. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9WpHc7l2V8&t=297.28000000000003s)]
*  A lot to think about. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9WpHc7l2V8&t=303.16s)]
*  Right. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9WpHc7l2V8&t=304.44000000000005s)]
*  Kurt, thank you so much. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9WpHc7l2V8&t=305.08000000000004s)]
