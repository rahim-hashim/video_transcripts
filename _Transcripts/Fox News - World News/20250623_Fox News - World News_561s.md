# Karoline Leavitt shuts down claim by Dems, CNN: 'BLATANT LIE'
**Fox News - World News:** [June 23, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SidHwZUl8RY)
*  A Fox News alert. President Trump gathering his National Security Council at the White [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SidHwZUl8RY&t=0.0s)]
*  House today as he doubles down on his campaign promise, making the world a safer place after [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SidHwZUl8RY&t=4.16s)]
*  the epic takedown of Iran's major nuclear sites. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SidHwZUl8RY&t=9.08s)]
*  White House Press Secretary Kellyanne Levitt joins us now. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SidHwZUl8RY&t=12.76s)]
*  Kellyanne, I know the president seems very pleased by the results so far. What could [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SidHwZUl8RY&t=15.280000000000001s)]
*  we â€“ what do we know about the effectiveness of the attack that's been relayed to you? [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SidHwZUl8RY&t=20.76s)]
*  The president is pleased. The country is pleased. And frankly, Brian, the whole world should [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SidHwZUl8RY&t=26.36s)]
*  be pleased with the courageous action that President Trump and our United States military [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SidHwZUl8RY&t=30.16s)]
*  took on Saturday night. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SidHwZUl8RY&t=34.56s)]
*  I want to thank, and the president wants to thank, the brave pilots who flew nearly 40 [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SidHwZUl8RY&t=36.28s)]
*  hours and more than 7,000 miles from the middle of America to the Middle East to conduct this [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SidHwZUl8RY&t=41.84s)]
*  highly successful and complex precision strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SidHwZUl8RY&t=48.58s)]
*  This is an operation that presidents of the past have dreamed about, but no president [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SidHwZUl8RY&t=54.52s)]
*  had the guts to actually do it. But President Trump did, to take away this imminent threat [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SidHwZUl8RY&t=59.040000000000006s)]
*  not just to the state of Israel, but to the United States and the rest of the world. So [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SidHwZUl8RY&t=63.760000000000005s)]
*  the country is a safer place today because of the president's bold action, and he has [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SidHwZUl8RY&t=68.96000000000001s)]
*  prevented a nuclear conflict. He has prevented a rogue radical regime from obtaining a nuclear [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SidHwZUl8RY&t=73.08s)]
*  bomb and threatening our people. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SidHwZUl8RY&t=79.92s)]
*  So I know the president is very decisive, but he also likes listening to all angles. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SidHwZUl8RY&t=82.48s)]
*  And he's used to Democrats fighting against him. How hard, how much harder was the decision [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SidHwZUl8RY&t=87.92s)]
*  when you have people like Steve Bannon coming over for lunch saying, don't do it, Marjorie [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SidHwZUl8RY&t=94.04s)]
*  Taylor Greene saying, don't do it, and other voices like that? How did the president digest [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SidHwZUl8RY&t=97.96000000000001s)]
*  all that, knowing these people weren't necessarily against him, they're against pending action [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SidHwZUl8RY&t=104.16s)]
*  he more than likely was going to take? [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SidHwZUl8RY&t=109.56s)]
*  One of the great things that makes President Trump a great leader is his ability to listen [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SidHwZUl8RY&t=112.72s)]
*  to people with different perspectives, but then ultimately make a decision based on his [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SidHwZUl8RY&t=117.52s)]
*  own instinct and the intelligence that he saw. And he saw, based on U.S. intelligence, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SidHwZUl8RY&t=122.67999999999999s)]
*  that Iran is just weeks away from obtaining a nuclear weapon. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SidHwZUl8RY&t=128.79999999999998s)]
*  And President Trump has been saying his entire life, not just as a presidential candidate [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SidHwZUl8RY&t=132.35999999999999s)]
*  or as president of the United States twice, but also as a private citizen, that Iran cannot [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SidHwZUl8RY&t=136.64s)]
*  obtain a nuclear weapon. And that's something that leaders around this world and on both [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SidHwZUl8RY&t=141.32s)]
*  sides of the political aisle agree with. Again, presidents dating back to Democrat Bill Clinton [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SidHwZUl8RY&t=145.68s)]
*  have said that Iran cannot obtain a nuclear weapon, but none of them had the courage to [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SidHwZUl8RY&t=150.72s)]
*  actually do something about it, and President Trump did. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SidHwZUl8RY&t=154.72s)]
*  And nobody knows what it means to accomplish peace through strength better than President [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SidHwZUl8RY&t=157.79999999999998s)]
*  Trump. He is the one who came up with that motto and that foreign policy doctrine, and [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SidHwZUl8RY&t=163.68s)]
*  he successfully implemented it in his first term. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SidHwZUl8RY&t=168.88s)]
*  And this is one of many steps he is taking to successfully implement peace in his second [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SidHwZUl8RY&t=171.79999999999998s)]
*  term. The president wants to see a peaceful and prosperous Middle East. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SidHwZUl8RY&t=176.44s)]
*  He talked about that extensively when we took that historic trip to Saudi Arabia and he [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SidHwZUl8RY&t=180.28s)]
*  talked about how the Iranian terrorist regime was bringing down the rest of the region and [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SidHwZUl8RY&t=185.0s)]
*  our Gulf partners and allies agree with that sentiment. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SidHwZUl8RY&t=190.04s)]
*  So the president wants peace. Sometimes you have to use strength to achieve it. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SidHwZUl8RY&t=192.88s)]
*  And he's not afraid to use strength. And as Saturday night proved, the United States has [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SidHwZUl8RY&t=197.44s)]
*  the best and most lethal fighting force in the history of the world, and we can use it [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SidHwZUl8RY&t=201.24s)]
*  if we must. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SidHwZUl8RY&t=206.36s)]
*  So the president tweeted out the next day, and I agree with you, by the way, and I think [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SidHwZUl8RY&t=207.4s)]
*  most everyone watching does, says it's not politically correct to use the term regime [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SidHwZUl8RY&t=211.04000000000002s)]
*  change, but if the current Iranian regime is unable to make Iran great again, why wouldn't [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SidHwZUl8RY&t=215.4s)]
*  there be a regime change? Does he think we should do that? Is he asking the Iranian people [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SidHwZUl8RY&t=220.88s)]
*  to do that? What's he saying there? [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SidHwZUl8RY&t=226.38000000000002s)]
*  The president believes the Iranian people can control their own destiny. And what he [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SidHwZUl8RY&t=229.22s)]
*  said last night makes complete sense. If the Iranian regime refuses to come to a peaceful [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SidHwZUl8RY&t=234.38000000000002s)]
*  diplomatic solution, which the president is still interested and engaging in, by the way, [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SidHwZUl8RY&t=240.62s)]
*  why shouldn't the Iranian people take away the power of this incredibly violent [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SidHwZUl8RY&t=245.06s)]
*  regime that has been suppressing them for decades? [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SidHwZUl8RY&t=253.46s)]
*  And so our posture has not changed. Our military posture has not changed. These were decisive, [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SidHwZUl8RY&t=256.62s)]
*  precision strikes that were successful on Saturday evening. But the president is just [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SidHwZUl8RY&t=263.54s)]
*  simply raising a good question that many people around the world are asking. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SidHwZUl8RY&t=268.06s)]
*  So let's go to the border if we can and how that relates to the reprisals that Iran promises. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SidHwZUl8RY&t=271.21999999999997s)]
*  One of the things they said was, you know, Donald Trump gambler, Donald Trump can start [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SidHwZUl8RY&t=276.65999999999997s)]
*  a war, well, finish it. Well, could it be through a sleeper cell here? Well, they certainly [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SidHwZUl8RY&t=281.17999999999995s)]
*  have the numbers. It turns out over the last four years, there's been over 1,500 Iranians [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SidHwZUl8RY&t=285.09999999999997s)]
*  coming through our southern border, 729 qualified for release. Your reactions to the American [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SidHwZUl8RY&t=289.58s)]
*  people concerned about a possible sleeper cell reprisal here? [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SidHwZUl8RY&t=296.41999999999996s)]
*  President Trump has no greater responsibility than protecting the homeland. And look at [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SidHwZUl8RY&t=302.21999999999997s)]
*  what he has done over the past several months to do that. He has done more than any president [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SidHwZUl8RY&t=307.98s)]
*  in American history to secure our border and the largest mass deportation operation of [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SidHwZUl8RY&t=313.86s)]
*  illegal criminals, many of them known terrorists that Joe Biden led into this country, are [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SidHwZUl8RY&t=318.62s)]
*  being removed every day. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SidHwZUl8RY&t=323.42s)]
*  I spoke to our secretary of homeland security this morning. She held a call with governors [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SidHwZUl8RY&t=324.78000000000003s)]
*  across the country and the Department of Homeland Security is actively engaged with our state [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SidHwZUl8RY&t=329.22s)]
*  and local law enforcement partners to protect the American people. That is the president's [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SidHwZUl8RY&t=334.1s)]
*  number one priority in all of this. And that's ultimately what led him to make the decision [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SidHwZUl8RY&t=338.94s)]
*  to launch this strike on Saturday night to protect our homeland from threats abroad. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SidHwZUl8RY&t=343.22s)]
*  And we will continue to protect our homeland from threats here at home. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SidHwZUl8RY&t=347.78000000000003s)]
*  Caroline, but no specific threat yet in any city or any state or any building? [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SidHwZUl8RY&t=351.22s)]
*  Not that I'm tracking, Brian, but I can assure you the Department of Homeland Security is [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SidHwZUl8RY&t=359.22s)]
*  monitoring the situation very closely. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SidHwZUl8RY&t=363.34000000000003s)]
*  So as this operation takes place, Democrats said they were not told about it. They were [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SidHwZUl8RY&t=365.54s)]
*  left in the dark and they said, usually there's bipartisan calls for this. And they didn't [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SidHwZUl8RY&t=370.3s)]
*  know about it. Here is Republican Thomas Massey. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SidHwZUl8RY&t=376.5s)]
*  We haven't been briefed. They should have called us all back. And frankly, we should [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SidHwZUl8RY&t=380.74s)]
*  have debated this War Powers Resolution that Ro Khanna and I offered instead of staying [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SidHwZUl8RY&t=384.92s)]
*  on vacation and doing fundraisers and saying, oh, well, the president's got this under control. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SidHwZUl8RY&t=390.42s)]
*  We're going to cede our constitutional authority. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SidHwZUl8RY&t=395.42s)]
*  Should you have called everybody back? [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SidHwZUl8RY&t=398.14s)]
*  First of all, we did make bipartisan calls. Thomas Massey and the Democrats, he should [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SidHwZUl8RY&t=401.54s)]
*  be a Democrat because he's more aligned with them than with the Republican Party. We're [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SidHwZUl8RY&t=405.74s)]
*  given notice. The White House made calls to congressional leadership. They were bipartisan [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SidHwZUl8RY&t=411.38s)]
*  calls. In fact, Takim Drafres couldn't be reached. We tried him before the strike and [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SidHwZUl8RY&t=416.58s)]
*  he didn't pick up the phone, but he was briefed after as well as Chuck Schumer was briefed [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SidHwZUl8RY&t=420.26s)]
*  prior to the strike. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SidHwZUl8RY&t=424.26s)]
*  So this notion that CNN ran with at the White House did not give a heads up to Democrats [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SidHwZUl8RY&t=425.34s)]
*  is just completely false. In fact, both Senator Schumer's office and CNN had to retract that [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SidHwZUl8RY&t=430.06s)]
*  story last night because it was a blatant lie. And we showed them the timestamps from [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SidHwZUl8RY&t=435.48s)]
*  those phone calls. But I want to add something to Thomas Massey's false points. The White [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SidHwZUl8RY&t=439.98s)]
*  House was not obligated to call anyone because the president was acting within his legal [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SidHwZUl8RY&t=444.94s)]
*  authority under Article 2 of the Constitution as commander in chief of the president of the United [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SidHwZUl8RY&t=449.06s)]
*  States. We gave these calls as a courtesy and the Democrats are lying about this because [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SidHwZUl8RY&t=454.22s)]
*  they can't talk about the truth of the success of that operation and the success of our United [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SidHwZUl8RY&t=459.14000000000004s)]
*  States military and the success of this president and this administration in doing something [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SidHwZUl8RY&t=463.98s)]
*  that past administrations, Democrats too, have only dreamed about. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SidHwZUl8RY&t=468.18s)]
*  Yeah, President Obama did not ask for permission to bomb Libya in 2011. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SidHwZUl8RY&t=471.34000000000003s)]
*  That's right. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SidHwZUl8RY&t=475.58000000000004s)]
*  Finally, I know you guys going over to NATO. You're going to go one day later. It's going [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SidHwZUl8RY&t=476.1s)]
*  to be on Tuesday. So far, our NATO allies are looking for de-escalation. What do you [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SidHwZUl8RY&t=479.62s)]
*  want to hear from them about what we did over the weekend? [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SidHwZUl8RY&t=484.54s)]
*  That's right. The president will be taking off for NATO tomorrow morning. And one of [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SidHwZUl8RY&t=490.14s)]
*  the main topics of discussion will be that five percent threshold that our NATO allies [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SidHwZUl8RY&t=494.18s)]
*  have to hit. The president has been calling on our NATO allies to do more for quite some [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SidHwZUl8RY&t=499.38s)]
*  time. He got them to step up and do more in his first term. And you'll hear the president [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SidHwZUl8RY&t=503.94s)]
*  talk about that on this next historic trip to Europe. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SidHwZUl8RY&t=507.5s)]
*  You want them spending five percent, right? Five percent of their GDP on defense. Some [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SidHwZUl8RY&t=511.62s)]
*  of them just got to two percent. Have you gotten any pushback on that? [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SidHwZUl8RY&t=517.02s)]
*  Not so far. Not that we've heard. And the president has been adamant. And our NATO allies, [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SidHwZUl8RY&t=523.46s)]
*  to their credit, heeded the president's strong call in his first term. And we expect them [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SidHwZUl8RY&t=528.48s)]
*  to do it this time around as well. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SidHwZUl8RY&t=532.14s)]
