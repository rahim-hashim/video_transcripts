# Attorney General Pam Bondi announces major criminal arrest
**Fox News - World News:** [June 06, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYfGUc3SImk)
*  We're grateful to President Bukele for agreeing to return him to our country [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYfGUc3SImk&t=0.0s)]
*  to face these very serious charges. This is what American justice looks like. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYfGUc3SImk&t=4.24s)]
*  Upon completion of his sentence, we anticipate he will be returned to his home country of El Salvador. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYfGUc3SImk&t=11.040000000000001s)]
*  The grand jury found that over the past nine years, Abrego Garcia has played a significant [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYfGUc3SImk&t=18.64s)]
*  role in an alien smuggling ring. They found this was his full-time job, not a contractor. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYfGUc3SImk&t=25.76s)]
*  He was a smuggler of humans and children and women. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYfGUc3SImk&t=36.160000000000004s)]
*  He made over a hundred trips, the grand jury found, smuggling people throughout our country. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYfGUc3SImk&t=42.400000000000006s)]
*  MS-13 members, violent gang terrorist organization members throughout our country. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYfGUc3SImk&t=51.12s)]
*  Thousands of illegal aliens were smuggled. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYfGUc3SImk&t=61.04s)]
*  This is especially disturbing because Abrego Garcia is also alleged with transporting [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYfGUc3SImk&t=66.32s)]
*  minor children. The defendant traded the innocence of minor children for profit. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYfGUc3SImk&t=73.52s)]
*  There are even more disturbing facts that the grand jury uncovered. It is alleged this defendant [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYfGUc3SImk&t=81.92s)]
*  is part of the same smuggling ring responsible for the death of more than 50 migrants in 2021 [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYfGUc3SImk&t=88.64s)]
*  after the tractor trailer overturned in Mexico. This is part of that same ring. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYfGUc3SImk&t=96.32000000000001s)]
*  The defendant abused undocumented alien females, according to co-conspirators who were under his [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYfGUc3SImk&t=103.92s)]
*  control while transporting them throughout our country. This defendant trafficked firearms and [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYfGUc3SImk&t=111.04s)]
*  narcotics throughout our country on multiple occasions. They were using vehicles, SUVs, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYfGUc3SImk&t=119.12s)]
*  with added seats in the back, floors that had been ripped out, guns, narcotics, children, women, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYfGUc3SImk&t=128.0s)]
*  MS-13 members. That is what the grand jury found. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYfGUc3SImk&t=137.04s)]
*  A co-conspirator alleged that the defendant solicited nude photographs and videos of a minor. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYfGUc3SImk&t=144.32s)]
*  A co-conspirator also alleges the defendant played a role in the murder of a rival gang member's [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYfGUc3SImk&t=150.8s)]
*  mother. These facts demonstrate Abrego Garcia is a danger to our community. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYfGUc3SImk&t=156.48000000000002s)]
*  We want to thank the Department of Homeland Security, the FBI, our state and local partners, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYfGUc3SImk&t=164.96s)]
*  our acting U.S. Attorney Robert McGuire, and prosecutors from the Joint Task Force Vulcan. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYfGUc3SImk&t=171.84s)]
*  Questions? [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYfGUc3SImk&t=180.48s)]
*  Attorney General, the traffic stop that we've seen video of from Tennessee where Abrego Garcia was [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYfGUc3SImk&t=184.56s)]
*  first identified by the local authorities. At the time, the Homeland Security Department [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYfGUc3SImk&t=193.12s)]
*  declined to take custody of him. What has happened in between that time and in between [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYfGUc3SImk&t=198.4s)]
*  the time that the government has been arguing that he was not returnable from El Salvador? What has [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYfGUc3SImk&t=203.44s)]
*  happened since in this investigation that brought you here? Yes, the question was in 2021 there was [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYfGUc3SImk&t=209.04s)]
*  the traffic stop and what has changed since then? What has changed is Donald Trump is now president [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYfGUc3SImk&t=216.48s)]
*  of the United States and our borders are again secure and thanks to the bright light that has [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYfGUc3SImk&t=221.92s)]
*  been shined on Abrego Garcia, this investigation continued with actually amazing police work [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYfGUc3SImk&t=228.72s)]
*  and we were able to track this case and stop this international smuggling ring from continuing. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYfGUc3SImk&t=236.07999999999998s)]
*  Recently found facts, right? Yes, recently found facts. At that point, can you just explain when [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYfGUc3SImk&t=246.88s)]
*  this investigation was opened? The investigation in Tennessee, can you say when that investigation [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYfGUc3SImk&t=253.12s)]
*  was opened? Well, the grand jury indicted on May 21st. This investigation has been ongoing. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYfGUc3SImk&t=257.44s)]
*  The case has been widely debated here in Washington. In your mind, does this resolve [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYfGUc3SImk&t=264.8s)]
*  that issue in terms of his deportation and should this be seen in any way as compliant [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYfGUc3SImk&t=270.64s)]
*  with the judge's order to return him to the U.S. and the Supreme Court ruling that the U.S. government [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYfGUc3SImk&t=275.52s)]
*  should facilitate his return? There's a big difference between what the state of play was [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYfGUc3SImk&t=280.32s)]
*  before the indictment and after the indictment and so the reason why he is back and was returned [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYfGUc3SImk&t=289.44s)]
*  was because it's an arrest warrant which was presented to the government in El Salvador. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYfGUc3SImk&t=296.71999999999997s)]
*  So there's a big difference there. As far as whether it makes the ongoing litigation in Maryland [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYfGUc3SImk&t=301.6s)]
*  moot, I would think so, but we don't know that. He just landed today. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYfGUc3SImk&t=308.96s)]
*  Jake, is there anybody else? I just want to confirm what you said earlier that you're intending to [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYfGUc3SImk&t=316.64s)]
*  prosecute him and keep him in an American prison if he's found guilty and then would remove him [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYfGUc3SImk&t=320.4s)]
*  after his sentence is over. Correct. Yes, he will be prosecuted in our country, [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYfGUc3SImk&t=324.72s)]
*  sentenced in our country if convicted, and then returned after completion of his sentence. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYfGUc3SImk&t=330.08s)]
*  Last one, Sadie, Wall Street Journal. Okay, I have two. One's on top of one's off top of it. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYfGUc3SImk&t=337.35999999999996s)]
*  Maybe I misunderstood you, but you were mentioning that he had some involvement in a murder or was [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYfGUc3SImk&t=344.96s)]
*  connected to groups that had involved with this other smuggling ring, but to be clear, the only [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYfGUc3SImk&t=350.96s)]
*  charges he's facing right now are the human smuggling charges. That's the one offense, [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYfGUc3SImk&t=357.12s)]
*  but the other things that you have talked about are not actually in the indictment? [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYfGUc3SImk&t=365.28000000000003s)]
*  No, co-conspirators allege that, and we were clear to say that he is charged with, [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYfGUc3SImk&t=369.84000000000003s)]
*  it's not only very serious charges of alien smuggling. Again, there were children involved [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYfGUc3SImk&t=375.84000000000003s)]
*  in that. Human trafficking, not only in our country but in our world, is very, very real. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYfGUc3SImk&t=382.8s)]
*  It's very dangerous. As you saw recently in Virginia, the arrest we made of the MS-13 member [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYfGUc3SImk&t=389.44000000000005s)]
*  unrelated to this, we learned at that press conference that's where they bring young children [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYfGUc3SImk&t=396.48s)]
*  into our country and they start grooming them at middle school age to become MS-13 full-fledged [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYfGUc3SImk&t=402.48s)]
*  members commit violent crimes throughout our country. It is highly organized. It is very [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYfGUc3SImk&t=410.24s)]
*  dangerous, and they are living throughout our country, but no more because they are being [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYfGUc3SImk&t=417.76s)]
*  arrested, they are being prosecuted, and being convicted and deported when appropriate. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYfGUc3SImk&t=424.08s)]
*  That's all for today. Thank you. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYfGUc3SImk&t=431.6s)]
*  you [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYfGUc3SImk&t=440.24s)]
*  you [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYfGUc3SImk&t=470.24s)]
