# Fox News Highlights - June 26th, 2025
**Fox News - World News:** [June 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q)
*  The Relatable Socialist. That's the focus of tonight's angle. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=0.0s)]
*  Now, if you're not old enough or too young to remember what New York City was like [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=6.16s)]
*  in the 70s and early 80s, here's a little refresher. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=10.48s)]
*  This is what Midtown looked like. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=15.280000000000001s)]
*  Peep shows everywhere. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=18.080000000000002s)]
*  There was urban blight. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=20.0s)]
*  Strip clubs in Times Square. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=22.16s)]
*  Generally it was just filthy. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=25.36s)]
*  And of course crime was out of control. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=27.44s)]
*  Here's the New York Times headline from December 26, 1979. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=30.16s)]
*  The year's 1,700 homicides break a record. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=34.16s)]
*  Of course the economy, that was lousy too. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=39.04s)]
*  It was an era of urban decay and decline. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=41.519999999999996s)]
*  So why would New Yorkers ever want to return to such a time? [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=45.68s)]
*  Now, it was bad when liberals like de Blasio ran the city, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=50.480000000000004s)]
*  but what about a socialist? [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=53.68s)]
*  His program is Tax the Rich, who of course already pay, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=55.760000000000005s)]
*  threw the nose in taxes in the city. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=59.84s)]
*  And then the promise of free stuff to young people. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=62.24s)]
*  What could go wrong? [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=65.68s)]
*  After all, his PR machine works 24-7 to sell Mom Donnie as the new Obama [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=67.28s)]
*  because he's so relatable. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=73.6s)]
*  Next mayor, baby. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=90.24s)]
*  That's the next mayor right there. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=91.2s)]
*  We here, we lit. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=92.24s)]
*  Future mayor. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=94.88s)]
*  So authentic. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=99.68s)]
*  Especially since he's an honorary squad member. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=101.68s)]
*  What did it feel like when you won? [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=105.52000000000001s)]
*  One of the things that reminds me of is when you were running and when you won, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=108.4s)]
*  it was this moment for so many where it felt like democracy could be different, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=112.16s)]
*  that politics could be different. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=117.04s)]
*  Connecting with the Instagram and Snapchat lefties, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=119.44s)]
*  Mom Donnie traffics in buzzwords and emotions, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=123.04s)]
*  spooning with his mentor. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=126.4s)]
*  Today has been so moving because people feel like it could actually be different. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=129.12s)]
*  It could actually, they could see themselves, they could see their life. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=132.96s)]
*  And I think that that is a beautiful, beautiful experience. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=135.36s)]
*  And it's been lovely building it with you. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=140.56s)]
*  Lovely. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=144.64000000000001s)]
*  Forget the fact that despite all the hype, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=145.68s)]
*  she's done nothing to actually improve the lives of working people. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=148.48s)]
*  Again, there are a lot of generalities, a lot of feelings, always sold with a smile. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=152.48s)]
*  How do you define being a democratic socialist? [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=158.64000000000001s)]
*  I think of the words of Dr. King who decades ago said, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=161.52s)]
*  call it democracy or call it democratic socialism. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=164.4s)]
*  There must be a better distribution of wealth for all of God's children in this country. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=166.88s)]
*  Ah, that's the rub. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=170.96s)]
*  In a city where the state income tax can run as high as 10.3% [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=172.16s)]
*  and add that to a top New York City tax of 3.87% plus the federal tax, 35 to 37%. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=175.84s)]
*  That's already 50% in taxes. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=184.56s)]
*  Plus, of course, sales taxes, congestion pricing fees, et cetera, et cetera. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=186.64000000000001s)]
*  But remember, proposals to soak the rich, they're nothing new. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=191.36s)]
*  But they always end with the same result. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=196.16s)]
*  Businesses, families, and talent fleeing. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=199.04s)]
*  Yet given the Democrats' utter failure to deliver for the middle class, [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=202.8s)]
*  Mamdani's rise is entirely predictable. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=206.4s)]
*  And he did get this right. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=209.6s)]
*  It is part of a larger referendum on where our party goes. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=212.16s)]
*  At the national level, after the presidential election, we saw that New York [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=215.68s)]
*  was actually the state with the largest swing in the country towards Donald Trump. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=219.2s)]
*  11.5 points. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=222.96s)]
*  And that that swing took place far from the caricature of Trump voters, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=224.0s)]
*  instead taking place in the hearts of immigrant New York City. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=227.44s)]
*  Of course, the machine behind Mamdani is working overtime to rebrand him from his old radical ways. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=231.36s)]
*  So we're supposed to think that he no longer believes in defunding the police, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=238.08s)]
*  despite the litany of social media posts where he urged just that. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=242.16s)]
*  And we're supposed to ignore all of his old views on ending cash bail. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=247.12s)]
*  The man is obviously deeply anti-law enforcement. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=252.32s)]
*  We should not even think about that. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=254.56s)]
*  And he thinks that our legal system is too harsh toward criminals. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=256.64s)]
*  That's why he wants to ban prisons. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=260.88s)]
*  But we're supposed to forget that too. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=263.52s)]
*  And of course, all those New Yorkers who believe in the Second Amendment, [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=266.0s)]
*  maybe they got their concealed carry permits after the Heller decision, [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=268.71999999999997s)]
*  or they have a gun at home for self-protection, look out. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=271.59999999999997s)]
*  Because a few years back, he urged a total gun ban. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=275.59999999999997s)]
*  But nah, he can't mean that, right? [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=280.56s)]
*  He's just saying that. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=282.0s)]
*  Well, if he's elected, does that mean his security detail will only carry slingshots? [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=283.84s)]
*  Look, I almost feel for them Democrats are in a huge bind here. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=290.56s)]
*  They're trapped. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=294.08s)]
*  Bill Clinton and Schumer are playing it cool right now, [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=295.6s)]
*  congratulating Mamdani but not endorsing him. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=298.56s)]
*  They're smart enough to know that if he wins, [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=301.52s)]
*  the city's going to crater and take the Democrat party along with it. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=304.15999999999997s)]
*  When Virginia gubernatorial candidate and fake moderate Abigail Spanberger [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=308.15999999999997s)]
*  was asked about Mamdani, well, she tried to punt. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=312.8s)]
*  Are you concerned that you'll be painted with that same brush, [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=316.64s)]
*  that sort of liberal socialist out of touch brush? [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=320.0s)]
*  So I do not pretend to know anything about New York City politics [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=322.16s)]
*  or the outcomes of that election. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=326.96000000000004s)]
*  What I know is my state, the Commonwealth of Virginia, [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=328.88s)]
*  a diverse, a vibrant, a large state. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=332.56s)]
*  Virginia is a really exciting place. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=335.84000000000003s)]
*  My goodness, is she a fraud? [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=339.84000000000003s)]
*  The Democrat establishment knows that if they're seen as opposing him, [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=342.8s)]
*  a chunk of liberal urban voters will revolt, just like Tim Walz's daughter. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=348.08s)]
*  I know it might surprise some people, but feeding kids lunch, providing child care, [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=353.84000000000003s)]
*  having accessible and functional public transportation, [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=360.72s)]
*  among many other things, are popular policies everywhere. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=365.92s)]
*  They're popular everywhere. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=371.52s)]
*  You just lost about 100,000 brain cells by watching that sound, but, [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=374.0s)]
*  sweetie, if they were popular everywhere, Trump would not be president. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=378.47999999999996s)]
*  Nevertheless, I have to say I disagree with some of my friends who are posting on social media, [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=384.47999999999996s)]
*  and they're basically saying, let's just write off places like New York City and LA. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=389.76s)]
*  They're hopeless. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=393.91999999999996s)]
*  I think that's a huge mistake. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=395.59999999999997s)]
*  The voters there aren't going to leave America. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=398.0s)]
*  They're here to stay. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=400.72s)]
*  And the country is going to be more Hispanic and more Asian as time goes on. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=402.48s)]
*  And our policies, the MAGA policies, they work for everyone. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=406.72s)]
*  Reagan didn't write off Democrat states and cities in 1980. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=411.36s)]
*  He fought for every vote. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=415.36s)]
*  And the Trump, wow, God, Trump grew his support everywhere, including in urban America. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=418.32000000000005s)]
*  Remember his Madison Square Garden rally? [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=423.76000000000005s)]
*  I was there. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=425.68s)]
*  His event in the Bronx? [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=427.12s)]
*  Incredible. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=429.36s)]
*  So the GOP should keep trying to reach the disaffected Democrats. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=430.8s)]
*  Because we know Bob Donnie's policies, even if he's a socialist with a smile, [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=436.0s)]

*  In 2009, an officer was brought into a secret vault [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=480.96000000000004s)]

*  And they knew from the very first days what this was for. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=527.52s)]
*  And along the way, they realized we did not have a weapon [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=532.0s)]
*  that could adequately strike and kill this target. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=535.6s)]
*  So they began a journey to work with industry and other tacticians [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=539.4399999999999s)]

*  The crews that attacked Fordow were from the Active Duty Air Force [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=562.48s)]
*  and the Missouri Air National Guard. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=566.4s)]
*  The crews ranked from captain to colonel. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=568.4s)]
*  And most were graduates of the Air Force Weapon School [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=572.0s)]
*  headquartered at Nellis Air Force Base in Nevada. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=575.44s)]

*  We believe that this is the largest single Patriot engagement in US military history. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=708.4s)]
*  These awesome humans, along with their Qatari brothers and sisters in arms, [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=715.28s)]
*  stood between a salvo of Iranian missiles and the safety of Al Udeid. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=720.24s)]

*  missile after missile from the mullahs. We're so proud of our men and women in uniform, [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=735.12s)]
*  such courage and such ingenuity. The mission was perfectly executed. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=740.64s)]
*  The only question is if Iran moved their uranium. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=746.24s)]
*  The uranium was removed from the facility before the B-2 strike. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=750.0s)]
*  So I'm not aware of any intelligence that I've reviewed that says things were not where they were supposed to be, moved or otherwise. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=753.68s)]

*  Iran's even admitting its nuclear sites are toast. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=772.72s)]
*  Our nuclear installations have been badly damaged, that's for sure, because it has come on the [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=776.56s)]
*  repeated attacks by Israeli and American aggressors. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=784.8s)]
*  The only ones who say Iran's nuclear program survived besides CNN is the Ayatollah, [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=789.3599999999999s)]
*  who came out of hiding and says he slapped us like Bridget McCrone. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=795.12s)]
*  The Islamic Republic dealt a severe slap to the face of America. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=800.88s)]
*  Besides Iranian Baghdad, Bob, CNN couldn't find a single soul to back up their fake story. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=806.64s)]
*  Oh, and they tried. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=813.28s)]
*  You could see that the key nodes of a centrifuge program were hit. So the program is severely damaged. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=815.28s)]
*  I am confident that Iran has suffered a catastrophic, catastrophic blow to its enrichment program. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=824.24s)]
*  They did it perfectly. So we should have, as kind of Norm said, an expectation that there was [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=830.8s)]
*  significant damage. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=838.9599999999999s)]
*  The reporter who fronted the piece is a known con artist. They call her Nasty Natasha. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=840.88s)]
*  In 2020, it was Natasha Bertrand who had 51 intelligence analysts falsely lie to her, [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=847.1999999999999s)]
*  but she still put it on paper for some reason that the Hunter Biden laptop story was Russian [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=853.12s)]
*  disinformation. Also in 2024, Bertrand pushed the suckers and losers hoax. She also pushed the fine [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=857.8399999999999s)]
*  people hoax, which was taking the president's words purposely out of context. And so this is [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=865.04s)]
*  a reporter who has been unfortunately used by people who dislike Donald Trump in this government [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=870.64s)]
*  to push fake and false narratives. She should be ashamed of herself. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=876.3199999999999s)]
*  You know, it's really bad when morning Joe won't touch the Bunker Buster hoax. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=880.4s)]
*  We also have to be cautious about being played by people inside the Intel community who want to [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=885.92s)]
*  get their message out. That's happened an awful lot. Happened a lot in Iraq. It happened a lot [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=893.04s)]
*  in Afghanistan. So again, that's why waiting to see what happens actually and not drawing too [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=898.7199999999999s)]

*  Asking questions is literally our job. Demanding facts and answers instead of just taking a [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=915.04s)]
*  president's word for it. Jake just started asking questions when Trump got sworn in. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=921.52s)]
*  He never asked why Biden's taking the short stares or why an Alzheimer's doctor's visiting [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=927.6s)]
*  the White House every week. Now we're not saying you have to believe everything the president says. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=932.64s)]
*  You don't. But use your head. The Air Force hasn't missed a target since Desert Storm. CNN just spent [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=938.0s)]
*  48 hours claiming our bombs don't work and Iran's nuke program's intact. Now Tapper's saying we were [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=946.32s)]
*  just demanding answers and his next book's going to be called How Trump Destroyed Fordell. Trump [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=953.36s)]

*  Hegseth says they all just have a wicked case of TDS. Because you, and I mean specifically you, [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=966.24s)]

*  so bad. You have to cheer against the efficacy of these strikes. You have to hope maybe they [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=988.3199999999999s)]

*  Spin it in every way we can to try to cause doubt and manipulate the mind, the public mind [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=1007.28s)]

*  of his intel with them. Maybe that's because they keep leaking it. Now if Trump gave Democrats a [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=1098.72s)]

*  Daddy hates leaks in the house. But first our top story tonight, a new low for Democrats and the [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=1110.64s)]
*  legacy media mob. They don't know what the word shame means. Now for the past week, many on the [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=1116.08s)]

*  right, we can praise him and proudly touting a ridiculous claim that the U.S. strikes. I'm talking [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=1128.16s)]
*  about the massive 14 bunker buster bombs against Iran's nuclear facilities were somehow a failure [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=1134.4s)]
*  in what has now become an all too predictable pattern. A bogus report designed to make Donald [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=1141.52s)]

*  That phony story then became the talk of the town in D.C. and the swamp fueled by obsessive, [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=1159.04s)]
*  compulsive, nonstop rage and hatred and coverage by MSDNC, fake news CNN, the New York Times, [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=1165.52s)]
*  and virtually every other left wing, you know, legacy media mob member in the country. And at [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=1172.48s)]
*  the center of this hit piece, the usual suspects, including a so-called reporter named Natasha [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=1178.64s)]
*  Bertrand, never really heard of her. She's exactly the embodiment of why CNN is known as fake news [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=1184.72s)]
*  CNN because for years this sad excuse for quote, a journalist has been the deep state's go-to helper [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=1192.0s)]
*  for smears all against Donald Trump. Caroline Levitt was way on her game today. She crushed it [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=1199.28s)]
*  and described it perfectly and that is Natasha Bertrand's track record. It's beyond laughable [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=1205.6000000000001s)]
*  and her reports should never be taken seriously. Take a look. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=1212.48s)]
*  It was Natasha Bertrand who had 51 intelligence analysts falsely lie to her but she still put it [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=1217.84s)]
*  on paper for some reason that the Hunter Biden laptop story was Russian disinformation. We all [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=1223.76s)]
*  know that's not true, right? We can all agree on that now. That was a lie from the intelligence [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=1229.1200000000001s)]
*  community. Also in 2020, this same reporter Natasha Bertrand wrote that a top intel agency [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=1233.04s)]
*  ruled out the man-made lab leak theory of the coronavirus origins. Again, the president was [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=1239.2s)]
*  right about that. This reporter wrote a lie from the intelligence community to seek a narrative [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=1245.04s)]
*  she wanted to prove and guess what? We now know that's the truth. Also in 2024, Bertrand pushed [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=1250.0800000000002s)]
*  the suckers and losers hoax. She also pushed the fine people hoax which was taking the president's [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=1256.56s)]
*  words purposely out of context. And then last October, and I believe this is notable, Natasha [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=1262.16s)]
*  Bertrand published an article in Politico from the intelligence agency. She said that John Ratcliffe [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=1268.0s)]
*  was speaking without any evidence when he said Iran was attempting to undermine President Trump's [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=1274.08s)]
*  presidential campaign. And then we of course found out that was absolutely true. In fact, [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=1279.76s)]
*  the Biden administration declass an intel report which said they had high confidence that Iran had [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=1284.32s)]
*  done exactly what Ratcliffe alleged. They did run an influence campaign to hurt President Trump's [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=1290.32s)]
*  candidacy. In fact, we know the Iranians tried to take President Trump's life. And so this is a [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=1295.36s)]
*  reporter who has been unfortunately used by people who dislike Donald Trump in this government to [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=1300.32s)]
*  push fake and false narratives. Now take a look at your screen. Natasha Bertrand has been wrong [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=1306.0s)]
*  about almost everything. They call her a reporter. Now that's because she clearly has an agenda. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=1312.24s)]
*  She's a radical leftist. She's not interested in the truth. She pushes these conspiracy theories [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=1318.9599999999998s)]
*  and fake news. CNN calls her a reporter and everything is to defame Donald Trump and protect [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=1325.4399999999998s)]
*  her democratic allies. It's that simple. And so it comes as no surprise that her latest reporting [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=1330.6399999999999s)]
*  is also completely and utterly wrong. According to the nuclear watchdog at the UN, IAEA, the [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=1335.9199999999998s)]
*  centrifuges at Iran's Fordow nuclear facility no longer operational. The CIA says Iran's nuclear [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=1343.12s)]
*  program was severely damaged by U.S. strikes. Also, according to Israeli intelligence, quote, [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=1351.84s)]
*  and I will read it, the devastating U.S. strike on Fordow destroyed, let me repeat, destroyed, [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=1357.76s)]
*  obliterated, you pick your adjective, destroyed the site's critical infrastructure, rendered the [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=1363.6799999999998s)]
*  enrichment facility inoperable. We assess that the American strikes have set back Iran's ability to [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=1368.9599999999998s)]
*  develop nuclear weapons by many, many years. Ah, even Iran themselves admitted their nuclear sites [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=1374.9599999999998s)]
*  were badly damaged. The Department of Defense released a visual to help members of the legacy [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=1381.52s)]
*  media mob understand how America's massive 30,000 pound bunker buster bombs were able to obliterate [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=1387.6s)]
*  Iranians heavily fortified nuclear facilities. The only voice of reason in the Democratic party, [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=1396.4s)]
*  God bless John Fetterman. He put it this way, to those who were unimpressed or borderline gloating [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=1402.8799999999999s)]
*  on a leak, on a leak, Operation Midnight Hammer worked. I have been calling for and fully [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=1410.48s)]
*  supported those strikes and it made the world safer. It should transcend partisan politics. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=1416.0s)]
*  Senator Fetterman absolutely got it right. Unfortunately, almost no one in his party [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=1422.16s)]
*  agrees with him. In fact, his Democratic colleagues, they tried extra, extra hard, [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=1427.52s)]
*  what, to try to make our military, our operation here look like a failure? What, just to get one [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=1432.08s)]
*  over on Donald Trump, the left's Trump derangement syndrome, clearly it knows no bounds, but there is [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=1437.28s)]
*  a bigger problem. And it's also the smear on the courage, the success, the precision, the bravery [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=1443.36s)]
*  of the incredible men and women that serve this country, protect all of your freedoms, all of your [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=1452.72s)]

*  Joint Chiefs, General Reisen Cain, had this to say about the successful strike. And by the way, [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=1470.96s)]

*  The Joint Force does not do BDA. By design, we don't grade our own homework. The intelligence [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=1483.76s)]

*  First, that the weapons were built, tested, and loaded properly. Two, the weapons were released [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=1496.96s)]
*  on speed and on parameters. Three, the weapons all guided to their intended targets and to their [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=1504.88s)]
*  intended aim points. Four, the weapons functioned as designed, meaning they exploded. Operation [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=1511.28s)]

*  Gutfeld didn't get any days off of work over it, which Joe Mackey complained about a lot. [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=1710.64s)]

*  Anyway, things have calmed down for now as the ceasefire between Israel and Iran seems to be holding up, [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=1721.2s)]
*  which is great. Although I did cancel my booze cruise from Tel Aviv to Tehran, [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=1729.92s)]
*  just in case. But in the heat of it all, people argued about what President Trump should or [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=1736.96s)]

*  I'm pro. We saw differing reports about the impact of the strikes themselves also. CNN ran with a leaked [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=1747.52s)]
*  DIA low confidence report, which said the strikes only set Iran's new program back months. The [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=1754.96s)]
*  Pentagon has since refuted that, calling it a historically successful attack and released file [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=1761.68s)]
*  footage of how the 30,000 pound bunker buster bombs actually work. And sure enough, CNN rolled out the [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=1767.2s)]
*  hand burglar to do damage control. There's so much more reporting to do on this topic. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=1775.1200000000001s)]
*  This is a very complex matter, even though Trump tried to make it sound simple on Saturday night. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=1783.3600000000001s)]
*  It's really important to note what CNN did not report. CNN did not report that this mission was [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=1788.4s)]
*  a failure. Far from it. It may have turned out to be a tremendous success. We just don't know all the [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=1792.96s)]
*  facts yet, and neither does the U.S. government. And then there's good old reliable morning Joe [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=1798.08s)]

*  who want to get their message out. That's why waiting to see what happens actually and not [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=1817.6s)]
*  not drawing too many conclusions make sense. And that, of course, not only not only is the [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=1824.56s)]
*  best practice for the White House and for the president, that's the best practice for the media [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=1831.92s)]
*  as well. You think? I mean, remember, this is the guy who ridiculed people who suggested that Joe [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=1835.8400000000001s)]
*  Biden might not be doing okay, calling him the best Biden ever three months before he dropped out of [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=1844.8000000000002s)]
*  the race. Sure, there's such a thing called fog of war, but the media will turn the fog of war into [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=1852.4s)]
*  a cluster fog. Think about everything they got wrong or lied about. COVID, Russia gate, the [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=1858.24s)]
*  Covington kid, Hunter's laptop, and of course, maybe the biggest scandal of all, ignoring Biden's [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=1864.24s)]
*  decline. So we should look at the current situation through the lens of all of that stuff. In other [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=1869.36s)]
*  words, it's okay to be skeptical. You can admit if you have doubts about how this is going to shake [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=1875.52s)]
*  out. You can believe that Iran was close to having nukes and we destroyed all of it. You can believe [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=1880.08s)]
*  that they were close and we maybe didn't get everything. But most importantly, you don't have [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=1884.72s)]
*  to blindly trust anyone. Basically, if the government and the legacy media were your spouse, [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=1890.24s)]
*  it would be okay to be tempted to use their face to unlock their phone while they slept and go [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=1897.2s)]
*  through it every night. Not that I condone that or cheating, but if you are cheating, you might want [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=1901.28s)]
*  to turn off your face ID. So yeah, we've been burned too many times to not have questions or to [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=1906.88s)]
*  not be suspicious that we've seen the end of the conflict. The reason? Trump summed it up perfectly. [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=1912.96s)]
*  You know what? We have, we basically have two countries that have been fighting so long and so [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=1919.04s)]
*  hard that they don't know what the f*** they're doing. Yeah. Can we agree that was awesome? Right? [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=1924.32s)]
*  He is right. Okay. And if this has been going on forever and they don't know what the f*** they're [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=1933.68s)]
*  doing, we should be skeptical of anyone who says they have it all figured out. [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=1939.28s)]
*  It's like playing twister naked. The old rules don't apply. [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=1944.16s)]
*  Look, in this case, you have to be able to tolerate different opinions because the stakes are so high. [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=1950.8s)]
*  The ultimate goal is the same, a safer America. That's by far the most critical piece in all of [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=1956.3999999999999s)]
*  this. No matter whether you think the strikes were a good move or not. And most people who oppose [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=1962.8s)]
*  intervention don't oppose it because they want Iran to get a nuke and then use it on us. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=1968.0s)]
*  Even the kinkiest of people don't want to be punished that bad. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=1973.12s)]
*  So someone has a different opinion than you. That doesn't mean that they don't want the same thing [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=1978.24s)]
*  that you want. Most people want peace and freedom and safety and stability. And unpopular opinions [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=1982.88s)]
*  can play a role in getting us there. Without them, all that's left is group think. Without [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=1990.24s)]
*  challenging group think, we never would have even been a country. We wouldn't have next Friday off [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=1995.6s)]
*  and most of us would have British accents. We'd also have no reason to get drunk and blow our [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=2001.4399999999998s)]
*  fingers off. Shout out to Stumpy Carl. I'll never forget you, brother. Think about it. It was probably [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=2006.56s)]
*  pretty hard to be the first dude to be like, hey, you know what? These taxes are insane. I want to [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=2014.6399999999999s)]
*  be free from the British. Let's dump all their tea into the harbor. Which by the way, was like [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=2020.08s)]
*  such a Boston thing to do. Dump the tea now so generations later can drink Dunkin. [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=2024.24s)]
*  But if social media had been around in 1773, the dude who had that idea might have been too afraid [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=2031.76s)]
*  of being recorded, posted, and canceled to have ever expressed it. The freedom to express unpopular [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=2038.16s)]
*  opinions is also how we got anti-war voices on the right in the first place, which is something we [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=2044.0s)]
*  probably thought we'd never see just a few decades ago, especially. So if someone says they don't [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=2048.88s)]
*  agree with you, embrace it and invite them to spill some tea together. Welcome tonight's guests. [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=2054.4s)]

*  Kennedy, I feel like it's normal to be skeptical. You'd have a lot of reasons to be skeptical of [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=2103.12s)]
*  the government or the media, especially when it comes to war, but a lot of stuff because of how [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=2109.44s)]
*  much we've been lied to. Yes, I mean, you put together a great list of things and it's always [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=2112.96s)]
*  such an important reminder to show people how the government has completely hoodwinked us. [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=2118.56s)]
*  And if it weren't for skeptics, we would all still be standing six feet apart from each other, [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=2124.48s)]
*  wearing masks. Yeah, absolutely. And thank God there were people who put their careers [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=2130.48s)]
*  and their reputations on the line to challenge the status quo. And that's absolutely fine. And [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=2135.28s)]
*  it's also okay to say, I don't want to get us into another war that we don't have a terminus for. [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=2140.8s)]
*  And I really hope to God that this was completely successful, that this was surgical, [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=2149.2s)]
*  and this is the way the military will keep us safe going forward. That would be amazing. But [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=2154.32s)]
*  unfortunately, the thing that we still need to determine that is time. And I have to give Brian [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=2160.3199999999997s)]
*  Stelter any credit for anything because he really is a giant human potato who's obsessed [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=2166.08s)]
*  with Emily Campanio. Really, really creepy and I said, I did say spill the tea like in front of [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=2172.3999999999996s)]

*  two inches and a half a glass of Chardonnay wave from humping her leg. Wow. You never get to hear [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=2187.36s)]
*  these stories on your shows. Kill me. But the point is like, yes, we still do need time. And [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=2194.32s)]
*  it is okay to have faith in the military. And it's also okay to question the security apparatus of [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=2201.44s)]
*  this country because in the past, they have spied on us and they have lied to us. So hope for the [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=2207.84s)]
*  best, but always be skeptical of what could be the worst. I agree. Yes. Thank you. Thank you. I [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=2213.04s)]
*  agree. Emily, you said in the green room that you have an unpopular opinion that you feel really [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=2219.44s)]
*  strongly about. Yes. And I'm going to say it. Okay. That on the airplane. Oh, God. First of all, [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=2228.56s)]
*  I am the window seat and the shade is up. The shade remains up. I don't care what time of day [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=2235.6s)]
*  it is. No, especially during the day. You monster. I have to be able to look out the window. That's [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=2242.16s)]
*  the whole point. Literally. By the way, the symbol, if I am sleeping and I have an eye mask on my face [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=2249.6s)]
*  while I'm sleeping in the window seat with a shade up, that is not an invitation for someone to reach [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=2255.52s)]
*  over and shut the shade, which has happened to me before. Because when I wake up, I'm like the whole [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=2259.92s)]
*  point is like the mask is the shade. The actual shade I need to see out. So you sit on the plane [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=2263.68s)]
*  with the window open and a mask on your own. Totally. Totally. Because otherwise like a floating [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=2269.6s)]
*  coffin. I have to be able to see out everyone who like has no cares in the world when the whole [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=2275.2s)]
*  thing is dark and you're just like in a submarine. That to me is the most frightening experience ever [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=2280.48s)]
*  shade up unequivocally. And that's why I get the window seat. And if anyone asks, can you please [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=2285.2s)]
*  shut it? I say no. Guess what? How about no, maybe a little. Whoa. Very unpopular. I know. [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=2290.16s)]
*  Full of monsters. Resist. Guy, do you have one? Yeah. So first of all, you disgust me. [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=2297.2s)]
*  So this is a true story. About 10 years ago, I had my book out with Mary Catherine Ham and we [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=2308.16s)]
*  hung out with a CNN personality. Okay. And we had a few drinks and this person suggested, [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=2314.08s)]
*  let's go around the group and admit our unpopular opinions that we would never say publicly. I'm [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=2320.3999999999996s)]
*  like, I don't know who, I don't trust you. I'm definitely not going to tell you my secret opinions. [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=2326.0s)]
*  So I sort of finessed it. We went around the circle and this person went last and kind of looks [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=2331.12s)]
*  around furtively and says, I watch your network way more than my own network. And I immediately go. [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=2338.08s)]
*  Wolf Blitzer, how dare you? No, I shot right back immediately. Yeah, so does the whole country. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=2346.08s)]
*  Right, so that is a popular opinion. Nailed it. Yeah. [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=2354.48s)]
*  I will say for the record, it was not stelter. It is, and also it's just the production value alone. [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=2359.9199999999996s)]
*  He just watches Emily's reels on Instagram. That's all he watches. [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=2365.68s)]
*  You can share an unpopular opinion or you can talk about war and bombs. [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=2370.24s)]
*  I choose war and bombs. Thank you. So I would say that I'm going to take a little bit with what [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=2374.32s)]
*  you were saying. You know, you're right to question, you're right to do this and you can have all the [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=2384.8s)]
*  questions you want. You could want for the best. A couple of things when it comes to Iran, the [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=2388.8s)]
*  nuclear weapons are part of it, probably the most serious, but for 46 years they've been trying to [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=2392.7200000000003s)]
*  say, we hate you. We will kill you whenever we see you. And 600 during Iraq, the hostages in 1979, [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=2397.36s)]
*  they really haven't stopped. This is the first time we say we're getting tired of it. And by the [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=2404.08s)]
*  way, we happen to have the bigger military and the better intelligence. What I think the other [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=2408.48s)]
*  thing is it's underappreciated, but to build on the CNN point is the story. You can say a legitimate [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=2413.84s)]
*  intelligence service by looking at pictures, nobody on the ground said that nothing was really [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=2420.48s)]
*  hurt, even though they can't see 600 feet in the ground and the centrifuges are fine. [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=2425.12s)]
*  That's fine. If you want to say it, but you should also be honest and say it's under low confidence. [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=2429.6800000000003s)]
*  And this is the first take. But instead, for CNN, where Brian Stelter used to work, does he still [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=2436.88s)]
*  work? He was hired back early. U.S. intelligence suggests strikes on Iran did not destroy the [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=2442.1600000000003s)]
*  nuclear sites. And then the whole thing is about how much how hard they worked and what they did [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=2447.6800000000003s)]
*  and how it was totally ineffective. And it was just like the Trump arrangement syndrome [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=2454.32s)]
*  through the intelligence and everyone who says that Donald Trump is paranoid and he fired too [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=2459.28s)]
*  many people and he keeps his circle too small. This is why, because the minute it gets big, [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=2463.28s)]
*  they go out of their way to whatever he does, find a way to undermine him. And then he spends [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=2470.1600000000003s)]
*  a whole day trying to say that this is not the gold standard. I've got to say that was a well [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=2474.48s)]
*  thought out answer, but someone's probably just going to clip you saying I choose Warren bombs. [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=2480.16s)]
*  I know. Thank you. All right. All right. Before we go, come see me in Nebraska, July 12th and 13th. [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=2485.68s)]
*  That is the only show I booked before I was diagnosed with cancer and my world turned upside [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTLe7ea5l1Q&t=2496.3999999999996s)]
