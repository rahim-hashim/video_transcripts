# STATE OF EMERGENCY: Netanyahu CONFIRMS Israel strikes targeted Iranian nuclear facility
**Fox News - World News:** [June 12, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVj01Akbioc)
*  Let's go back to Trey Yngst. He's in Jerusalem. What's new, Trey? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVj01Akbioc&t=0.0s)]
*  Jesse, a lot of developments for you. We are hearing tonight from Israel's Prime Minister [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVj01Akbioc&t=5.2s)]
*  Benjamin Netanyahu, who confirmed these strikes took place with dozens of Israeli jets in the [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVj01Akbioc&t=9.28s)]
*  skies over Iran. The Prime Minister is saying that the Netan's nuclear facility, this is the main [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVj01Akbioc&t=16.080000000000002s)]
*  enrichment site for Iran's nuclear program, was targeted in these strikes along with a number of [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVj01Akbioc&t=22.0s)]
*  other locations. As we look forward here, there are a number of things to talk about, but again, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVj01Akbioc&t=28.32s)]
*  Israel tonight is bracing for the possibility that there is a direct response in the coming [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVj01Akbioc&t=33.84s)]
*  hours from the Iranian regime. Iran's top IRGC officials had promised that if their nuclear [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVj01Akbioc&t=40.480000000000004s)]
*  facilities were attacked, that they would target Israel directly with a variety of missiles that [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVj01Akbioc&t=46.8s)]
*  they did not use in previous strikes against Israel. Remember, last April, Jesse, was the [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVj01Akbioc&t=52.16s)]
*  first time that Iran ever directly attacked Israel, but the timeline here is very important. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVj01Akbioc&t=57.76s)]
*  On April 1st of 2024, a top IRGC commander was killed in an Israeli strike in Damascus, Syria. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVj01Akbioc&t=63.599999999999994s)]
*  It took the Iranians 12 days to respond to that strike that took place. Now, whenever the Iranians [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVj01Akbioc&t=71.03999999999999s)]
*  targeted Israel again in October of 2024, the response window was even shorter. Israeli officials [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVj01Akbioc&t=77.92s)]
*  are concerned tonight that the response window to this strike that is targeting the nuclear [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVj01Akbioc&t=84.72s)]
*  facilities in Iran will be even shorter than those previous attacks. And so again, as we look forward [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVj01Akbioc&t=89.76s)]
*  here, Israel has declared a state of emergency. Special instructions have been texted to every [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVj01Akbioc&t=95.28s)]
*  person in this country to stay close to bomb shelters, and the country's Prime Minister, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVj01Akbioc&t=100.96000000000001s)]
*  Benjamin Netanyahu, is releasing his first statement tonight, and I will read you just a [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVj01Akbioc&t=105.6s)]
*  little bit more of what the Prime Minister said. He said, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVj01Akbioc&t=110.24s)]
*  in what could take place again with the scheduled six rounds of talks supposed to happen on Sunday. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVj01Akbioc&t=140.24s)]
*  Jesse? [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVj01Akbioc&t=145.84s)]
