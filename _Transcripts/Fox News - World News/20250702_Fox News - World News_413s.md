# NATO chief warns of North Korean troops fighting for Russia
**Fox News - World News:** [July 02, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQQHdLNuRnM)
*  Russia has about 50,000 troops stationed outside of Sumi in Ukraine. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQQHdLNuRnM&t=0.0s)]
*  What will you do if Russia authorizes an offensive? [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQQHdLNuRnM&t=5.5200000000000005s)]
*  We'll see what happens. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQQHdLNuRnM&t=8.96s)]
*  I'm watching it very closely. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQQHdLNuRnM&t=9.96s)]
*  So President Trump has his eye on Russia over its massive deployment to the Ukraine border, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQQHdLNuRnM&t=12.280000000000001s)]
*  capping off a month of record drone attacks. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQQHdLNuRnM&t=16.36s)]
*  It comes as one of Vladimir Putin's top officials, Sergey Lavrov, predicts NATO's increased defense [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQQHdLNuRnM&t=18.96s)]
*  spending will only lead to NATO's collapse? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQQHdLNuRnM&t=25.18s)]
*  Let's ask NATO General Secretary Mark Rutte, who joins us now. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQQHdLNuRnM&t=28.48s)]
*  Mr. Secretary, after your fantastic conference, almost all the Allies agreed. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQQHdLNuRnM&t=31.72s)]
*  Now you have Vladimir Putin seeing the increase in defense spending and saying it's going [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQQHdLNuRnM&t=37.76s)]
*  to cause your collapse through his foreign secretary. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQQHdLNuRnM&t=41.84s)]
*  Your thoughts? [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQQHdLNuRnM&t=45.2s)]
*  Well, you know, it was a huge foreign policy win for President Trump and his excellent [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQQHdLNuRnM&t=46.2s)]
*  foreign policy team, with Matt Whitaker, the ambassador here, and Marco Rubio and Pete [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQQHdLNuRnM&t=52.400000000000006s)]
*  Hackshad. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQQHdLNuRnM&t=57.44s)]
*  And finally, now the Europeans have committed to pay the same amount of money as the U.S. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQQHdLNuRnM&t=58.44s)]
*  is paying. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQQHdLNuRnM&t=63.12s)]
*  And this is a discussion going on since Eisenhower. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQQHdLNuRnM&t=64.12s)]
*  And by the way, we also need to pay for this for building up NATO further, because we know [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQQHdLNuRnM&t=67.2s)]
*  the Russia threat is there. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQQHdLNuRnM&t=71.92s)]
*  And then to Lavrov, I mean, he's for a minister of Russia, I think since the birth of Jesus [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQQHdLNuRnM&t=73.28s)]
*  Christ. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQQHdLNuRnM&t=78.84s)]
*  And since then, nothing, anything useful came out of his mouth. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQQHdLNuRnM&t=80.12s)]
*  So let's not pay too much attention to Mr. Lavrov. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQQHdLNuRnM&t=83.2s)]
*  So how do you feel about North Korea's participation now going from a few thousand up to maybe [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQQHdLNuRnM&t=86.24s)]
*  30,000? [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQQHdLNuRnM&t=92.36s)]
*  Well, I'm extremely worried about the fact that this is not a European conflict, Russia's [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQQHdLNuRnM&t=93.36s)]
*  unprovoked war of aggression against Ukraine. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQQHdLNuRnM&t=101.83999999999999s)]
*  For some time now, we know that China is supporting Russia's war effort with sanctioned circumvention, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQQHdLNuRnM&t=104.88s)]
*  with dual-use goods. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQQHdLNuRnM&t=110.24s)]
*  And to your point, North Korea has provided already troops now fighting Europe. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQQHdLNuRnM&t=111.6s)]
*  Can you imagine that you have a war in Europe going on where North Koreans are helping the [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQQHdLNuRnM&t=116.52s)]
*  Russians to fight that war? [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQQHdLNuRnM&t=121.28s)]
*  And indeed, this report that these numbers could increase. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQQHdLNuRnM&t=122.64s)]
*  And don't, let's not be naive. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQQHdLNuRnM&t=126.88s)]
*  Russia is paying for this support. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQQHdLNuRnM&t=129.32s)]
*  So North Korea is getting long-range missile technology in return, which then makes North [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQQHdLNuRnM&t=131.16s)]
*  Korea an even bigger threat to the U.S. mainland. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQQHdLNuRnM&t=136.95999999999998s)]
*  So this is all interconnected. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQQHdLNuRnM&t=139.76000000000002s)]
*  And even the mullahs in Iran are involved here with their drone technology. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQQHdLNuRnM&t=141.96s)]
*  And it's like they're sending North Korean troops into a woodchip or they're all coming [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQQHdLNuRnM&t=145.52s)]
*  back in caskets, but it doesn't seem to matter. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQQHdLNuRnM&t=148.6s)]
*  How do you feel about the report today that the U.S. is stopping shipments of patriots [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQQHdLNuRnM&t=151.68s)]
*  and some artillery because they say we're running short of it for our own arsenal? [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQQHdLNuRnM&t=157.04000000000002s)]
*  Have you heard about that directly from the president and from the secretary of defense? [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQQHdLNuRnM&t=161.92000000000002s)]
*  Or are you just reading about it like I am? [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQQHdLNuRnM&t=166.32s)]
*  No, these reports are really new. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQQHdLNuRnM&t=168.48000000000002s)]
*  And I totally understand that the U.S. always has to make sure that the own interests are [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQQHdLNuRnM&t=171.44000000000003s)]
*  covered. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQQHdLNuRnM&t=176.52s)]
*  But when it comes to Ukraine, in the short term, Ukraine cannot do without all the support [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQQHdLNuRnM&t=177.52s)]
*  it can get when it comes to ammunition and to air defense systems. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQQHdLNuRnM&t=182.84s)]
*  And last week, the president and President Zelensky had a very good discussion, particularly [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQQHdLNuRnM&t=187.68s)]
*  focusing on air defense systems. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQQHdLNuRnM&t=192.24s)]
*  Yes, I understand the U.S. has to take care of its stockpiles. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQQHdLNuRnM&t=195.04s)]
*  And at the same time, we have to allow for some flexibility here. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQQHdLNuRnM&t=198.48s)]
*  Europeans in the meantime are really stepping up. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQQHdLNuRnM&t=202.8s)]
*  They have now committed 35 billion for Ukraine this year. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQQHdLNuRnM&t=205.84s)]
*  So when it comes to the burden shift from the U.S. to Europe, that's taking place. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQQHdLNuRnM&t=209.52s)]
*  But we cannot do without the practical U.S. support. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQQHdLNuRnM&t=213.52s)]
*  This is also in the U.S. interest for Ukraine not to lose this war and having a huge Russia [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQQHdLNuRnM&t=218.4s)]
*  now on the border of Europe. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQQHdLNuRnM&t=225.68s)]
*  And of course, a secure Europe also means a secure U.S. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQQHdLNuRnM&t=227.6s)]
*  So this is all completely connected. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQQHdLNuRnM&t=230.64s)]
*  Mr. Secretary, I'm getting the sense that the president of the United States is getting [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQQHdLNuRnM&t=232.88s)]
*  fed up with Vladimir Putin. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQQHdLNuRnM&t=236.0s)]
*  He's given him a lot of chances, take some political hits, giving him an opening. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQQHdLNuRnM&t=237.6s)]
*  And I think that Putin is not taking advantage of that opening for peace. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQQHdLNuRnM&t=242.32s)]
*  Do you think the president is getting fed up? [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQQHdLNuRnM&t=246.72s)]
*  Well, I'm not going to speak for the president, but let me say that I commend him for the [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQQHdLNuRnM&t=250.64s)]
*  fact that he broke the death lock with Vladimir Putin when he came into office. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQQHdLNuRnM&t=254.64s)]
*  He was the only one who could do this. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQQHdLNuRnM&t=258.48s)]
*  So that conversation started. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQQHdLNuRnM&t=260.48s)]
*  And we now have to make sure that Ukraine has what it needs, that Russia will come to [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQQHdLNuRnM&t=262.32s)]
*  the conference table and have a meaningful dialogue with Ukraine. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQQHdLNuRnM&t=267.2s)]
*  So not sending some historian talking about what happened in 70, whatever, [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQQHdLNuRnM&t=270.72s)]
*  but having meaningful talks about today's realities. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQQHdLNuRnM&t=275.84s)]
*  And the Ukrainians already, they want a ceasefire the minute they can get it. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQQHdLNuRnM&t=279.03999999999996s)]
*  And they want to get to a peace deal. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQQHdLNuRnM&t=283.44s)]
*  And it will mean indeed that we have to look for means, including potentially sanctions [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQQHdLNuRnM&t=285.28s)]
*  and other means to put somewhat more pressure on the Russians. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQQHdLNuRnM&t=290.4s)]
*  But I really want to thank President Trump for what he has been doing, both on getting [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQQHdLNuRnM&t=293.44s)]
*  the Europeans to pay up for our collective defense in NATO, as well as on getting this [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQQHdLNuRnM&t=297.84s)]
*  conversation going with the Russians. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQQHdLNuRnM&t=304.15999999999997s)]
*  And Mr. Secretary, I know he has great respect for you too, but this is the moment out of [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQQHdLNuRnM&t=305.84s)]
*  the whole weekend that stands out that people are talking about. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQQHdLNuRnM&t=310.0s)]
*  They don't necessarily follow international politics. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQQHdLNuRnM&t=313.12s)]
*  And here's the exchange on June 25th. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQQHdLNuRnM&t=315.59999999999997s)]
*  You know, they fight like hell. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQQHdLNuRnM&t=319.44s)]
*  You can't stop them. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQQHdLNuRnM&t=320.88s)]
*  Let them fight for about two or three minutes. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQQHdLNuRnM&t=321.76s)]
*  Then it's easy to stop them. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQQHdLNuRnM&t=323.84s)]
*  And then daddy has to sometimes use strong language. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQQHdLNuRnM&t=325.2s)]
*  He does the strong language. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQQHdLNuRnM&t=327.76s)]
*  Every once in a while you have to use a certain word. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQQHdLNuRnM&t=329.36s)]
*  So they call him daddy. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQQHdLNuRnM&t=331.2s)]
*  He's certainly rung out. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQQHdLNuRnM&t=334.32s)]
*  And Secretary of State Marco Rubio, I've never seen him smile so much. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQQHdLNuRnM&t=335.92s)]
*  Your reaction to that reaction? [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQQHdLNuRnM&t=339.76s)]
*  That was great. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQQHdLNuRnM&t=344.32s)]
*  I mean, what happens, don't forget that before President Trump went on the plane, [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQQHdLNuRnM&t=344.96s)]
*  that Israelis and the Iranians had committed to a ceasefire. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQQHdLNuRnM&t=348.96s)]
*  And then that morning before he boarded that plane, they said, well, we might get at each [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQQHdLNuRnM&t=352.32s)]
*  other's throats again. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQQHdLNuRnM&t=357.12s)]
*  And then President Trump clearly became very angry and he used some strong language [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQQHdLNuRnM&t=358.48s)]
*  to underscore that. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQQHdLNuRnM&t=363.28000000000003s)]
*  So what I was saying that it sometimes comes to the leader and history may. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQQHdLNuRnM&t=364.24s)]
*  President Trump, the leader of the US, the leader of the free world to then [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQQHdLNuRnM&t=370.08000000000004s)]
*  basically say, here's the red line. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQQHdLNuRnM&t=374.32s)]
*  I don't accept it. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQQHdLNuRnM&t=376.0s)]
*  And when it comes to that particular comment, I was really taken by the after movie, [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQQHdLNuRnM&t=376.96000000000004s)]
*  the White House brought out daddy's home. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQQHdLNuRnM&t=382.64000000000004s)]
*  So it was really funny. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQQHdLNuRnM&t=386.16s)]
*  General Secretary, it's a very consequential time for NATO and they seem to be stepping [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQQHdLNuRnM&t=388.23999999999995s)]
*  up to the challenge. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQQHdLNuRnM&t=392.32s)]
*  Thanks to your leadership. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQQHdLNuRnM&t=393.59999999999997s)]
*  Thanks so much for joining us today. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQQHdLNuRnM&t=394.71999999999997s)]
