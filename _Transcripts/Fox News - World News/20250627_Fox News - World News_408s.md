# Trump says he’d bomb Iran AGAIN ‘without question’ if they did this
**Fox News - World News:** [June 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXFafZfAMfQ)
*  Well, as we wait here for President Trump at the White House to speak, a House divided [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXFafZfAMfQ&t=0.0s)]
*  over who leaked the low-confidence preliminary assessment of Iran's nuclear facilities. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXFafZfAMfQ&t=8.22s)]
*  But history shows almost all leaks come out of the executive branch. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXFafZfAMfQ&t=16.56s)]
*  The low-confidence preliminary assessment that was leaked, sadly and dangerously, probably [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXFafZfAMfQ&t=20.76s)]
*  from this body. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXFafZfAMfQ&t=26.44s)]
*  OK, so let's bring in Fox News chief political analyst, Brit Hume. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXFafZfAMfQ&t=29.76s)]
*  Brit, good to see you. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXFafZfAMfQ&t=33.0s)]
*  Happy Friday to you. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXFafZfAMfQ&t=34.0s)]
*  A lot of finger pointing going on in Washington, which is pretty par for the norm. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXFafZfAMfQ&t=35.0s)]
*  The president blames Democrats for this leak as the White House really wages this war on [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXFafZfAMfQ&t=40.24s)]
*  the leaker and they want to prosecute this leaker as quickly as possible. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXFafZfAMfQ&t=47.400000000000006s)]
*  How confident are you that we'll ever know who the leaker is? [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXFafZfAMfQ&t=51.400000000000006s)]
*  Because we're still waiting to find out who the leaker is of the DAB's decision. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXFafZfAMfQ&t=56.86s)]
*  That's right, Aisha, and there have been a lot more leak investigations than there have [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXFafZfAMfQ&t=61.9s)]
*  been leakers found and a lot more leakers than leakers investigated. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXFafZfAMfQ&t=65.3s)]
*  So you know, look, they may find out who leaked this, but I don't think it matters very much. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXFafZfAMfQ&t=69.22s)]
*  What mattered, of course, was the play that the story got. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXFafZfAMfQ&t=75.94s)]
*  A very preliminary report rated low confidence and it dominated national news for several [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXFafZfAMfQ&t=79.5s)]
*  days because media outlets picked it up and ran with it and treated it more seriously [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXFafZfAMfQ&t=84.98s)]
*  than I think it manifestly deserved. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXFafZfAMfQ&t=89.66s)]
*  So that would be my point of contention here. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXFafZfAMfQ&t=92.26s)]
*  And you know, the administration has criticized the media about this and justly so, I think. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXFafZfAMfQ&t=95.66s)]
*  Well, it's interesting because Congress finally got its classified briefing that it had been [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXFafZfAMfQ&t=101.10000000000001s)]
*  begging and pleading for. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXFafZfAMfQ&t=105.26s)]
*  Democrats came out of it not saying, not opposing, you know, that this facility was in fact [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXFafZfAMfQ&t=107.22s)]
*  destroyed. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXFafZfAMfQ&t=114.58s)]
*  In fact, they were arguing over the words that are being used to describe what happened [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXFafZfAMfQ&t=115.58s)]
*  to this facility. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXFafZfAMfQ&t=121.1s)]
*  So Chris Murphy, the senator from Connecticut, said, I just don't think the president was [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXFafZfAMfQ&t=122.1s)]
*  telling the truth when he said this program was obliterated. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXFafZfAMfQ&t=126.78s)]
*  Britt, does it matter what language you're using? [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXFafZfAMfQ&t=130.94s)]
*  The program has been set back. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXFafZfAMfQ&t=134.22s)]
*  Well, the program has clearly been set back and whether it was set back for months, years [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXFafZfAMfQ&t=136.62s)]
*  or forever is of some obvious interest. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXFafZfAMfQ&t=140.9s)]
*  But there's a broader picture here. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXFafZfAMfQ&t=145.22000000000003s)]
*  And I don't think we need to pay a lot of attention to the Chris Murphys of the world. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXFafZfAMfQ&t=146.62s)]
*  He's a diehard anti-Trump partisan who says all kinds of exotic things. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXFafZfAMfQ&t=149.70000000000002s)]
*  And I wouldn't pay him a lot of mind. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXFafZfAMfQ&t=155.66000000000003s)]
*  I think we need to look kind of with a broader lens here at the situation in the Mideast [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXFafZfAMfQ&t=158.02s)]
*  and well beyond. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXFafZfAMfQ&t=164.98000000000002s)]
*  For example, a year ago at this time, Iran was on its way to building a nuclear weapon. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXFafZfAMfQ&t=166.3s)]
*  How close is anybody's guess? [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXFafZfAMfQ&t=171.34s)]
*  It had its robust military forces in place. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXFafZfAMfQ&t=174.3s)]
*  It had a feared Revolutionary Guard command structure in place. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXFafZfAMfQ&t=176.86s)]
*  It had proxies located all around the Mideast, Hamas and Hezbollah being conspicuous examples [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXFafZfAMfQ&t=182.78s)]
*  of that. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXFafZfAMfQ&t=188.70000000000002s)]
*  And today, it doesn't have any of that. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXFafZfAMfQ&t=189.78s)]
*  And it also had allies in the world. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXFafZfAMfQ&t=193.22000000000003s)]
*  Russia being the most obvious example. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXFafZfAMfQ&t=195.17999999999998s)]
*  And look at Russia, if you will, in the wake of all that has happened in the Middle East, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXFafZfAMfQ&t=198.57999999999998s)]
*  in the wake of the fall of the Assad regime, which was an ally in Syria, an ally of Russia, [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXFafZfAMfQ&t=202.17999999999998s)]
*  a country to whose rescue Putin and his regime had come before. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXFafZfAMfQ&t=208.82s)]
*  But this time around, they're too tied up in the situation in Ukraine to do anything [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXFafZfAMfQ&t=214.22s)]
*  about it. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXFafZfAMfQ&t=218.1s)]
*  Similarly, Iran has hit. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXFafZfAMfQ&t=219.1s)]
*  Wouldn't the Iranian regime love to have had some help from its ally Russia, whom it's [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXFafZfAMfQ&t=221.94s)]
*  been supplying drones and other military equipment? [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXFafZfAMfQ&t=226.74s)]
*  Russia didn't lift a finger. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXFafZfAMfQ&t=232.66s)]
*  Neither did its friend in China, which gets its oil from Iran. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXFafZfAMfQ&t=234.29999999999998s)]
*  They didn't do anything either. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXFafZfAMfQ&t=238.54s)]
*  And one of the important things I think I see is whatever ends up being the final battle [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXFafZfAMfQ&t=240.18s)]
*  assessment from this bombing, the fact that the United States could pull it off and could [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXFafZfAMfQ&t=246.38s)]
*  travel there unseen, undetected, and unshot at by the Iranian regime and do what it did [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXFafZfAMfQ&t=253.01999999999998s)]
*  on top of what Israel had already done is astonishing. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXFafZfAMfQ&t=262.53999999999996s)]
*  And I think it rearranges the chessboard on the international scene in a way that the [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXFafZfAMfQ&t=266.97999999999996s)]
*  whole 12-day war does in a way that I never anticipated could have happened this quickly. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXFafZfAMfQ&t=272.14s)]
*  I want to quickly play this soundbite for you from the president today in the briefing [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXFafZfAMfQ&t=277.62s)]
*  room. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXFafZfAMfQ&t=281.21999999999997s)]
*  It kind of got overlooked, but he called the Ayatollah a liar because he's spinning this [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXFafZfAMfQ&t=282.21999999999997s)]
*  to his own people, trying to say that Iran won this war with Israel. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXFafZfAMfQ&t=285.74s)]
*  And then this is the president saying that he would bomb Iran again if it had to come [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXFafZfAMfQ&t=289.86s)]
*  to that. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXFafZfAMfQ&t=294.18s)]
*  Watch this. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXFafZfAMfQ&t=295.18s)]
*  If the intelligence reports conclude that Iran can enrich uranium to a level that concerns [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXFafZfAMfQ&t=296.18s)]
*  you, would you consider bombing the country again? [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXFafZfAMfQ&t=302.42s)]
*  Sure. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXFafZfAMfQ&t=305.46s)]
*  Without question, absolutely. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXFafZfAMfQ&t=306.46s)]
*  I want to get what you make of that because I think what you're saying here is that the [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXFafZfAMfQ&t=307.46s)]
*  story that's getting missed is what this has done to Iran, the corner that it has put Iran [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXFafZfAMfQ&t=311.02s)]
*  in where it has no friends, it has no allies, and it's in a pretty bad bind. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXFafZfAMfQ&t=317.3s)]
*  Well, the other thing is about what the president said, Aisha, is we've proved we could do that. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXFafZfAMfQ&t=324.22s)]
*  They didn't see it coming. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXFafZfAMfQ&t=330.06s)]
*  They didn't think it was coming. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXFafZfAMfQ&t=331.06s)]
*  They couldn't do anything about it. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXFafZfAMfQ&t=332.66s)]
*  They never got off a shot. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXFafZfAMfQ&t=333.66s)]
*  I'm not even sure their systems could see the B-2 bombers coming. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXFafZfAMfQ&t=335.90000000000003s)]
*  Israel has proved that it can take out their air defense system, which it had already done [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXFafZfAMfQ&t=340.46000000000004s)]
*  some time back, and that it could knock out much of their ballistic missile facilities. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXFafZfAMfQ&t=345.54s)]
*  That's something that presumably Israel and its ally the United States could do again [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXFafZfAMfQ&t=351.82s)]
*  if necessary. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXFafZfAMfQ&t=355.18s)]
*  Obviously, then the high total comes out and talks about this being a great victory for [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXFafZfAMfQ&t=356.18s)]
*  Iran and how he slapped the United States across the face, or however he put it, was [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXFafZfAMfQ&t=361.98s)]
*  palpably ridiculous, particularly in light of the extreme competency and proficiency [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXFafZfAMfQ&t=366.86s)]
*  shown by our military and our base there in Qatar when they fired 14 rockets at it and [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXFafZfAMfQ&t=371.92s)]
*  none of them got through. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXFafZfAMfQ&t=379.7s)]
*  So I think the International Chess Board has been reset probably for some time to come. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXFafZfAMfQ&t=381.58s)]
*  Absolutely, and we will see how long the Ayatollah can actually hang on to power in that country. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXFafZfAMfQ&t=387.5s)]
*  Brit Hume, always good to see you. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXFafZfAMfQ&t=392.5s)]
*  Have a great weekend. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXFafZfAMfQ&t=394.42s)]
*  Thank you, Aisha. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXFafZfAMfQ&t=395.42s)]
