# This is just the beginning: Israel Special Ops vet warns
**Fox News - World News:** [June 22, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkl1xNP4JOg)
*  Thank you. With us now our panel, Rabbi Chaim Mentz, Fox News contributor Kairan Skinner [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkl1xNP4JOg&t=0.0s)]
*  and Aaron Cohen, Israeli special operations veteran. Aaron, let me come to you first. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkl1xNP4JOg&t=5.88s)]
*  We heard President Trump there describe this as an attack against what is and has been [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkl1xNP4JOg&t=11.5s)]
*  the world's biggest state sponsor of terror. It seems impossible for any, I'm sure people [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkl1xNP4JOg&t=20.6s)]
*  will try, but it's impossible to argue any case against that. They have been for decades [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkl1xNP4JOg&t=27.58s)]
*  now the Iranians, the biggest state sponsor of terror in the world. That's right. They [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkl1xNP4JOg&t=33.82s)]
*  should have been designated a terrorist organization 39 years ago. Trump is spot on. He was spot [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkl1xNP4JOg&t=38.86s)]
*  on with his attack on Fordow. He had the intelligence. It was actionable. He didn't wait too long. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkl1xNP4JOg&t=45.82s)]
*  He made the decision before the threat continued to emerge, took the shot, successful operation. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkl1xNP4JOg&t=51.62s)]
*  But I can't help but think to believe, Jonathan, with my 25 years in this business, I don't [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkl1xNP4JOg&t=59.699999999999996s)]
*  think Fordow was the end. And that's the truth. I think Fordow was the beginning. And I'll [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkl1xNP4JOg&t=66.34s)]
*  tell you why. You can bury the centrifuge when this is over after this operation was [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkl1xNP4JOg&t=70.9s)]
*  just conducted. But you're not going to bury this regime without taking them down. And [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkl1xNP4JOg&t=77.98s)]
*  that's really where I come out with this. And I think that the real work here is just [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkl1xNP4JOg&t=84.14s)]
*  going to begin. I think it's going to be Israel taking point here. Like your other guest was [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkl1xNP4JOg&t=89.5s)]
*  saying earlier, we're going to continue doing all this work. We're going to continue hunting [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkl1xNP4JOg&t=93.94s)]
*  the leaders. We're going to continue hunting the Quds force. We're going to continue going [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkl1xNP4JOg&t=97.86s)]
*  after the planners. We're going to continue going after the engineers. They will all be [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkl1xNP4JOg&t=102.10000000000001s)]
*  hunted, but they'll have to be removed because at the end of the day, even though you took [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkl1xNP4JOg&t=107.04s)]
*  out the weapon, it's the narcissistic, radical Islamist running that terror organization [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkl1xNP4JOg&t=111.32000000000001s)]
*  which you set this up with is ultimately the ones who would have pulled the trigger and [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkl1xNP4JOg&t=120.2s)]
*  use that nuclear weapon. And we have to have an honest conversation about what happens [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkl1xNP4JOg&t=125.04s)]
*  if they remain in. So what's the next day look like? And I think those are the next [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkl1xNP4JOg&t=129.68s)]
*  conversations that we need to start having. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkl1xNP4JOg&t=134.60000000000002s)]
*  And Rabbi, talking of a regime change in Iran, we're hearing some statements from some of [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkl1xNP4JOg&t=136.52s)]
*  the Gulf states, Saudi Arabia, among them which are treading a careful line, not openly [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkl1xNP4JOg&t=143.44s)]
*  criticizing the U.S., but saying diplomacy is the only way forward. But it strikes me, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkl1xNP4JOg&t=150.74s)]
*  and you were making this point earlier, what they say publicly might not be what they're [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkl1xNP4JOg&t=157.36s)]
*  thinking privately. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkl1xNP4JOg&t=161.86s)]
*  100%, because you've got to realize, Saudi Arabia has millions of Muslims living in their [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkl1xNP4JOg&t=162.86s)]
*  country, and they are very much in control of their country, but at the same time, they [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkl1xNP4JOg&t=169.78s)]
*  don't know who tomorrow is going to be in Iran. That's number one. Number two, you're [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkl1xNP4JOg&t=175.5s)]
*  right. What kind of a regime change is going to be? There's a cancer. You can get out the [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkl1xNP4JOg&t=180.06s)]
*  machine. But if the mindset is still that because the Arabs love living, I shouldn't say Muslim, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkl1xNP4JOg&t=188.3s)]
*  but these kind of people love living with time. If I didn't get you today, I'll get [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkl1xNP4JOg&t=196.74s)]
*  you 60 years from now. Such people cannot ever get into power, and that is the biggest [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkl1xNP4JOg&t=202.3s)]
*  threat for history. Thank God we took care of a Hitler. Thank God we took care of a Stalin. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkl1xNP4JOg&t=209.66000000000003s)]
*  Thank God we took care of every single person that raises the power. But it seems like when [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkl1xNP4JOg&t=216.5s)]
*  it came to Iran, presidencies and many administrations were coddling them, saying, if you like us, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkl1xNP4JOg&t=221.46s)]
*  you're not going to hit us. At the same time, we heard in the streets, death to America. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkl1xNP4JOg&t=229.78s)]
*  So these types of leaders, it's not about regime change. It's more about thinking change, [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkl1xNP4JOg&t=235.34s)]
*  and that is the most important thing. These kind of people, your life will be better off [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkl1xNP4JOg&t=242.34s)]
*  if you stop thinking how I can murder everybody who doesn't think like me. And that's where [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkl1xNP4JOg&t=248.70000000000002s)]
*  I think is where we have to start thinking about tomorrow. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkl1xNP4JOg&t=253.5s)]
*  Kyron, there's been a lot of debate in the run-up to the second Trump presidency, in [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkl1xNP4JOg&t=256.9s)]
*  the first few months of the second Trump presidential term about whether this president is and would [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkl1xNP4JOg&t=264.34000000000003s)]
*  act as an isolationist. This seems to have put that debate to bed. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkl1xNP4JOg&t=272.02s)]
*  I think so, and it did something else. If you think about the 21st century, the Bush [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkl1xNP4JOg&t=277.26s)]
*  administration came in with some grand plans, and then they really got mugged by history [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkl1xNP4JOg&t=283.17999999999995s)]
*  with 9-11. And they had to pivot to the global war and terror. Much of that was happening [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkl1xNP4JOg&t=289.46s)]
*  in the rest of the world, although they tried to address it. They had to just focus on defeating [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkl1xNP4JOg&t=295.82s)]
*  terrorists, and they fought wars in the Middle East. Perhaps the wrong ones, but they did. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkl1xNP4JOg&t=303.26s)]
*  Donald Trump is the first U.S. president in the 21st century to develop a grand strategy [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkl1xNP4JOg&t=309.54s)]
*  that's not just about the global war and terror and not just about the Middle East. What does [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkl1xNP4JOg&t=318.15999999999997s)]
*  that mean? There are many in the new MAGA movement, the America First movement, the [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkl1xNP4JOg&t=323.26s)]
*  bipartisan elites who want to define for him what that grand strategy should be. And this [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkl1xNP4JOg&t=331.06s)]
*  moment is one in which Donald Trump has taken the reins and has defined it for himself. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkl1xNP4JOg&t=338.74s)]
*  That he's not an isolationist, he's not an interventionist, he's a peace strategist. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkl1xNP4JOg&t=346.74s)]
*  And I think that's what we saw in the last 24 or 48 hours. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkl1xNP4JOg&t=354.98s)]
*  It's interesting how many presidencies seem to be controlled or allow themselves to be [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkl1xNP4JOg&t=360.38s)]
*  controlled by foreign policy events. It seems to be a president, as you say, determined [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkl1xNP4JOg&t=368.12s)]
*  to take control of those events. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkl1xNP4JOg&t=375.6s)]
*  It is, and I think some are going to be quite upset with him that they did not prevail in [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkl1xNP4JOg&t=377.96s)]
*  their perspective. I know Mark Levin was really harshly criticized by the restrainers and [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkl1xNP4JOg&t=383.48s)]
*  the isolationists. Donald Trump is his own man. I don't understand why it's so difficult [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkl1xNP4JOg&t=391.52s)]
*  for many of his advisors and many of those in the larger and emerging conservative movement [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkl1xNP4JOg&t=398.52s)]
*  think he needs guidance from them. He's reading the globe fairly well, I would say. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkl1xNP4JOg&t=404.84000000000003s)]
*  Is this the president the world needed at the time it needed it, Aaron? [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkl1xNP4JOg&t=411.72s)]
*  Well, if you were to add up the amount of Americans killed, the amount of Israelis getting [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkl1xNP4JOg&t=416.72s)]
*  attacked daily, October 7th, the 1200 murdered, the 250, 60 kidnapped and taken into the tunnels, [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkl1xNP4JOg&t=422.72s)]
*  the Houthis, Hezbollah, Hassan Nasrallah for 20 years, while you were living in Israel [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkl1xNP4JOg&t=429.72s)]
*  and those missiles were coming over in the north, while Israel was in the southern border [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkl1xNP4JOg&t=438.72s)]
*  there at southern Lebanon. This is the president who has essentially helped their forward operating [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkl1xNP4JOg&t=442.12s)]
*  ally Israel take down Hezbollah, and now the nuclear bully of the last 40 years, Hassan [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkl1xNP4JOg&t=452.04s)]
*  Nasrallah. This is the president the world needed. There's no lollygagging with this [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkl1xNP4JOg&t=460.04s)]
*  guy. And like you said, he's his own man. He doesn't need advisors. He understands the [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkl1xNP4JOg&t=463.68s)]
*  global threat here, takes the shot when he needs to. He's just got certainty and moral [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkl1xNP4JOg&t=469.64000000000004s)]
*  clarity and I think it's interesting to see him get everybody else on the run and start [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkl1xNP4JOg&t=474.8s)]
*  getting everybody in line, but for the good of the world. And you know what? There's going [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkl1xNP4JOg&t=479.92s)]
*  to be this opposition and whatnot, but we don't have the luxury to deal with this nonsense [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkl1xNP4JOg&t=484.24s)]
*  with the other side right now. I'm into it and I like where it's going and I'm interested [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkl1xNP4JOg&t=488.16s)]
*  to see where it's going to continue to go. Interesting description of Israel as a forward [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkl1xNP4JOg&t=492.88000000000005s)]
*  operating ally. I'm going to get the rabbi's views on that a little bit later in the show. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkl1xNP4JOg&t=496.44s)]
*  We've got to run now, Rabbi. Kyron, Aaron, thank you so much. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkl1xNP4JOg&t=501.12s)]
