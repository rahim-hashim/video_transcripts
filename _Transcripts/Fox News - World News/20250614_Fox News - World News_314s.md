# Minnesota shootings: Army veteran warns lawmakers to be 'on guard'
**Fox News - World News:** [June 14, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCNJj-J04Q8)
*  For more, let's bring in Iowa Republican Congresswoman and former Army Lieutenant Colonel [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCNJj-J04Q8&t=0.0s)]
*  Marriott Miller Meeks, excuse me, triple M, Marriott Miller Meeks. Congressman, welcome. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCNJj-J04Q8&t=4.5600000000000005s)]
*  Thank you for being here. Great to be with you. Your thoughts on the horrible news of the day [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCNJj-J04Q8&t=11.28s)]
*  out of Minnesota, these people targeted lawmakers there in the state of Minnesota. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCNJj-J04Q8&t=15.84s)]
*  It's tragic and horrendous. Our hearts and our prayers certainly go out to the lawmakers, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCNJj-J04Q8&t=21.28s)]
*  their families, and you know, to the people of Minnesota and our delegation that we have to be [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCNJj-J04Q8&t=26.08s)]
*  on guard and be very watchful. And this was a law enforcement personnel from what we know. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCNJj-J04Q8&t=32.72s)]
*  But other than that, I don't want to say much because I don't know the motivation of this [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCNJj-J04Q8&t=38.64s)]
*  person. I don't want to foment conspiracy theories of why this happened. But we certainly saw, as you [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCNJj-J04Q8&t=42.239999999999995s)]
*  know, this week we had the congressional baseball game and there was the targeted attack on the [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCNJj-J04Q8&t=48.879999999999995s)]
*  Republicans at that time and Steve Scalise barely survived. And luckily he did survive [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCNJj-J04Q8&t=54.8s)]
*  and has just been courageous throughout all of this. We saw the assassinations on President Trump [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCNJj-J04Q8&t=61.04s)]
*  last year and then on judges or elected officials. But let me just say unequivocally, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCNJj-J04Q8&t=66.72s)]
*  whether they're judges, police, ICE, elected officials, government officials, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCNJj-J04Q8&t=72.47999999999999s)]
*  politically motivated violence is unacceptable period, full stop. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCNJj-J04Q8&t=78.4s)]
*  Um, Capitol Police obviously are watching this very closely as they have to protect you and [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCNJj-J04Q8&t=83.03999999999999s)]
*  your colleagues. What are you expecting to hear from them when you come back into session [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCNJj-J04Q8&t=88.16s)]
*  as they learn more about the investigation in Minnesota? [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCNJj-J04Q8&t=93.84s)]
*  Well, we know that leadership has already, you know, been in contact with the Sergeant of Arms [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCNJj-J04Q8&t=96.4s)]
*  and with Capitol Police. We're in district this coming week. So I think lawmakers are going to [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCNJj-J04Q8&t=100.96s)]
*  have to especially be on guard while they're in their districts. And, you know, all of us have had, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCNJj-J04Q8&t=106.4s)]
*  I think most of us have had protests. We've had people come up. I've had [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCNJj-J04Q8&t=113.12s)]
*  just last weekend at parades had people yelling things to me, but haven't been threatened, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCNJj-J04Q8&t=117.2s)]
*  but have been threatened before in the past. So, you know, lawmakers, elected officials need to [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCNJj-J04Q8&t=123.2s)]
*  be on their guard, be on their guard in their districts. I think it was a very wise thing for [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCNJj-J04Q8&t=128.16s)]
*  Governor Walz to call off and tell people not to attend protests, to stay at home [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCNJj-J04Q8&t=132.32s)]
*  in Minnesota. But I think that's wise for all of us. We can have disagreements, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCNJj-J04Q8&t=137.76s)]
*  but we should have discourse. We should have conversations. We should be able to say, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCNJj-J04Q8&t=141.92s)]
*  I disagree, but thank you. And typically what I do is I'll just tell people, thank you for sharing [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCNJj-J04Q8&t=146.07999999999998s)]
*  that with me. I know after the political violence where Leader Scalise was attacked, there's been [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCNJj-J04Q8&t=150.56s)]
*  discussions about perhaps the need to increase security so you all have more protection, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCNJj-J04Q8&t=156.88s)]
*  whether it's at your office, at your home, when you're back in district. Do you think that [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCNJj-J04Q8&t=163.12s)]
*  discussion, that debate will come up again? Well, I certainly think it will come up again. We know [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCNJj-J04Q8&t=167.28s)]
*  that when we receive threats that the Capitol Police investigates them, they work with local [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCNJj-J04Q8&t=172.48s)]
*  law enforcement to determine one, if they're a credible threat, number two, if they're just [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCNJj-J04Q8&t=177.35999999999999s)]
*  someone that's mouthing off for lack of a better term. And you don't want someone to be in jail [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCNJj-J04Q8&t=181.6s)]
*  because they're angry. But to that point, we have to be careful with our language. And this includes [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCNJj-J04Q8&t=187.2s)]
*  us as elected officials. We need to tone it down. We need to have the discourse and the disagreement [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCNJj-J04Q8&t=193.28s)]
*  and the difference in policy. But we really need to tone it down and set the stage for the American [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCNJj-J04Q8&t=199.28s)]
*  people that we can disagree, we can carry out differences at the ballot box, but political [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCNJj-J04Q8&t=204.79999999999998s)]
*  violence is not acceptable. One reason I wanted to have you on today is you serve 24 years in the [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCNJj-J04Q8&t=209.76s)]
*  United States Army. Thank you for your service. I'm curious what your service has done for you, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCNJj-J04Q8&t=214.64s)]
*  has meant to your life and your thoughts today as we celebrate 250 years of the United States Army. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCNJj-J04Q8&t=220.48s)]
*  Well, as you said, it's 250 years of the United States Army. The Army's birthday precedes that of [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCNJj-J04Q8&t=226.79999999999998s)]
*  our country and our Declaration of Independence as the Continental Army started us and helped [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCNJj-J04Q8&t=232.95999999999998s)]
*  through the American Revolution with George Washington as the head and the general of the Army. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCNJj-J04Q8&t=237.92s)]
*  I'm very proud of the service. I had my father had served in the Air Force with career Air Force, [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCNJj-J04Q8&t=243.11999999999998s)]
*  six of the eight children in my family, my husband, we met at Walter Reed here in Washington, DC. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCNJj-J04Q8&t=248.0s)]
*  He was a licensed practical nurse. I had just been promoted to lieutenant as a [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCNJj-J04Q8&t=254.23999999999998s)]
*  bachelor of science nurse and very proud and very humble to be able to have served in our nation's [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCNJj-J04Q8&t=258.4s)]
*  military. It's a wonderful thing to do. You learn a skill set, which I think we bring to us in Congress. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCNJj-J04Q8&t=264.24s)]
*  As you know, we have a four country caucus in Congress, which is a bipartisan group of military [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCNJj-J04Q8&t=270.24s)]
*  veterans. And we have been very instrumental in getting legislation passed and sometimes in very [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCNJj-J04Q8&t=275.36s)]
*  short order to include the global war on terror, which that monument to those who had served in the [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCNJj-J04Q8&t=280.48s)]
*  global war of terror will be on the mall and prior to when they die. Congresswoman Marionette Miller [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCNJj-J04Q8&t=285.76s)]
*  Meeks of the great state of Iowa. Thank you for your service. It's great to have you today. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCNJj-J04Q8&t=292.0s)]
*  It's great to be here and happy 250th birthday to the Army. Happy Flag Day and also happy birthday [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCNJj-J04Q8&t=295.76s)]
