# NEW: Judge accused of stranding ICE agents overseas in dangerous conditions
**Fox News - World News:** [June 06, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GUyF_wywi8)
*  Thank you, Bill. Thank you, Jackie. Hope you guys have a great weekend. We'll start with the Fox News alert Republicans making a big time push in their investigations into the alleged cover up a former president Biden's mental decline while he was in office. House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer now firing off his very first subpoena of the probe. The recipient, Biden's former White House doctor Kevin O'Connor. Good morning and thank you for joining us today. I'm Bill Mellugian in for Harris. This is the Faulkner Focus. Dr O'Connor refused a voluntary interview with the House panel. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GUyF_wywi8&t=0.0s)]
*  So now Comer is demanding he sit down for a formal deposition at the end of the month again via subpoena. This is all part of several investigations into this issue. The House now joined by Senate Republicans, the White House and the DOJ. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GUyF_wywi8&t=30.0s)]
*  They all want some answers on who was actually in charge during Biden's first term in office. Here's the president yesterday. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GUyF_wywi8&t=43.32s)]
*  He didn't have much of an idea what was going on. Whoever used the auto pen was the president. And that is wrong. It's illegal. It's so bad and it's so disrespectful to our country. I think it's the biggest scandal maybe in the last hundred years in this country. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GUyF_wywi8&t=49.56s)]
*  And we're also learning that the only pardon out of some fifteen hundred that Biden actually hand signed was his son Hunter's. In the meantime, Republican Senator John Cornyn says he tried to get congressional testimony from journalist Jake Tapper and Alex Thompson. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GUyF_wywi8&t=67.88s)]
*  The two of them apparently declined to cooperate, though, despite their new book dramatically highlighting the White House's cover up of Joe Biden's decline. Justice correspondent David Spunk tracking this story and a whole lot more for us. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GUyF_wywi8&t=84.4s)]
*  He is joining us live from D.C. this morning. Hi, David. Hi, Bill. In the House investigation, House Oversight Chairman James Comer wants Dr. Kevin O'Connor, the former White House doctor, to come in for that formal deposition on June 27th. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GUyF_wywi8&t=96.64s)]
*  After Comer says Dr. O'Connor just refused to cooperate, as you say, with a voluntary interview, Chairman Comer wrote to O'Connor, quote, given your connections with the Biden family, the committee sought to understand if you contributed to an effort to hide former President Biden's fitness to serve from the American people. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GUyF_wywi8&t=110.28s)]
*  But Bill, Democrats don't seem worried. Listen. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GUyF_wywi8&t=126.16s)]
*  It's totally desperate. You know, news alerts, my Republican colleagues, Joe Biden is no longer the president. They tried to impeach him in the last Congress. It was the most spectacular flop of an impeachment investigation in U.S. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GUyF_wywi8&t=129.04s)]
*  history. Now, the investigation on Capitol Hill just won another coming directly from the Oval Office. The president handed this hot potato to Attorney General Pam Bondi in a very public and direct way through a presidential memo released earlier this week for the world to see. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GUyF_wywi8&t=144.32s)]
*  Now, relating to this auto pen, presidents have used auto pens for decades to sign letters, pardons, proclamations and other official documents. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GUyF_wywi8&t=158.92s)]
*  Actually, Thomas Jefferson used one in early version of the machine. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GUyF_wywi8&t=166.12s)]
*  But President Trump believes others in the Biden orbit use the auto pen signature without President Biden's knowledge. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GUyF_wywi8&t=170.36s)]
*  Now, President Trump admitted to using the auto pen in the past, though he says that it was for documents he doesn't consider important. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GUyF_wywi8&t=177.24s)]
*  The former president, Joe Biden, is defending himself. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GUyF_wywi8&t=183.48000000000002s)]
*  Quote, let me be clear. I made the decisions during my presidency. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GUyF_wywi8&t=185.76000000000002s)]
*  I made the decisions about the pardons, executive orders, legislation and proclamations. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GUyF_wywi8&t=189.52s)]
*  Any suggestion that I didn't is ridiculous and false. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GUyF_wywi8&t=193.76000000000002s)]
*  End quote. When I asked Attorney General Pam Bondi's office about the investigation, the DOJ declined comment. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GUyF_wywi8&t=197.12s)]
*  Bill. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GUyF_wywi8&t=203.84s)]
*  And David James Comer warned that you can sit down with us voluntarily. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GUyF_wywi8&t=204.64000000000001s)]
*  If you don't, the subpoenas are going to come out. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GUyF_wywi8&t=207.68s)]
*  Here we go. David Spongweb in D.C. for us. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GUyF_wywi8&t=209.76000000000002s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GUyF_wywi8&t=212.32000000000002s)]
*  For more on this, we want to bring in Republican Congressman Ship Roy of Texas. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GUyF_wywi8&t=213.56s)]
*  He's a member of the House Judiciary Committee. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GUyF_wywi8&t=216.64000000000001s)]
*  Congressman, always great to see you. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GUyF_wywi8&t=218.64000000000001s)]
*  So again, we just talked about these subpoenas going out. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GUyF_wywi8&t=221.24s)]
*  I know you're on a different committee, but if you had Dr. O'Connor in front of you, what would your biggest question be to him? [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GUyF_wywi8&t=223.44s)]
*  Yeah, Bill, great to be on. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GUyF_wywi8&t=229.60000000000002s)]
*  And I did used to serve on the Oversight Committee. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GUyF_wywi8&t=230.76000000000002s)]
*  I'm on Judiciary now and other committees. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GUyF_wywi8&t=232.84s)]
*  But Jamie Comer is doing a great job. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GUyF_wywi8&t=234.8s)]
*  Of course, he should call Dr. O'Connor in before the committee to get to the heart of what the mental state of the president was. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GUyF_wywi8&t=236.56s)]
*  Because this isn't an issue about the use of an auto pen. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GUyF_wywi8&t=243.08s)]
*  Of course, presidents use auto pen. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GUyF_wywi8&t=245.96s)]
*  It's an issue of who was deciding who was making the decisions. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GUyF_wywi8&t=247.8s)]
*  That's what I want to know from the doctor. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GUyF_wywi8&t=252.0s)]
*  What was the mental capacity of the president? [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GUyF_wywi8&t=253.64000000000001s)]
*  Look, we obviously know in the her report who he said, you know, this guy is not all there. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GUyF_wywi8&t=255.28s)]
*  Right. And that he's a aging man who, you know, you wouldn't put on the stand. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GUyF_wywi8&t=259.48s)]
*  That was a big clue. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GUyF_wywi8&t=264.32s)]
*  It was one of the reasons I went to the floor last year in the House and I said that the vice president should be asked to invoke the 25th Amendment. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GUyF_wywi8&t=265.48s)]
*  And of course, Democrats ran away from it. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GUyF_wywi8&t=271.71999999999997s)]
*  And you had the White House press secretary who now is all of a sudden finding religion and becoming an independent writing a book who was out there saying, I can't keep up with the president. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GUyF_wywi8&t=273.71999999999997s)]
*  And half my colleagues were all saying, oh, he's sharp. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GUyF_wywi8&t=281.59999999999997s)]
*  He's great. But the president of the United States was not all there and everybody in America knows it. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GUyF_wywi8&t=283.8s)]
*  So who was making the decisions? [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GUyF_wywi8&t=288.52s)]
*  Who was deciding where our military should be? [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GUyF_wywi8&t=290.44s)]
*  Who was making decisions about national security, about pardons? [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GUyF_wywi8&t=292.8s)]
*  Who was signing these things? [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GUyF_wywi8&t=295.88s)]
*  Because I think there was a cadre of radical leftists around the president in the White House making decisions and the president, President Trump, is exactly right. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GUyF_wywi8&t=297.28000000000003s)]
*  It is one of the biggest scandals in American history. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GUyF_wywi8&t=304.6s)]
*  Politico out now with a headline which essentially says whatever is uncovered in this probe could potentially be pretty damaging to Democrats and to the media as a whole. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GUyF_wywi8&t=307.24s)]
*  I want to read a little headline from it. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GUyF_wywi8&t=314.76s)]
*  It says, quote, The investigation also potentially implicates the broader Democratic Party apparatus and partisan media outlets that supported Biden throughout 2024. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GUyF_wywi8&t=316.04s)]
*  It's not so much a legal problem as it is a potential political or professional one for those involved, particularly as the party struggles to find its way out of the political wilderness and operatives within the party. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GUyF_wywi8&t=327.8s)]
*  John Key for position headed into twenty twenty eight. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GUyF_wywi8&t=339.44s)]
*  So, Congressman, it sounds like some Democrats out there worried that if you guys start pulling on this string a little bit, the whole ball is going to come unravel. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GUyF_wywi8&t=342.92s)]
*  Yeah, I think so. I mean, I think it's pretty clear that that pretty much the entire Democrat establishment in town was in on it. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GUyF_wywi8&t=349.68s)]
*  And it wasn't until they saw Midsomer after that debate that, oh, my gosh, we might actually lose the election because people now see the in front center, the mental state of the president, that they needed to pull the pin and move in a different direction. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GUyF_wywi8&t=355.48s)]
*  That's really what's been guiding the Democrat Party for the last five, six, eight years. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GUyF_wywi8&t=368.36s)]
*  Trump derangement syndrome that has been driving the entire agenda of the Democrat Party. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GUyF_wywi8&t=372.84000000000003s)]
*  They were then ignoring all of the important duties of the commander in chief and the person that is supposed to run our government and allowing again a radical cadre of leftists in the in the White House to make decisions on behalf of the president. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GUyF_wywi8&t=377.32s)]
*  It is abundantly clear that's what was occurring. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GUyF_wywi8&t=389.96000000000004s)]
*  And now you've got reporters who suddenly they come to see the light and they are now writing books. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GUyF_wywi8&t=392.44s)]
*  So they're now coming forward and saying, oh, yeah, I mean, maybe there was something going on there. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GUyF_wywi8&t=397.32s)]
*  Well, thanks, you know, Woodward and Bernstein for doing your job now. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GUyF_wywi8&t=400.96s)]
*  But, you know, we were all watching this unfold in real time. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GUyF_wywi8&t=404.28s)]
*  And it's frankly it's embarrassing. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GUyF_wywi8&t=406.91999999999996s)]
*  And it and it is a huge scandal. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GUyF_wywi8&t=408.36s)]
*  I want to turn to a topic I know you care a lot about immigration enforcement. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GUyF_wywi8&t=410.59999999999997s)]
*  This is a wild story here. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GUyF_wywi8&t=414.12s)]
*  There's nearly a dozen ICE agents who are currently sick and stranded in a metal shipping container in the East African country of Djibouti. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GUyF_wywi8&t=415.59999999999997s)]
*  The officers are being forced to watch these eight criminal illegal aliens you see on the screen right here. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GUyF_wywi8&t=423.76s)]
*  This is after a federal judge ordered they not be deported to South Sudan. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GUyF_wywi8&t=428.6s)]
*  Now, these aliens have all been convicted of really heinous crimes, including murder and child sexual assault. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GUyF_wywi8&t=432.52000000000004s)]
*  The U.S. military base where these ICE agents are stuck in really, really dangerous. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GUyF_wywi8&t=438.8s)]
*  On top of temperatures being over 100 degrees, the officers and the detainees are sick. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GUyF_wywi8&t=443.8s)]
*  They're at risk of getting malaria. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GUyF_wywi8&t=448.28000000000003s)]
*  On top of that, they're facing possible rocket attacks from Houthi terrorists in nearby Yemen. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GUyF_wywi8&t=449.88s)]
*  Homeland Security spokesperson Trisha McLaughlin posting this quote, [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GUyF_wywi8&t=455.28000000000003s)]
*  The Massachusetts district judge is putting the lives of our law enforcement in danger, stranding them in Djibouti without proper resources, [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GUyF_wywi8&t=459.12s)]
*  lack of medical care and terrorists who hate Americans running rampant. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GUyF_wywi8&t=467.40000000000003s)]
*  This is reprehensible and quite frankly, pathological. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GUyF_wywi8&t=471.6s)]
*  Congressman, one of the guys that they're watching over there is a Cuban national convicted of murder who's had a deportation order since 1999. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GUyF_wywi8&t=475.56s)]
*  All the guys have deportation orders. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GUyF_wywi8&t=484.6s)]
*  They had their due process. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GUyF_wywi8&t=486.52s)]
*  Now this judge is saying you got to do it all over again. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GUyF_wywi8&t=488.12s)]
*  Yeah, you remember President Jackson, he said, well, you know, the courts, you've issued your opinion. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GUyF_wywi8&t=491.64s)]
*  Now go enforce it. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GUyF_wywi8&t=495.68s)]
*  I think we ought to be sending this federal judge from Massachusetts straight over to Djibouti and say, look, you deal with these violent criminals. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GUyF_wywi8&t=497.04s)]
*  You deal with the heat. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GUyF_wywi8&t=504.16s)]
*  You deal with the missiles that are flying in and dealing with what's going on with the Houthis. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GUyF_wywi8&t=505.2s)]
*  We are putting our ICE agents in danger to go deal with these violent criminals who the previous administration doesn't really care to make sure that we're, you know, keeping out of the streets and keeping out of our country. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GUyF_wywi8&t=509.16s)]
*  And now you've got a liberal judge, a radical judge who's endangering them by trying to insert himself into the middle of what is clearly an executive function to say we've got these dangerous people and they need to be sent home and that are sent wherever, sent out of our country. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GUyF_wywi8&t=520.32s)]
*  And so I want these judges to have to step up. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GUyF_wywi8&t=535.6800000000001s)]
*  They issue their orders. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GUyF_wywi8&t=538.16s)]
*  They sit behind their desk with a pen, like make this judge have to go over to Djibouti and go check out what he's forcing these ICE agents to do so that he can go feel good about himself at cocktail parties in frickin Boston. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GUyF_wywi8&t=539.12s)]
*  With the ICE agents here in the US, they're really, really starting to crank up their arrest numbers. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GUyF_wywi8&t=551.52s)]
*  They actually broke their single day arrest records for illegal aliens on back to back days this week. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GUyF_wywi8&t=555.52s)]
*  That would be Wednesday and Tuesday. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GUyF_wywi8&t=560.84s)]
*  More than 2000 arrests on each day. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GUyF_wywi8&t=562.48s)]
*  This all coming after the White House pushed the agency to pick up the pace. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GUyF_wywi8&t=564.28s)]
*  They want 3000 a day. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GUyF_wywi8&t=567.28s)]
*  And there's been all sorts of criticism for sanctuary city, Boston's mayor over her comments this week. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GUyF_wywi8&t=569.0s)]
*  Here's the acting ICE director responding to her. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GUyF_wywi8&t=574.52s)]
*  Take a listen. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GUyF_wywi8&t=576.5600000000001s)]
*  It's outright disgusting. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GUyF_wywi8&t=578.36s)]
*  What Mayor Wu said is completely disgusting. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GUyF_wywi8&t=579.96s)]
*  She actually compared us to a neo-Nazi group. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GUyF_wywi8&t=581.88s)]
*  While they may not like it, what the men and women of ICE are doing in Massachusetts and all over this country is making communities safer. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GUyF_wywi8&t=584.48s)]
*  And in case anybody missed it, Boston's mayor, Michelle Wu, essentially equated ICE to the Nazis. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GUyF_wywi8&t=592.4s)]
*  The mayor had the opportunity to walk back her remarks, but she didn't. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GUyF_wywi8&t=597.48s)]
*  I don't know of any police department that routinely wears masks. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GUyF_wywi8&t=602.44s)]
*  We know that there are other groups that routinely wear masks. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GUyF_wywi8&t=609.88s)]
*  NSC 131 routinely wears masks. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GUyF_wywi8&t=612.64s)]
*  What I said is that Boston police and no police department that I know of at the local level routinely wears masks. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GUyF_wywi8&t=617.2s)]
*  So many on the left and Democrats hitting ICE agents for concealing their identities. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GUyF_wywi8&t=623.56s)]
*  They're getting death threats. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GUyF_wywi8&t=628.88s)]
*  They're being doxed. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GUyF_wywi8&t=630.3199999999999s)]
*  Here's the House minority leader. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GUyF_wywi8&t=631.52s)]
*  Every single ICE agent who's engaged in this aggressive overreach and are trying to hide their identities from the American people will be unsuccessful in doing that. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GUyF_wywi8&t=634.5999999999999s)]
*  This is America. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GUyF_wywi8&t=649.88s)]
*  This is not the Soviet Union. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GUyF_wywi8&t=651.84s)]
*  And every single one of them, no matter what it takes, no matter how long it takes, will of course be identified. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GUyF_wywi8&t=653.84s)]
*  And House Speaker Mike Johnson just this morning, pretty fired up about all this. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GUyF_wywi8&t=661.24s)]
*  Take a listen. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GUyF_wywi8&t=664.92s)]
*  From the people who mandated mask wearing for years in America, it's absurd. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GUyF_wywi8&t=666.88s)]
*  They need to back off of ICE and respect our agents and stop protesting against them. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GUyF_wywi8&t=671.8s)]
*  You're OK with these agents sort of not identifying themselves when they're arresting migrants? [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GUyF_wywi8&t=676.56s)]
*  Why? So that they can target them, so they can put their names and faces online and dox them. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GUyF_wywi8&t=682.7199999999999s)]
*  That's what these activists do. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GUyF_wywi8&t=686.8399999999999s)]
*  Congressman, I know that was a big lead up to you there. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GUyF_wywi8&t=689.36s)]
*  Want to get your thoughts on this. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GUyF_wywi8&t=691.28s)]
*  I've been with ICE a bunch of times. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GUyF_wywi8&t=692.76s)]
*  They're going out and arresting murderers, child rapists, fentanyl traffickers. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GUyF_wywi8&t=694.16s)]
*  And the things they're getting is to be called Nazis and say they're all going to be doxed. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GUyF_wywi8&t=698.24s)]
*  Your reaction? [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GUyF_wywi8&t=702.8399999999999s)]
*  Yeah, this is the Democrat Party that wants to say they back the blue. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GUyF_wywi8&t=703.3199999999999s)]
*  This is their examples of how they back the blue and back our law enforcement community. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GUyF_wywi8&t=706.9599999999999s)]
*  You know, Mayor Wu and Speaker or I should say the minority leader, Hakeem Jefferies, [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GUyF_wywi8&t=711.1999999999999s)]
*  you know, they were the chief proponents of everybody in America having to wear masks. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GUyF_wywi8&t=716.68s)]
*  Every child in America having to sit out in the cold during school wearing masks [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GUyF_wywi8&t=720.24s)]
*  with pseudoscience that had no basis in reality. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GUyF_wywi8&t=723.8399999999999s)]
*  And now they want to say to ICE agents, oh, guys, you can't, you know, hide your identity [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GUyF_wywi8&t=726.56s)]
*  so that you're not being targeted by cartel members and gang members and the violent criminals [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GUyF_wywi8&t=731.3199999999999s)]
*  that Biden and all of their Democratic cronies led into the United States. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GUyF_wywi8&t=735.6s)]
*  Again, like that federal judge, I'd like to see Mayor Wu or like to see, you know, [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GUyF_wywi8&t=738.92s)]
*  Leader Jefferies. Why don't you go out? [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GUyF_wywi8&t=743.56s)]
*  Why don't you go out and find these dangerous individuals? [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GUyF_wywi8&t=745.8s)]
*  Why don't you do it without masks? [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GUyF_wywi8&t=748.3199999999999s)]
*  And then you see what happens when they're targeting you and your families. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GUyF_wywi8&t=749.9599999999999s)]
*  When I was in the U.S. Attorney's office, I had to work with the FBI. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GUyF_wywi8&t=753.12s)]
*  I had to work with CBP and ICE. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GUyF_wywi8&t=755.92s)]
*  I had to work with our law enforcing community to try to stop the dangerous people [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GUyF_wywi8&t=757.88s)]
*  who are coming into our into the United States. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GUyF_wywi8&t=761.72s)]
*  And that was 15 years ago before the radical policies of Joe Biden and these radical [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GUyF_wywi8&t=763.64s)]
*  Democrats who've endangered Americans by putting these people on our streets. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GUyF_wywi8&t=768.24s)]
*  I think we should stand with ICE. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GUyF_wywi8&t=772.1600000000001s)]
*  They're doing what they should do to protect their folks. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GUyF_wywi8&t=774.0400000000001s)]
*  And by the way, they're doing that while they're getting put in danger by this, [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GUyF_wywi8&t=776.32s)]
*  you know, federal judge in Massachusetts saying you got to go sit in Djibouti [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GUyF_wywi8&t=779.84s)]
*  getting missiles fired at you so that guy can feel good about himself. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GUyF_wywi8&t=783.0400000000001s)]
*  Yeah, you know, it's interesting. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GUyF_wywi8&t=786.36s)]
*  We always hear these politicians say nobody's above the rule of law. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GUyF_wywi8&t=787.8000000000001s)]
*  But that thinking apparently doesn't apply to immigration law. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GUyF_wywi8&t=790.96s)]
*  Congressman Chip Roy, thank you for your time. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GUyF_wywi8&t=793.76s)]
*  Always great to see you, my friend. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GUyF_wywi8&t=795.5200000000001s)]
