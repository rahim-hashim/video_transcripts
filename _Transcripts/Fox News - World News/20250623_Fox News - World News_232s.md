# BREAKING: Iran reportedly launches 6 missiles toward US bases in Qatar
**Fox News - World News:** [June 23, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCGTIKtzkLo)
*  I'm looking now at major cases of GPS jamming in Qatar and other Gulf states. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCGTIKtzkLo&t=0.0s)]
*  Iran is bombing Qatar. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCGTIKtzkLo&t=5.28s)]
*  Let's bring in now chief national security correspondent Jennifer Griffin at the Pentagon. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCGTIKtzkLo&t=7.08s)]
*  You and I started talking about this about 45—more than an hour ago now. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCGTIKtzkLo&t=11.6s)]
*  Are we where your sources are telling you that we thought we'd be? [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCGTIKtzkLo&t=16.68s)]
*  Have we gone someplace that we're at least prepared to deal with? [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCGTIKtzkLo&t=20.6s)]
*  Well, Harris, right now, what we can tell from open source reporting on Twitter, you [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCGTIKtzkLo&t=23.48s)]
*  can see imagery of about what we're told from Israeli sources are six ballistic missiles [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCGTIKtzkLo&t=28.319999999999997s)]
*  that have been fired from Iran towards Qatar. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCGTIKtzkLo&t=34.36s)]
*  As you know, as we discussed, the Al Udeid base, the largest U.S. base in the Middle [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCGTIKtzkLo&t=38.4s)]
*  East, is about 40 miles from the capital of Qatar, from Doha. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCGTIKtzkLo&t=43.5s)]
*  You can see the night skies over Doha right now, and there are explosions in the air. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCGTIKtzkLo&t=48.16s)]
*  Some of those may be air defense missiles, Patriot missiles, trying to intercept those [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCGTIKtzkLo&t=52.42s)]
*  ballistic missiles. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCGTIKtzkLo&t=57.0s)]
*  We have no indications of impact at this point. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCGTIKtzkLo&t=58.76s)]
*  As you and I discussed before, there were satellite images from last week of Al Udeid, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCGTIKtzkLo&t=61.76s)]
*  where the U.S. normally has a large number of transport planes, refueling planes, that [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCGTIKtzkLo&t=66.76s)]
*  those tarmacs had been emptied of those warplanes. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCGTIKtzkLo&t=72.8s)]
*  But Al Udeid normally would have 10,000 U.S. troops based there. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCGTIKtzkLo&t=76.12s)]
*  There had been warnings to U.S. embassy staff to shelter in place and at other embassies [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCGTIKtzkLo&t=80.64s)]
*  across Doha. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCGTIKtzkLo&t=84.96000000000001s)]
*  We also now are learning that the airspace over UAE, the United Arab Emirates, where [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCGTIKtzkLo&t=86.32s)]
*  the United States military has a large—another large military base, that that airspace has [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCGTIKtzkLo&t=91.11999999999999s)]
*  been closed. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCGTIKtzkLo&t=98.0s)]
*  And we also understand there could be an imminent threat to U.S. troops and personnel at bases [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCGTIKtzkLo&t=99.13999999999999s)]
*  in Iraq. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCGTIKtzkLo&t=105.03999999999999s)]
*  That, if you remember, just four years ago, five years ago, Iran fired ballistic missiles, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCGTIKtzkLo&t=106.03999999999999s)]
*  at U.S. troops in the wake of Qassem Soleimani's killing. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCGTIKtzkLo&t=113.6s)]
*  So a lot of intelligence warnings. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCGTIKtzkLo&t=117.32s)]
*  We brought it to you on air just a little while ago, and now it seems that those explosions [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCGTIKtzkLo&t=119.3s)]
*  are being heard over the capital of Qatar. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCGTIKtzkLo&t=123.39999999999999s)]
*  Well, and through your reporting, you readied us for, you know, exactly who would be still [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCGTIKtzkLo&t=126.0s)]
*  there, and you're furthering that now to let us know who is able to get out and who's [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCGTIKtzkLo&t=131.6s)]
*  expected to be there serving right now. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCGTIKtzkLo&t=135.12s)]
*  You know, six missiles may not sound a lot to some people because they can do so much [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCGTIKtzkLo&t=136.88s)]
*  damage. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCGTIKtzkLo&t=141.84s)]
*  And Iran reportedly has been running low on—we don't really exactly know what they have. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCGTIKtzkLo&t=143.35999999999999s)]
*  Maybe they're not running that low. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCGTIKtzkLo&t=147.82s)]
*  But with precision, six missiles are a lot. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCGTIKtzkLo&t=149.38s)]
*  They haven't really been precision-guided, though, going into Israel. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCGTIKtzkLo&t=151.72s)]
*  They've been hitting all those residential targets. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCGTIKtzkLo&t=154.88s)]
*  Not saying that they didn't want to kill civilians, but a little bit more haphazard. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCGTIKtzkLo&t=157.04s)]
*  This seems more precision. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCGTIKtzkLo&t=160.92s)]
*  Well, I would say, Harris, the difference between Qatar and Israel is that it's just [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCGTIKtzkLo&t=162.35999999999999s)]
*  a few-minute flight for both short-range and medium-range— [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCGTIKtzkLo&t=167.76000000000002s)]
*  Ah, so both kinds. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCGTIKtzkLo&t=171.32s)]
*  —ballistic or cruise missiles. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCGTIKtzkLo&t=172.32s)]
*  You also could be having—and my guess right now, based on the way the Iranians have been [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCGTIKtzkLo&t=174.76000000000002s)]
*  behaving in terms of targeting Israel, you may also have swarming drones that could overwhelm [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCGTIKtzkLo&t=179.68s)]
*  any air defense system. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCGTIKtzkLo&t=185.20000000000002s)]
*  So obviously, the U.S. military, U.S. Central Command has been preparing for this moment. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCGTIKtzkLo&t=186.60000000000002s)]
*  They have been setting up air defenses. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCGTIKtzkLo&t=191.08s)]
*  Al Udeid would be one of the most protected bases that the U.S. has. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCGTIKtzkLo&t=193.72s)]
*  But they also have long known that they are sitting ducks there. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCGTIKtzkLo&t=198.2s)]
*  And so, therefore, right now, we have to just see if any of those ballistic missiles or [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCGTIKtzkLo&t=202.24s)]
*  cruise missiles got through. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCGTIKtzkLo&t=206.4s)]
*  All right, Jennifer Griffin, stay where we can get you. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCGTIKtzkLo&t=207.72s)]
*  I know you will, as the news warrants. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCGTIKtzkLo&t=210.6s)]
*  We'll bring you back. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCGTIKtzkLo&t=211.92s)]
*  Appreciate you. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCGTIKtzkLo&t=212.92s)]
*  We'll be back in a moment with more Outnumbered. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCGTIKtzkLo&t=213.92s)]
