# BREAKING: CIA confirms Iran's nuclear sites 'severely damaged'
**Fox News - World News:** [June 26, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flbppT2491k)
*  First, let's turn it over to Lucas Tomlinson with all the details on Secretary Hegset's [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flbppT2491k&t=0.0s)]
*  upcoming press conference this morning. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flbppT2491k&t=4.92s)]
*  Hey, Lucas. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flbppT2491k&t=6.640000000000001s)]
*  Good early morning, Carly and Todd. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flbppT2491k&t=7.640000000000001s)]
*  President Trump returned to the White House late last night from the NATO summit in The [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flbppT2491k&t=10.040000000000001s)]
*  Hague after ordering the Pentagon to share intelligence with the world about that B-2 [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flbppT2491k&t=13.24s)]
*  strike on Iran's nuclear sites. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flbppT2491k&t=18.12s)]
*  And the CIA director now weighing in with a statement of his own saying, quote, CIA [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flbppT2491k&t=19.52s)]
*  and confirm that a body of credible intelligence indicates Iran's nuclear program has been [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flbppT2491k&t=25.16s)]
*  severely damaged by the recent targeted strikes. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flbppT2491k&t=30.84s)]
*  During a lengthy press conference following the summit, President Trump and his defense [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flbppT2491k&t=34.480000000000004s)]
*  secretary Pete Hegseth insist the mission those bombers were sent on was completed. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flbppT2491k&t=37.519999999999996s)]
*  There are numerous of those reports and they're coming out fast and furious. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flbppT2491k&t=43.879999999999995s)]
*  But the most respected ones we've already seen. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flbppT2491k&t=48.16s)]
*  The site was obliterated, just like I said it was. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flbppT2491k&t=50.64s)]
*  And just like the pilots should be given credit for. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flbppT2491k&t=53.72s)]
*  So if you want to make an assessment of what happened at Fordow, you better get a big shovel [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flbppT2491k&t=56.76s)]
*  and go really deep because Iran's nuclear program is obliterated. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flbppT2491k&t=61.84s)]
*  As the sea fire between Iran and Israel appears to be holding, Trump says he's looking at [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flbppT2491k&t=67.34s)]
*  talking to Iran next week and perhaps working on a pledge by the Islamic Republic to give [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flbppT2491k&t=71.36s)]
*  up its nuclear program. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flbppT2491k&t=76.66s)]
*  Look, we're going to talk to them next week with Iran. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flbppT2491k&t=78.6s)]
*  We may sign an agreement. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flbppT2491k&t=84.64s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flbppT2491k&t=86.0s)]
*  To me, I don't think it's that necessary. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flbppT2491k&t=87.0s)]
*  I mean, they had a war, they fought. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flbppT2491k&t=88.24s)]
*  Now they're going back to their world. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flbppT2491k&t=90.24s)]
*  I don't care if I have an agreement or not. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flbppT2491k&t=91.8s)]
*  The only thing we'd be asking for is what we were asking for before about we want no [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flbppT2491k&t=94.5s)]
*  nuclear, but we destroyed the nuclear. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flbppT2491k&t=98.88s)]
*  And Carly, that Pentagon briefing scheduled for 8 a.m. Eastern will be carrying it right [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flbppT2491k&t=103.0s)]
*  here live. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flbppT2491k&t=106.91999999999999s)]
*  We'll be watching it right here on the Fox News channel. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flbppT2491k&t=108.24s)]
*  We certainly will be watching. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flbppT2491k&t=110.2s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flbppT2491k&t=111.56s)]
*  That's an amazing tease. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flbppT2491k&t=112.56s)]
*  We will do it more. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flbppT2491k&t=114.0s)]
*  So I say keep your station locked to Fox News. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flbppT2491k&t=115.0s)]
*  How about that? [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flbppT2491k&t=117.36s)]
*  We have that doubling down. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flbppT2491k&t=118.36s)]
*  Lucas, thank you. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flbppT2491k&t=119.36s)]
*  Locked and loaded. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flbppT2491k&t=120.36s)]
*  Let's bring in former NSC chief of staff under President Trump, Alex Gray. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flbppT2491k&t=121.36s)]
*  Alex, let's start there. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flbppT2491k&t=125.28s)]
*  What are you expecting to hear from Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth in just a few hours? [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flbppT2491k&t=126.4s)]
*  Well, thanks, Todd. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flbppT2491k&t=131.48s)]
*  I expect Secretary Hegseth is going to lay out in more granular detail what we've learned [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flbppT2491k&t=133.88s)]
*  about the operation since it's ended, what we know about the success, what we've learned [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flbppT2491k&t=138.76000000000002s)]
*  about the post battle damage assessment. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flbppT2491k&t=144.36s)]
*  And I think hopefully what the secretary is going to give us more information on is kind [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flbppT2491k&t=148.28s)]
*  of a granular readout of what the intelligence agencies have been able to learn in the last [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flbppT2491k&t=153.12s)]
*  couple of days so we can finally put to rest some of these naysayers who have been openly [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flbppT2491k&t=158.48s)]
*  contradicting what the president has said, some of the leaking that's gone on, just so [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flbppT2491k&t=164.0s)]
*  we can have kind of a definitive understanding of the success that the president and his [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flbppT2491k&t=168.44s)]
*  senior officials have been telling us. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flbppT2491k&t=174.23999999999998s)]
*  I think I'd like to get that formally in the record. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flbppT2491k&t=177.12s)]
*  That would be helpful. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flbppT2491k&t=179.76s)]
*  And those naysayers, to be clear once again, have been calling into question the success [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flbppT2491k&t=180.83999999999997s)]
*  of this absolutely remarkable mission based off of a non-low confidence intelligence assessment. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flbppT2491k&t=185.08s)]
*  Let's keep that clear as well. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flbppT2491k&t=192.96s)]
*  Meantime, the president trying to explain what happened during the strike. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flbppT2491k&t=194.64000000000001s)]
*  Take a listen. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flbppT2491k&t=198.0s)]
*  They call it dust, but it's very, very heavy. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flbppT2491k&t=199.76000000000002s)]
*  It's very, very hard to move. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flbppT2491k&t=202.28s)]
*  And they were way down, you know, they're 30 stories down. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flbppT2491k&t=204.44s)]
*  We think it's covered with granite, concrete, and steel. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flbppT2491k&t=207.8s)]
*  OK, in light of that fact that it appears that the Iranian nuclear program is in really [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flbppT2491k&t=213.72s)]
*  bad shape, I'll just say that before Pete Haystaff speaks in a couple of hours, what [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flbppT2491k&t=219.08s)]
*  should we expect to come out of this Iran-U.S. meeting? [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flbppT2491k&t=223.4s)]
*  Well I think that the Iranians saw exactly what happens when you have a president who's [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flbppT2491k&t=228.04s)]
*  willing to not just talk endlessly for no purpose, but who views negotiations as an [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flbppT2491k&t=233.04s)]
*  opportunity to advance U.S. interests and who is unafraid if you're on the other side [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flbppT2491k&t=238.28s)]
*  of the table and you're unwilling to be a good faith negotiator, he's willing to use [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flbppT2491k&t=243.34s)]
*  the United States military to make sure that our interests are protected. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flbppT2491k&t=248.1s)]
*  And the Iranians had their chance, they lost it, and now they have to make a strategic [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flbppT2491k&t=252.62s)]
*  decision. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flbppT2491k&t=257.22s)]
*  Do they want to spend the next 10 years as a global pariah with no nuclear deterrent? [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flbppT2491k&t=258.22s)]
*  Or do they want to have an opportunity, which I think President Trump is sincere in giving [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flbppT2491k&t=265.18s)]
*  and re-enter the global community with a good faith effort to try and get back on track [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flbppT2491k&t=271.06s)]
*  with the United States and our allies. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flbppT2491k&t=277.9s)]
*  I think the president is very genuine when he says he wants to have, as he said many [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flbppT2491k&t=280.06s)]
*  times over the last couple months, he'd like to have negotiations that lead to a detente [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flbppT2491k&t=284.66s)]
*  in the region so we can have mutual prosperity. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flbppT2491k&t=289.42s)]
*  But the choices would be Iranian and Ayatollah's. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flbppT2491k&t=292.42s)]
*  We will be watching that with bated breath. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flbppT2491k&t=294.92s)]
*  I'm NATO Secretary General Mark Ruda giving praise to President Trump yesterday for his [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flbppT2491k&t=296.78s)]
*  role in getting NATO members to agree to that 5% total amount of defense spending. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flbppT2491k&t=300.97999999999996s)]
*  Listen. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flbppT2491k&t=306.94s)]
*  President Trump, dear Donald, you made this change possible. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flbppT2491k&t=307.94s)]
*  Your leadership on this has already produced one trillion dollars in extra spending from [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flbppT2491k&t=313.14s)]
*  European allies since 2016. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flbppT2491k&t=318.41999999999996s)]
*  The decisions today will produce trillions more for our common defense to make us stronger [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flbppT2491k&t=321.22s)]
*  and fairer by equalizing spending between America and America's allies. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flbppT2491k&t=327.70000000000005s)]
*  Alex, did Donald Trump just usher in a new era of peace through strength, not just in [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flbppT2491k&t=333.02000000000004s)]
*  America but throughout the world with both the Iranian strike and this 5% NATO commitment? [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flbppT2491k&t=338.86s)]
*  Todd, he's done more than any president since Ronald Reagan to build a world that understands [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flbppT2491k&t=347.22s)]
*  that peace is only possible if the United States has an overwhelming capacity, capability, [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flbppT2491k&t=353.58000000000004s)]
*  and willingness to use force as needed on the global stage. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flbppT2491k&t=361.42s)]
*  And I think we're going to see incredible opportunities for peace because the president [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flbppT2491k&t=365.98s)]
*  has been so willing to be that dynamic actor on the global stage. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flbppT2491k&t=370.5s)]
*  Now, let's be very clear, Todd, about NATO. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flbppT2491k&t=375.94s)]
*  Harry Truman may have built NATO when he was president. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flbppT2491k&t=377.94s)]
*  Donald Trump saved it by being willing to fight and pressure and cajole and to use every [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flbppT2491k&t=380.94s)]
*  tool in his kit to make sure that NATO members were willing to finally spend first 2%, now [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flbppT2491k&t=387.06s)]
*  5% of GDP on defense. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flbppT2491k&t=392.94s)]
*  And if he hadn't done that, which every president since Carter had been urging NATO allies to [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flbppT2491k&t=395.38s)]
*  do, if he hadn't done that, NATO would be a totally toothless alliance today. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flbppT2491k&t=399.9s)]
*  Alex Gray, thank you for your insight this morning. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flbppT2491k&t=405.54s)]
*  We appreciate it. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flbppT2491k&t=407.46s)]
