# BREAKING: Trump reveals details of hour-long call with Putin after Ukraine strike
**Fox News - World News:** [June 04, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwccR34V2dc)
*  Well, we have some breaking news. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwccR34V2dc&t=0.0s)]
*  President Trump announcing he has just spoken with Russian President Vladimir Putin. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwccR34V2dc&t=2.08s)]
*  He wrote this on True Social. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwccR34V2dc&t=6.0s)]
*  I just finished speaking by telephone with President Vladimir Putin of Russia. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwccR34V2dc&t=7.68s)]
*  The call lasted approximately one hour and 15 minutes. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwccR34V2dc&t=11.92s)]
*  We discussed the attack on Russia's docked airplanes by Ukraine and also various other [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwccR34V2dc&t=15.46s)]
*  attacks that have been taking place by both sides. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwccR34V2dc&t=19.96s)]
*  It was a good conversation, but not a conversation that will lead to immediate peace. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwccR34V2dc&t=23.16s)]
*  President Putin did say and very strongly that he will have to respond to the recent [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwccR34V2dc&t=28.12s)]
*  attack on the airfields. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwccR34V2dc&t=32.36s)]
*  Those were those Ukrainian attacks on the airfields with the drones. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwccR34V2dc&t=34.160000000000004s)]
*  We also discussed Iran and the fact that time is running out on Iran's decision pertaining [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwccR34V2dc&t=37.480000000000004s)]
*  to nuclear weapons, which must be made quickly. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwccR34V2dc&t=41.68s)]
*  I stated to President Putin that Iran cannot have a nuclear weapon. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwccR34V2dc&t=44.8s)]
*  On this, I believe that we were in agreement. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwccR34V2dc&t=49.040000000000006s)]
*  President Putin suggested that he will participate in the discussions with Iran and that he could [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwccR34V2dc&t=51.42s)]
*  perhaps be helpful in getting this brought to a rapid conclusion. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwccR34V2dc&t=55.68s)]
*  It is my opinion, the president continued, that Iran has been slow walking their decision [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwccR34V2dc&t=59.96s)]
*  on this very important matter and we will need a definitive answer in a very short period [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwccR34V2dc&t=64.36s)]
*  of time. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwccR34V2dc&t=69.28s)]
*  A few interesting notes here. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwccR34V2dc&t=70.28s)]
*  First, just yesterday in Istanbul, you had the Ukrainian side meet with the Russian side [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwccR34V2dc&t=71.84s)]
*  and they were talking about swapping injured soldiers, but they admitted there is no immediate [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwccR34V2dc&t=76.6s)]
*  end of peace inside an immediate ceasefire. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwccR34V2dc&t=81.56s)]
*  Not only that, we know that Russia is a close ally of Iran. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwccR34V2dc&t=84.64s)]
*  They partner together strategically, militarily, so any assistance on that front could push [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwccR34V2dc&t=87.6s)]
*  Iran perhaps into an agreement. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwccR34V2dc&t=92.76s)]
*  Two interesting notes there. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwccR34V2dc&t=94.68s)]
*  Ari, this all comes against the backdrop of President Trump saying, I'll know in two weeks [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwccR34V2dc&t=96.28s)]
*  whether Putin is serious. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwccR34V2dc&t=101.36s)]
*  He said that about a week and a half ago. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwccR34V2dc&t=103.12s)]
*  This development coming as he's really prodding Putin to push towards peace. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwccR34V2dc&t=105.28s)]
*  Yeah, and it doesn't sound like there's going to be any prospect of peace between Ukraine [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwccR34V2dc&t=110.11999999999999s)]
*  and Russia if there were. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwccR34V2dc&t=114.24s)]
*  If the president had any inclination from President Putin that there was something encouraging, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwccR34V2dc&t=115.24s)]
*  we'd have seen it in that true social. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwccR34V2dc&t=119.44s)]
*  Its absence speaks volumes. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwccR34V2dc&t=121.11999999999999s)]
*  Look, I think the only way to get peace between Ukraine and Russia is for Ukraine to continue [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwccR34V2dc&t=122.75999999999999s)]
*  to bring the war into Russia. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwccR34V2dc&t=127.64s)]
*  That strike against the 40 Russian long-range bombers was instrumental in telling Russian [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwccR34V2dc&t=129.8s)]
*  people and the Russian government there's a cost to you for continuing your attacks [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwccR34V2dc&t=135.68s)]
*  in Ukraine. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwccR34V2dc&t=140.36s)]
*  You need a stalemate in order for two parties to come to a peace terms. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwccR34V2dc&t=141.36s)]
*  Right now there's been an imbalance until this recent Ukrainian attack inside Russia. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwccR34V2dc&t=145.52s)]
*  I don't know if the Ukrainians can sustain it though. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwccR34V2dc&t=149.96s)]
*  And if you're Russia, you might want to just continue to keep the attacks going because [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwccR34V2dc&t=152.4s)]
*  you think you can win. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwccR34V2dc&t=156.28s)]
*  That's why I think this was very risky for President Trump to think he could be the peacemaker. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwccR34V2dc&t=157.72s)]
*  America's strong. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwccR34V2dc&t=162.44s)]
*  Trump is strong, but we can't do everything around the world. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwccR34V2dc&t=163.44s)]
*  And I think if Russia and Ukraine won't make peace, we can't do it for them. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwccR34V2dc&t=165.92s)]
*  Kayleigh, interestingly, in the middle of that true socialist, President Putin did say [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwccR34V2dc&t=169.4s)]
*  and very strongly that he will have to respond to the recent attack on the airfields. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwccR34V2dc&t=173.24s)]
*  I'm sure that caught the ear of Zelensky. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwccR34V2dc&t=178.24s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwccR34V2dc&t=181.16s)]
*  And I think that one thing to Trump's credit is we have full confidence that both Putin [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwccR34V2dc&t=182.16s)]
*  and Iran, all these other countries that he's dealing with, know for a fact that Donald [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwccR34V2dc&t=186.24s)]
*  Trump is not messing around. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwccR34V2dc&t=190.6s)]
*  I think what's happening here is Putin is deliberately testing the bounds to see how [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwccR34V2dc&t=192.32000000000002s)]
*  far he can push Trump, how far he can push this administration before receiving a really [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwccR34V2dc&t=195.96s)]
*  harsh rebuke. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwccR34V2dc&t=200.68s)]
*  But Donald Trump is not messing around. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwccR34V2dc&t=202.12s)]
*  And I think that these countries know that. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwccR34V2dc&t=204.52s)]
*  The American people know that. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwccR34V2dc&t=206.0s)]
*  And that's why they elected him to handle our foreign policy. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwccR34V2dc&t=207.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwccR34V2dc&t=210.08s)]
*  And Laurie, this comes against the background of the Hill. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwccR34V2dc&t=211.08s)]
*  The Russia hawks are meeting today. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwccR34V2dc&t=212.68s)]
*  It's a bipartisan group. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwccR34V2dc&t=213.92000000000002s)]
*  It's Blumenthal and Graham about potential sanctions on Russia. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwccR34V2dc&t=214.92000000000002s)]
*  Notably, I always point out President Trump, on his watch, you did not see Putin go into [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwccR34V2dc&t=219.28s)]
*  sovereign territory. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwccR34V2dc&t=224.52s)]
*  You did see that with his predecessor. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwccR34V2dc&t=225.6s)]
*  You saw that with President Biden. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwccR34V2dc&t=227.4s)]
*  There was an absence for years. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwccR34V2dc&t=229.0s)]
*  So there is a respect there that could be leveraged by President Trump. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwccR34V2dc&t=230.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwccR34V2dc&t=234.4s)]
*  And he's talked about that, too. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwccR34V2dc&t=235.4s)]
*  We didn't see the issue in the Middle East when Donald Trump was in the White House. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwccR34V2dc&t=236.4s)]
*  We didn't see an issue with Russia in large part when he was in the White House. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwccR34V2dc&t=239.48000000000002s)]
*  I interviewed last week on my show General Keith Kellogg, who is a special envoy to Russia [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwccR34V2dc&t=244.51999999999998s)]
*  and Ukraine. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwccR34V2dc&t=249.35999999999999s)]
*  And when he was talking about the discussions that have been had, that he was privy to between [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwccR34V2dc&t=250.48s)]
*  these two countries, he says Ukraine is very clear on what their parameters are, where [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwccR34V2dc&t=255.32s)]
*  they are and what it would take for them to come to a peace agreement. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwccR34V2dc&t=261.12s)]
*  Russia is not. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwccR34V2dc&t=265.76s)]
*  He said they will not actually give us any framework to use. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwccR34V2dc&t=266.76s)]
*  And so I think that's the needle that President Trump is trying to thread. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwccR34V2dc&t=271.4s)]
*  If there's anyone who can thread that needle, if there's anyone, to Kayleigh's point, who [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwccR34V2dc&t=275.03999999999996s)]
*  can tell the rest of the world, I mean business and they know he means business, it's President [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwccR34V2dc&t=279.67999999999995s)]
*  Donald J. Trump. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwccR34V2dc&t=284.03999999999996s)]
*  And I'm still hopeful that we're going to see peace. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwccR34V2dc&t=285.15999999999997s)]
*  Keith Kellogg is the perfect person to talk to, Emily, because there's the public conversation [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwccR34V2dc&t=287.2s)]
*  where President Trump is broadcasting one message. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwccR34V2dc&t=291.64s)]
*  The private conversation with the world leader is very, very different. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwccR34V2dc&t=294.12s)]
*  And sometimes we've seen that spill over in Oval Office. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwccR34V2dc&t=297.67999999999995s)]
*  We've seen things we've covered here. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwccR34V2dc&t=300.6s)]
*  But how he talks to Putin, I know from talking to Kellogg, it's going to be in a tough manner. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwccR34V2dc&t=301.8s)]
*  Kellogg has stories about him picking up the phone, talking to the Taliban, to Baradar, [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwccR34V2dc&t=306.52s)]
*  saying, do not harm the head on an American troop. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwccR34V2dc&t=310.36s)]
*  And thereafter, many, many months, not a single American troop was harmed. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwccR34V2dc&t=313.0s)]
*  Those kinds of hard conversations are the hour and a half ones that happen behind the [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwccR34V2dc&t=316.76s)]
*  scenes. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwccR34V2dc&t=320.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwccR34V2dc&t=321.24s)]
*  And I think we've caught glimpses of that in the public eye of exactly who the president [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwccR34V2dc&t=322.24s)]
*  is. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwccR34V2dc&t=324.16s)]
*  He's the same off air as he is on air. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwccR34V2dc&t=325.16s)]
*  And I think while that may have surprised members of the public, it doesn't surprise [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwccR34V2dc&t=327.52000000000004s)]
*  those who look at him with respect and value the fact that he is authentically himself [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwccR34V2dc&t=331.68s)]
*  in every conversation. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwccR34V2dc&t=335.72s)]
*  I'm grateful that you pointed out the Ukraine point, because I think specifically that Putin [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwccR34V2dc&t=337.36s)]
*  apparently talked about sort of a retaliation. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwccR34V2dc&t=343.28000000000003s)]
*  And I point that out that Ukraine bombed them because they were the ones that were invaded. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwccR34V2dc&t=345.88s)]
*  This is an oversimplification, but it seems to me that Putin is sort of interested in [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwccR34V2dc&t=351.86s)]
*  an eye for an eye at every point of the way, because to your point, Putin sees Ukraine [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwccR34V2dc&t=355.52s)]
*  as his territory, like nothing less than subsuming it back within his borders will suffice, because [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwccR34V2dc&t=360.35999999999996s)]
*  to him, that's a loss. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwccR34V2dc&t=365.12s)]
*  That was a lost territory this entire time. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwccR34V2dc&t=367.08s)]
*  He sees it as not sovereign. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwccR34V2dc&t=369.82s)]
*  So I'm not quite sure if that approach and that perspective that Putin has is something [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwccR34V2dc&t=372.2s)]
*  workable on the Ukrainian side, because it's like football penalties. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwccR34V2dc&t=378.47999999999996s)]
*  I mean, he's never, he's like, oh, I have to get them back for this. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwccR34V2dc&t=382.48s)]
*  Wasn't it enough that you invaded? [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwccR34V2dc&t=385.84000000000003s)]
*  But clearly it's not. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwccR34V2dc&t=387.6s)]
*  So tough road ahead. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwccR34V2dc&t=388.6s)]
*  I agree that my faith is in our president to get it done if it's possible, but I think [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwccR34V2dc&t=389.6s)]
*  we still have a rocky road ahead. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwccR34V2dc&t=393.64000000000004s)]
*  But this is also where I question President Trump's ability to influence these events, [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwccR34V2dc&t=394.64000000000004s)]
*  because President Putin does not care. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwccR34V2dc&t=398.36s)]
*  And we as Americans, we don't have much leverage over Russia. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwccR34V2dc&t=400.76s)]
*  We're adversaries of Russia for the most part. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwccR34V2dc&t=403.36s)]
*  We don't do a lot of commercial trade with Russia. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwccR34V2dc&t=405.12s)]
*  So we don't have the leverage we have in other places that President Trump can use. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwccR34V2dc&t=407.36s)]
*  So I think this is a lonely mission for President Trump, and he's going to quickly come to the [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwccR34V2dc&t=411.44s)]
*  realization Putin's not listening. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwccR34V2dc&t=415.24s)]
*  America doesn't have a lot of leverage. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwccR34V2dc&t=417.76s)]
*  There are other priorities for the United States around this world. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwccR34V2dc&t=419.24s)]
*  He also said last week that something is off with Putin. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwccR34V2dc&t=421.52s)]
*  Something is different about Vladimir Putin. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwccR34V2dc&t=424.72s)]
*  So I'm wondering if that's playing into this as well. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwccR34V2dc&t=427.04s)]
*  Maybe it's a different Vladimir Putin than he dealt with the first term in office. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwccR34V2dc&t=429.24s)]
*  Or it's the same Vladimir Putin who's always been. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwccR34V2dc&t=432.4s)]
*  In Putin, it's worth noting, I know that all eyes are on Ukraine, but he is constructing [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwccR34V2dc&t=434.68s)]
*  on the border of Estonia. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwccR34V2dc&t=438.64s)]
*  They call that the edge of the free world because that's where you start to get into [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwccR34V2dc&t=440.12s)]
*  NATO territory. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwccR34V2dc&t=442.92s)]
*  Does he have designs beyond Ukraine? [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwccR34V2dc&t=443.92s)]
*  Let's certainly hope not, but we'll see. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwccR34V2dc&t=445.96s)]
