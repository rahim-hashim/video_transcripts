# NEW: US drops 6 'bunker buster' bombs on Fordow: Report
**Fox News - World News:** [June 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iY4m9xNhGsE)
*  We bring in now Lucas Tomlinson. He is live outside the White House tonight. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iY4m9xNhGsE&t=0.0s)]
*  Lucas, I'm sure probably a lot of activity in there. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iY4m9xNhGsE&t=4.0s)]
*  There's no question, Sean. We're about 45 minutes away from President Trump addressing the nation from the White House after those unprecedented strikes against Iran's nuclear enrichment sites, three in all in Isfahan, Fordo and Natanz. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iY4m9xNhGsE&t=8.0s)]
*  And you mentioned the six bunker busting bombs, Sean, that the president told you about. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iY4m9xNhGsE&t=23.0s)]
*  That means three B-2 bombers were involved in the strikes tonight because each B-2 bomber can only carry two of those 15-ton bunker busting bombs. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iY4m9xNhGsE&t=27.0s)]
*  So that means three B-2 bombers were involved. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iY4m9xNhGsE&t=37.0s)]
*  And as we heard from Jennifer's reporting, it's likely deception was involved. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iY4m9xNhGsE&t=40.0s)]
*  Everyone woke up this morning to chatter about these six B-2 bombers flying west over the Pacific, refueling over Hawaii at about 11 p.m. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iY4m9xNhGsE&t=44.0s)]
*  But it's clear now that those were decoys and that another flight of B-2s flew east, likely three of them, when you said six bunker busting bombs were dropped. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iY4m9xNhGsE&t=53.0s)]
*  And you mentioned that the B-2s, that flight that went east, went to the target and annihilated Fordos. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iY4m9xNhGsE&t=64.0s)]
*  We're hearing likely destroying Iran's nuclear enrichment program. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iY4m9xNhGsE&t=69.0s)]
*  As you mentioned, for 11 years, President Trump has made clear that Iran will not have a nuclear weapon. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iY4m9xNhGsE&t=73.0s)]
*  That was his red line, and tonight he enforced it. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iY4m9xNhGsE&t=80.0s)]
*  You mentioned the 30 Tomahawks fired from submarines, of course, an Ohio-class guided missile submarine, the old Ohio-class ballistic missile subs that were converted, Sean. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iY4m9xNhGsE&t=83.0s)]
*  This one carries 154 Tomahawks, so it's likely the strike came from there. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iY4m9xNhGsE&t=91.0s)]
*  Not sure if USS Georgia or Florida is patrolling in the area, but those are converted Ohio-class boats. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iY4m9xNhGsE&t=95.0s)]
*  Of course, attack submarines typically carry Virginia-class, L.A.-class attack boats, carry about a dozen Tomahawk cruise missiles. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iY4m9xNhGsE&t=101.0s)]
*  So it could have been a pair of attack submarines or most likely one of those converted Ohio-class guided missile submarines that took out that site. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iY4m9xNhGsE&t=107.0s)]
*  What's notable, Sean, is today President Trump had three opportunities to address the press. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iY4m9xNhGsE&t=116.0s)]
*  He declined each time, perhaps a signal looking back that something was up. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iY4m9xNhGsE&t=121.0s)]
*  And of course, he always speaks to the press. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iY4m9xNhGsE&t=126.0s)]
*  And also, let's not forget, just a few days ago on Thursday in the White House, Caroline Levitt at the podium said she had a message from President Trump. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iY4m9xNhGsE&t=129.0s)]
*  She said that a decision on Iran will be made within two weeks. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iY4m9xNhGsE&t=136.0s)]
*  Now it is very clear there's a lot of emphasis on the word within because we're now just two days since that statement. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iY4m9xNhGsE&t=140.0s)]
*  And this unprecedented strike was made against Iran, knocking out Iran's nuclear sites, likely setting back that program for years, decades or perhaps ever. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iY4m9xNhGsE&t=145.0s)]
*  And Lucas, we've got to remember, too, it was only 24 hours after the president made that statement that the Iranians said they would not have a negotiation at all. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iY4m9xNhGsE&t=155.0s)]
*  So they gave their answer almost immediately. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iY4m9xNhGsE&t=165.0s)]
*  And most compelling analysis, you will not get it anywhere else. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iY4m9xNhGsE&t=175.0s)]
