# Russian official hints at supplying Iran with nuclear weapons: 'OFF THE CHARTS!'
**Fox News - World News:** [June 23, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znUqRLIOFOg)
*  A lot of people who we don't have full accounting of were let in over the last four years under [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znUqRLIOFOg&t=0.0s)]
*  the Biden administration. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znUqRLIOFOg&t=6.66s)]
*  We know that some of those people were on terrorism watch lists. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znUqRLIOFOg&t=7.76s)]
*  And this is one of the reasons why border security is national security, is if you let [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znUqRLIOFOg&t=10.700000000000001s)]
*  a bunch of crazy people into your country, those crazy people can eventually take action. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znUqRLIOFOg&t=14.74s)]
*  We're going to do everything that we can to make sure that doesn't happen and to keep [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znUqRLIOFOg&t=19.1s)]
*  Americans safe. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znUqRLIOFOg&t=22.44s)]
*  There you go. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znUqRLIOFOg&t=23.44s)]
*  The vice president yesterday on Meet the Press, the White House warning about dangers of sleeper [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znUqRLIOFOg&t=24.44s)]
*  cells lurking here in the U.S. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znUqRLIOFOg&t=28.419999999999998s)]
*  Why would they think that? [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znUqRLIOFOg&t=30.02s)]
*  Well, for the last four years of Joe Biden's policies, we've let in over 1500 Iranian [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znUqRLIOFOg&t=31.22s)]
*  nationals. This is from the Border Patrol. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znUqRLIOFOg&t=35.98s)]
*  Bill Molluskian got this last night. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znUqRLIOFOg&t=37.94s)]
*  And guess what? Over 700 were allowed to stay. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znUqRLIOFOg&t=39.58s)]
*  Senate Intel Committee Chair Tom Cotton knows all about it. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znUqRLIOFOg&t=42.94s)]
*  Senator, when you talk about reprisals, people think about sleeper cells here. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znUqRLIOFOg&t=46.14s)]
*  Do they have a right to be concerned? [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znUqRLIOFOg&t=50.3s)]
*  Good morning, Brian. Unfortunately, they do have a right to be concerned. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znUqRLIOFOg&t=54.739999999999995s)]
*  As you said, Joe Biden had a wide open border policy for four years. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znUqRLIOFOg&t=58.22s)]
*  We know that terrorists tried to enter our country. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znUqRLIOFOg&t=63.14s)]
*  Iran has a long history of terrorizing America, going back 46 years [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znUqRLIOFOg&t=66.78s)]
*  to include here in the United States. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znUqRLIOFOg&t=72.1s)]
*  They tried to assassinate Donald Trump last year. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znUqRLIOFOg&t=74.66s)]
*  Someone finally answered the call to Iran's fatwag, it's Salman Rushdie, a few years [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znUqRLIOFOg&t=78.94s)]
*  back and brutally stabbed him. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znUqRLIOFOg&t=83.5s)]
*  But I think it's important that we remember. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znUqRLIOFOg&t=86.14s)]
*  Iran did not become a terrorist state because Donald Trump bombed their nuclear [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znUqRLIOFOg&t=89.66s)]
*  bunkers. He bombed their nuclear bunkers because they're a terrorist state. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znUqRLIOFOg&t=95.38s)]
*  And we cannot allow a terrorist state to have nuclear weapons. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znUqRLIOFOg&t=100.02s)]
*  Yes. And let them try to assassinate our president and Mike Pompeo and Brian [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znUqRLIOFOg&t=103.3s)]
*  Hook and John Bolton. Why was that allowed to stand? [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znUqRLIOFOg&t=107.78s)]
*  I don't get it. But just to break down a little bit more, some more stats on the [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znUqRLIOFOg&t=110.7s)]
*  border and why people are concerned about the people that have crossed in [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znUqRLIOFOg&t=114.06s)]
*  2021, 48 came across, then 197, then 462, and then the last year of Joe Biden, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znUqRLIOFOg&t=117.86s)]
*  797. So that's the that's the IED in human beings that the Biden [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znUqRLIOFOg&t=124.78s)]
*  administration left behind. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znUqRLIOFOg&t=131.86s)]
*  Just moving ahead and talking about what's going to happen next. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znUqRLIOFOg&t=133.86s)]
*  The foreign minister of the foreign minister of Iran is going to Russia today. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znUqRLIOFOg&t=136.42000000000002s)]
*  And ahead of that meeting, the former president of Russia, Dmitry Medvedev, says [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znUqRLIOFOg&t=141.98000000000002s)]
*  this, the enrichment of nuclear material and now we can say it outright, the [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znUqRLIOFOg&t=146.3s)]
*  future production of nuclear weapons will continue. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znUqRLIOFOg&t=150.3s)]
*  A number of countries are ready to directly supply Iran with their own nuclear [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znUqRLIOFOg&t=152.70000000000002s)]
*  warheads. That is just off the charts crazy. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znUqRLIOFOg&t=156.14000000000001s)]
*  But how do you view it? [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znUqRLIOFOg&t=159.62s)]
*  Well, one, he doesn't have real influence inside of Russia. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znUqRLIOFOg&t=163.66000000000003s)]
*  Vladimir Putin does. He was Vladimir Putin's puppet for four years when he was [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znUqRLIOFOg&t=166.3s)]
*  president during the Obama era. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znUqRLIOFOg&t=169.74s)]
*  And two, I think you see that kind of bluster and rhetoric because Iran is [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znUqRLIOFOg&t=171.66s)]
*  providing no real support. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znUqRLIOFOg&t=176.26s)]
*  Or I'm sorry, Russia is providing no real support to Iran. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znUqRLIOFOg&t=177.82s)]
*  For the second time in just eight months, one of Iran's main clients in the [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znUqRLIOFOg&t=181.5s)]
*  Middle East has faced dire straits and Russia has stood by. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znUqRLIOFOg&t=185.94s)]
*  The first was last fall when Bashar al-Assad's tyranny fell in Syria. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znUqRLIOFOg&t=191.34s)]
*  What did Russia do? [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znUqRLIOFOg&t=195.66s)]
*  It simply gave Assad a one way trip to Moscow. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znUqRLIOFOg&t=196.85999999999999s)]
*  Now, Donald Trump, after 25 years of presidents promising that Iran can't have [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znUqRLIOFOg&t=200.26s)]
*  a nuclear weapon, has finally acted on it and destroyed their key nuclear [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znUqRLIOFOg&t=204.62s)]
*  facilities and infrastructure. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znUqRLIOFOg&t=208.82s)]
*  And what has Russia done? [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znUqRLIOFOg&t=210.62s)]
*  Issued a strongly worded statement and welcomed Iran's foreign minister to [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znUqRLIOFOg&t=212.22s)]
*  Moscow. So I think this is mostly just bluster to cover up the fact that Russia [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znUqRLIOFOg&t=215.85999999999999s)]
*  is a pretty fickle friend to have in the world. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znUqRLIOFOg&t=220.7s)]
*  Senator, people like to label people like you Warhawks or neocons, Lindsey Graham. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znUqRLIOFOg&t=223.98000000000002s)]
*  Are you a Warhawk or a neocon? [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znUqRLIOFOg&t=228.78s)]
*  No, Brian, I'm someone who puts America's interests first, just like Donald Trump. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znUqRLIOFOg&t=234.34s)]
*  And for 10 years, like Donald Trump, I have said that Iran can never have a [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znUqRLIOFOg&t=239.18s)]
*  nuclear weapon. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znUqRLIOFOg&t=243.46s)]
*  Iran has been terrorizing the United States and the civilized world since 1979. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znUqRLIOFOg&t=244.5s)]
*  They have the blood of thousands of Americans on their hands. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znUqRLIOFOg&t=250.18s)]
*  As President Trump has said repeatedly, so have I said, Iran can never be allowed [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znUqRLIOFOg&t=253.34s)]
*  to have a nuclear weapon. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znUqRLIOFOg&t=258.06s)]
*  That means Iran cannot have any path to nuclear weapons either. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znUqRLIOFOg&t=259.26s)]
*  And his personal view here in the infantry in Iraq, we've lost 600 plus guys. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znUqRLIOFOg&t=262.90000000000003s)]
*  It's more like over a thousand, according to a former secretary of defense, [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znUqRLIOFOg&t=268.22s)]
*  Austin, and it's directly linked to Iran. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znUqRLIOFOg&t=271.66s)]
*  And they've never been forced to pay for that. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znUqRLIOFOg&t=274.38s)]
*  Maybe the payback begins. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znUqRLIOFOg&t=276.7s)]
*  And I don't think that's being a Warhawk. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znUqRLIOFOg&t=278.54s)]
*  I think it's defending America. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znUqRLIOFOg&t=280.18s)]
*  Senator Tom Cotton, thanks so much. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znUqRLIOFOg&t=281.62s)]
