# ‘THEY DON’T CARE’: Dems blasted for anti-Israel sentiments amid tensions with Iran
**Fox News - World News:** [June 15, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpirGz0IbRc)
*  Well, it didn't take long for far-left Democrats to trash Israel for defending itself. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpirGz0IbRc&t=0.0s)]
*  Some are calling Netanyahu a war criminal. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpirGz0IbRc&t=6.72s)]
*  The left is ignoring the reason behind these strikes to eliminate Iran's ability to build [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpirGz0IbRc&t=8.88s)]
*  a nuclear weapon. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpirGz0IbRc&t=13.58s)]
*  But they don't care. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpirGz0IbRc&t=14.68s)]
*  They'll take whatever side is anti-Israel. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpirGz0IbRc&t=15.68s)]
*  And so will liberals across the nation. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpirGz0IbRc&t=18.8s)]
*  We saw really this escalation. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpirGz0IbRc&t=22.84s)]
*  In fact, you see the free Palestine flags out there, and having been out and covered [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpirGz0IbRc&t=26.08s)]
*  some of these, it's pretty clear that a lot of it appears to be less pro-Palestinian and [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpirGz0IbRc&t=32.199999999999996s)]
*  more anti-Israel. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpirGz0IbRc&t=38.519999999999996s)]
*  Lydia? [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpirGz0IbRc&t=39.519999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, it does seem that way. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpirGz0IbRc&t=40.519999999999996s)]
*  And this is not something that is just developing overnight. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpirGz0IbRc&t=44.56s)]
*  I mean, this is a sentiment, anti-Semitism, that has been growing for years. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpirGz0IbRc&t=47.44s)]
*  And I think that's why our president, President Trump, is really taking a hard look at where [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpirGz0IbRc&t=53.26s)]
*  is this originating? [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpirGz0IbRc&t=57.42s)]
*  This is not organic. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpirGz0IbRc&t=59.22s)]
*  Where is this coming? [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpirGz0IbRc&t=61.18s)]
*  Are young people getting information from places like TikTok, where that's controlled [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpirGz0IbRc&t=62.18s)]
*  by the CCP, China? [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpirGz0IbRc&t=66.74s)]
*  And what types of organizations on our elite institutions are cultivating and fomenting [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpirGz0IbRc&t=68.94s)]
*  these types of ideologies and beliefs, this anti-Semitism? [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpirGz0IbRc&t=73.53999999999999s)]
*  Taylor and I talk about this all the time on the Business Network, taking a look at [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpirGz0IbRc&t=76.66s)]
*  our schools and how they are inadequate at responding to anti-Semitic protests and demonstrations, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpirGz0IbRc&t=79.94s)]
*  some of them that are outright pro-Hamas in some instances. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpirGz0IbRc&t=86.22s)]
*  Well, Taylor, so picking up on that, you know, I walk in the streets of New York today. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpirGz0IbRc&t=89.14s)]
*  Earlier today, I saw a young, and I have two daughters, they're teenage age and early [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpirGz0IbRc&t=95.46s)]
*  twenties, and this was a young teenager wearing a free Palestine shirt. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpirGz0IbRc&t=100.22s)]
*  And you wonder really how much they really understand. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpirGz0IbRc&t=104.22s)]
*  I don't think they get it. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpirGz0IbRc&t=108.18s)]
*  Yeah, you've pulled people on the streets. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpirGz0IbRc&t=109.42s)]
*  They don't know from the river to the sea what that slogan means. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpirGz0IbRc&t=111.74000000000001s)]
*  They don't know what river and what sea. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpirGz0IbRc&t=114.38000000000001s)]
*  They're just repeating what they've been told without any critical thinking skills [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpirGz0IbRc&t=115.94000000000001s)]
*  involved behind that. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpirGz0IbRc&t=119.82000000000001s)]
*  Most of the analyst notes I read this week said we should be thanking Israel for doing [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpirGz0IbRc&t=121.54s)]
*  for us what the rest of the world will not do, which is going to bat and taking out Iran, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpirGz0IbRc&t=126.58000000000001s)]
*  and that the rest of the world should be thanking them. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpirGz0IbRc&t=132.44s)]
*  And this really comes back to me, you guys, about Trump's trip to the Middle East just [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpirGz0IbRc&t=134.86s)]
*  a few months ago. And now I'm wondering in hindsight if it really was to shore up support [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpirGz0IbRc&t=138.7s)]
*  to make sure we had Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Dubai, right? [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpirGz0IbRc&t=143.18s)]
*  Everyone there sort of getting them to rally around us and really to further isolate [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpirGz0IbRc&t=147.22s)]
*  Iran. And now that Middle East trip, not to mention the investments in A.I., [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpirGz0IbRc&t=152.1s)]
*  but that actually now looks more strategic than we even thought. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpirGz0IbRc&t=156.94s)]
*  Yeah. And Dr. Siegel, you know, a brick with free Palestine painted on it through [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpirGz0IbRc&t=160.06s)]
*  the window of a kosher deli in Massachusetts. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpirGz0IbRc&t=165.62s)]
*  It's it's unthinkable that something like that would happen. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpirGz0IbRc&t=168.62s)]
*  But sadly, we see a lot of these sorts of instances on a near daily basis. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpirGz0IbRc&t=172.26s)]
*  You frame this just right. You have to understand history. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpirGz0IbRc&t=177.74s)]
*  You have to understand that Hamas is an organization dedicated to the destruction of Israel. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpirGz0IbRc&t=180.5s)]
*  It's a terrorist group. We understand the word terrorism here in the United States. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpirGz0IbRc&t=185.3s)]
*  We understand it from 9-11. Well, it's no different. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpirGz0IbRc&t=188.78s)]
*  So how does that become a freely elected government in that area of Gaza? [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpirGz0IbRc&t=191.22s)]
*  Same with Hezbollah. So we're dealing with this treachery. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpirGz0IbRc&t=196.14000000000001s)]
*  And now we see it in terms of how it's playing out in terms of nuclear weapons. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpirGz0IbRc&t=199.06s)]
*  But even to that, I'm worried. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpirGz0IbRc&t=202.38s)]
*  I thought the ambassador was brilliant on this point that that Israel is doing the [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpirGz0IbRc&t=204.34s)]
*  world a favor. But I'll have to tell you, it took 64 kilograms for an atomic bomb. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpirGz0IbRc&t=207.86s)]
*  They have nuclear power in Iran. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpirGz0IbRc&t=215.42000000000002s)]
*  And I know it's tricky to get from nuclear power to nuclear weapons. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpirGz0IbRc&t=217.54s)]
*  It isn't as tricky as as you might think. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpirGz0IbRc&t=221.54s)]
*  I am very nervous about this. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpirGz0IbRc&t=224.42s)]
*  And Israel is definitely doing the world a favor. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpirGz0IbRc&t=226.58s)]
*  Well, you're not the only one that's nervous, Dr. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpirGz0IbRc&t=228.74s)]
*  Siegel, because that's why Iran acted. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpirGz0IbRc&t=230.54s)]
*  I mean, Israel acted striking Iran and The Wall Street Journal calls it a watershed [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpirGz0IbRc&t=233.58s)]
*  moment. And we're going to dive a little bit later in the show into really that threat [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpirGz0IbRc&t=238.06s)]
*  and how close they are to making it. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpirGz0IbRc&t=243.06s)]
*  You know, it's interesting going back to what the ambassador was saying. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpirGz0IbRc&t=244.82s)]
*  He talked about, you know, even in the wake of October 7th, no resolution condemning [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpirGz0IbRc&t=248.1s)]
*  from the United Nations. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpirGz0IbRc&t=254.3s)]
*  And I saw a protest. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpirGz0IbRc&t=256.02s)]
*  It was a free Palestine protest. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpirGz0IbRc&t=257.62s)]
*  The Jerusalem Post had an article with pictures of a big protest they had in Europe [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpirGz0IbRc&t=260.3s)]
*  today. But there were signs that also said stop attacking Iran. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpirGz0IbRc&t=264.58s)]
*  And all of a sudden, it sort of seems that this is more about just being against Israel [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpirGz0IbRc&t=268.58s)]
*  than anything else. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpirGz0IbRc&t=274.26000000000005s)]
*  And it really makes you wonder sometimes you wonder why. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpirGz0IbRc&t=275.3s)]
*  Why do we look to the United Nations at all? [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpirGz0IbRc&t=278.06s)]
*  I mean, it seems like the organization has kind of lost relevance if they're not going [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpirGz0IbRc&t=280.02000000000004s)]
*  to stand on the right side of morality and history in this case. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpirGz0IbRc&t=283.18s)]
*  As you pointed out, I mean, the Holocaust was within our lifetimes, you know, and we [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpirGz0IbRc&t=288.02000000000004s)]
*  were seeing the results of the growing anti-Semitism in this country with the recent [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpirGz0IbRc&t=292.5s)]
*  attacks at the Pennsylvania governor's mansion out in Boulder, Colorado, deadly in some [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpirGz0IbRc&t=297.82000000000005s)]
*  cases. I mean, this is just becoming more and more concerning. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpirGz0IbRc&t=303.14s)]
*  It makes you wonder why the United Nations has a hard time coming down on the right [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpirGz0IbRc&t=306.9s)]
*  side. It's such a good point. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpirGz0IbRc&t=309.94s)]
*  We should not forget that during that Boulder attack, there was a Holocaust survivor. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpirGz0IbRc&t=311.21999999999997s)]
*  Right. She survived the Holocaust only to be set on fire in that Boulder attack. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpirGz0IbRc&t=316.53999999999996s)]
*  Just hang us. We've got a lot more on that coming up. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpirGz0IbRc&t=321.7s)]
