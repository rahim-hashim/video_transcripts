# Israel is doing us an 'ENORMOUS' favor, Ted Cruz says
**Fox News - World News:** [June 18, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BmIIJrvgAIc)
*  Here with reaction, Texas Senator Ted Cruz. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BmIIJrvgAIc&t=0.0s)]
*  Senator, it is amazing. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BmIIJrvgAIc&t=2.56s)]
*  I watched the president. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BmIIJrvgAIc&t=4.28s)]
*  You should have listened. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BmIIJrvgAIc&t=6.84s)]
*  I gave you time. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BmIIJrvgAIc&t=8.040000000000001s)]
*  I watched the president warn the people of Tehran, and we'll show more video of it, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BmIIJrvgAIc&t=9.4s)]
*  to get out. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BmIIJrvgAIc&t=14.36s)]
*  And there's like millions of people listening to Donald Trump. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BmIIJrvgAIc&t=16.16s)]
*  They're not getting that message from the leadership of Iran. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BmIIJrvgAIc&t=20.04s)]
*  They're getting it from the president of the United States, showing that he cares about [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BmIIJrvgAIc&t=23.04s)]
*  human life. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BmIIJrvgAIc&t=26.52s)]
*  Well, listen, President Trump throughout this conflict has been fantastic. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BmIIJrvgAIc&t=29.2s)]
*  I spoke to the president on Sunday and just told him, I said, your leadership has been [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BmIIJrvgAIc&t=33.0s)]
*  so critical on this. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BmIIJrvgAIc&t=37.56s)]
*  And he made clear Iran is not getting a nuclear weapon and he is standing with Israel. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BmIIJrvgAIc&t=39.4s)]
*  I believe our position should be we stand unequivocally with the state of Israel. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BmIIJrvgAIc&t=44.480000000000004s)]
*  And I'll make a point. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BmIIJrvgAIc&t=49.519999999999996s)]
*  Israel is doing an enormous favor to the United States right now. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BmIIJrvgAIc&t=51.28s)]
*  I believe the most acute near-term security threat facing America is the threat of a nuclear [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BmIIJrvgAIc&t=54.56s)]
*  Iran because the Ayatollah is a religious nutcase. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BmIIJrvgAIc&t=60.0s)]
*  He is a theocratic mass murderer. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BmIIJrvgAIc&t=63.96s)]
*  And when he chants death to America and death to Israel, he does so in front of mobs of [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BmIIJrvgAIc&t=66.82000000000001s)]
*  people. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BmIIJrvgAIc&t=71.24000000000001s)]
*  He also refers to Israel as the little Satan and America as the great Satan. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BmIIJrvgAIc&t=72.24000000000001s)]
*  There is a reason the Ayatollah is developing ICBMs. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BmIIJrvgAIc&t=77.28s)]
*  ICBMs are intercontinental ballistic missiles. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BmIIJrvgAIc&t=80.72s)]
*  They don't need an ICBM to bomb Israel. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BmIIJrvgAIc&t=84.02s)]
*  They're bombing Israel with ballistic missiles. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BmIIJrvgAIc&t=87.3s)]
*  You need an ICBM to get to America. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BmIIJrvgAIc&t=89.61999999999999s)]
*  If Iran gets a nuclear weapon, I think the odds are unacceptably high that we would find [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BmIIJrvgAIc&t=93.06s)]
*  out with a mushroom cloud over New York City or Los Angeles or Tel Aviv and Israel. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BmIIJrvgAIc&t=98.53999999999999s)]
*  And what Israel has said is we are going to act. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BmIIJrvgAIc&t=104.58s)]
*  Israel is a tiny country. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BmIIJrvgAIc&t=107.22s)]
*  It's the size of the state of New Jersey. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BmIIJrvgAIc&t=108.22s)]
*  And they are taking out Iran's military with surgical precision. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BmIIJrvgAIc&t=110.34s)]
*  They're taking out virtually all of the senior leaders of the military. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BmIIJrvgAIc&t=114.38000000000001s)]
*  They're taking out their nuclear scientists. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BmIIJrvgAIc&t=117.78s)]
*  They are leveling nuclear facilities on the ground. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BmIIJrvgAIc&t=119.66s)]
*  And I think President Trump is exactly right to say we stand with Israel. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BmIIJrvgAIc&t=122.54s)]
*  And I'm with the 75 percent of Americans that agree with the president's strong stance to [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BmIIJrvgAIc&t=126.94s)]
*  keep America safe. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BmIIJrvgAIc&t=131.5s)]
*  That's the commander in chief's number one job to protect American lives and keep America [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BmIIJrvgAIc&t=133.42000000000002s)]
*  safe. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BmIIJrvgAIc&t=137.98000000000002s)]
*  What is Donald Trump doing today? [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BmIIJrvgAIc&t=139.01999999999998s)]
*  You know, Senator, this has been discussed for so many years. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BmIIJrvgAIc&t=141.14s)]
*  We've discussed it on this program for years. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BmIIJrvgAIc&t=144.78s)]
*  And now we literally allowed the Iranians, Joe Biden allowed them to get rich. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BmIIJrvgAIc&t=147.7s)]
*  It was able to build up their weaponry, foment terror, build up their nuclear program. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BmIIJrvgAIc&t=153.38s)]
*  All of that, I believe, could have been prevented. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BmIIJrvgAIc&t=157.89999999999998s)]
*  Donald Trump left Joe Biden and Iran on the on on the verge of bankruptcy. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BmIIJrvgAIc&t=159.66s)]
*  But we are where we are today. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BmIIJrvgAIc&t=164.94s)]
*  And it's a minute to midnight. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BmIIJrvgAIc&t=166.5s)]
*  And they're at 60 percent enrichment in less than a month. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BmIIJrvgAIc&t=168.12s)]
*  They can have weapons grade uranium, according to every report that has been published and [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BmIIJrvgAIc&t=170.76000000000002s)]
*  even the IAEA, not exactly a conservative group. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BmIIJrvgAIc&t=175.4s)]
*  So it seems like this is the moment that will forever end their nuclear ambition. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BmIIJrvgAIc&t=179.16000000000003s)]
*  To me, that moment, we cannot miss the moment. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BmIIJrvgAIc&t=185.20000000000002s)]
*  I agree. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BmIIJrvgAIc&t=191.76000000000002s)]
*  And you rightly identified in your opening monologue, Israel can take out virtually all [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BmIIJrvgAIc&t=193.04000000000002s)]
*  of this. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BmIIJrvgAIc&t=198.12s)]
*  The one location that they have a technological challenge with is Fordow. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BmIIJrvgAIc&t=199.12s)]
*  And Fordow is built into the base of a mountain. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BmIIJrvgAIc&t=202.6s)]
*  It's deliberately built to be able to withstand air assault. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BmIIJrvgAIc&t=204.88s)]
*  And America has bunker buster bombs that could destroy Fordow. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BmIIJrvgAIc&t=208.51999999999998s)]
*  And I think it is very much in America's interest to see that nuclear research lab destroyed. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BmIIJrvgAIc&t=213.32s)]
*  Look, Iran is not researching nuclear technology because the Ayatollah is worried about climate [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BmIIJrvgAIc&t=218.64s)]
*  change. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BmIIJrvgAIc&t=225.51999999999998s)]
*  He's researching nuclear technology for one reason, to create nuclear warheads to be able [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BmIIJrvgAIc&t=226.52s)]
*  to murder as many Israelis as he can and as many Americans as he can. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BmIIJrvgAIc&t=231.20000000000002s)]
*  And the president is rightly focused. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BmIIJrvgAIc&t=237.04000000000002s)]
*  He is not going to let a theocratic lunatic murder Americans. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BmIIJrvgAIc&t=239.08s)]
*  And I will say there are some in the political debate that are urging the president essentially [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BmIIJrvgAIc&t=243.72s)]
*  to be isolationist, not to engage and not to defend America. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BmIIJrvgAIc&t=249.32000000000002s)]
*  Donald J. Trump has never been isolationist. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BmIIJrvgAIc&t=253.36s)]
*  He doesn't want to get us into unnecessary wars. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BmIIJrvgAIc&t=255.76s)]
*  We're not going to see boots on the ground in Iran. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BmIIJrvgAIc&t=258.52s)]
*  But if you look at the first term, President Trump, he utterly destroyed ISIS and their [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BmIIJrvgAIc&t=261.71999999999997s)]
*  caliphate. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BmIIJrvgAIc&t=266.15999999999997s)]
*  He took out General Soleimani, the leading state sponsor of terrorism. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BmIIJrvgAIc&t=267.15999999999997s)]
*  He took out al-Baghdadi, the leader of ISIS. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BmIIJrvgAIc&t=271.28s)]
*  Donald Trump is not hesitated to act when he's protecting American lives. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BmIIJrvgAIc&t=273.92s)]
*  That's exactly what's happening in Israel. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BmIIJrvgAIc&t=278.56s)]
*  And I want to say God bless the people of Israel. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BmIIJrvgAIc&t=280.3s)]
*  Pray for the people of Israel tonight and pray for our servicemen and women in harm's [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BmIIJrvgAIc&t=283.4s)]
*  way. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BmIIJrvgAIc&t=286.76s)]
*  All right, well said. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BmIIJrvgAIc&t=287.76s)]
*  Amen. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BmIIJrvgAIc&t=289.03999999999996s)]
*  We appreciate you being on. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BmIIJrvgAIc&t=290.03999999999996s)]
