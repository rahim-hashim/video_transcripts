# ‘The Five’: Trump’s 2-week notice for Iran
**Fox News - World News:** [June 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPAwlFIOw_Y)
*  A new wave of missile strikes rocking the Middle East as the Israel-Iran conflict enters a second week. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPAwlFIOw_Y&t=0.0s)]
*  President Trump met with his national security team today at the White House, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPAwlFIOw_Y&t=5.98s)]
*  and then he spoke with reporters after landing in New Jersey, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPAwlFIOw_Y&t=9.78s)]
*  where he doubled down on his two-week deadline for the MOLAs to come to the negotiating table. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPAwlFIOw_Y&t=12.94s)]
*  We've been speaking to Iran and we'll see what happens. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPAwlFIOw_Y&t=18.240000000000002s)]
*  Israel's doing well in terms of war, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPAwlFIOw_Y&t=22.88s)]
*  and I think you would say that Iran is doing less well. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPAwlFIOw_Y&t=27.12s)]
*  Sometimes you need some toughness to make peace. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPAwlFIOw_Y&t=30.32s)]
*  I would say two weeks would be the maximum. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPAwlFIOw_Y&t=32.72s)]
*  Peace through strength, and President Trump also reminding reporters that Iran is not their friend. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPAwlFIOw_Y&t=36.24s)]
*  Are you concerned that Iran or its proxies would wage terror attacks against American targets abroad if you order military action? [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPAwlFIOw_Y&t=42.480000000000004s)]
*  We're always concerned about that and we have to take them out and be very strong. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPAwlFIOw_Y&t=50.56s)]
*  You're even in danger talking to me right now. Do you know that? [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPAwlFIOw_Y&t=54.88s)]
*  You are in danger talking to me right now, so I should probably get out of here, but you guys are actually in danger. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPAwlFIOw_Y&t=58.400000000000006s)]
*  Now all of this comes as Iranian negotiators held talks with European officials in Geneva, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPAwlFIOw_Y&t=66.8s)]
*  and Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu hinted that he might not wait for that two-week deadline. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPAwlFIOw_Y&t=71.68s)]
*  President Trump will do what's best for America. I trust his judgment. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPAwlFIOw_Y&t=77.92s)]
*  He's a tremendous friend, a tremendous world leader, a tremendous friend of Israel and the Jewish people, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPAwlFIOw_Y&t=82.32000000000001s)]
*  and we will do what we have to do, and we are doing it. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPAwlFIOw_Y&t=87.12s)]
*  We are committed to destroying the nuclear threat, the threat of a nuclear annihilation against Israel. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPAwlFIOw_Y&t=90.32000000000001s)]
*  We're able to do it, and we of course will make our own determination. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPAwlFIOw_Y&t=98.32000000000001s)]
*  So here's how the posture of the negotiations began. We all remember the True Social Post's unconditional surrender. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPAwlFIOw_Y&t=103.12s)]
*  Khamenei responded saying, we will never surrender. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPAwlFIOw_Y&t=109.52000000000001s)]
*  Greg, the readouts that I'm getting from these European negotiations, they've rejected talks with the U.S. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPAwlFIOw_Y&t=112.24000000000001s)]
*  Not only that, when asked about zero enrichment, Iran said, undoubtedly we reject this, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPAwlFIOw_Y&t=118.4s)]
*  especially now under Israel's strikes, that's according to Reuters. So it sounds like it's going great. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPAwlFIOw_Y&t=123.52000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I'm not surprised. I love Trump saying you're in danger. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPAwlFIOw_Y&t=128.08s)]
*  I love Trump saying you're in danger if you talk to me right now. I say that after I have a burrito for lunch. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPAwlFIOw_Y&t=131.52s)]
*  Today's five is my last one for a week. I'm going on vacation, so I'm really kind of upset you asked me first [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPAwlFIOw_Y&t=136.8s)]
*  because I kind of checked out already. But I do, the one thing I like talking about, not the things that are going on in there [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPAwlFIOw_Y&t=145.20000000000002s)]
*  because I don't trust half the stuff I hear, and I have a feeling this is going to go on for a while. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPAwlFIOw_Y&t=153.04000000000002s)]
*  I like watching people talk about it. And there's these factions on the right, both pro and con, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPAwlFIOw_Y&t=157.6s)]
*  who think that someone can easily influence Trump as if he isn't in control of his faculties, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPAwlFIOw_Y&t=163.6s)]
*  like he's Joe Biden, you know, and he could be easily swayed by a Lindsey Graham or a [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPAwlFIOw_Y&t=169.68s)]
*  Laura Loomer or a Mike Johnson. It's like, oh my God. And that directly contradicts [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPAwlFIOw_Y&t=174.0s)]
*  your inherent faith and trust in the guy. I mean, in every issue, I see Trump kind of doing his own thing, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPAwlFIOw_Y&t=180.08s)]
*  which completely jives with America's thing, whether it is crime or border or even tariffs. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPAwlFIOw_Y&t=186.72s)]
*  I mean, it's like, he believes that helps Americans. He's going to do it. There's no bug in his ear, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPAwlFIOw_Y&t=193.12s)]
*  unless that bug is American voices. I don't see him being swayed. The isolationists think, you know, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPAwlFIOw_Y&t=198.56s)]
*  somebody's doing this. The interventionists say the other thing. But my guess is, is that he listens to [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPAwlFIOw_Y&t=204.8s)]
*  everybody. And then he does what he does. He goes with his gut. It's kind of how you saw him adjust [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPAwlFIOw_Y&t=209.84s)]
*  to the deportations goes all in and then he lifts pressure in certain industries. You know, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPAwlFIOw_Y&t=215.76s)]
*  there's no shame in that. So I think, I think, you know, he's not under the spell of anybody. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPAwlFIOw_Y&t=221.67999999999998s)]
*  I'm hopeful that he does the right thing and that he knows what he's doing and that he's [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPAwlFIOw_Y&t=228.79999999999998s)]
*  finding a path that isn't necessarily the paths that we keep hearing about. I mean, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPAwlFIOw_Y&t=232.64s)]
*  how do we get rid of Iran without putting boots on the ground? Does anybody know? [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPAwlFIOw_Y&t=238.88s)]
*  Nobody seems to care about what's next. You know, including Jesse, he doesn't care. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPAwlFIOw_Y&t=243.12s)]
*  I just care that you're okay on your vacation. A week in Iran is dangerous, Greg. I know. I don't [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPAwlFIOw_Y&t=249.92000000000002s)]
*  know why you booked that. That's why I'm dressed as the Ayatollah. Yeah, good timing on that one, [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPAwlFIOw_Y&t=256.08s)]
*  Greg. You know, Jesse Trump, to Greg's point, he goes with his gut and he knows what to do and when [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPAwlFIOw_Y&t=260.24s)]
*  to do it. And sometimes that gut is last minute. You know, he said, we're going to give this two [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPAwlFIOw_Y&t=266.72s)]
*  week negotiation period. He said today, maybe the strike on Fordo won't be necessary, [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPAwlFIOw_Y&t=270.72s)]
*  but he often will make that call in the moment. I remember 2019, he had, there were jets in the [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPAwlFIOw_Y&t=275.52000000000004s)]
*  air ready to strike Iran and then he pulled back because it wasn't the moment. He knows what to do [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPAwlFIOw_Y&t=280.24s)]
*  and he's going to do it when the time's right. Yeah, he's like the guy that hands in the term [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPAwlFIOw_Y&t=285.12s)]
*  paper at the last second, but he likes the pressure of it. He has these self-imposed [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPAwlFIOw_Y&t=288.8s)]
*  deadlines and I think it makes him think better. But the two week deal is smart because it gives [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPAwlFIOw_Y&t=295.12s)]
*  you more military options. You can bring in another carrier to the region and then you can [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPAwlFIOw_Y&t=300.56s)]
*  also let Israel really soften up Iran. I mean, they could hit more targets. They could hit [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPAwlFIOw_Y&t=304.64s)]
*  electrical transmission sites around Fordo. They could assassinate more commanders and the hope is [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPAwlFIOw_Y&t=309.92s)]
*  from the administration is that the Israeli bombing campaign could be so effective. You could bring [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPAwlFIOw_Y&t=317.12s)]
*  the Iranians to their knees and say, fine, I'll give up the enrichment, whatever you want, just [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPAwlFIOw_Y&t=323.12s)]
*  about regime survival at that point, but it doesn't look good because you're right. What [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPAwlFIOw_Y&t=327.92s)]
*  they're saying in Europe is that the negotiators from Tehran are not going to give up enrichment, [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPAwlFIOw_Y&t=332.88s)]
*  so that doesn't speak well. The pump fake could be tomorrow. He could say, I'll give you two weeks [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPAwlFIOw_Y&t=338.40000000000003s)]
*  and the bombs can rain down tomorrow. We have to remember though, air wars are not always completely [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPAwlFIOw_Y&t=345.20000000000005s)]
*  effective. North Vietnam, Kosovo. I mean, they're great because you don't risk anybody, but you're [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPAwlFIOw_Y&t=349.6s)]
*  not really there. But no one wants to be there. That's the problem. The concern is, is that if [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPAwlFIOw_Y&t=356.48s)]
*  you knock out the nuke site and a lot of the other ballistic missile sites, you leave the Ayatollah [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPAwlFIOw_Y&t=361.92s)]
*  in power. And then what? How do we know he doesn't have a clandestine nuclear program where they have, [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPAwlFIOw_Y&t=367.76s)]
*  you know, they're spinning some centrifuges somewhere else that the Israeli intelligence [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPAwlFIOw_Y&t=373.92s)]
*  hasn't discovered? How do we know he doesn't just spin these up all of a sudden and then where are [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPAwlFIOw_Y&t=378.24s)]
*  we now? We're in a worse position. Or if he falls to a coup, then you have 30,000 zealots who are [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPAwlFIOw_Y&t=382.88s)]
*  running the country, the clerics, and they're going to back the guys with the guns and the guys with [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPAwlFIOw_Y&t=391.44s)]
*  the guns through the army. So then the army takes over. So what do you have then? You have a military [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPAwlFIOw_Y&t=396.24s)]
*  dictatorship backed by religious zealots. Is that better? Is that worse? Nobody knows. Nobody knows [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPAwlFIOw_Y&t=400.96s)]
*  anything. But I do know that the Saudi crown prince is meeting with American politicians [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPAwlFIOw_Y&t=408.16s)]
*  to find out what a post Ayatollah Iran looks like. So they're already planning for the Ayatollah [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPAwlFIOw_Y&t=413.44s)]
*  gone. It's moving pretty fast. Yeah. And he's drawn that red line, no nuclear weapons. So we'll see how [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPAwlFIOw_Y&t=420.40000000000003s)]
*  he has to enforce that. Jessica, I wanted to bring in another voice, and this is very frighteningly [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPAwlFIOw_Y&t=425.6s)]
*  Obama's under secretary of state for public diplomacy and public affairs. Let's listen to him. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPAwlFIOw_Y&t=430.64000000000004s)]
*  They chant death to America. I went to Iran in 2014. I was sitting in a rally. These young guys [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPAwlFIOw_Y&t=435.52s)]
*  were chanting death to America. I finished the chant and two young men came over and said, [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPAwlFIOw_Y&t=443.52s)]
*  are you American? I said, yes. We want to welcome you to our country. We love American culture and [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPAwlFIOw_Y&t=447.52s)]
*  love American movies. They wanted to talk about all these things. Iran is the most western nation [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPAwlFIOw_Y&t=452.56s)]
*  in the whole Middle East. We have much more in common with them than a lot of countries that we [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPAwlFIOw_Y&t=457.2s)]
*  do have alliances with. I don't think Iran's the most western country in the Middle East. And he [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPAwlFIOw_Y&t=462.0s)]
*  began by saying, why is it a foundational issue for Trump that Iran should not have a nuclear [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPAwlFIOw_Y&t=465.92s)]
*  weapon? Maybe that philosophy is what got us here. Definitely anti that philosophy. I don't think we [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPAwlFIOw_Y&t=470.8s)]
*  should have a nuclear Iran by any means. I do think he's making an important point about civil [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPAwlFIOw_Y&t=477.28s)]
*  society within Iran, that these are people who want to be free, who want to be able to dance in [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPAwlFIOw_Y&t=481.28s)]
*  public and to drive cars and for women not to have to be covered and to be able to be educated [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPAwlFIOw_Y&t=486.24s)]
*  and all of that. But you obviously have a tremendous problem here. And we are not safe. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPAwlFIOw_Y&t=492.8s)]
*  And our strongest ally in the region, Israel, isn't safe. And that's what this is fundamentally [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPAwlFIOw_Y&t=497.76s)]
*  about. I very much think that Bibi gave up the game in that little presser that he had where he [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPAwlFIOw_Y&t=502.72s)]
*  said, Donald Trump is going to do what's best for America. And he's our great friend. And I'm going [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPAwlFIOw_Y&t=508.0s)]
*  to do what's best for Israel. And since Operation Rising Lion began, Bibi has been doing what Bibi [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPAwlFIOw_Y&t=512.16s)]
*  wants to do. And we're following along. I don't know where that leads. But this idea that Donald [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPAwlFIOw_Y&t=518.9599999999999s)]
*  Trump adheres to deadlines is absolutely ludicrous. The man promised us a health care plan over 450 [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPAwlFIOw_Y&t=524.7199999999999s)]
*  weeks ago. It has been infrastructure week since I was born. Russia's sanctions are supposed to be [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPAwlFIOw_Y&t=531.92s)]
*  coming in two weeks. A tax plan. Two weeks is meaningless. Jesse might be right. It may happen [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPAwlFIOw_Y&t=537.6800000000001s)]
*  tomorrow. It may happen in two weeks. It may happen in a year. I don't know. But they're going [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPAwlFIOw_Y&t=544.08s)]
*  to have to deal with the fact that there is a contrast within the intel community right now. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPAwlFIOw_Y&t=548.24s)]
*  Caroline Levitt from the podium is essentially parroting Israel or Mossad's assessment of the [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPAwlFIOw_Y&t=552.5600000000001s)]
*  risk from Iran, saying that this could be a couple of weeks. Our intel community is saying that it [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPAwlFIOw_Y&t=558.8000000000001s)]
*  could be several months to a year, which is what Tulsi Gabbard testified to in March. And apparently [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPAwlFIOw_Y&t=563.6s)]
*  the intel community is completely split on this. Donald Trump is going to have to pick which camp [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPAwlFIOw_Y&t=568.64s)]
*  he's in on this. It seems like he's leaning towards Bibi's assessment of it, that this is impending [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPAwlFIOw_Y&t=573.44s)]
*  doom and that you need to decide within the fake two weeks. But that's some really tough stuff [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPAwlFIOw_Y&t=578.48s)]
*  because what is the plan afterwards? I don't see how you do this without trying for regime change. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPAwlFIOw_Y&t=584.08s)]
*  First, I would say it's preposterous to say that Trump is not a man of action. He took out Soleimani. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPAwlFIOw_Y&t=588.48s)]
*  It's not about action. Hold on. I listened to the whole minute and a half long and I didn't interrupt [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPAwlFIOw_Y&t=592.4s)]
*  because I know you don't like that. He took out Soleimani. No one likes it. He took out [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPAwlFIOw_Y&t=597.76s)]
*  al-Baghdadi. He acted in Syria. All things Biden did not do. He did not act. Secondly, with regard [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPAwlFIOw_Y&t=601.6s)]
*  to the intel community, I would just say this. I spoke to General Jack Keane today. He said for [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPAwlFIOw_Y&t=607.52s)]
*  25 years they've been building a nuclear program out in the public. 12 sites, their entire enterprise [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPAwlFIOw_Y&t=610.88s)]
*  pointing towards nuclear weapons. So there's that. And I want to ask you, Mary Katherine, [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPAwlFIOw_Y&t=616.64s)]
*  Rahm Emanuel said last night, I think he's spot on, 1994 Bill Clinton had an opportunity to bomb [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPAwlFIOw_Y&t=620.4s)]
*  North Korea's nuclear reactor. He didn't take it. Now we have a nuclear North Korea. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPAwlFIOw_Y&t=626.88s)]
*  I would also note that the last deadline was 60 days of negotiations and on day 61 is when the [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPAwlFIOw_Y&t=631.68s)]
*  bombing started from Israel. So that's an important deadline. He's in a unique situation right here. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPAwlFIOw_Y&t=636.24s)]
*  He has a very tough decision to make, but he's in the situation where you could get more peace. As [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPAwlFIOw_Y&t=640.9599999999999s)]
*  he says, toughness is needed for peace. I like it how it's his spin on peace through strength. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPAwlFIOw_Y&t=644.96s)]
*  He has to make this decision, but as you point out, he has a record of having gone after people. I [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPAwlFIOw_Y&t=650.64s)]
*  call it occasional bellicosity, whether it's Soleimani or it's moving, it's moving the, [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPAwlFIOw_Y&t=655.44s)]
*  going after the Houthis, taking shots that work and then pulling back. Israel has done most of [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPAwlFIOw_Y&t=661.76s)]
*  the work here and he has a chance at a real historic moment, I think. Yeah, I think you're exactly [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPAwlFIOw_Y&t=667.6800000000001s)]
*  right. Well, we will see when that moment comes. You said two weeks could be sooner than that. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPAwlFIOw_Y&t=672.8000000000001s)]
*  Ahead, Democrats never learn. Rising star Jasmine Crockett just smeared half the country as mentally ill. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPAwlFIOw_Y&t=677.1999999999999s)]
