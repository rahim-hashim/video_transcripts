# US, Israel cautioned about giving Hamas a ‘lifeline’ in ceasefire talks
**Fox News - World News:** [July 05, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5X3_gzlXdxE)
*  Joining us now for more on this, Brent Sadler, Heritage Foundation senior fellow, as well [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5X3_gzlXdxE&t=0.0s)]
*  as retired Navy captain. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5X3_gzlXdxE&t=5.6000000000000005s)]
*  Thanks very much for being with us on this Independence Day weekend. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5X3_gzlXdxE&t=8.08s)]
*  To what do you attribute Hamas's reported willingness to come to the table here and [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5X3_gzlXdxE&t=12.08s)]
*  join in some peace talks? [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5X3_gzlXdxE&t=17.48s)]
*  Yeah, thanks for having me on on this very historic weekend. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5X3_gzlXdxE&t=19.6s)]
*  The cause for optimism, certainly to try to get the remaining hostages and the remains [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5X3_gzlXdxE&t=25.68s)]
*  of those that have perished in Hamas captivity, I think there is room for optimism. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5X3_gzlXdxE&t=30.8s)]
*  But again, there has to be caution that a lifeline is not provided to Hamas so that [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5X3_gzlXdxE&t=36.16s)]
*  it can reconstitute itself. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5X3_gzlXdxE&t=41.68s)]
*  And we find ourselves back in this same type of attack seen on October 7, 2023, perpetrated [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5X3_gzlXdxE&t=44.519999999999996s)]
*  again on innocent people. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5X3_gzlXdxE&t=51.480000000000004s)]
*  So optimism for the hostages, certainly, but they should be guarded by how and if Hamas [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5X3_gzlXdxE&t=53.04s)]
*  is given a lifeline. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5X3_gzlXdxE&t=59.839999999999996s)]
*  Another retired military man, British Army Colonel Richard Camp, now retired, shares [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5X3_gzlXdxE&t=61.8s)]
*  your caution about the situation with regard to Hamas. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5X3_gzlXdxE&t=68.03999999999999s)]
*  Listen. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5X3_gzlXdxE&t=71.68s)]
*  In my view, the IDF have been conducting it very effectively. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5X3_gzlXdxE&t=72.68s)]
*  They've they've killed huge numbers of Hamas terrorists. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5X3_gzlXdxE&t=77.72s)]
*  They destroyed a lot of Hamas infrastructure, including some of the tunnels. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5X3_gzlXdxE&t=81.64s)]
*  But they've got a long way to go yet. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5X3_gzlXdxE&t=86.91999999999999s)]
*  It's the fight's not over yet. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5X3_gzlXdxE&t=88.8s)]
*  It's fair to say, isn't it, that with the American attacks on Iran, as well as the Israeli [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5X3_gzlXdxE&t=91.91999999999999s)]
*  attacks on Iran, frankly, that Iran's pipeline to Hamas has pretty much dried up. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5X3_gzlXdxE&t=98.19999999999999s)]
*  They don't have they're not sending the money that they used to and the supplies that they [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5X3_gzlXdxE&t=103.91999999999999s)]
*  were up till now. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5X3_gzlXdxE&t=107.75999999999999s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5X3_gzlXdxE&t=110.36s)]
*  That's it. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5X3_gzlXdxE&t=111.36s)]
*  That is a strategic change from previous ceasefires and negotiations with these groups, these [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5X3_gzlXdxE&t=112.36s)]
*  Iranian proxies, in this case, in Gaza with Hamas. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5X3_gzlXdxE&t=117.67999999999999s)]
*  And it's important that Iran and any other outside benefactors not able to reconstitute [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5X3_gzlXdxE&t=121.56s)]
*  a nefarious off the grid supply of finances, let alone weapon systems, to any type of violent [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5X3_gzlXdxE&t=127.56s)]
*  faction, certainly not Hamas in Gaza. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5X3_gzlXdxE&t=135.76s)]
*  There is one hostage named Itay Chen, who is apparently still being held. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5X3_gzlXdxE&t=140.16s)]
*  We hope that Itay is still alive. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5X3_gzlXdxE&t=146.76s)]
*  But this is what her parents had to say. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5X3_gzlXdxE&t=150.32s)]
*  After the historic wins over Iran, Hezbollah, and yes, Hamas, now is the time for us to [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5X3_gzlXdxE&t=152.96s)]
*  pause and adopt President Trump's policy of peace through strength. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5X3_gzlXdxE&t=159.44s)]
*  It is time for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to collaborate with the U.S. and [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5X3_gzlXdxE&t=164.04s)]
*  bring the hostages back. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5X3_gzlXdxE&t=168.72s)]
*  Now Benjamin Netanyahu is coming to the United States on Monday, and one would think this [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5X3_gzlXdxE&t=172.35999999999999s)]
*  would be top of mind for both leaders. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5X3_gzlXdxE&t=178.24s)]
*  No, absolutely. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5X3_gzlXdxE&t=181.16s)]
*  And I think, of course, the future of negotiations or follow-up actions against the regime in [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5X3_gzlXdxE&t=183.64s)]
*  Tehran I think are also top of the list. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5X3_gzlXdxE&t=188.92s)]
*  And they are deeply integrated. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5X3_gzlXdxE&t=191.2s)]
*  The actions that you saw on October 7, 2023, are directly linked to the actions and the [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5X3_gzlXdxE&t=193.56s)]
*  support that the Iranian regime in Tehran has been given. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5X3_gzlXdxE&t=198.96s)]
*  So of course, when Netanyahu arrives this coming week in Washington, D.C., there's [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5X3_gzlXdxE&t=202.64000000000001s)]
*  a pretty rich list of issues that need to get addressed. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5X3_gzlXdxE&t=209.2s)]
*  And I think it's important to not forget the human cost of this bloodthirsty group like [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5X3_gzlXdxE&t=213.0s)]
*  Hamas, but at the same time, there has to be vigilance to make sure that we don't repeat [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5X3_gzlXdxE&t=217.64000000000001s)]
*  a future attack by this group by giving them a lifeline at the same time. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5X3_gzlXdxE&t=222.76s)]
*  Yeah, there's been a lot of discussion, maybe even argument, in Washington and elsewhere [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5X3_gzlXdxE&t=227.2s)]
*  over whether those U.S. strikes, the B-2 strikes, the bunker buster strikes on Iran's nuclear, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5X3_gzlXdxE&t=232.24s)]
*  especially the Fordo nuclear program, were effective. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5X3_gzlXdxE&t=240.4s)]
*  All right, we're going to leave it here, Brent. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5X3_gzlXdxE&t=244.16s)]
*  We appreciate your contribution today. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5X3_gzlXdxE&t=247.56s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5X3_gzlXdxE&t=250.84s)]
