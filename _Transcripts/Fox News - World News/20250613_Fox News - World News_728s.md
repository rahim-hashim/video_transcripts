# Israeli spies smuggled weapons, drones inside Iran: Report
**Fox News - World News:** [June 13, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnEjg58Yteo)
*  And at this moment, President Trump is in the Situation Room. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnEjg58Yteo&t=0.0s)]
*  It's been about an hour, reportedly, that he's been with members of his National Security [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnEjg58Yteo&t=5.4s)]
*  Council. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnEjg58Yteo&t=9.72s)]
*  So we were following this the last hour. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnEjg58Yteo&t=10.72s)]
*  We're still waiting to see what comes about after that. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnEjg58Yteo&t=11.96s)]
*  They are discussing the United States' next move after Israel's stunning preemptive offensive [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnEjg58Yteo&t=15.200000000000001s)]
*  to cripple Iran's nuclear operation and neutralize many of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard's [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnEjg58Yteo&t=20.84s)]
*  top brass. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnEjg58Yteo&t=26.44s)]
*  They were on it. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnEjg58Yteo&t=27.96s)]
*  Precision strikes. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnEjg58Yteo&t=28.96s)]
*  They've taken a lot of those people out. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnEjg58Yteo&t=29.96s)]
*  Now Iran says the strikes are a declaration of war. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnEjg58Yteo&t=32.08s)]
*  Iranian media claims Israel has resumed its strikes within that country now. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnEjg58Yteo&t=35.68s)]
*  And the IDF is releasing this brand new video showing top secret Mossad fighters that were [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnEjg58Yteo&t=40.120000000000005s)]
*  operating inside Iran. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnEjg58Yteo&t=45.480000000000004s)]
*  Now we found out last hour that they had been there on kind of a pre-operation mode, and [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnEjg58Yteo&t=47.32s)]
*  this had been gearing up for quite some time. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnEjg58Yteo&t=51.96s)]
*  So they had some good intel from within that country. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnEjg58Yteo&t=54.16s)]
*  The Jewish state of Israel says Iran has started to respond with some 100 drones having [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnEjg58Yteo&t=57.16s)]
*  already been sent toward Israel. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnEjg58Yteo&t=63.12s)]
*  And the IDF says it's deploying reserve forces to all potential combat arenas within the [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnEjg58Yteo&t=65.28s)]
*  country. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnEjg58Yteo&t=71.56s)]
*  This is Outnumbered. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnEjg58Yteo&t=72.56s)]
*  I'm Harris Faulkner here with my co-host, Kayleigh McEnany, and Emily Campagno also [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnEjg58Yteo&t=73.56s)]
*  joining us today for the first time on the couch with us, Jillian Michaels, host of the [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnEjg58Yteo&t=78.16s)]
*  And that's exactly what we're going to do this hour, keep it real. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnEjg58Yteo&t=84.64s)]
*  George P. Bush also keeps it real. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnEjg58Yteo&t=88.12s)]
*  Former Texas Land Commissioner and partner at Michael Best LLP. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnEjg58Yteo&t=90.6s)]
*  So great to have them both. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnEjg58Yteo&t=94.7s)]
*  First let's go straight to Alex Hogan. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnEjg58Yteo&t=96.28s)]
*  She's live in Tel Aviv for us. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnEjg58Yteo&t=97.96000000000001s)]
*  Alex? [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnEjg58Yteo&t=99.88s)]
*  Hi, Harris. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnEjg58Yteo&t=100.88s)]
*  Israel continues to carry out strikes in Iran and what has been an elaborate and complex [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnEjg58Yteo&t=102.44s)]
*  plan to target not only Iran's nuclear capabilities, but also high ranking members of Iran's [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnEjg58Yteo&t=107.5s)]
*  military. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnEjg58Yteo&t=113.48s)]
*  It's been 16 hours since the start of this operation, Operation Rising Lion. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnEjg58Yteo&t=114.78s)]
*  The IDF and Mossad carried out a coordinated attack which began at 3 a.m. this morning [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnEjg58Yteo&t=120.0s)]
*  local time. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnEjg58Yteo&t=124.78s)]
*  This was a highly planned mission. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnEjg58Yteo&t=125.9s)]
*  Again, it took years of planning. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnEjg58Yteo&t=128.12s)]
*  The operation involved Mossad smuggling weapons and drones deep into Iran long before the [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnEjg58Yteo&t=130.0s)]
*  attack. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnEjg58Yteo&t=135.84s)]
*  They set up a drone base and they activated the drones this morning to hit Iran's surface [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnEjg58Yteo&t=136.84s)]
*  to air missiles. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnEjg58Yteo&t=141.34s)]
*  It also involved those drones hitting specific apartments. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnEjg58Yteo&t=142.46s)]
*  The IDF at the same time deployed hundreds of fighter jets to strike hundreds of sites [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnEjg58Yteo&t=146.18s)]
*  in Iran. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnEjg58Yteo&t=151.5s)]
*  Multiple explosions were heard at Iran's Natanz nuclear power facility. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnEjg58Yteo&t=152.5s)]
*  That's Iran's main enrichment facility. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnEjg58Yteo&t=156.86s)]
*  The IDF today says that most of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Court High Command was [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnEjg58Yteo&t=159.22s)]
*  killed while gathering in an underground headquarters. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnEjg58Yteo&t=164.54000000000002s)]
*  That includes several of the highest ranking military commanders. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnEjg58Yteo&t=167.82s)]
*  Iran also says that six nuclear scientists were killed. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnEjg58Yteo&t=172.18s)]
*  They make up some of the roughly 80 people who are dead and more than 320 people who [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnEjg58Yteo&t=175.66s)]
*  are reportedly injured. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnEjg58Yteo&t=181.74s)]
*  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says this strike initially was planned out for April. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnEjg58Yteo&t=183.46s)]
*  It carried out in the early hours of this morning. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnEjg58Yteo&t=188.62s)]
*  It says that the U.S. was notified before any of this took place. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnEjg58Yteo&t=191.18s)]
*  Washington says it was not involved and that the top priority right now is still protecting [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnEjg58Yteo&t=195.14000000000001s)]
*  in the region as U.S. destroyers are moving closer in to the area. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnEjg58Yteo&t=201.34s)]
*  Iran's foreign ministry firing back at all of this today saying quote, the aggressive [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnEjg58Yteo&t=206.10000000000002s)]
*  actions of the Zionist regime against Iran could not have been carried out without the [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnEjg58Yteo&t=210.06s)]
*  coordination and the approval of the United States. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnEjg58Yteo&t=214.10000000000002s)]
*  Thus, the U.S. government as the main supporter of this regime will be held responsible for [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnEjg58Yteo&t=216.94s)]
*  the dangerous consequences of Israel's adventurism. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnEjg58Yteo&t=221.62s)]
*  In response to all of these actions today, launched as many as 100 drones. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnEjg58Yteo&t=225.98s)]
*  We know that Israel was able to intercept those drones using not only the Air Force [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnEjg58Yteo&t=230.82s)]
*  deploying fighter jets but also using the Navy's resources. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnEjg58Yteo&t=235.7s)]
*  We have seen more incoming drones here in Israel. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnEjg58Yteo&t=239.72s)]
*  It seems so far that the IDF has managed to shoot all of those down. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnEjg58Yteo&t=243.38s)]
*  But this is not over yet. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnEjg58Yteo&t=247.86s)]
*  Both Iran is promising further retaliation and Israel is warning citizens here to brace [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnEjg58Yteo&t=249.26s)]
*  for what could come in the days and potentially weeks to follow. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnEjg58Yteo&t=255.58s)]
*  Harris. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnEjg58Yteo&t=258.90000000000003s)]
*  Alex, thank you. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnEjg58Yteo&t=259.90000000000003s)]
*  You know, kind of a flavor because President Trump has been talking with media. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnEjg58Yteo&t=261.26s)]
*  He spoke first with our Brett Baer last night. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnEjg58Yteo&t=265.34000000000003s)]
*  To CNN, he said Iran's hardline negotiators are now dead. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnEjg58Yteo&t=268.34000000000003s)]
*  And the anchor asked, does that mean Israel got them? [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnEjg58Yteo&t=273.46000000000004s)]
*  And he says, well, they didn't die of COVID. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnEjg58Yteo&t=276.02000000000004s)]
*  And I'm just quoting the transcript of what was said. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnEjg58Yteo&t=278.56s)]
*  I didn't actually see it, so it might have benefited to watch it. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnEjg58Yteo&t=281.62s)]
*  What's your response to kind of our allies around the world and what we're seeing right [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnEjg58Yteo&t=285.1s)]
*  now? [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnEjg58Yteo&t=289.26000000000005s)]
*  Well, I think the president is positioning our country in the right way. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnEjg58Yteo&t=290.26000000000005s)]
*  And that's offering a backdoor diplomatic channel to the Iranians and almost leveraging [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnEjg58Yteo&t=293.02000000000004s)]
*  his are the deal approach to negotiating by saying Iran has a very clear choice here. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnEjg58Yteo&t=297.82000000000005s)]
*  And that's to join the international community of peaceful nations that would only use enrich [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnEjg58Yteo&t=303.22s)]
*  uranium for peaceful and civilian energy purposes, which is the deal on the table. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnEjg58Yteo&t=307.64000000000004s)]
*  It's a very reasonable deal that the U.S. has been a part of in a collaborative effort [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnEjg58Yteo&t=311.86s)]
*  with the greater Middle East. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnEjg58Yteo&t=315.7s)]
*  But this Iranian regime since 1979 has talked about the extermination of Jews, the elimination [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnEjg58Yteo&t=318.26s)]
*  of a sovereign nation in the form of Israel. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnEjg58Yteo&t=324.26s)]
*  And in that area of the world, you have to take those words and actions very seriously, [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnEjg58Yteo&t=327.06s)]
*  particularly in the wake of October 7, the attack, their funding of Hamas, Hezbollah, [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnEjg58Yteo&t=331.46s)]
*  other terrorist groups. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnEjg58Yteo&t=336.74s)]
*  They are truly the head of the octopus that is strangling peace desiring nations in the [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnEjg58Yteo&t=337.78000000000003s)]
*  region. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnEjg58Yteo&t=343.26s)]
*  And so we exhausted every single diplomatic effort possible. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnEjg58Yteo&t=344.26s)]
*  Special Envoy Witkoff was going to Amman. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnEjg58Yteo&t=348.22s)]
*  I believe the offer is still there for six rounds of discussions on Sunday. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnEjg58Yteo&t=350.54s)]
*  So the Israelis really were back in the corner here. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnEjg58Yteo&t=353.98s)]
*  So I know it wasn't too long ago that you were in this region. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnEjg58Yteo&t=356.86s)]
*  Would it surprise you if Ron shows up at that table or do you anticipate they would not [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnEjg58Yteo&t=359.90000000000003s)]
*  do that? [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnEjg58Yteo&t=364.76s)]
*  It would surprise me significantly. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnEjg58Yteo&t=366.70000000000005s)]
*  And if they do, it's a low-level official that does not have negotiating authority because [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnEjg58Yteo&t=367.70000000000005s)]
*  the attacks appear to be so significant that their leadership is in total disarray and [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnEjg58Yteo&t=371.3s)]
*  they have to their priority probably right now is assembling what their responses with [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnEjg58Yteo&t=375.58000000000004s)]
*  the kinetic response is going to be not diplomatic. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnEjg58Yteo&t=379.46000000000004s)]
*  Kayleigh, I know it's been a little bit more than an hour that they've been in the situation [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnEjg58Yteo&t=381.90000000000003s)]
*  room and we have quite a list of people that are in the room with him. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnEjg58Yteo&t=385.78000000000003s)]
*  National Security Council. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnEjg58Yteo&t=388.8s)]
*  It is not open to the press as we might assume at this point. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnEjg58Yteo&t=389.86s)]
*  You've been there at important moments. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnEjg58Yteo&t=393.70000000000005s)]
*  Talk to us about what that's like. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnEjg58Yteo&t=395.42s)]
*  You're huddled in the situation room. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnEjg58Yteo&t=397.42s)]
*  You know you are in this place. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnEjg58Yteo&t=399.1s)]
*  No one can hear you. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnEjg58Yteo&t=400.74s)]
*  You can have the most internal of communications. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnEjg58Yteo&t=401.74s)]
*  The White House has come forward. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnEjg58Yteo&t=404.46000000000004s)]
*  We saw the Rubio statement. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnEjg58Yteo&t=405.62s)]

*  I personally believe that the White House did indeed know. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnEjg58Yteo&t=413.46000000000004s)]
*  I believe that in fact it was a coordinated strategy for President Trump to stand up there [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnEjg58Yteo&t=416.66s)]
*  and say, let's negotiate. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnEjg58Yteo&t=421.18s)]
*  Let's get this deal done. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnEjg58Yteo&t=422.66s)]

*  I think that's a good thing. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnEjg58Yteo&t=444.98s)]
*  With the view that America always comes first, protecting our men and women, making sure [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnEjg58Yteo&t=445.98s)]
*  that they are not deployed overseas. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnEjg58Yteo&t=450.06s)]
*  But if I could step back for a moment and just praise Israel on the clandestine operation [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnEjg58Yteo&t=452.06s)]
*  they have put forward. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnEjg58Yteo&t=457.70000000000005s)]
*  When you put these pieces together, we're reading the Esfah Jahaabat airbase where they [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnEjg58Yteo&t=458.94s)]
*  snuck in explosive drones and hit the launchers. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnEjg58Yteo&t=463.94s)]
*  Imagine sneaking something into Iran. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnEjg58Yteo&t=467.54s)]
*  What our Trey Yanks is reporting that these military generals were aggregated in a meeting [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnEjg58Yteo&t=469.74s)]
*  and kept there because of specific massade intelligence about how to get these generals [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnEjg58Yteo&t=474.98s)]
*  in a room. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnEjg58Yteo&t=479.54s)]
*  I've seen pictures of pinpointed strikes on the bedroom window of top Iranian officials [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnEjg58Yteo&t=480.54s)]
*  from more than a thousand miles away. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnEjg58Yteo&t=487.94s)]
*  This is what Israel did. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnEjg58Yteo&t=490.92s)]
*  This is the kind of clandestine operation you see in movies and you wonder if it's real. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnEjg58Yteo&t=492.5s)]
*  It's real. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnEjg58Yteo&t=496.68s)]
*  It's real. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnEjg58Yteo&t=497.68s)]
*  It is real. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnEjg58Yteo&t=498.68s)]
*  You know, Jillian, to that point, Lieutenant Colonel Shoshani with the IDF, who's their [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnEjg58Yteo&t=499.68s)]
*  spokesperson today, was saying they did some asset flipping by having massade and intelligence [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnEjg58Yteo&t=502.42s)]
*  on the ground inside Iran and that this was a many years long operation leading up to [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnEjg58Yteo&t=509.18s)]
*  this. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnEjg58Yteo&t=514.58s)]
*  You're nodding. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnEjg58Yteo&t=515.58s)]
*  Well, I'm nodding because I do agree with you that it's Fordy chess and just as the [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnEjg58Yteo&t=516.58s)]
*  layman in the room, I've been a bit confounded in Trump's second term with the 180, right? [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnEjg58Yteo&t=519.94s)]
*  We went from I'm suffocating them, I'm bankrupting them, I'm taking out Soleimani to I'm going [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnEjg58Yteo&t=525.74s)]
*  to negotiate with Iran. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnEjg58Yteo&t=531.14s)]
*  I don't understand this as they're chanting death to America. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnEjg58Yteo&t=532.9s)]
*  And then it's like not putting sanctions on Putin, but he just mentioned that he spoke [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnEjg58Yteo&t=536.5s)]
*  to Putin a week and a half ago and Iran came up. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnEjg58Yteo&t=540.66s)]
*  So are you not putting sanctions on Putin because you want his cooperation with regard [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnEjg58Yteo&t=543.98s)]
*  to what's happening here? [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnEjg58Yteo&t=548.86s)]
*  Why was Israel sidelined in all these meetings that you had in the Middle East just a few [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnEjg58Yteo&t=550.78s)]
*  weeks ago? [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnEjg58Yteo&t=555.02s)]
*  But we know that the Saudis and the people in the UAE are not fans of Iran. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnEjg58Yteo&t=556.02s)]
*  So I think very clearly the breadcrumbs were there. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnEjg58Yteo&t=560.9s)]
*  And I also think this was inevitable. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnEjg58Yteo&t=563.9399999999999s)]
*  I was very confused. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnEjg58Yteo&t=565.9s)]
*  I understand that Americans are beleaguered by foreign wars. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnEjg58Yteo&t=567.18s)]
*  But this seems to be a very different thing here. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnEjg58Yteo&t=570.9399999999999s)]
*  There are weapons of mass destruction. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnEjg58Yteo&t=573.62s)]
*  It does affect Americans. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnEjg58Yteo&t=576.28s)]
*  So I don't understand what the option was, like kick the can until they do have a nuclear [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnEjg58Yteo&t=578.84s)]
*  weapon. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnEjg58Yteo&t=587.06s)]
*  For me, sitting on the sidelines, I felt that this was inevitable and I don't see the alternative. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnEjg58Yteo&t=588.6999999999999s)]
*  If you avoid it, it seems potentially catastrophic. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnEjg58Yteo&t=594.9799999999999s)]
*  Well the kick the can part we saw for four years under ex-president Biden. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnEjg58Yteo&t=597.5799999999999s)]
*  Emily? [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnEjg58Yteo&t=600.9399999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I agree with you wholeheartedly. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnEjg58Yteo&t=601.9399999999999s)]
*  And I'm a layperson too in this. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnEjg58Yteo&t=603.54s)]
*  I spoke with my Israeli friends last night who were hunkered down in a bunker all night [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnEjg58Yteo&t=605.5s)]
*  and a couple things about how they're feeling right now. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnEjg58Yteo&t=610.38s)]
*  So first of all, they're feeling victorious and triumphant after this, you know, I don't [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnEjg58Yteo&t=612.52s)]
*  know if it's a salvo or just the first step in this incredibly coordinated, deeply planned [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnEjg58Yteo&t=617.02s)]
*  and incredibly elite attack of what would be a nuclear power and a frightening escalation. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnEjg58Yteo&t=622.3000000000001s)]
*  And they also believe deeply that it is with coordination with the United States, obviously, [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnEjg58Yteo&t=630.0600000000001s)]
*  I don't know anything. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnEjg58Yteo&t=634.1s)]
*  But at the end of the day, they see us as their ally and their friend. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnEjg58Yteo&t=635.1s)]
*  They've been asking for our prayers for them and also that the U.S. stands behind them [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnEjg58Yteo&t=638.94s)]
*  diplomatically and politically, they said. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnEjg58Yteo&t=642.64s)]
*  And I'll note too, I just blanked on what I was going to say, so I'm sure it wasn't [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnEjg58Yteo&t=645.18s)]
*  that exciting. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnEjg58Yteo&t=650.3s)]
*  But I think for those who, thank you, for those who I think are sort of decrying this, [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnEjg58Yteo&t=651.3s)]
*  I've been hearing this on the left. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnEjg58Yteo&t=656.62s)]
*  Same. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnEjg58Yteo&t=658.0999999999999s)]
*  And on the right, by the way, is it's like you've got that split within the right of [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnEjg58Yteo&t=659.0999999999999s)]
*  like MAGA and the neocons. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnEjg58Yteo&t=663.06s)]
*  But that's my point. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnEjg58Yteo&t=665.8199999999999s)]
*  I don't see where the option is. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnEjg58Yteo&t=666.8199999999999s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnEjg58Yteo&t=670.02s)]
*  But for those saying this was the escalation, wasn't the escalation the violent rhetoric [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnEjg58Yteo&t=671.54s)]
*  that was coupled with all of these steps taken toward actions of nuclear bomb creation? [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnEjg58Yteo&t=676.9s)]
*  The UN watchdog for the first time in 20 years just condemned Iran. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnEjg58Yteo&t=683.38s)]
*  Like the building energy of that, the strategy of just watching it in the hopes it diffuses [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnEjg58Yteo&t=686.9s)]
*  on its own, bears no one any favors. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnEjg58Yteo&t=692.68s)]
*  This is what de-escalates. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnEjg58Yteo&t=695.9399999999999s)]
*  Show of force for strength for peace is exactly what the world needed to see. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnEjg58Yteo&t=698.3s)]
*  So thank you, Israel. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnEjg58Yteo&t=702.66s)]
*  Yeah, God bless them. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnEjg58Yteo&t=704.14s)]
*  And what you're both saying is what Aaron Kona, special ops with IDF, said last hour. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnEjg58Yteo&t=705.5s)]
*  He said, look, we could see this happening in real time and it was forecast and they [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnEjg58Yteo&t=709.54s)]
*  jumped in years ago to yield what we've seen today. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnEjg58Yteo&t=713.8599999999999s)]
