# Here's what's next for Iran's terror army
**Fox News - World News:** [July 02, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuV7SwIvAhA)
*  Our assessment of the battle damage around Fordow, Nantes, and Isfahan remains unchanged. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuV7SwIvAhA&t=0.0s)]
*  We believe and certainly all of the intelligence that we've seen have led us to believe that [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuV7SwIvAhA&t=7.76s)]
*  Iran's, those facilities especially have been completely obliterated. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuV7SwIvAhA&t=13.200000000000001s)]
*  We have degraded their program by one to two years. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuV7SwIvAhA&t=16.98s)]
*  That from the Pentagon moments ago, Iran admitting that US strikes seriously damaged its nuclear [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuV7SwIvAhA&t=21.2s)]
*  and is now refusing to cooperate with the UN's nuclear watchdog. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuV7SwIvAhA&t=27.06s)]
*  The chief foreign correspondent Trey Yinks is live for us in Tel Aviv with more. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuV7SwIvAhA&t=31.14s)]
*  Trey. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuV7SwIvAhA&t=35.26s)]
*  Trey, good afternoon. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuV7SwIvAhA&t=36.26s)]
*  Today Iranian President Masoud Pesachian signed a law that was passed last week by the Iranian [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuV7SwIvAhA&t=38.06s)]
*  parliament suspending Iran's participation in the IAEA. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuV7SwIvAhA&t=43.54s)]
*  Now the move was done with the UN nuclear watchdog, stipulating that any future work [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuV7SwIvAhA&t=48.14s)]
*  with the agency would have to be approved by Tehran's supreme national security council. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuV7SwIvAhA&t=54.1s)]
*  The decision by Iranian politicians came after both Israel and the United States bombed [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuV7SwIvAhA&t=58.38s)]
*  Iran's three key nuclear facilities. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuV7SwIvAhA&t=62.82s)]
*  The law to suspend cooperation with the international atomic energy agency was issued for enforcement. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuV7SwIvAhA&t=67.42s)]
*  The president announced the law to government bodies for enforcement. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuV7SwIvAhA&t=74.42s)]
*  The IAEA responded to the news saying they are aware of the reports and are awaiting [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuV7SwIvAhA&t=80.74s)]
*  official information from the Iranian government. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuV7SwIvAhA&t=84.67999999999999s)]
*  During Martha's interview with the IAEA director general Rafael Grossi, the director discussed [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuV7SwIvAhA&t=87.46s)]
*  the amount of damage caused to Iran's nuclear facilities amid questions about if and when [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuV7SwIvAhA&t=92.14s)]
*  the program could be rebuilt. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuV7SwIvAhA&t=97.03999999999999s)]
*  I could agree in the sense that what we see is a very important degree of damage in the [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuV7SwIvAhA&t=99.61999999999999s)]
*  three facilities, Natanz, which was the first to be hit and sustained very, very serious [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuV7SwIvAhA&t=105.78s)]
*  damage in one of the important centrifuge holes where enrichment was being carried out. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuV7SwIvAhA&t=111.9s)]
*  The current ceasefire between Israel and Iran is holding for now, but analysts say Israel [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuV7SwIvAhA&t=121.08s)]
*  could strike again if it believes Iran is advancing its nuclear program. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuV7SwIvAhA&t=125.66s)]
*  Trace? [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuV7SwIvAhA&t=130.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuV7SwIvAhA&t=131.86s)]
*  It's amazing. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuV7SwIvAhA&t=132.86s)]
*  Are they given any kind of timeline to that at all, Trey, when they say they could take [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuV7SwIvAhA&t=134.06s)]
*  some action on their own, Israel? [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuV7SwIvAhA&t=138.22000000000003s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuV7SwIvAhA&t=141.26000000000002s)]
*  They're waiting for the battlefield assessments, trying to understand just how much damage [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuV7SwIvAhA&t=142.46s)]
*  was done to these facilities following the American strikes that were ordered by President [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuV7SwIvAhA&t=146.82000000000002s)]
*  Trump. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuV7SwIvAhA&t=150.94000000000003s)]
*  We know there was a significant amount of damage, but the reality is many of these centrifuges [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuV7SwIvAhA&t=151.94000000000003s)]
*  are deep underground, now buried by dirt and rubble. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuV7SwIvAhA&t=156.22000000000003s)]
*  And so the Israelis are looking for that information, but also preparing for the possibility that [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuV7SwIvAhA&t=159.06s)]
*  Iran could launch more missiles into Israel. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuV7SwIvAhA&t=163.62s)]
*  Air defense systems across this country remain on high alert. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuV7SwIvAhA&t=166.18s)]
*  Trace? [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuV7SwIvAhA&t=169.26s)]
*  Trey, we'll get back to you as the news warrants. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuV7SwIvAhA&t=170.26s)]
*  It's now late evening in Tel Aviv. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuV7SwIvAhA&t=172.02s)]
*  Trey Yanks live for us on the ground. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuV7SwIvAhA&t=174.46s)]
