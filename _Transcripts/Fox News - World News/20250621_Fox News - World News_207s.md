# BREAKING: US launches attack against Iran
**Fox News - World News:** [June 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Rh9_1sKTv0)
*  This is a Fox News alert. News from the President of the United States that there has been an attack inside Iran. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Rh9_1sKTv0&t=0.0s)]
*  Just moments ago, President Donald Trump putting out on Truth Social, we have completed our very successful attack on three nuclear sites in Iran, including Fordo, Natanz and Esfahan. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Rh9_1sKTv0&t=9.0s)]
*  All planes are now outside of Iran airspace. Again, this from President Donald Trump. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Rh9_1sKTv0&t=22.0s)]
*  A full payload of bombs was dropped on the primary site, Fordo. All planes are safely on their way home. Congratulations to our great American warriors. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Rh9_1sKTv0&t=28.0s)]
*  There is not another military in the world that could have done this. Now is the time for peace. Thank you for your attention to this matter. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Rh9_1sKTv0&t=38.0s)]
*  And that's just seconds ago from President Donald Trump on Truth Social, suggesting that those B-2 bombers that perhaps were on the way may have been behind this. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Rh9_1sKTv0&t=47.0s)]
*  We'll get more details on these three sites that the president said has been attacked inside Iran. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Rh9_1sKTv0&t=58.0s)]
*  This comes after days of negotiations to try to get Iran to the negotiating table. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Rh9_1sKTv0&t=67.0s)]
*  The president of the United States saying it would have to be unconditional surrender, saying enrichment would have to stop. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Rh9_1sKTv0&t=74.0s)]
*  We heard from negotiations in Europe that that was not being accepted by the Iranians, that they would not stop enriching uranium. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Rh9_1sKTv0&t=81.0s)]
*  There was a thought that this could go as long as two weeks, as the president said he would decide within two weeks. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Rh9_1sKTv0&t=90.0s)]
*  However, two days is within two weeks. And now word from President Donald Trump that these attacks have happened. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Rh9_1sKTv0&t=97.0s)]
*  Again, interesting that three sites have been struck by U.S. bombers. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Rh9_1sKTv0&t=105.0s)]
*  And this, again, will get more information about the exact targets and what bombs were used. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Rh9_1sKTv0&t=111.0s)]
*  We expect that the GBU-57, the bunker buster, the massive penetrator bomb, may have been one of those used. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Rh9_1sKTv0&t=119.0s)]
*  Fordow is a nuclear facility inside Iran that is roughly a half mile deep, underneath a rock mountain-like facility that has been said to be the site of a lot of the enrichment capability. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Rh9_1sKTv0&t=127.0s)]
*  Esfahan, believed to be a storage facility for enriched uranium, and Natan's another part of the nuclear facilities. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Rh9_1sKTv0&t=144.0s)]
*  They have several throughout Iran. It has been long described as a very difficult and tedious effort to go after these nuclear sites. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Rh9_1sKTv0&t=155.0s)]
*  But the U.S., for the first time, launching an attack inside Iran. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Rh9_1sKTv0&t=166.0s)]
*  Again, the president of the United States saying all of the planes are out of Iranian airspace. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Rh9_1sKTv0&t=171.0s)]
*  The bombings do continue by the Israelis inside Iran as this back-and-forth volley between Israel and Iran has continued for some two weeks. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Rh9_1sKTv0&t=176.0s)]
*  We expect to hear more about this operation, not only from the Pentagon, but perhaps from the White House. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Rh9_1sKTv0&t=186.0s)]
*  Although the White House this afternoon, this evening rather, has called a lid, as far as meaning no one will talk after that, that may be changing now. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Rh9_1sKTv0&t=192.0s)]
*  Obviously, we have this Truth Social post from President Donald Trump. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Rh9_1sKTv0&t=203.0s)]
