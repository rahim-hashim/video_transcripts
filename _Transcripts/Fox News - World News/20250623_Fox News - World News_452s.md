# It would be really 'dumb' if Iran did this: Watters
**Fox News - World News:** [June 23, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM_w3kpCIOg)
*  Iran's plotting other ways to retaliate, including a threat to shut down the Strait of Hormuz, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM_w3kpCIOg&t=0.0s)]
*  a crucial waterway through which about 20% of the world's oil and natural gas shipments [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM_w3kpCIOg&t=5.16s)]
*  pass through. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM_w3kpCIOg&t=10.38s)]
*  But the White House is warning they'd be foolish to make that decision. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM_w3kpCIOg&t=11.78s)]
*  I think that would be suicidal. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM_w3kpCIOg&t=15.96s)]
*  Their entire economy runs through the Strait of Hormuz. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM_w3kpCIOg&t=17.64s)]
*  If they want to destroy their own economy and cause disruptions in the world, I think [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM_w3kpCIOg&t=20.66s)]
*  that would be their decision. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM_w3kpCIOg&t=25.0s)]
*  If they do that, it will be another terrible mistake. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM_w3kpCIOg&t=26.0s)]
*  It's economic suicide for them if they do it. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM_w3kpCIOg&t=27.92s)]
*  It would be, I think, a massive escalation that would merit a response, not just by us, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM_w3kpCIOg&t=30.400000000000002s)]
*  but from others. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM_w3kpCIOg&t=35.160000000000004s)]
*  President Trump keeping a close eye on the situation, he posted on Truth, quote, everyone [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM_w3kpCIOg&t=36.6s)]
*  keep oil prices down. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM_w3kpCIOg&t=40.84s)]
*  I'm watching. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM_w3kpCIOg&t=42.56s)]
*  You're playing right into the hands of the enemy. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM_w3kpCIOg&t=43.56s)]
*  Don't do it. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM_w3kpCIOg&t=46.44s)]
*  And from oil to cyber, the DHS is warning of retaliatory cyber attacks from Iran. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM_w3kpCIOg&t=48.06s)]
*  So that would be really dumb if the Iranians did that, Harold Ford Jr. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM_w3kpCIOg&t=54.8s)]
*  Not only would they invite a huge response from the world, but they'd hurt their own [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM_w3kpCIOg&t=59.16s)]
*  economy. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM_w3kpCIOg&t=63.4s)]
*  More important, they would hurt their own economy. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM_w3kpCIOg&t=64.39999999999999s)]
*  Think about it. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM_w3kpCIOg&t=66.44s)]
*  First of all, in the history of this strait, they've never closed it. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM_w3kpCIOg&t=67.44s)]
*  Number two, 20 million barrels of oil a day go through there. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM_w3kpCIOg&t=71.08s)]
*  Twenty percent of what the world uses, we use 20 million barrels a day as Americans, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM_w3kpCIOg&t=75.16s)]
*  so 20% of the production each day we use. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM_w3kpCIOg&t=79.24s)]
*  We fortunately are not as impacted by that because of what we do in our own country, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM_w3kpCIOg&t=82.44000000000001s)]
*  the production that has resulted here over the many years. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM_w3kpCIOg&t=86.60000000000001s)]
*  Barack Obama, who probably had the worst posture towards oil and gas, but was as good as any [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM_w3kpCIOg&t=90.72s)]
*  president has been as it relates to oil and gas drilling and exploration in the country, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM_w3kpCIOg&t=96.84s)]
*  was a big part of that. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM_w3kpCIOg&t=101.08000000000001s)]
*  And now we are where we are. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM_w3kpCIOg&t=102.08000000000001s)]
*  I think if they do this, it also demonstrates to the Iranian people that this regime that's [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM_w3kpCIOg&t=103.60000000000001s)]
*  in charge, and I'm not arguing that we should be for regime change. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM_w3kpCIOg&t=109.10000000000001s)]
*  But why would you do something that would hurt your own economy when you've already [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM_w3kpCIOg&t=112.38s)]
*  failed the people economically for so many years? [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM_w3kpCIOg&t=115.46s)]
*  So I agree with Secretary Rubio and Vice President Vance on this. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM_w3kpCIOg&t=118.42s)]
*  This seems like an odd thing to do. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM_w3kpCIOg&t=121.25999999999999s)]
*  But I've got to tell you, you can't put odd things out of the realm when you talk about [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM_w3kpCIOg&t=123.34s)]
*  Iran. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM_w3kpCIOg&t=127.22s)]
*  Right. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM_w3kpCIOg&t=128.22s)]
*  But they do seem totally focused on regime survival at this point. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM_w3kpCIOg&t=129.22s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, one would presume. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM_w3kpCIOg&t=133.22s)]
*  And the greatest way for your regime not to survive is you've already pissed off the United [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM_w3kpCIOg&t=135.62s)]
*  States. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM_w3kpCIOg&t=139.22s)]
*  Why don't you throw in China, right? [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM_w3kpCIOg&t=140.22s)]
*  Because China, one thing they care most about is China. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM_w3kpCIOg&t=143.06s)]
*  They don't care about Iran. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM_w3kpCIOg&t=145.5s)]
*  And China in Q1, first quarter of this year, 38 percent of oil that went through the Strait [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM_w3kpCIOg&t=147.22s)]
*  of Hormuz went to China. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM_w3kpCIOg&t=151.62s)]
*  China cannot allow the Strait of Hormuz to close. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM_w3kpCIOg&t=154.26s)]
*  That's why Secretary of State Marco Rubio was so smart to say, this strait can't close. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM_w3kpCIOg&t=156.74s)]
*  China time to step up. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM_w3kpCIOg&t=161.66s)]
*  So Iran's not going to do that because then they get China on their bad side. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM_w3kpCIOg&t=162.98s)]
*  They already have Russia on their bad side. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM_w3kpCIOg&t=166.32s)]
*  So prior to this all occurring, Putin made the point to emphasize our strategic cooperation [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM_w3kpCIOg&t=169.14000000000001s)]
*  agreement with Iran does not include military defense. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM_w3kpCIOg&t=172.98000000000002s)]
*  So you've lost Russia. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM_w3kpCIOg&t=176.54000000000002s)]
*  You've lost China. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM_w3kpCIOg&t=177.94s)]
*  You've lost the axis of resistance. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM_w3kpCIOg&t=179.66s)]
*  And Rahm Emanuel made a really smart point last week before all this went off. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM_w3kpCIOg&t=181.06s)]
*  He said, when the chips are down, the axis of resistance doesn't appear to be found anywhere. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM_w3kpCIOg&t=184.18s)]
*  And you want to lose China further, isolate them, close the strait. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM_w3kpCIOg&t=189.66s)]
*  It's amazing. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM_w3kpCIOg&t=192.70000000000002s)]
*  So getting into this strike, Dana, you go through the list of possible things that they [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM_w3kpCIOg&t=194.14000000000001s)]
*  could do. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM_w3kpCIOg&t=198.74s)]
*  And at this point, it seems like it's not as bad as everybody thought. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM_w3kpCIOg&t=200.1s)]
*  Well, and I think that we haven't mentioned someone, a part of this attack and all of [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM_w3kpCIOg&t=205.18s)]
*  this effort that we haven't mentioned yet. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM_w3kpCIOg&t=210.98000000000002s)]
*  And that's the Israelis. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM_w3kpCIOg&t=213.22s)]
*  The Israelis are so innovative. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM_w3kpCIOg&t=215.22s)]
*  They're so creative. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM_w3kpCIOg&t=217.58s)]
*  Their intelligence destroyed Hezbollah and Hamas or segregated their capabilities to [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM_w3kpCIOg&t=218.7s)]
*  the point that Iran, who relies on proxies in order to attack us or the Jewish people [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM_w3kpCIOg&t=224.29999999999998s)]
*  in Israel, they can't do it. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM_w3kpCIOg&t=229.54s)]
*  And now because Israel did all of that intel work and then they went in and they got air [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM_w3kpCIOg&t=232.7s)]
*  supremacy, that meant that they could take out missile launchers and rockets. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM_w3kpCIOg&t=236.85999999999999s)]
*  So and it cleared the way for President Trump to be able to say, all right, I'll do it. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM_w3kpCIOg&t=241.33999999999997s)]
*  And I'll do the final, because you don't have that capability, I'll do that final thing. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM_w3kpCIOg&t=246.7s)]
*  And it was such a moment of unity that I think the Iranians are just sitting there going, [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM_w3kpCIOg&t=250.29999999999998s)]
*  what could we do? [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM_w3kpCIOg&t=255.61999999999998s)]
*  We could throw a few missiles to Qatar now. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM_w3kpCIOg&t=257.14s)]
*  That didn't work. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM_w3kpCIOg&t=261.38s)]
*  What I am concerned about is the cyber capability, because you could take out missiles and things [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM_w3kpCIOg&t=262.38s)]
*  like that. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM_w3kpCIOg&t=267.8s)]
*  But it doesn't take that many people to figure out a way to hurt, let's for example, let's [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM_w3kpCIOg&t=268.8s)]
*  see what would they do to America? [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM_w3kpCIOg&t=273.41999999999996s)]
*  Let's say ban TikTok. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM_w3kpCIOg&t=275.02s)]
*  Like maybe they would actually ban TikTok and there would be a huge outcry and American [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM_w3kpCIOg&t=276.02s)]
*  children everywhere would be so upset. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM_w3kpCIOg&t=282.94s)]
*  The cyber issue, I think, is the one that we have to think about the most. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM_w3kpCIOg&t=286.02s)]
*  I think the sleeper cells are a concern. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM_w3kpCIOg&t=289.82s)]
*  We're going to talk about that in a moment. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM_w3kpCIOg&t=291.82s)]
*  I understand. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM_w3kpCIOg&t=293.06s)]
*  But Iran, because of what the Israelis did, is kind of unable to respond in a way that [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM_w3kpCIOg&t=294.06s)]
*  they would have three years ago before October 7th. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM_w3kpCIOg&t=300.94s)]
*  What do you think is the biggest threat right now that we face from Iran at this point? [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM_w3kpCIOg&t=305.46000000000004s)]
*  We just saw a suicide bomber in Damascus. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM_w3kpCIOg&t=310.5s)]
*  But I think what's different this time around is that the Arab countries don't have the [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM_w3kpCIOg&t=314.1s)]
*  stomach for it. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM_w3kpCIOg&t=318.7s)]
*  I think they'll be a part of the solution, not the problem. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM_w3kpCIOg&t=319.7s)]
*  I think the biggest threat probably is terror here in our country. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM_w3kpCIOg&t=322.7s)]
*  But I don't know that ... I guess my response to that has been if they're already here, [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM_w3kpCIOg&t=326.42s)]
*  they were already here. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM_w3kpCIOg&t=329.8s)]
*  When you look back at 9-11, to my knowledge, there was a major action by Clinton or Bush [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM_w3kpCIOg&t=331.58000000000004s)]
*  that said, now's the time. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM_w3kpCIOg&t=337.48s)]
*  It was planned for a long time. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM_w3kpCIOg&t=339.46000000000004s)]
*  In 9-11, it happened. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM_w3kpCIOg&t=341.1s)]
*  I would argue you could adjunct oppose Trump's actions on the nuclear sites to had Clinton [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM_w3kpCIOg&t=342.98s)]
*  taken out Osama bin Laden when he had the opportunities to. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM_w3kpCIOg&t=348.16s)]
*  So for the pacifists out there, sometimes military action is the prevention of war. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM_w3kpCIOg&t=351.90000000000003s)]
*  If you look at Iran's military capabilities, they have a unique navy. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM_w3kpCIOg&t=357.82s)]
*  It's built around the swarm mentality. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM_w3kpCIOg&t=361.58s)]
*  They have small, agile ships that can attack. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM_w3kpCIOg&t=363.85999999999996s)]
*  They can't really defend. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM_w3kpCIOg&t=366.46s)]
*  The last time their navy went up against us in 1988, we sunk half of it, pretty much. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM_w3kpCIOg&t=367.46s)]
*  So I don't think ... It really depends on does President Trump want to keep pushing. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM_w3kpCIOg&t=372.53999999999996s)]
*  From his post that he put out or his statement, I really don't know that any of this stuff [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM_w3kpCIOg&t=377.08s)]
