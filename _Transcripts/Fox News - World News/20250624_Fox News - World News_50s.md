*  I am glad we have got a ceasefire. I want to praise President Trump and his team for [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOwZnpw-tCE&t=0.0s)]
*  Operation Midnight Hammer. If you don't give him credit in the military credit, that is [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOwZnpw-tCE&t=4.92s)]
*  a problem for you. They deserve credit. This operation was flawless. It was effective more [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOwZnpw-tCE&t=10.48s)]
*  than anything else. It did obliterate these three sites. The pilots did a fantastic job, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOwZnpw-tCE&t=17.080000000000002s)]
*  but so did President Trump making a bold decision. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOwZnpw-tCE&t=23.240000000000002s)]

*  in Iran, the one who is still alive, said they're going right back to enrichment. So [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOwZnpw-tCE&t=39.58s)]
*  I'm not so sure we solved the problem. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOwZnpw-tCE&t=44.379999999999995s)]
