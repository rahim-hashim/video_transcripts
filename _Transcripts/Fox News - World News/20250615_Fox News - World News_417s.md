# Cruz unleashes on 'theocratic lunatic' ayatollah over nuclear weapon ambitions
**Fox News - World News:** [June 15, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-bq3WKMah0)
*  And now to the U.S.'s role, as the U.S. military has been supporting Israel in fighting retaliation from Iran this weekend. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-bq3WKMah0&t=0.0s)]
*  Joining me now is Texas Senator Ted Cruz, a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-bq3WKMah0&t=7.5s)]
*  Senator, thank you so much for being here. Your reaction on the U.S.'s side? [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-bq3WKMah0&t=12.0s)]
*  Well, Maria, this week has been extraordinarily consequential, extraordinarily dangerous, and I will say this week was also inevitable. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-bq3WKMah0&t=20.0s)]
*  The Ayatollah is a theocratic lunatic. He regularly chants, death to America, death to Israel. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-bq3WKMah0&t=28.0s)]
*  He is building nuclear weapons because he wants to be able to use nuclear weapons. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-bq3WKMah0&t=34.0s)]
*  Now, President Trump drew a very clear red line in the sand. He said on April 12th, he told Iran, you have 60 days to negotiate. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-bq3WKMah0&t=40.0s)]
*  I led a coalition of 52 Republican senators, and we all said, we stand with President Trump. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-bq3WKMah0&t=49.0s)]
*  President Trump has been clear that the standard for any deal must be complete dismantlement. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-bq3WKMah0&t=55.0s)]
*  No centrifuges, no enrichments. There is no reason a theocratic lunatic who chants death to America should have nuclear weapons, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-bq3WKMah0&t=62.0s)]
*  the tools to murder millions of Americans or millions of Israelis. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-bq3WKMah0&t=70.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-bq3WKMah0&t=74.0s)]
*  On the 61st day, the Ayatollah publicly said he would not shut down a single centrifuge. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-bq3WKMah0&t=75.0s)]
*  He said he would build more centrifuges. He would make more enriched uranium in order to make more nuclear weapons. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-bq3WKMah0&t=82.0s)]
*  That was effectively, Maria, a giant middle finger at President Trump. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-bq3WKMah0&t=89.0s)]
*  But it was also a message to Israel, we're not going to stop. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-bq3WKMah0&t=94.0s)]
*  And if you don't act, you're going to find out when we've achieved success with a mushroom cloud in the skies of Tel Aviv or New York or Los Angeles. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-bq3WKMah0&t=97.0s)]
*  And so Israel act acted. They acted with extraordinary efficacy. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-bq3WKMah0&t=107.0s)]
*  We've seen 720 military strikes across military across Israel. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-bq3WKMah0&t=112.0s)]
*  They have decapitated the top leadership of Iran's military. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-bq3WKMah0&t=117.0s)]
*  They've taken out the head of the IRGC. They've taken out the chief of staff of the armed forces. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-bq3WKMah0&t=121.0s)]
*  They've taken out multiple nuclear scientists. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-bq3WKMah0&t=125.0s)]
*  They've leveled the tons, which is the chief research area where they're doing much of the enrichment. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-bq3WKMah0&t=129.0s)]
*  And Israel is committed to getting the job done and understand what the job is. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-bq3WKMah0&t=134.0s)]
*  The job is to prevent Iran from being able to acquire nuclear weapons. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-bq3WKMah0&t=139.0s)]
*  It's not conquering Iran. It's not turning them into a democracy. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-bq3WKMah0&t=144.0s)]
*  It's taking away their capacity to commit mass murder. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-bq3WKMah0&t=147.0s)]
*  And this week they've made enormous progress in getting that accomplished. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-bq3WKMah0&t=151.0s)]
*  And that goal has far and wide implications for the world. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-bq3WKMah0&t=155.0s)]
*  How would you assess those implications? [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-bq3WKMah0&t=160.0s)]
*  Well, I would assess them that they're enormously beneficial to us, to America. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-bq3WKMah0&t=162.0s)]
*  You know, there's a lot of discussion of America first foreign policy. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-bq3WKMah0&t=168.0s)]
*  And I emphatically agree with America first foreign policy. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-bq3WKMah0&t=171.0s)]
*  This week is a good week for America. Why? [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-bq3WKMah0&t=175.0s)]
*  Because a very dangerous enemy who has been murdering hundreds of Americans. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-bq3WKMah0&t=178.0s)]
*  The Ayatollah has murdered over 600 servicemen and women. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-bq3WKMah0&t=183.0s)]
*  He's the chief funder of terrorism across the globe. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-bq3WKMah0&t=186.0s)]
*  And he's trying to get weapons to be able to murder not hundreds of Americans, but millions of Americans. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-bq3WKMah0&t=189.0s)]
*  And Israel, a little bitty country surrounded by enemies in the Middle East. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-bq3WKMah0&t=194.0s)]
*  Israel is doing an enormous favor to America right now. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-bq3WKMah0&t=199.0s)]
*  They're taking out the capability of Iran to strike out at America. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-bq3WKMah0&t=203.0s)]
*  And I'll say two things. Number one, Iran would not be in this position [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-bq3WKMah0&t=208.0s)]
*  if Joe Biden and the Democrats had not spent four years flooding over $100 billion into Iran. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-bq3WKMah0&t=211.0s)]
*  In a very real sense, Joe Biden and the Democrats funded Iran's terrorism efforts and funded their nuclear efforts. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-bq3WKMah0&t=219.0s)]
*  And number two, I stand unequivocally with President Trump. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-bq3WKMah0&t=226.0s)]
*  President Trump has said Iran will not get a nuclear weapon and we will do whatever is necessary. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-bq3WKMah0&t=230.0s)]
*  And that means we stand unequivocally with the state of Israel. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-bq3WKMah0&t=236.0s)]
*  That is where America is. It is where I am. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-bq3WKMah0&t=240.0s)]
*  And it's the right place to be for the interest of the United States of America. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-bq3WKMah0&t=242.0s)]
*  So what does that mean for the United States? Does this entangle us in a wider war? [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-bq3WKMah0&t=246.0s)]
*  So I don't believe it does. I don't believe there's any scenario where we would see American boots on the ground. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-bq3WKMah0&t=254.0s)]
*  I think we are already seeing American logistical help, help defending Israel in terms of intercepting missiles. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-bq3WKMah0&t=260.0s)]
*  Iran is firing wantonly at civilian areas. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-bq3WKMah0&t=268.0s)]
*  The Israeli military strikes are very targeted to military locations, nuclear research locations that are trying to build nuclear weapons. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-bq3WKMah0&t=272.0s)]
*  Iran is just lobbing missiles into population centers trying to kill as many Jews as they can. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-bq3WKMah0&t=281.0s)]
*  And Israel has done a very effective job defending that. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-bq3WKMah0&t=287.0s)]
*  The United States has been assisting in defending those civilian populations. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-bq3WKMah0&t=291.0s)]
*  And the United States also assists with logistical assistance and assists historically in helping provide weaponry. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-bq3WKMah0&t=295.0s)]
*  I think all of that is important. But Israel's military is incredibly effective. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-bq3WKMah0&t=302.0s)]
*  They're going to be the ones providing the boots on the ground. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-bq3WKMah0&t=307.0s)]
*  And I think that's exactly what they're doing right now. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-bq3WKMah0&t=310.0s)]
*  Senator, do you want to see regime change? Do you think that happens soon? [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-bq3WKMah0&t=313.0s)]
*  And what would the future look like in that regard? [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-bq3WKMah0&t=318.0s)]
*  Look, I think it is very much in the interest of America to see regime change. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-bq3WKMah0&t=321.0s)]
*  I don't think there's any redeeming the Ayatollah. He is filled with hatred. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-bq3WKMah0&t=326.0s)]
*  You know, I'll tell you a story that's a little bit amazing. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-bq3WKMah0&t=331.0s)]
*  The former head of the Iranian nuclear program, a man whom many say was sent to meet his maker by the Mossad, the Israeli intelligence forces. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-bq3WKMah0&t=333.0s)]
*  He had written in his last will and testament that he wanted the following words written on his tombstone. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-bq3WKMah0&t=345.0s)]
*  Here lies a man who sought to annihilate Israel. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-bq3WKMah0&t=351.0s)]
*  Maria, think of the level of bilious hate when that's the only thing you want to be remembered for is I am such a bigot, such an anti-Semite, [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-bq3WKMah0&t=356.0s)]
*  filled with so much hate that the entire purpose of my life is to murder as many Jews as possible. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-bq3WKMah0&t=366.0s)]
*  That's what we're dealing with, religious fanatics. So it is unquestionably in America's interest to see a secular regime. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-bq3WKMah0&t=372.0s)]
*  You know, before the revolution, Iran was a secular country that was an ally of America. I think the people want to go back to that. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-bq3WKMah0&t=380.0s)]
*  And we want to assess how significant the nuclear capability is in Iran right now. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-bq3WKMah0&t=387.0s)]
*  Senator, it's good to have you this morning. We so appreciate your leadership here. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-bq3WKMah0&t=393.0s)]
*  Senator Ted Cruz joining us. Thank you, sir. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-bq3WKMah0&t=396.0s)]
*  Thank you, sir. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-bq3WKMah0&t=402.0s)]
