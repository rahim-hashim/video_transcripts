# Gov. DeSantis on helping Americans evacuate Israel: 'We sprung into action'
**Fox News - World News:** [June 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2NuT_Aj-es)
*  Well, today, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis greeted Americans he helped evacuate from [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2NuT_Aj-es&t=0.0s)]
*  what is now a war zone in Israel. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2NuT_Aj-es&t=5.08s)]
*  So far, over 1,500 Americans have been extracted from the region. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2NuT_Aj-es&t=8.16s)]
*  Here now with more, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2NuT_Aj-es&t=11.8s)]
*  Governor DeSantis, great to see you. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2NuT_Aj-es&t=14.44s)]
*  I saw you in the Tampa Airport with some of these evacuees, and you said that this is [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2NuT_Aj-es&t=16.72s)]
*  the most challenging and logistically difficult mission Florida Department of Emergency Management [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2NuT_Aj-es&t=21.56s)]
*  has ever pulled off. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2NuT_Aj-es&t=26.84s)]
*  What did it entail as you rescued these Floridians? [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2NuT_Aj-es&t=28.58s)]
*  Well, Kaylee, it's good to be with you. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2NuT_Aj-es&t=31.299999999999997s)]
*  We have done this in Israel before, after the October 7, 2023 Hamas attacks. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2NuT_Aj-es&t=35.18s)]
*  We've also done it in Haiti when the situation got really bad there, rescued our people from [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2NuT_Aj-es&t=40.9s)]
*  that. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2NuT_Aj-es&t=45.62s)]
*  But in this situation, you have the total shutdown of Ben Gurion Airport. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2NuT_Aj-es&t=46.62s)]
*  You have people that are all of a sudden stranded there, but you have ballistic missiles raining [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2NuT_Aj-es&t=50.26s)]
*  down from a very hostile nation. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2NuT_Aj-es&t=54.82s)]
*  So we had students who were studying in Israel from our state universities. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2NuT_Aj-es&t=59.1s)]
*  We had a number of young people, student age, who were on the Birthright Israel program. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2NuT_Aj-es&t=66.3s)]
*  And all of a sudden, their entire lives have been upended. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2NuT_Aj-es&t=71.22s)]
*  And what happened was, because we have a track record of helping in these situations, we [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2NuT_Aj-es&t=75.12s)]
*  were willing to do it, and we wanted to do it. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2NuT_Aj-es&t=80.62s)]
*  But people were reaching out to us saying, hey, we need help. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2NuT_Aj-es&t=82.78s)]
*  And so we sprung into action and were able to do that. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2NuT_Aj-es&t=85.98s)]
*  So there have been 1,500-plus that have been evacuated out of Israel. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2NuT_Aj-es&t=89.06s)]
*  We're now running flights from Cyprus. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2NuT_Aj-es&t=93.30000000000001s)]
*  So the plane that I welcomed this morning was the second plane that's come in from Cyprus. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2NuT_Aj-es&t=95.18s)]
*  E-planes carry between 150 and 200 passengers. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2NuT_Aj-es&t=100.42s)]
*  And I can tell you, there was just a real big sense of relief and appreciation to be [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2NuT_Aj-es&t=104.14s)]
*  back in the United States. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2NuT_Aj-es&t=110.5s)]
*  I mean, these were folks who were not expecting this to happen. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2NuT_Aj-es&t=112.10000000000001s)]
*  They were supposed to be there a limited amount of time. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2NuT_Aj-es&t=116.14s)]
*  And they really didn't have a lot of hope immediately. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2NuT_Aj-es&t=118.86s)]
*  And the state of Florida stepped up. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2NuT_Aj-es&t=121.5s)]
*  We have a lot of challenging problem sets we deal with, with hurricanes. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2NuT_Aj-es&t=122.96000000000001s)]
*  We've used our emergency response personnel to help enforce laws against illegal immigration [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2NuT_Aj-es&t=127.06s)]
*  and even do transportation to places like Martha's Vineyard. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2NuT_Aj-es&t=132.38s)]
*  But this was a very difficult situation. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2NuT_Aj-es&t=136.12s)]
*  And I think everyone involved did a really good job. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2NuT_Aj-es&t=139.1s)]
*  And the operations are ongoing. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2NuT_Aj-es&t=141.32s)]
*  We're going to continue to bring flights in as people need it. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2NuT_Aj-es&t=143.2s)]
*  You know, speaking to the broader conflict, Governor DeSantis, you've served in the Navy. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2NuT_Aj-es&t=146.23999999999998s)]
*  You've been deployed to Iraq. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2NuT_Aj-es&t=150.56s)]
*  You are a smart and astute student of foreign policy. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2NuT_Aj-es&t=152.07999999999998s)]
*  What do you think the right answer is now in Iran? [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2NuT_Aj-es&t=155.72s)]
*  Striking for dough, continuing negotiations? [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2NuT_Aj-es&t=159.0s)]
*  Your analysis? [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2NuT_Aj-es&t=161.68s)]
*  Well, I think President Trump's policy from the time he came down the escalator in 2015 [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2NuT_Aj-es&t=162.68s)]
*  until today is the right policy. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2NuT_Aj-es&t=170.24s)]
*  Iran cannot have a nuclear weapon. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2NuT_Aj-es&t=173.04000000000002s)]
*  And part of the reason is we just don't want to see nuclear proliferation. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2NuT_Aj-es&t=175.68s)]
*  Part of the reason is no country has been more hostile to the United States since 1979 [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2NuT_Aj-es&t=179.36s)]
*  than the Iranian Mullah regime. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2NuT_Aj-es&t=185.32000000000002s)]
*  But then their ideology, I mean, these are very extreme Shia Islamists. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2NuT_Aj-es&t=188.0s)]
*  And we've always recognized that nuclear weapons can be deterred because if someone were to [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2NuT_Aj-es&t=194.8s)]
*  use it against us or a different country, that country could respond or we could respond, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2NuT_Aj-es&t=199.85999999999999s)]
*  and then we both end up in smoke. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2NuT_Aj-es&t=205.34s)]
*  That's not a good prospect. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2NuT_Aj-es&t=206.94s)]
*  And it worked during the Cold War to deter. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2NuT_Aj-es&t=208.18s)]
*  The problem is with these Iranian Mullahs, mutually assured destruction is not really [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2NuT_Aj-es&t=211.26s)]
*  a deterrent. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2NuT_Aj-es&t=215.66s)]
*  It's an inducement. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2NuT_Aj-es&t=216.66s)]
*  Because if they can wipe Israel off the map, even if Israel were to respond and kill tens [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2NuT_Aj-es&t=217.66s)]
*  of millions of Iranians, these Mullahs would think that's a good thing, that that is following [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2NuT_Aj-es&t=222.34s)]
*  their radical theology. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2NuT_Aj-es&t=227.74s)]
*  And so that's really the policy. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2NuT_Aj-es&t=229.34s)]
*  You know, you were talking about with your previous guest about regime change. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2NuT_Aj-es&t=231.34s)]
*  That is not what President Trump's going to seek. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2NuT_Aj-es&t=235.02s)]
*  You know, we're not going to be sending American troops in to change the government. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2NuT_Aj-es&t=237.42000000000002s)]
*  I mean, we've we've tried that in Iraq that obviously has huge complications. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2NuT_Aj-es&t=241.62s)]
*  I do hope the Iranian people will have a new government at some point. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2NuT_Aj-es&t=245.74s)]
*  I think it'd be better for Iranian society. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2NuT_Aj-es&t=249.82000000000002s)]
*  I think it'd be better for the Middle East and for for the broader world. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2NuT_Aj-es&t=252.10000000000002s)]
*  That's ultimately the decision for the Iranian people to make. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2NuT_Aj-es&t=255.38000000000002s)]
*  It's not one that can be imposed externally. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2NuT_Aj-es&t=258.90000000000003s)]
*  So I think the focus should be from the American perspective is Iran can't have a nuclear weapon. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2NuT_Aj-es&t=261.3s)]
*  And when this is over, it needs to be clear that Iran will not get a nuclear weapon. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2NuT_Aj-es&t=266.86s)]
*  Precisely. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2NuT_Aj-es&t=271.66s)]
*  And I do want to ask you about this laughable headline from The New York Times. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2NuT_Aj-es&t=272.66s)]
*  I find it laughable. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2NuT_Aj-es&t=275.5s)]
*  U.S. spy agencies assess Iran remains undecided on building a bomb. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2NuT_Aj-es&t=276.5s)]
*  President Trump said today that intelligence assessment is wrong. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2NuT_Aj-es&t=282.42s)]
*  I spoke with General Jack Keane. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2NuT_Aj-es&t=285.66s)]
*  He said they've been trying to do this for 25 years. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2NuT_Aj-es&t=287.06s)]
*  They have a whole enterprise about nuclear weapons. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2NuT_Aj-es&t=289.06s)]
*  Your thoughts on that headline. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2NuT_Aj-es&t=291.62s)]
*  Well, it's absurd. Now, look, are they a week away, a year away? [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2NuT_Aj-es&t=295.06s)]
*  I don't think anybody really knows that clearly the Ayatollah wants a nuclear weapon. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2NuT_Aj-es&t=298.14s)]
*  It's part of their designs will allow them to export jihad more effectively throughout [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2NuT_Aj-es&t=303.94s)]
*  the Middle East and around the world. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2NuT_Aj-es&t=309.66s)]
*  And they know what that would mean in their hands. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2NuT_Aj-es&t=311.58s)]
*  And so, of course, they're trying to do a nuclear weapon. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2NuT_Aj-es&t=314.42s)]
*  I think John Radcliffe, the CIA director, had a good analogy. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2NuT_Aj-es&t=317.38s)]
*  If you have a football team that drives the ball down the field to the one yard line, [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2NuT_Aj-es&t=320.82s)]
*  you can say they're not trying to score a touchdown, but they're probably trying to [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2NuT_Aj-es&t=324.74s)]
*  score a touchdown. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2NuT_Aj-es&t=328.38s)]
*  So everything Iran has done over the last 25 years has been trying to achieve a nuclear [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2NuT_Aj-es&t=329.38s)]
*  weapon. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2NuT_Aj-es&t=335.06s)]
*  Fantastic sports analogy. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2NuT_Aj-es&t=336.06s)]
*  You have a track record of rescuing Floridians. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2NuT_Aj-es&t=337.06s)]
*  Keep it up. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2NuT_Aj-es&t=339.66s)]
*  Thank you, Governor DeSantis. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2NuT_Aj-es&t=340.66s)]
*  Hey, Sean Hannity here. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2NuT_Aj-es&t=341.66s)]
