# LISTEN UP: Trump's message to Iran on nuclear deal
**Fox News - World News:** [June 09, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtZVzHdQaAM)
*  What do you make of the Ayatollah saying that they have to enrich? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtZVzHdQaAM&t=0.0s)]
*  Well, they won't be enriching. If they enrich, then we're going to have to do it the other way. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtZVzHdQaAM&t=5.0s)]
*  And I don't really want to do it the other way, but we're going to have to do it the other way. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtZVzHdQaAM&t=10.0s)]
*  There's not going to be enrichment. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtZVzHdQaAM&t=13.0s)]
*  President Trump is standing firm. He insists any nuclear deal with Iran would not let it enrich uranium. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtZVzHdQaAM&t=15.0s)]
*  While also hinting the U.S. could use military action if Tehran continues enriching that nuclear fuel. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtZVzHdQaAM&t=21.0s)]
*  Joining us now is retired general Jack Keene, a Fox News strategic analyst. Great to have you here. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtZVzHdQaAM&t=27.0s)]
*  Axios also said the same. Israel has been assured by the U.S. it won't strike Iran unless talks fail. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtZVzHdQaAM&t=31.0s)]
*  I'm sorry, Israel has told the U.S. it won't strike unless talks fail. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtZVzHdQaAM&t=39.0s)]
*  But the president's been very clear on this, that the Iranians will not be allowed to enrich uranium. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtZVzHdQaAM&t=43.0s)]
*  So I know that there are people in the media, maybe people in the region, that want to have daylight [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtZVzHdQaAM&t=49.0s)]
*  between the United States and Israel. So far I feel like President Trump is doing a good job keeping that pretty cohesive. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtZVzHdQaAM&t=56.0s)]
*  Your thoughts? [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtZVzHdQaAM&t=62.0s)]
*  Yeah, well I think kind of where we are in setting the table here, what are the Iranians really up to? [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtZVzHdQaAM&t=65.0s)]
*  They want to drag these negotiations out as much as they can. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtZVzHdQaAM&t=71.0s)]
*  They were very successful with the Obama administration. Negotiations began in 2013, two years it took before they had a deal. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtZVzHdQaAM&t=75.0s)]
*  And by the way, the Obama administration gave up all of their in-going positions, enriching uranium, dismantling a nuclear program, gave that up. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtZVzHdQaAM&t=82.0s)]
*  Ballistic missiles gave that up and gave up also state sponsor of terrorism and malign behavior in the region. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtZVzHdQaAM&t=91.0s)]
*  Gave up all of it. What Yaya Tolar and his negotiators are up to here, they're trying to recover their air defense systems, Dana, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtZVzHdQaAM&t=98.0s)]
*  that the Israelis took down in their last attack rather significantly in October. And they have recovered some of it. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtZVzHdQaAM&t=107.0s)]
*  The longer they drag these negotiations out, the better it will be for them. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtZVzHdQaAM&t=114.0s)]
*  And I think where the Yaya Tolar is, the guy who runs the regime, where he is in his head, is he's not going to let the United States dismantle his nuclear enterprise. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtZVzHdQaAM&t=118.0s)]
*  And he's willing to accept an attack and thinks he can survive it and then rebuild his nuclear program at some point. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtZVzHdQaAM&t=129.0s)]
*  I think that's where he is in his head. And he's dragging it out so he can recover his air defense systems. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtZVzHdQaAM&t=136.0s)]
*  Do you think he could survive that? [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtZVzHdQaAM&t=142.0s)]
*  We cannot completely destroy the entire nuclear enterprise. We can delay it for a certain period of time, a year or two, but we would have to stay focused on it. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtZVzHdQaAM&t=147.0s)]
*  And if they attempt to rebuild it and recover it, the Israelis would likely strike it again. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtZVzHdQaAM&t=156.0s)]
*  That's kind of where we are. That's well known within military channels and certainly within the IDF and Israel's government. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtZVzHdQaAM&t=161.0s)]
*  And I think it's well known within the Iranian government as well. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtZVzHdQaAM&t=169.0s)]
*  Right. They know it too. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtZVzHdQaAM&t=173.0s)]
*  The president is committed to this. They're not going to have a nuclear weapon. And he's unequivocal about it. And he knows full well, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtZVzHdQaAM&t=174.0s)]
*  If they give them enrichment at any level, they can weaponize that in a matter of weeks to get to enrichment grade for a nuclear weapon. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtZVzHdQaAM&t=180.0s)]
*  That we've seen already happen. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtZVzHdQaAM&t=187.0s)]
*  And so let's stay on this topic for the remaining time that we have. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtZVzHdQaAM&t=189.0s)]
*  At this point, how much time then do you think the administration, the Trump administration, should allow for these talks to continue if Iran is just playing for time? [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtZVzHdQaAM&t=194.0s)]
*  Well, I turn that over to the president and his negotiators. They're involved in this. They have the tenor of it. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtZVzHdQaAM&t=205.0s)]
*  They see what's going on with the opposing negotiators from Iran, who, by the way, who are very experienced. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtZVzHdQaAM&t=211.0s)]
*  And they got a better feel on when to pull the switch on this and say, OK, we're done here. We're not making any progress with these guys. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtZVzHdQaAM&t=218.0s)]
*  I leave that up to them to make that decision. I don't think we can sit on the sidelines and make that judgment. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtZVzHdQaAM&t=227.0s)]
*  Understood. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtZVzHdQaAM&t=233.0s)]
*  All right, General Jack Keane, thank you so much for your insights this morning. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtZVzHdQaAM&t=234.0s)]
