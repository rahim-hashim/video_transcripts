# Peter Doocy reveals Trump's message for Iranian supreme leader #shorts #iran #trump #israel #world
**Fox News - World News:** [June 18, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKfE6yYDGF8)
*  The president revealed that the next week concerning Iran could be very big, as he told [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKfE6yYDGF8&t=0.0s)]
*  us that some Iranian leaders could actually come here to the White House. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKfE6yYDGF8&t=5.68s)]
*  Have the Iranians reached out to you? [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKfE6yYDGF8&t=10.56s)]
*  Yes. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKfE6yYDGF8&t=13.68s)]
*  And what did they say? [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKfE6yYDGF8&t=14.68s)]
*  I said it's very late, you know. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKfE6yYDGF8&t=16.44s)]
*  I said it's very late to be talking. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKfE6yYDGF8&t=20.6s)]
*  They even suggested they come to the White House. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKfE6yYDGF8&t=23.32s)]
*  It's a big difference. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKfE6yYDGF8&t=25.28s)]
*  But they've suggested that they come to the White House. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKfE6yYDGF8&t=27.68s)]
*  That's courageous. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKfE6yYDGF8&t=31.28s)]
*  But the president is in no rush to get the Iranians here because he revealed he told [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKfE6yYDGF8&t=34.28s)]
*  Bibi Netanyahu to keep going with the strikes inside Iran. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKfE6yYDGF8&t=38.76s)]
*  President Trump will not reveal his current thinking about striking nuclear targets, and [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKfE6yYDGF8&t=43.24s)]
*  his defense secretary was just asked about possible strike packages. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKfE6yYDGF8&t=47.480000000000004s)]
*  My question for you is whether you have been asked actively to provide options for the [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKfE6yYDGF8&t=54.32s)]
*  president regarding a strike in the Middle East. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKfE6yYDGF8&t=59.88s)]
*  If I had or I had not, I wouldn't disclose that in this forum, Senator. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKfE6yYDGF8&t=63.46s)]
*  My job, our job, the chairman and I, at all times, is to make sure the president has options [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKfE6yYDGF8&t=68.08s)]
*  and is informed of what those options might be and what the ramifications of those options [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKfE6yYDGF8&t=73.4s)]
*  might be. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKfE6yYDGF8&t=78.2s)]
*  The president was asked what his message is for Iran's supreme leader, who is refusing [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKfE6yYDGF8&t=79.36s)]
*  the unconditional surrender the president wants. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKfE6yYDGF8&t=84.24000000000001s)]
*  The president sent his message to the Ayatollah. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKfE6yYDGF8&t=86.96000000000001s)]
*  Good luck, Harris. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKfE6yYDGF8&t=89.76s)]
