# Israeli ambassador sounds alarm if mullahs 'run loose' with ballistic missiles, nuclear weapon
**Fox News - World News:** [June 15, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Me5KVM9lfc)
*  Joining us now is Yaquil Leiter, who is the Israeli ambassador to the United States. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Me5KVM9lfc&t=0.0s)]
*  Mr. Ambassador, welcome. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Me5KVM9lfc&t=3.7600000000000002s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Me5KVM9lfc&t=6.76s)]
*  Good morning, Shannon. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Me5KVM9lfc&t=7.76s)]
*  Can you give us a sense of a timeline, an end goal? [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Me5KVM9lfc&t=8.76s)]
*  How will you measure success? [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Me5KVM9lfc&t=12.24s)]
*  When will this mission wrap? [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Me5KVM9lfc&t=14.16s)]
*  Well, I think we have a very good indication right now of how this needs to be wrapped [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Me5KVM9lfc&t=16.44s)]
*  up. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Me5KVM9lfc&t=21.76s)]
*  As we talk, Shannon, there are missiles, ballistic missiles being fired from Iran into Israel. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Me5KVM9lfc&t=22.900000000000002s)]
*  We're expecting a hit very soon. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Me5KVM9lfc&t=28.24s)]
*  And this is very telling about what we're trying to contend with. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Me5KVM9lfc&t=30.4s)]
*  The Iranians have a program, a very clear program, a written program to destroy us through [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Me5KVM9lfc&t=35.56s)]
*  nuclear weapons and through massive ballistic missile attacks. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Me5KVM9lfc&t=41.92s)]
*  And we saw what one ballistic missile can do when it gets through the Iron Dome system, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Me5KVM9lfc&t=46.2s)]
*  the defensive shield system. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Me5KVM9lfc&t=50.4s)]
*  That's their intention, to kill as many people as possible. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Me5KVM9lfc&t=52.959999999999994s)]
*  This is what our prime minister has been saying for 15 years now. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Me5KVM9lfc&t=56.24s)]
*  This is what the president of the United States has said repeatedly over the past three, four [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Me5KVM9lfc&t=59.16s)]
*  months. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Me5KVM9lfc&t=63.16s)]
*  They cannot achieve a nuclear weapon because if they do achieve a path to a nuclear weapon, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Me5KVM9lfc&t=64.16s)]
*  they're going to use it. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Me5KVM9lfc&t=68.4s)]
*  So, of course, the U.S. was in some form of talks. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Me5KVM9lfc&t=69.68s)]
*  Going into, we had hoped, a sixth round with Iran regarding their nuclear program. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Me5KVM9lfc&t=73.96000000000001s)]
*  Senator Chris Murphy, a Democrat, has said he feels like what Israel has done actually [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Me5KVM9lfc&t=78.4s)]
*  upended that process. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Me5KVM9lfc&t=83.88s)]
*  I want to read you a little bit of his statement. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Me5KVM9lfc&t=84.92s)]
*  He said, Israel's attack on Iran clearly intended to scuttle the Trump administration's negotiations [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Me5KVM9lfc&t=86.28s)]
*  with Iran, risks a regional war that will likely be catastrophic for America and is [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Me5KVM9lfc&t=91.64s)]
*  further evidence of how little respect world leaders, including our own allies, have for [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Me5KVM9lfc&t=96.6s)]
*  President Trump. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Me5KVM9lfc&t=101.64s)]
*  How do you respond to the accusations that Israel has made the situation worse by upending [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Me5KVM9lfc&t=103.19999999999999s)]
*  those talks? [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Me5KVM9lfc&t=108.03999999999999s)]
*  Well, I mean, it's interesting that Senator Murphy is now coming to the defense of the [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Me5KVM9lfc&t=109.2s)]
*  Trump administration. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Me5KVM9lfc&t=116.0s)]
*  A bit of an oddity, I would say. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Me5KVM9lfc&t=117.0s)]
*  But Senator Murphy, you know, has voted in favor of an arms embargo on Israel while we [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Me5KVM9lfc&t=119.28s)]
*  were at a war for our life. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Me5KVM9lfc&t=123.96000000000001s)]
*  So I wouldn't be too concerned about his statement about Iran. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Me5KVM9lfc&t=125.88000000000001s)]
*  We were in favor of negotiations throughout. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Me5KVM9lfc&t=131.08s)]
*  We hoped that Steve Witkoff, the president's envoy, negotiating with Iran, would be successful. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Me5KVM9lfc&t=134.44s)]
*  The point is that they need to have their nuclear weapons program dismantled. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Me5KVM9lfc&t=141.36s)]
*  That's our endgame. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Me5KVM9lfc&t=147.24s)]
*  And if it can be done through negotiations, if it can be done through talks and agreements, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Me5KVM9lfc&t=148.60000000000002s)]
*  that's great. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Me5KVM9lfc&t=154.60000000000002s)]
*  But as we said from the outset, the chance that the mullahs of Iran, I mean, this is [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Me5KVM9lfc&t=155.64000000000001s)]
*  a lunatic occult, a death cult that favors mass murder, talks every day about destroying [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Me5KVM9lfc&t=160.4s)]
*  our state, are not going to agree in the course of negotiations. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Me5KVM9lfc&t=168.35999999999999s)]
*  And this is going to have to be done militarily. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Me5KVM9lfc&t=173.04s)]
*  And our sons and daughters are flying those planes now to ensure that the state of Israel [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Me5KVM9lfc&t=175.0s)]
*  survives. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Me5KVM9lfc&t=180.24s)]
*  Look, the important thing here to understand is that the Jewish people experienced 80 years [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Me5KVM9lfc&t=181.24s)]
*  ago a little guy with a mustache running around Europe saying he was going to annihilate us. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Me5KVM9lfc&t=185.84s)]
*  And nobody listened. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Me5KVM9lfc&t=190.72s)]
*  And nobody raised a finger. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Me5KVM9lfc&t=191.72000000000003s)]
*  And we lost one-third of our people, six million. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Me5KVM9lfc&t=192.76000000000002s)]
*  And we entered into a second world war that took the lives of 65 million people. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Me5KVM9lfc&t=195.20000000000002s)]
*  If we let these mullahs run loose with ballistic missiles and nuclear weapons, that's going [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Me5KVM9lfc&t=199.60000000000002s)]
*  to happen again. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Me5KVM9lfc&t=204.32000000000002s)]
*  So what we're doing is preventing war, not advancing war. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Me5KVM9lfc&t=205.32000000000002s)]
*  Well, Ambassador, let me ask you about this, because you've talked about the Fordow site. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Me5KVM9lfc&t=208.36s)]
*  That needs to be gone. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Me5KVM9lfc&t=211.88000000000002s)]
*  It is deep underground. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Me5KVM9lfc&t=212.88000000000002s)]
*  Axios notes this. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Me5KVM9lfc&t=214.32s)]
*  Israel lacks the huge bunker busters needed to destroy this facility and the strategic [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Me5KVM9lfc&t=215.95999999999998s)]
*  bombers to carry them. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Me5KVM9lfc&t=220.23999999999998s)]
*  The U.S. has both within flying distance of Iran. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Me5KVM9lfc&t=221.51999999999998s)]
*  Any indication to you that the U.S. would be willing to offer those particular weapons [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Me5KVM9lfc&t=225.28s)]
*  and the planes to carry them that you need? [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Me5KVM9lfc&t=230.72s)]
*  Look, that's a decision that the United States government has to take. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Me5KVM9lfc&t=233.32s)]
*  We are going to deal with the nuclear program as best we can. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Me5KVM9lfc&t=239.79999999999998s)]
*  We still have a few surprises up our sleeve. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Me5KVM9lfc&t=243.86s)]
*  I think we've proven that over the past couple of days. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Me5KVM9lfc&t=246.62s)]
*  We're determined to get this done. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Me5KVM9lfc&t=249.82s)]
*  At this point, what we've requested from our ally, our greatest ally, the United States, [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Me5KVM9lfc&t=251.42000000000002s)]
*  is defensive posture. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Me5KVM9lfc&t=255.98s)]
*  They're helping protect our civilians through defensive missile systems. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Me5KVM9lfc&t=257.74s)]
*  And that's our ask at this point, whether or not they join in the battle to ensure a [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Me5KVM9lfc&t=263.5s)]
*  total dismantlement of Iran's nuclear program is a decision the administration will have [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Me5KVM9lfc&t=268.94s)]
*  to take. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Me5KVM9lfc&t=273.66s)]
*  Ambassador, we appreciate your time very much, sir. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Me5KVM9lfc&t=274.66s)]
*  Thank you for making that for us this morning. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Me5KVM9lfc&t=276.86s)]
*  Thank you, Shannon. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Me5KVM9lfc&t=280.22s)]
