# Senator backs Trump's call to jail American flag burners: 'I'm all for it'
**Fox News - World News:** [June 14, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rtq9vUb0R08)
*  We're back with a Fox News alert right now. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rtq9vUb0R08&t=0.0s)]
*  America's military bases in the Middle East are on alert as U.S. defense plays a crucial [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rtq9vUb0R08&t=9.36s)]
*  role intercepting Iran's deadly missiles, targeting our greatest ally in the Middle [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rtq9vUb0R08&t=13.94s)]
*  East, of course, Israel. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rtq9vUb0R08&t=18.64s)]
*  A U.S. Army veteran and GOP Senator Roger Marshall from the great state of Kansas joins [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rtq9vUb0R08&t=19.92s)]
*  us now. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rtq9vUb0R08&t=25.3s)]
*  Thank you for joining us. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rtq9vUb0R08&t=26.3s)]
*  First of all, thank you for your service. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rtq9vUb0R08&t=27.3s)]
*  Joey, it's great to be with you and a big happy birthday to the U.S. Army. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rtq9vUb0R08&t=28.94s)]
*  Happy birthday to President Trump as well. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rtq9vUb0R08&t=32.26s)]
*  Two hundred and fifty years ago today, George Washington, the Continental Army was formed [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rtq9vUb0R08&t=34.26s)]
*  and here we are today. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rtq9vUb0R08&t=39.66s)]
*  What a great country we live in. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rtq9vUb0R08&t=40.78s)]
*  You know, we're using words like anniversary and it's flag day. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rtq9vUb0R08&t=41.78s)]
*  It's a birthday. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rtq9vUb0R08&t=44.38s)]
*  It's a birthday for the Army, a birthday for President Trump, a birthday for our flag. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rtq9vUb0R08&t=45.38s)]
*  It's a great day. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rtq9vUb0R08&t=48.18s)]
*  But there are things going on in the world that are tough. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rtq9vUb0R08&t=49.74s)]
*  And so when you see this happening in Israel, you see that 50 were injured, three are dead. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rtq9vUb0R08&t=51.94s)]
*  And Iran says U.S. military bases are on their target list. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rtq9vUb0R08&t=56.6s)]
*  What's your reaction? [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rtq9vUb0R08&t=59.760000000000005s)]
*  Well, Joey, you said it, that Israel is our greatest ally in the Middle East. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rtq9vUb0R08&t=60.760000000000005s)]
*  We need to stand beside them at the same time. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rtq9vUb0R08&t=64.88s)]
*  I want all the listeners to understand that the Iranian regime is just a week away probably [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rtq9vUb0R08&t=67.48s)]
*  from having nuclear warheads. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rtq9vUb0R08&t=71.8s)]
*  President Trump gave them a 60-day warning on day 61. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rtq9vUb0R08&t=73.8s)]
*  Israel took things into their own hands. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rtq9vUb0R08&t=77.52000000000001s)]
*  We pray for peace. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rtq9vUb0R08&t=79.36s)]
*  We pray for the Iranian people as well. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rtq9vUb0R08&t=80.6s)]
*  But we cannot tolerate a terrorist group having a nuclear warhead. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rtq9vUb0R08&t=83.88000000000001s)]
*  You're a United States senator. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rtq9vUb0R08&t=86.68s)]
*  You get a say in things like this. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rtq9vUb0R08&t=87.92s)]
*  We have Lindsey Graham that everyone knows usually is for whatever the war move is. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rtq9vUb0R08&t=90.32000000000001s)]
*  We have others like maybe Rand Paul that generally is completely against it. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rtq9vUb0R08&t=94.48s)]
*  How do you decide what you believe the right move is? [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rtq9vUb0R08&t=98.88000000000001s)]
*  Well, being from Kansas, I'm a big Eisenhower fan. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rtq9vUb0R08&t=101.68s)]
*  And President Eisenhower said, I hate war. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rtq9vUb0R08&t=104.16s)]
*  It's only a soldier who's lived it can with all its brutality and futility. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rtq9vUb0R08&t=106.04s)]
*  Joey, you've lived what that war is like as well. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rtq9vUb0R08&t=110.0s)]
*  I think when you've served, you hate war more than anybody else. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rtq9vUb0R08&t=112.2s)]
*  I want to project peace through strength. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rtq9vUb0R08&t=115.0s)]
*  That was another President Eisenhower saying as well. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rtq9vUb0R08&t=116.72s)]
*  So let's project peace through strength. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rtq9vUb0R08&t=118.84s)]
*  Pray for peace every day. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rtq9vUb0R08&t=120.84s)]
*  And just so grateful for all the military people willing to fight for our freedoms to [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rtq9vUb0R08&t=122.6s)]
*  keep the peace, but make us safe as well. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rtq9vUb0R08&t=126.44s)]
*  And a big shout out to all those soldiers who are in harm's way right now in the Middle East. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rtq9vUb0R08&t=128.96s)]
*  You know, as we're going to celebrate today, as we said, anybody that loves this country [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rtq9vUb0R08&t=133.0s)]
*  is going to celebrate today. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rtq9vUb0R08&t=136.64s)]
*  But there are a lot of people that think today is a day for protests. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rtq9vUb0R08&t=137.44s)]
*  No, King's Day, National Day of Defiance. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rtq9vUb0R08&t=140.24s)]
*  They they just hate President Trump and they say that this entire parade is about him and [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rtq9vUb0R08&t=142.44s)]
*  his ego. What do you say to that? [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rtq9vUb0R08&t=146.4s)]
*  Well, certainly their obsession has become psychosis. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rtq9vUb0R08&t=147.88s)]
*  But I would just invite all those people to come and meet some of the people that I had [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rtq9vUb0R08&t=150.84s)]
*  to have privilege of giving a capital tour last night. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rtq9vUb0R08&t=154.56s)]
*  Soldiers from the Big Red One, the First Infantry Division. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rtq9vUb0R08&t=157.04000000000002s)]
*  This division alone has had 12000 people that have made the ultimate sacrifice. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rtq9vUb0R08&t=160.44s)]
*  Twelve thousand people from one division. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rtq9vUb0R08&t=165.20000000000002s)]
*  One point three million people from the army have made the ultimate sacrifice. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rtq9vUb0R08&t=169.51999999999998s)]
*  Another one and a half million people injured in war as well. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rtq9vUb0R08&t=173.92s)]
*  So just come and tell them thanks for that right to get out here and protest. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rtq9vUb0R08&t=176.64s)]
*  God bless all of them. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rtq9vUb0R08&t=179.95999999999998s)]
*  God bless President Trump. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rtq9vUb0R08&t=181.39999999999998s)]
*  Let's let's celebrate the army's birthday today. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rtq9vUb0R08&t=182.6s)]
*  I know it's the 250th birthday of the army. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rtq9vUb0R08&t=185.51999999999998s)]
*  President Trump says if you're out there protesting, that's fine. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rtq9vUb0R08&t=188.2s)]
*  But if you're burning flags, you should get a year in jail. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rtq9vUb0R08&t=190.64s)]
*  What do you think about that? [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rtq9vUb0R08&t=193.04s)]
*  I'm all for it. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rtq9vUb0R08&t=193.95999999999998s)]
*  You know, I just I unfortunately grew up during the Vietnam era. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rtq9vUb0R08&t=195.23999999999998s)]
*  That's when the flag burning started. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rtq9vUb0R08&t=198.6s)]
*  Again, my dad served, my brother served, someone from every generation, [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rtq9vUb0R08&t=200.28s)]
*  my family since the Civil War has served. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rtq9vUb0R08&t=203.32s)]
*  And to see them burn the flag is just a kick in the gut to all of us who served. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rtq9vUb0R08&t=206.0s)]
*  Listen, I know that as a soldier, you're proud today to celebrate the army as a Marine. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rtq9vUb0R08&t=210.12s)]
*  We're so proud on our birthday. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rtq9vUb0R08&t=214.68s)]
*  But today I'm pretty proud of the army, too. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rtq9vUb0R08&t=216.0s)]
*  Thank you for joining us. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rtq9vUb0R08&t=217.76s)]
*  And most importantly, thank you for your service. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rtq9vUb0R08&t=218.64000000000001s)]
*  I'm honored to be here, Joey. Thanks so much. Yes, sir. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rtq9vUb0R08&t=220.2s)]
