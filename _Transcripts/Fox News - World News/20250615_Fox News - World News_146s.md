# Trump hopes for a deal between Iran and Israel
**Fox News - World News:** [June 15, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PZ88ztOUlE)
*  We're actually going to go to President Trump who's speaking right now to the appointment. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PZ88ztOUlE&t=0.0s)]
*  The start was a tremendous success with a fantastic audience. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PZ88ztOUlE&t=4.0s)]
*  It was supposed to rain. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PZ88ztOUlE&t=8.0s)]
*  They gave it a 100 percent chance of rain, and it didn't rain at all. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PZ88ztOUlE&t=10.0s)]
*  It was beautiful. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PZ88ztOUlE&t=13.0s)]
*  And so I asked, if they gave it 100 percent chance, right? [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PZ88ztOUlE&t=15.0s)]
*  100 percent it was going to rain like crazy, and it didn't rain at all. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PZ88ztOUlE&t=19.0s)]
*  How do they predict 100 years out and 50 years out or 200 years out? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PZ88ztOUlE&t=24.0s)]
*  They didn't do too well, the weather people, last night, but it was beautiful. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PZ88ztOUlE&t=30.0s)]
*  Well, we get along very well, and I will tell you that I think we have great respect for each other. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PZ88ztOUlE&t=41.0s)]
*  Mr. President, can you give us a sense of what you're doing to try to de-escalate the situation between Iran and Israel? [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PZ88ztOUlE&t=48.0s)]
*  Well, I hope there's going to be a deal. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PZ88ztOUlE&t=60.0s)]
*  I think it's time for a deal, and we'll see what happens. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PZ88ztOUlE&t=62.0s)]
*  But sometimes they have to fight it out, but we're going to see what happens. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PZ88ztOUlE&t=65.0s)]
*  I think there's a good chance there'll be a deal. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PZ88ztOUlE&t=69.0s)]
*  What? [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PZ88ztOUlE&t=72.0s)]
*  So the protesters, if we didn't have the National Guard on call and ready, they would rip Los Angeles apart. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PZ88ztOUlE&t=77.0s)]
*  They come and they check and they say, is the National Guard going to be there? [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PZ88ztOUlE&t=91.0s)]
*  And if the National Guard is being there, they don't even show up. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PZ88ztOUlE&t=95.0s)]
*  Have you asked Israel to pause their airstrikes into Iran? [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PZ88ztOUlE&t=102.0s)]
*  Well, I don't want to say that. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PZ88ztOUlE&t=106.0s)]
*  Mr. President, do you expect to have some trade deals announced at the G7 summit coming up? [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PZ88ztOUlE&t=108.0s)]
*  Look, we have our trade deals. All we have to do is send a letter. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PZ88ztOUlE&t=114.0s)]
*  This is what you're going to have to pay. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PZ88ztOUlE&t=117.0s)]
*  But I think we'll have a few new trade deals. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PZ88ztOUlE&t=119.0s)]
*  Will the U.S. continue to support the defense of Israel? [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PZ88ztOUlE&t=122.0s)]
*  Will the U.S. continue to support Israel in its defense? [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PZ88ztOUlE&t=126.0s)]
*  Thank you. Thank you very much, everybody. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PZ88ztOUlE&t=130.0s)]
