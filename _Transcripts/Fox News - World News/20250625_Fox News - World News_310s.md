# Trump says Iran's nuclear program was set back decades
**Fox News - World News:** [June 25, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nm_-5J0rvo)
*  This is a Fox News alert. President Donald Trump and members of his cabinet are in The [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nm_-5J0rvo&t=0.0s)]
*  Hague. They're in the Netherlands this morning for the NATO summit, sitting down with world [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nm_-5J0rvo&t=4.5600000000000005s)]
*  leaders amid the global unrest. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nm_-5J0rvo&t=8.56s)]
*  This is live. Senior White House correspondent Jackie Heinrich is there following the president [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nm_-5J0rvo&t=11.08s)]
*  and joins us now with the latest. Jackie? [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nm_-5J0rvo&t=15.64s)]
*  We're told that's not live. He's going to be speaking in a little bit. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nm_-5J0rvo&t=17.240000000000002s)]
*  Oh, that wasn't? Okay. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nm_-5J0rvo&t=19.64s)]
*  We'll be hearing from him soon. We actually heard from him just a little while ago, guys, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nm_-5J0rvo&t=21.16s)]
*  and he had a lot to say about the U.S. strikes on Iran. He compared the bombs that were dropped [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nm_-5J0rvo&t=26.14s)]
*  to the bombs the U.S. dropped on Japan to end World War II, saying that both cases were [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nm_-5J0rvo&t=31.740000000000002s)]
*  bombs basically that ended wars. He said Iran's nuclear program has been set back, he believes, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nm_-5J0rvo&t=36.34s)]
*  by decades because he thinks that the Iranians are not going to try this whole thing again. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nm_-5J0rvo&t=42.74s)]
*  The last thing they want to do is enrich anything right now. They want to recover. And we won't [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nm_-5J0rvo&t=48.620000000000005s)]
*  let that happen. Number one, militarily, we won't. I think we'll end up having somewhat [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nm_-5J0rvo&t=53.26s)]
*  of a relationship with Iran. I see it. Look, I've had a relationship over the last four [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nm_-5J0rvo&t=58.18s)]
*  days. They agreed to the ceasefire. And it was a very equal agreement. They both said [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nm_-5J0rvo&t=62.46s)]
*  that's enough. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nm_-5J0rvo&t=67.22s)]
*  The president also countered that leaked preliminary low-confidence assessment, saying that he [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nm_-5J0rvo&t=68.66s)]
*  believes Iran never got a chance to remove the uranium ahead of the strikes because the [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nm_-5J0rvo&t=74.46s)]
*  fast. He also revealed Israel is releasing a report soon that will concur with his description [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nm_-5J0rvo&t=79.1s)]
*  of total obliteration of those facilities. Now the president's turning his focus to NATO [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nm_-5J0rvo&t=84.97999999999999s)]
*  after appearing to possibly be wavering on the U.S. commitment to mutual defense on his [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nm_-5J0rvo&t=89.3s)]
*  way here, which in that case he said there are, quote, numerous definitions of Article [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nm_-5J0rvo&t=94.3s)]
*  5. It spooked European officials, but they had a collective sigh of relief this morning [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nm_-5J0rvo&t=99.94s)]
*  at this answer. Listen here. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nm_-5J0rvo&t=104.94s)]
*  We're with them all the way. If you take a look at the numbers, we're with them. And [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nm_-5J0rvo&t=107.78s)]
*  they're very big things to announce today. I don't know if you've taken the vote or you're [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nm_-5J0rvo&t=112.02s)]
*  going to take the vote, but I've been asking them to go up to 5 percent for a number of [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nm_-5J0rvo&t=114.86s)]
*  years and they're going up to 5 percent. That's a big, from 2 percent. And a lot of people [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nm_-5J0rvo&t=119.62s)]
*  didn't even pay the 2 percent. So I think it's going to be very big news. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nm_-5J0rvo&t=126.1s)]
*  NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte has tried to stave off any chance that the president [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nm_-5J0rvo&t=131.1s)]
*  would back away from NATO as Russia's war on Ukraine has really exposed Europe's vulnerability, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nm_-5J0rvo&t=136.74s)]
*  including by texting the president this. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nm_-5J0rvo&t=142.02s)]
*  Donald, you've driven us to a really, really important moment for America and Europe and [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nm_-5J0rvo&t=144.54000000000002s)]
*  the world. You will achieve something no American president in decades could get done. Europe [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nm_-5J0rvo&t=148.46s)]
*  is going to pay in a big way, as they should, and it will be your win. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nm_-5J0rvo&t=153.02s)]
*  Although concerns about Russia really underpin all the conversations that are happening here, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nm_-5J0rvo&t=158.22s)]
*  we are not expecting a fiery joint statement that's like the ones in the past condemning [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nm_-5J0rvo&t=164.01999999999998s)]
*  Russian aggression, because folks here know that President Trump is really trying to get [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nm_-5J0rvo&t=169.7s)]
*  Russia and President Putin to the negotiating table in a real way to try to move this forward. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nm_-5J0rvo&t=174.34s)]
*  And more evidence of that this morning, you had Secretary of State Marco Rubio saying [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nm_-5J0rvo&t=181.34s)]
*  that we're not going to do everything as a country that everyone wants us to do, including [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nm_-5J0rvo&t=186.14s)]
*  ramp up those sanctions at this time that everyone is, especially Zelensky, has been [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nm_-5J0rvo&t=189.45999999999998s)]
*  calling for, because they're trying to just get these conversations going in the right [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nm_-5J0rvo&t=193.89999999999998s)]
*  place. The president will be meeting with Zelensky. We expect that he's going to make [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nm_-5J0rvo&t=197.89999999999998s)]
*  that request to impose those heavy sanctions, make that request to the president, guys. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nm_-5J0rvo&t=201.66s)]
*  Jackie, it appears that the tone just, you're there so you can give us a better outlook. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nm_-5J0rvo&t=207.45999999999998s)]
*  It seems different. It looks like it's a more collaborative appreciation of the president [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nm_-5J0rvo&t=212.66s)]
*  there right now. What can you tell us? [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nm_-5J0rvo&t=218.18s)]
*  Yeah, you just heard the secretary general really crediting the president for making [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nm_-5J0rvo&t=221.1s)]
*  NATO a stronger, fairer alliance. And that, those words are a long time coming, because [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nm_-5J0rvo&t=226.86s)]
*  in his first term, you remember the president complaining that NATO countries were not pulling [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nm_-5J0rvo&t=233.02s)]
*  their own weight, they were not meeting their, at that point, 2% obligation to spend 2% of [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nm_-5J0rvo&t=237.06s)]
*  their GDP on defense, and really expecting the U.S. to carry all of NATO in terms of [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nm_-5J0rvo&t=243.26s)]
*  its capacity for defense. But the war in Ukraine has exposed so much vulnerability that there's [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nm_-5J0rvo&t=249.82s)]
*  been a shift in attitude among all these countries, and there was an eagerness for these countries [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nm_-5J0rvo&t=255.78s)]
*  to ramp up their own defense production, to make sure they don't get into a space where [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nm_-5J0rvo&t=260.2s)]
*  they could run out of artillery, which was a real concern, and also plan for the future, [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nm_-5J0rvo&t=264.78s)]
*  and to make sure that the U.S. commitment to NATO doesn't fracture, because that capacity, [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nm_-5J0rvo&t=271.14s)]
*  as we just saw with the military might in Iran, is so critical to giving NATO the power [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nm_-5J0rvo&t=275.86s)]
*  that it has always had. They do not want to see the president or the United States back [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nm_-5J0rvo&t=281.78s)]
*  away from this alliance, and so they're doing everything they can to basically accommodate [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nm_-5J0rvo&t=286.3s)]
*  President Trump and show him that he has made a difference and that his presence and the [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nm_-5J0rvo&t=292.34s)]
*  U.S. presence matters. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nm_-5J0rvo&t=296.9s)]
*  Absolutely. Thanks so much, Jackson. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nm_-5J0rvo&t=298.09999999999997s)]
