# NEW: Iran missiles strike Israeli hospital, apartment building in overnight attack
**Fox News - World News:** [June 19, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdkOUXGH5P8)
*  Straight to a Fox News story, at least 85 people were hurt in the latest Iranian ballistic [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdkOUXGH5P8&t=0.0s)]
*  missile attack. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdkOUXGH5P8&t=6.1000000000000005s)]
*  This in Tel Aviv and beyond, including a direct hit on a hospital in southern Israel. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdkOUXGH5P8&t=7.4s)]
*  Young children are among the wounded in the attack. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdkOUXGH5P8&t=13.56s)]
*  And earlier, our foreign correspondent, Greg Palkot, capturing footage of Israeli air defenses [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdkOUXGH5P8&t=16.52s)]
*  trying to stop the incoming fire. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdkOUXGH5P8&t=22.96s)]
*  They're not taking a break. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdkOUXGH5P8&t=26.84s)]
*  We've been listening to the anti-missile defenses. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdkOUXGH5P8&t=28.16s)]
*  There's a couple right there. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdkOUXGH5P8&t=32.16s)]
*  It's a wake-up call for this country, for the city that this war between Iran and Israel [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdkOUXGH5P8&t=34.24s)]
*  is still on. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdkOUXGH5P8&t=39.84s)]
*  And Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is promising to quote exact the full price [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdkOUXGH5P8&t=41.519999999999996s)]
*  from the tyrants in Tehran. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdkOUXGH5P8&t=46.400000000000006s)]
*  Mike Tobin is live in Israel at the scene of one of those attacks. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdkOUXGH5P8&t=48.64s)]
*  Good morning, Mike. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdkOUXGH5P8&t=51.84s)]
*  Good morning, Greg. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdkOUXGH5P8&t=52.84s)]
*  Good morning, Greg. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdkOUXGH5P8&t=54.52s)]
*  Yeah, this is what's seen where one of the missiles got through the air defenses and [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdkOUXGH5P8&t=55.52s)]
*  struck in the middle of Ramat Gan. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdkOUXGH5P8&t=58.36000000000001s)]
*  That's a neighborhood here in Tel Aviv. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdkOUXGH5P8&t=61.2s)]
*  As I step out of the way, I can tell you it's kind of a modernized both residential and [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdkOUXGH5P8&t=62.92s)]
*  business area. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdkOUXGH5P8&t=67.28s)]
*  And what you're looking at now is pretty much the center of the impact. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdkOUXGH5P8&t=68.80000000000001s)]
*  I'm told by Magan David Adom EMT that one of the missiles did make a direct hit on a [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdkOUXGH5P8&t=72.12s)]
*  building here. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdkOUXGH5P8&t=78.44s)]
*  And what you're looking at is a lot of the damage from the shrapnel and the force of [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdkOUXGH5P8&t=79.52s)]
*  the blast as it went through this modernized neighborhood. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdkOUXGH5P8&t=84.39999999999999s)]
*  Remarkably, you talk about 35 people who were injured. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdkOUXGH5P8&t=88.19999999999999s)]
*  Those injuries are mostly minor. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdkOUXGH5P8&t=91.32s)]
*  We've got six serious injuries. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdkOUXGH5P8&t=92.67999999999999s)]
*  And it's quite dramatic the fact that there aren't more casualties because of these massive [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdkOUXGH5P8&t=95.0s)]
*  missiles that are crashing down. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdkOUXGH5P8&t=99.75999999999999s)]
*  And that's largely because Israelis are respecting the warnings and heading to the bomb shelters. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdkOUXGH5P8&t=101.24s)]
*  Now, there was also a missile that hit in the area of Tel Aviv in a town or neighborhood, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdkOUXGH5P8&t=106.2s)]
*  I should say, called Halon. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdkOUXGH5P8&t=109.92s)]
*  That is an older residential area. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdkOUXGH5P8&t=111.76s)]
*  And again, you have dramatically minimized casualties given the force of the impact of [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdkOUXGH5P8&t=114.44s)]
*  that missile that made it through the defenses. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdkOUXGH5P8&t=120.52s)]
*  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, as you mentioned, got to social media and he said [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdkOUXGH5P8&t=123.03999999999999s)]
*  that the tyrants in Iran, that Israel will exact the full price from the tyrants in Iran. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdkOUXGH5P8&t=127.4s)]
*  The Defense Minister, Yisrael Katz, made this statement that the attacks or the air campaign [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdkOUXGH5P8&t=133.12s)]
*  in Iran will only intensify. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdkOUXGH5P8&t=138.68s)]
*  I had a conversation with an IDF spokesman this morning, pressed him on what that means, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdkOUXGH5P8&t=140.72000000000003s)]
*  and he says Israel has been picking targets in Iran for decades. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdkOUXGH5P8&t=146.0s)]
*  Well, this is an ongoing operation and our goals are very clear, to remove these existential [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdkOUXGH5P8&t=150.20000000000002s)]
*  threats from the civilian of Israel. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdkOUXGH5P8&t=155.76000000000002s)]
*  And we're seeing, this is a preview, this morning we saw a preview of what could happen [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdkOUXGH5P8&t=157.4s)]
*  if we let Iran keep going this way. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdkOUXGH5P8&t=162.44s)]
*  And their goal was to have thousands and thousands of these ballistic missiles on Israeli civilians [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdkOUXGH5P8&t=164.8s)]
*  and on top of that, nuclear weapons. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdkOUXGH5P8&t=170.08s)]
*  Now to the south of here is the town of Beersheba. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdkOUXGH5P8&t=174.92000000000002s)]
*  In Beersheba is the Soroka Hospital. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdkOUXGH5P8&t=177.56s)]
*  That hospital took a direct hit from an Iranian missile overnight. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdkOUXGH5P8&t=179.96s)]
*  A few reasons that the casualties were minimized there. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdkOUXGH5P8&t=183.48s)]
*  The Soroka Hospital is within rocket range of the Gaza Strip. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdkOUXGH5P8&t=186.72s)]
*  That means for more than a decade now they have been fortifying and reinforcing that [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdkOUXGH5P8&t=191.1s)]
*  hospital to take rocket strikes that minimize the damage and also just by chance last night [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdkOUXGH5P8&t=194.94s)]
*  the decision was made to draw down the patients and staff in the old surgical building that [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdkOUXGH5P8&t=201.18s)]
*  was hit. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdkOUXGH5P8&t=206.74s)]
*  So again, casualties are minimal. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdkOUXGH5P8&t=207.78s)]
*  Israeli fighter jets were active in the skies over Iran overnight. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdkOUXGH5P8&t=209.82s)]
*  They hit a weapons production facility according to the IDF in the area of Natanz, also an [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdkOUXGH5P8&t=213.94s)]
*  old reactor that was inactive, a heavy water reactor in the town of Arrak, not to be confused [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdkOUXGH5P8&t=219.66s)]
*  with Iraq, the country, A-R-A-K. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdkOUXGH5P8&t=225.1s)]
*  Griff back to you. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdkOUXGH5P8&t=227.94s)]
*  Hey Mike, just real quick. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdkOUXGH5P8&t=228.94s)]
*  These are not considered dumb bombs. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdkOUXGH5P8&t=231.14s)]
*  They're not these ballistic missiles that just go in the vicinity. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdkOUXGH5P8&t=233.26s)]
*  They seem to have targets, which makes one believe they were targeting a hospital. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdkOUXGH5P8&t=236.46s)]
*  Well according to the Iranian news agencies, what they were targeting was an Israeli intelligence [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdkOUXGH5P8&t=244.78s)]
*  and military base that was very near the hospital. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdkOUXGH5P8&t=250.38s)]
*  But yeah, when you say missile, that means something you can aim. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdkOUXGH5P8&t=253.82000000000002s)]
*  A rocket is usually a flying pipe bomb. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdkOUXGH5P8&t=256.1s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdkOUXGH5P8&t=258.94s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdkOUXGH5P8&t=259.94s)]
