# Watters: Iranians missed the opportunity of a lifetime
**Fox News - World News:** [June 17, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gesp8dc01tU)
*  Donald Trump's ordering the Iranians to surrender unconditionally. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gesp8dc01tU&t=0.0s)]
*  Last night he warned everybody to flee the capital, and now Tehran's a ghost town. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gesp8dc01tU&t=5.04s)]
*  Surgical strikes target Iranian nuclear scientists, and military commanders have taken their toll. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gesp8dc01tU&t=10.040000000000001s)]
*  Windows have turned to powder, and the lobby of buildings are gone. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gesp8dc01tU&t=15.64s)]
*  Overnight Israel continued to pummel missile and drone infrastructure in the western part [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gesp8dc01tU&t=20.12s)]
*  of the country. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gesp8dc01tU&t=25.36s)]
*  Tel Aviv says they've destroyed over 120 Iranian missile launchers since Thursday. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gesp8dc01tU&t=26.6s)]
*  That's about 40 percent of their missile capacity. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gesp8dc01tU&t=32.56s)]
*  They also took out Iran's top general early this morning. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gesp8dc01tU&t=36.04s)]
*  He was only at the job for four days after his old boss was executed. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gesp8dc01tU&t=39.88s)]
*  Israel's already slaughtered 11 senior Iranian generals, but the regime is retaliating tonight [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gesp8dc01tU&t=45.6s)]
*  with a barrage of ballistic missile strikes against the Jewish state. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gesp8dc01tU&t=51.84s)]
*  Our very own Trey Yngst just had to duck for cover in Tel Aviv on the 5. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gesp8dc01tU&t=55.8s)]
*  Air defense systems are currently active over Tel Aviv with hundreds of thousands of people [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gesp8dc01tU&t=61.839999999999996s)]
*  into bomb shelters at this moment. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gesp8dc01tU&t=68.28s)]
*  Unhooked. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gesp8dc01tU&t=70.8s)]
*  Get off. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gesp8dc01tU&t=71.8s)]
*  All right, we got it. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gesp8dc01tU&t=72.8s)]
*  We're going to move. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gesp8dc01tU&t=73.8s)]
*  Okay. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gesp8dc01tU&t=74.8s)]
*  Stay with us. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gesp8dc01tU&t=75.8s)]
*  Stay with us. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gesp8dc01tU&t=76.8s)]
*  Stay with us. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gesp8dc01tU&t=77.8s)]
*  Keep moving. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gesp8dc01tU&t=78.8s)]
*  Keep moving. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gesp8dc01tU&t=79.8s)]
*  Keep moving. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gesp8dc01tU&t=80.8s)]
*  Keep moving. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gesp8dc01tU&t=81.8s)]
*  The IDF says 80 to 90 percent of Iran's missiles are being intercepted by the Iron Dome and [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gesp8dc01tU&t=83.48s)]
*  by U.S. missile defense systems in the region. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gesp8dc01tU&t=88.64s)]
*  And they have something up their sleeve. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gesp8dc01tU&t=91.72s)]
*  Israel says the beeper operation will seem simple compared to what it has in store next. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gesp8dc01tU&t=94.12s)]
*  The Israeli ambassador is promising a number of surprises when the dust settles within [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gesp8dc01tU&t=100.0s)]
*  the next 24 hours. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gesp8dc01tU&t=105.0s)]
*  Netanyahu still isn't ruling out an assassination strike against the Ayatollah. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gesp8dc01tU&t=106.92s)]
*  It's not going to escalate the conflict. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gesp8dc01tU&t=113.2s)]
*  It's going to end the conflict. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gesp8dc01tU&t=114.68s)]
*  We've had half a century of conflict spread by this regime that terrorizes everyone in [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gesp8dc01tU&t=115.68s)]
*  the Middle East, has bombed the Aramco oil fields in Saudi Arabia, is spreading terrorism [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gesp8dc01tU&t=121.48s)]
*  and subversion and sabotage everywhere. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gesp8dc01tU&t=126.52s)]
*  The forever war is what Iran wants. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gesp8dc01tU&t=129.68s)]
*  And they're bringing us to the brink of nuclear war. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gesp8dc01tU&t=132.12s)]
*  Netanyahu says killing the Iranian leader will be the end of the conflict, but it could [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gesp8dc01tU&t=135.04s)]
*  also be the beginning of the conflict because the next Ayatollah could be even nastier. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gesp8dc01tU&t=139.2s)]
*  The White House is thinking right now is it's the Ayatollah you know versus the Ayatollah [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gesp8dc01tU&t=144.79999999999998s)]
*  you don't know. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gesp8dc01tU&t=150.32s)]
*  That's not to say Trump couldn't decide to swoop in and do some gigantic action. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gesp8dc01tU&t=151.95999999999998s)]
*  Trump already rejected Israel's original plan for regime change, but he wants Khomeini to [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gesp8dc01tU&t=157.39999999999998s)]
*  know that he's the one keeping them alive. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gesp8dc01tU&t=162.92s)]
*  Quote, we know exactly where the so-called supreme leader's hiding. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gesp8dc01tU&t=166.44s)]
*  He is an easy target, but is safe there. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gesp8dc01tU&t=171.35999999999999s)]
*  We are not going to take him out, kill, at least not for now. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gesp8dc01tU&t=174.28s)]
*  But we don't want missiles shot at civilians or American soldiers. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gesp8dc01tU&t=178.24s)]
*  Our patience is wearing thin. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gesp8dc01tU&t=182.02s)]
*  Trump says the Iranians missed the opportunity of a lifetime. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gesp8dc01tU&t=184.4s)]
*  I told them to do the deal. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gesp8dc01tU&t=188.92s)]
*  They should have done the deal. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gesp8dc01tU&t=190.07999999999998s)]
*  The cities have been blown to pieces. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gesp8dc01tU&t=191.88s)]
*  We've lost a lot of people. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gesp8dc01tU&t=193.88s)]
*  They should have done the deal. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gesp8dc01tU&t=196.12s)]
*  I told them do the deal. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gesp8dc01tU&t=197.12s)]
*  Trump always wanted a deal, but Netanyahu, after October 7th, had decided he was going [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gesp8dc01tU&t=199.12s)]
*  to strike Iran anyway, with or without the United States, regardless of whether we were [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gesp8dc01tU&t=204.16s)]
*  negotiating. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gesp8dc01tU&t=209.24s)]
*  Netanyahu even asked Trump for the bunker busters, but Trump said no and was focused [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gesp8dc01tU&t=210.68s)]
*  on signing a deal, but began to feel the Iranians were stringing us along. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gesp8dc01tU&t=216.16s)]
*  And after they missed their deadline and the clock ran out, he let Israel go hard, the [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gesp8dc01tU&t=221.2s)]
*  very next day. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gesp8dc01tU&t=225.52s)]
*  And now Trump has a big decision to make. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gesp8dc01tU&t=227.32000000000002s)]
*  The U.S. and Israel control the airspace over Iran. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gesp8dc01tU&t=230.36s)]
*  Their proxies have been gutted. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gesp8dc01tU&t=233.8s)]
*  Our sanctions are strangling the country, and Israel is conducting sabotage and espionage [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gesp8dc01tU&t=235.62s)]
*  activity inside of their borders. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gesp8dc01tU&t=240.70000000000002s)]
*  The U.S. naval assets have surged into the region, encircling the regime in the Arabian [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gesp8dc01tU&t=243.22s)]
*  Sea, the Gulf, and in the Mediterranean. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gesp8dc01tU&t=248.36s)]
*  Sources say B-52s are stationed in the Indian Ocean within striking distance of Iran. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gesp8dc01tU&t=251.6s)]
*  And Trump says this country cannot have a nuclear weapon. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gesp8dc01tU&t=258.36s)]
*  Trump's orchestrating a massive pressure campaign to ensure the Iranians never get [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gesp8dc01tU&t=281.6s)]
*  a nuke. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gesp8dc01tU&t=295.16s)]
*  Politico says it's the most consequential decision of his presidency. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gesp8dc01tU&t=296.16s)]
*  The Trump administration doesn't want to barrel into risky missions or regime changes, but [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gesp8dc01tU&t=300.64000000000004s)]
*  they recognize there's a historic window of opportunity to solve a problem that's vexed [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gesp8dc01tU&t=305.64000000000004s)]
*  U.S. presidents for decades. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gesp8dc01tU&t=311.36s)]
*  How to fully eliminate the Iranian nuclear program. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gesp8dc01tU&t=313.52000000000004s)]
*  Does the president authorize American pilots to fly B-2 bombers over Iran and drop a series [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gesp8dc01tU&t=317.48s)]
*  of bunker busters on Fordow, the underground Iranian nuclear facility? [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gesp8dc01tU&t=323.56s)]
*  Or does he let the Israeli air campaign put Khomeini under so much pressure that he crawls [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gesp8dc01tU&t=328.8s)]
*  back to the negotiating table and signs away his nuke program peacefully? [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gesp8dc01tU&t=334.36s)]
*  Trump met with his national security team earlier today and is carefully deliberating. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gesp8dc01tU&t=339.82s)]
*  The president just finished a call with Netanyahu this afternoon and is keeping all options [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gesp8dc01tU&t=344.74s)]
*  on the table. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gesp8dc01tU&t=349.7s)]
*  He's considering dispatching JD Vance and negotiator Steve Witkoff to the region while [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gesp8dc01tU&t=351.06s)]
*  also getting assets in place if he decides to strike. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gesp8dc01tU&t=356.65999999999997s)]
*  Israel can't eliminate the Iranian nuclear threat by themselves. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gesp8dc01tU&t=360.86s)]
*  They have their own bunker busters, but none of them are powerful enough to pierce 300 [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gesp8dc01tU&t=364.9s)]
*  feet deep underground. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gesp8dc01tU&t=369.56s)]
*  There's only one bomb for the job, and we have it. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gesp8dc01tU&t=371.24s)]
*  The MOP, the Massive Ordnance Penetrator, weighs 30,000 pounds. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gesp8dc01tU&t=375.24s)]
*  It's so heavy that it can only be lifted by an American B-2 bomber, and once it drops, [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gesp8dc01tU&t=380.8s)]
*  it explodes horizontally and vertically. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gesp8dc01tU&t=386.32s)]
*  We've been working on it for 20 years. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gesp8dc01tU&t=389.28s)]
*  Trump tested one during his first term, and it's fully operational. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gesp8dc01tU&t=391.4s)]
*  We've used variations of bunker busters in the past, in the Iraq War, to destroy deep [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gesp8dc01tU&t=395.67999999999995s)]
*  Iraqi command centers, and then in the Afghanistan War to target al-Qaeda caves. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gesp8dc01tU&t=400.4s)]
*  They look like this. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gesp8dc01tU&t=406.03999999999996s)]
*  Using bunker busters against Iran's nuke sites doesn't come without a risk. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gesp8dc01tU&t=407.12s)]
*  The Iranians have stated that if the United States does take offensive action against [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gesp8dc01tU&t=423.88s)]
*  them, they'll target U.S. bases and the U.S. Navy in the region. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gesp8dc01tU&t=428.08s)]
*  If we decimate their nuke site, we'll take away their only leverage, and they could lash [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gesp8dc01tU&t=432.92s)]
*  out unpredictably. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gesp8dc01tU&t=438.36s)]
*  A dirty bomb, suicide bombers, assassination attempts. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gesp8dc01tU&t=439.36s)]
*  Who knows? [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gesp8dc01tU&t=443.88s)]
*  We'd have to deal with the consequences. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gesp8dc01tU&t=444.88s)]
*  The United States targeting Iran's nuclear facilities doesn't necessarily lead to regime [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gesp8dc01tU&t=447.40000000000003s)]
*  change. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gesp8dc01tU&t=451.44s)]
*  It could domino into regime change, but it doesn't necessarily guarantee it. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gesp8dc01tU&t=452.6s)]
*  The commander-in-chief has campaigned against regime change and expensive quagmire, but [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gesp8dc01tU&t=457.84s)]
*  in the first term he wasn't shy about taking decisive action to eliminate threats when [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gesp8dc01tU&t=463.28s)]
*  opportunities presented themselves, striking Soleimani, al-Baghdadi, and bombing ISIS off [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gesp8dc01tU&t=467.76s)]
*  the map. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gesp8dc01tU&t=473.32s)]
*  No one in the administration is considering putting boots on the ground. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gesp8dc01tU&t=474.7s)]
*  That's what we think. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gesp8dc01tU&t=478.0s)]
*  But bunker busters against Iranian nuke sites would be a bold and dramatic escalation. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gesp8dc01tU&t=480.17999999999995s)]
*  JD Vance says whatever he decides, Trump will make the right call. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gesp8dc01tU&t=486.56s)]
