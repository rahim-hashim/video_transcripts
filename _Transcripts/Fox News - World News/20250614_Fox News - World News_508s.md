# MOMENTS AGO: Iran fires fifth wave of missiles into Israel
**Fox News - World News:** [June 14, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHF3Hm2IvYw)
*  Iran began firing more missiles into Israel moments ago. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHF3Hm2IvYw&t=0.0s)]
*  Chief Foreign Correspondent Trey Yengst is live from Tel Aviv with more on that. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHF3Hm2IvYw&t=4.4s)]
*  Trey. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHF3Hm2IvYw&t=8.96s)]
*  Yeah, John, we have some video captured by our cameraman, Yaniv Terjiman. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHF3Hm2IvYw&t=9.96s)]
*  Off in the skyline, we could see these incoming ballistic missiles. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHF3Hm2IvYw&t=16.14s)]
*  They appeared as if they were headed toward the port city of Haifa in northern Israel. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHF3Hm2IvYw&t=20.0s)]
*  The entirety of the country has gotten an alert to head into bomb shelters. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHF3Hm2IvYw&t=25.3s)]
*  This is still an ongoing event, but you can see this video here just captured by Fox News [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHF3Hm2IvYw&t=29.22s)]
*  as these missiles were streaming through the skies of Israel. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHF3Hm2IvYw&t=35.26s)]
*  We do know some of them were intercepted. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHF3Hm2IvYw&t=39.8s)]
*  We could hear some distant booms as some of the advanced missile defense systems were [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHF3Hm2IvYw&t=41.9s)]
*  engaging these incoming ballistic missiles. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHF3Hm2IvYw&t=45.94s)]
*  But this is an indication that the Iranians have now launched a fifth wave over the past [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHF3Hm2IvYw&t=49.019999999999996s)]
*  24 hours targeting different parts of Israel. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHF3Hm2IvYw&t=54.620000000000005s)]
*  We don't know yet how many of these missiles actually landed and hit targets, but we can [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHF3Hm2IvYw&t=59.14s)]
*  tell you this is a significant attack for all of them to come at one time. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHF3Hm2IvYw&t=64.78s)]
*  Certainly, we could see from our vantage point more than 15 of them all flying through the [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHF3Hm2IvYw&t=69.5s)]
*  skies of Tel Aviv. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHF3Hm2IvYw&t=75.18s)]
*  And again, this was in the distance because if you go along the coast from Tel Aviv north [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHF3Hm2IvYw&t=77.06s)]
*  along the Mediterranean, you'll get to the port city of Haifa. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHF3Hm2IvYw&t=81.7s)]
*  And it does appear that was the city that was targeted. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHF3Hm2IvYw&t=84.9s)]
*  You saw earlier today those images from the aftermath of a ballistic missile strike in [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHF3Hm2IvYw&t=87.86s)]
*  central Israel, completely destroying an entire block in a neighborhood, killing two people [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHF3Hm2IvYw&t=92.16s)]
*  and injuring dozens of others. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHF3Hm2IvYw&t=97.53999999999999s)]
*  These are very significant and powerful missiles that the Iranians are using and reports right [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHF3Hm2IvYw&t=100.38s)]
*  now indicate that the Israelis are striking a variety of different targets in Iran. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHF3Hm2IvYw&t=105.53999999999999s)]
*  I'm just reading from my phone here, John, because there are some initial reports coming [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHF3Hm2IvYw&t=116.06s)]
*  in from Haifa of at least one impact. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHF3Hm2IvYw&t=119.66s)]
*  And again, we have this video showing you what it was like as these missiles were soaring [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHF3Hm2IvYw&t=122.86s)]
*  through the skies of Israel. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHF3Hm2IvYw&t=127.14s)]
*  And again, the initial reports at least one impact. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHF3Hm2IvYw&t=129.22s)]
*  But when you watch this video, it appears there could be even more than that. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHF3Hm2IvYw&t=131.7s)]
*  We will in the minutes and hours ahead get more information from local authorities and, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHF3Hm2IvYw&t=134.86s)]
*  of course, from the IDF to understand just how extensive this recent barrage was. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHF3Hm2IvYw&t=139.7s)]
*  But what we can report at this hour, Iran has launched a fifth wave of ballistic missiles [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHF3Hm2IvYw&t=144.3s)]
*  against Israel targeting the northern port city of Haifa. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHF3Hm2IvYw&t=148.94s)]
*  John. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHF3Hm2IvYw&t=152.46s)]
*  It is described as like trying to hit a bullet with a bullet when you intercept one of these [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHF3Hm2IvYw&t=153.46s)]
*  ballistic missiles, Trey. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHF3Hm2IvYw&t=159.10000000000002s)]
*  So, although Israel has done amazing things with its Iron Dome and David's sling systems, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHF3Hm2IvYw&t=161.42000000000002s)]
*  other anti-ballistic missile systems, you know, low-flying and high-flying, some will [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHF3Hm2IvYw&t=168.98000000000002s)]
*  get through, apparently. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHF3Hm2IvYw&t=174.86s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHF3Hm2IvYw&t=177.38000000000002s)]
*  And Israeli officials tell us the Americans are indeed helping to shoot down these incoming [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHF3Hm2IvYw&t=179.3s)]
*  missiles. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHF3Hm2IvYw&t=184.10000000000002s)]
*  They're likely using the Patriot system or even the THAAD system to do so. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHF3Hm2IvYw&t=185.10000000000002s)]
*  It's very expensive to shoot down these missiles, and it does take time to prepare the air defenses. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHF3Hm2IvYw&t=188.70000000000002s)]
*  And so this is something both the Americans and the Israelis are working on daily trying [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHF3Hm2IvYw&t=193.9s)]
*  to ensure that they are prepared for more barrages of ballistic missiles. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHF3Hm2IvYw&t=198.22s)]
*  And one senior Israeli intelligence source that I spoke with earlier today said, look, [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHF3Hm2IvYw&t=202.62s)]
*  they want this conflict to be over in a matter of days, and they believe they can succeed [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHF3Hm2IvYw&t=207.1s)]
*  in that objective. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHF3Hm2IvYw&t=212.18s)]
*  But this official warned it will be a very difficult week for the Israeli people, telling [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHF3Hm2IvYw&t=213.78s)]
*  civilians to brace for the reality that there will be more damage and more casualties here [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHF3Hm2IvYw&t=218.34s)]
*  in Israel, given the fact that the Iranians have one of the most advanced missile programs [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHF3Hm2IvYw&t=224.06s)]
*  in the Middle East. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHF3Hm2IvYw&t=228.58s)]
*  We know they have supplied the Russians with missiles that are being used in Ukraine. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHF3Hm2IvYw&t=229.58s)]
*  We have seen the destruction these missiles have caused to major population centers here [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHF3Hm2IvYw&t=233.3s)]
*  in Israel, and they are targeting a variety of different things here, making it very challenging [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHF3Hm2IvYw&t=237.66000000000003s)]
*  for the Israelis to decide where to put their air defense systems, when to activate them, [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHF3Hm2IvYw&t=242.26000000000002s)]
*  and how to shoot down this amount of fire that's currently happening. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHF3Hm2IvYw&t=247.3s)]
*  John? [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHF3Hm2IvYw&t=250.86s)]
*  I'm sorry, Prime Minister Netanyahu suggested that there will be more attacks on Iran, that [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHF3Hm2IvYw&t=251.94000000000003s)]
*  they have many more targets available to them, and that they intend to decapitate Iran's [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHF3Hm2IvYw&t=258.7s)]
*  nuclear program. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHF3Hm2IvYw&t=265.62s)]
*  So as these missiles are flying at Israel, there could easily be Israeli attacks on Iran [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHF3Hm2IvYw&t=267.26s)]
*  going on right now as well, right? [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHF3Hm2IvYw&t=273.7s)]
*  Absolutely, and I don't want to speculate much on why Haifa is the current target for [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHF3Hm2IvYw&t=277.09999999999997s)]
*  the Iranians, but we should look at something that happened earlier today. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHF3Hm2IvYw&t=282.38s)]
*  An Israeli official speaking to Fox News said that the Israelis targeted a gas field belonging [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHF3Hm2IvYw&t=285.65999999999997s)]
*  to the Iranians in the southern part of the country, near Tuvan Dara Bas. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHF3Hm2IvYw&t=291.38s)]
*  This is very close to the Strait of Hormuz. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHF3Hm2IvYw&t=296.65999999999997s)]
*  And it was an indication that the Israelis were looking to send a message to the Iranian [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHF3Hm2IvYw&t=299.82s)]
*  regime that they will now start to go after energy infrastructure targets, something that [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHF3Hm2IvYw&t=303.7s)]
*  the Iranians previously said would raise everything up a step on the escalation ladder, because [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHF3Hm2IvYw&t=307.86s)]
*  we do have to keep all of this in mind despite the war that has erupted. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHF3Hm2IvYw&t=313.66s)]
*  And this is a war. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHF3Hm2IvYw&t=319.3s)]
*  People here are calling it a conflict, an exchange of fire. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHF3Hm2IvYw&t=320.3s)]
*  It is a war between the two countries. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHF3Hm2IvYw&t=322.98s)]
*  They are exchanging fire. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHF3Hm2IvYw&t=324.62s)]
*  They are killing people. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHF3Hm2IvYw&t=325.62s)]
*  But amid this war, there are certain red lines that each side has. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHF3Hm2IvYw&t=327.26s)]
*  And the Iranian energy infrastructure is one of them. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHF3Hm2IvYw&t=332.12s)]
*  And so as we look forward, we can expect both the Israelis and the Iranians to adjust what [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHF3Hm2IvYw&t=334.36s)]
*  they're trying to hit. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHF3Hm2IvYw&t=339.6s)]
*  And we heard earlier today from President Trump saying that he wants to see all of this [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHF3Hm2IvYw&t=341.40000000000003s)]
*  conflict end. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHF3Hm2IvYw&t=345.52000000000004s)]
*  And so the question is, will the Israelis and the Americans be able to say enough or [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHF3Hm2IvYw&t=347.08000000000004s)]
*  do enough to get the Iranians back to the negotiating table? [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHF3Hm2IvYw&t=351.32000000000005s)]
*  At this point, that seems far-fetched, but this can't go on forever. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHF3Hm2IvYw&t=354.82000000000005s)]
*  And that is the big question that ultimately will come after this round of violence slows [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHF3Hm2IvYw&t=358.78000000000003s)]
*  down and the missile fire that we have seen toward this country slows down. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHF3Hm2IvYw&t=363.1s)]
*  People will start to discuss what comes next. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHF3Hm2IvYw&t=368.74s)]
*  And there is a question of if there will be room for diplomacy or if this will just relentlessly [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHF3Hm2IvYw&t=370.72s)]
*  continue. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHF3Hm2IvYw&t=375.46000000000004s)]
*  There are certainly many here who say the Israelis will continue to go after both Iran's [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHF3Hm2IvYw&t=377.02s)]
*  nuclear program and also a variety of senior officials there to ensure that they meet their [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHF3Hm2IvYw&t=381.3s)]
*  objectives. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHF3Hm2IvYw&t=387.14s)]
*  An Israeli source telling Fox News today there are three objectives, to weaken Iran's nuclear [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHF3Hm2IvYw&t=388.21999999999997s)]
*  program, to take out the country's ballistic missile program, and to stop what this source [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHF3Hm2IvYw&t=392.14s)]
*  calls an existential threat to Israel's safety and security. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHF3Hm2IvYw&t=396.53999999999996s)]
*  And this source says if they're able to do that, they would end this round of conflict [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHF3Hm2IvYw&t=401.9s)]
*  with Iran. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHF3Hm2IvYw&t=406.65999999999997s)]
*  John. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHF3Hm2IvYw&t=407.65999999999997s)]
*  It shouldn't be lost on our viewers that President Trump said that Iran had 60 days to come to [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHF3Hm2IvYw&t=408.65999999999997s)]
*  the table, make serious concessions, and maybe get rid of or at least significantly curtail [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHF3Hm2IvYw&t=415.26s)]
*  its nuclear program. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHF3Hm2IvYw&t=423.62s)]
*  And these attacks by Israel came on day 61. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHF3Hm2IvYw&t=425.42s)]
*  I have that right, don't I, Trey? [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHF3Hm2IvYw&t=429.53999999999996s)]
*  John, you're exactly right. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHF3Hm2IvYw&t=432.5s)]
*  And these strikes that the Israelis launched against Iran came just days before six rounds [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHF3Hm2IvYw&t=435.18s)]
*  of nuclear talks were set to take place in Oman. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHF3Hm2IvYw&t=440.76s)]
*  You know, President Trump's Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, was channeling those messages [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHF3Hm2IvYw&t=445.0s)]
*  back and forth trying to get an agreement. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHF3Hm2IvYw&t=449.2s)]
*  President Trump has said from the very beginning that he actually sees a prosperous future [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHF3Hm2IvYw&t=451.4s)]
*  for Iran, real opportunity for the Iranian people, but that they have to make a deal. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHF3Hm2IvYw&t=455.56s)]
*  And he laid out that 60-day timeframe, and just after that timeframe is when these Israeli [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHF3Hm2IvYw&t=460.02s)]
*  strikes started. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHF3Hm2IvYw&t=465.21999999999997s)]
*  And so, again, we hear from American officials, we still hear from President Trump about this [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHF3Hm2IvYw&t=466.91999999999996s)]
*  conflict and about the possibility of diplomacy prevailing. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHF3Hm2IvYw&t=471.36s)]
*  And he's made clear he still wants a deal. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHF3Hm2IvYw&t=475.40000000000003s)]
*  And the question is how far Iran is willing to go, how many senior officials they're willing [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHF3Hm2IvYw&t=477.64s)]
