# This is Iran's ULTIMATE objective: Tom Cotton
**Fox News - World News:** [June 16, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-CK-0Za8T0)
*  Welcome back America. We're here with Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas on the Senate Intelligence [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-CK-0Za8T0&t=0.0s)]
*  Committee. The Senate Armed Forces Committee knows something about combat. He's been in [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-CK-0Za8T0&t=8.58s)]
*  combat, including in this region that we're talking about right now. Senator Cotton, I [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-CK-0Za8T0&t=12.44s)]
*  am a little confused. We have nuclear negotiations that we're still pushing for. Don't they [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-CK-0Za8T0&t=17.76s)]
*  have now like ballistic missiles and they can keep building ballistic missiles and rain [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-CK-0Za8T0&t=22.92s)]
*  terror down on Israel? And are the communist Chinese going to stop selling fuel to them [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-CK-0Za8T0&t=26.88s)]
*  for ballistic missiles? And will the Russians stop building ground-to-air missile systems? [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-CK-0Za8T0&t=32.48s)]
*  I mean, what exactly would a deal look like at this point? [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-CK-0Za8T0&t=37.2s)]
*  Mark, good evening. It's hard to know what a deal would look like at this point because [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-CK-0Za8T0&t=40.0s)]
*  the Supreme Leader of Iran, Ayatollah Khamenei, keeps saying he wants no deal. He was saying [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-CK-0Za8T0&t=44.56s)]
*  that before Israel began these preemptive strikes on Thursday night. He continues to [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-CK-0Za8T0&t=48.879999999999995s)]
*  say it, even though President Trump continues to try to offer him an off-ramp to give up [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-CK-0Za8T0&t=53.92s)]
*  their enrichment capabilities. But the point you make about ballistic missiles, Mark, is [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-CK-0Za8T0&t=58.64s)]
*  very important. That's one reason why Iran is not just a threat to Israel or our other [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-CK-0Za8T0&t=62.800000000000004s)]
*  friends in the region or our troops there. Those missiles now can hit our troops. They [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-CK-0Za8T0&t=67.36s)]
*  can hit Israel. But within a very short time, maybe a couple of years, they could hit the [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-CK-0Za8T0&t=71.04s)]
*  United States as well. That's Iran's ultimate objective. That's why they still call us the [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-CK-0Za8T0&t=74.96000000000001s)]
*  great Satan. That's why they still chant death to America, why they've terrorized America [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-CK-0Za8T0&t=79.92s)]
*  for 46 years since the Iranian Revolution. And that's one of the reasons why President [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-CK-0Za8T0&t=84.48s)]
*  Trump gave them a 60-day window, an ultimatum. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-CK-0Za8T0&t=89.44s)]
*  And on the 61st day, what happened? Israel began these strikes because every month, Iran [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-CK-0Za8T0&t=92.56s)]
*  has been adding many more missiles to its stockpile that it can use to target innocent [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-CK-0Za8T0&t=97.68s)]
*  civilians in Israel or to target our troops. They don't have to have a nuclear weapon yet [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-CK-0Za8T0&t=102.64s)]
*  to have enough of those missiles to essentially put them in a zone of immunity, as it's sometimes [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-CK-0Za8T0&t=107.92s)]
*  called, from any such strikes. And that's one reason why Prime Minister Netanyahu thought [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-CK-0Za8T0&t=113.04s)]
*  he had to go now and why President Trump is backing Israel to the hilt. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-CK-0Za8T0&t=118.08s)]
*  Let me ask you a question, Senator. We've heard a lot of arguments that this, it's not a [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-CK-0Za8T0&t=122.32000000000001s)]
*  battle, I would argue, it's a war, that this war has the potential of expanding to other [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-CK-0Za8T0&t=129.12s)]
*  countries like Arab countries. Can you think of a single Arab country with a significant military [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-CK-0Za8T0&t=134.32s)]
*  that would say, you know what, I'm going to jump into the middle of this because I believe [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-CK-0Za8T0&t=139.44s)]
*  Iran should have nuclear weapons. Which Arab country would that be? [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-CK-0Za8T0&t=142.07999999999998s)]
*  It's hard to identify one, Mark. It's also, although a concern you have to have in mind, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-CK-0Za8T0&t=146.4s)]
*  a concern best addressed through being strong and deterring the Iranian terror regime. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-CK-0Za8T0&t=152.32s)]
*  President Trump did that overnight last night when he posted that if America is hit in any way, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-CK-0Za8T0&t=158.16s)]
*  our troops, our citizens, our ships or what have you, then they will feel the full force and strength [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-CK-0Za8T0&t=163.28s)]
*  of the U.S. military in a way no one has ever seen. That's a clear message to the Ayatollahs [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-CK-0Za8T0&t=168.64000000000001s)]
*  that I want to reiterate that they should not target a single American anywhere in the world [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-CK-0Za8T0&t=173.44s)]
*  because of these strikes. It's also a reminder that we have to be strong on all fronts against [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-CK-0Za8T0&t=179.52s)]
*  our adversaries. And you know, some of the same people that say this is going to draw us into a [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-CK-0Za8T0&t=186.64s)]
*  regional conflict or even exclaim excitably that though this is the start of World War III, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-CK-0Za8T0&t=190.96s)]
*  we're saying that it was the start of World War III five years ago when Donald Trump ordered the [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-CK-0Za8T0&t=197.12s)]
*  strike on Qasem Soleimani, Iran's terrorist mastermind. And as we saw then, and as we've [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-CK-0Za8T0&t=201.28s)]
*  seen throughout history, being strong and being resolute doesn't create or doesn't spark a war. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-CK-0Za8T0&t=206.64000000000001s)]
*  It usually prevents a war. Well, let me pursue this. Did we start World War I? [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-CK-0Za8T0&t=214.08s)]
*  No, Mark, we did not. Did we start World War II? [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-CK-0Za8T0&t=221.20000000000002s)]
*  No, we did not, Mark. So evil people and evil countries started World War I and World War II [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-CK-0Za8T0&t=225.28s)]
*  because free countries, democracies didn't stand up to them early on. Is that not the case? [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-CK-0Za8T0&t=231.04000000000002s)]
*  I think that's a very, very point to make, Mark. Although Germany was the aggressor, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-CK-0Za8T0&t=238.08s)]
*  also Russia in the case of World War II, they were tempted to start those wars by the weakness and [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-CK-0Za8T0&t=242.64000000000001s)]
*  irresolution of the Western powers. That's the opposite of what Donald Trump is. Donald Trump is [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-CK-0Za8T0&t=249.52s)]
*  strong and resolute. We saw that in his first term. We've seen it over these first five months [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-CK-0Za8T0&t=254.8s)]
*  in his second term. That, again, is the best way to prevent a war from happening, is to be strong [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-CK-0Za8T0&t=259.2s)]
*  and resolute. It's called peace through strength. It's what Ronald Reagan did for eight years. It's [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-CK-0Za8T0&t=264.8s)]
*  what Donald Trump has done in the White House as well. When we come back, Senator, I want to play [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-CK-0Za8T0&t=268.72s)]
*  a little game with you. Let's say Bibi Netanyahu was not the prime minister of Israel. Let's say [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-CK-0Za8T0&t=273.6s)]
*  Donald Trump was not the president of the United States. And peace was defined as, [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-CK-0Za8T0&t=279.68s)]
*  let's leave Iran alone. Let's leave Iran alone. What would this place look like [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-CK-0Za8T0&t=284.96000000000004s)]
*  now, in a year from now, in five years from now, if action, military action, wasn't being taken [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-CK-0Za8T0&t=292.0s)]
*  today, right now, by the Israelis, under their great leader and the support of our great leader, [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-CK-0Za8T0&t=299.2s)]
*  Donald Trump? What would it look like right now in the Middle East? We'll be right back. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-CK-0Za8T0&t=306.56s)]
