# Israel's targeting of Iran will continue for days: Source
**Fox News - World News:** [June 12, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Is1orqeAQsM)
*  Israeli military officials, they are reporting that Iran had enough fusion material to make [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Is1orqeAQsM&t=0.0s)]
*  15 nuclear weapons within days. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Is1orqeAQsM&t=4.12s)]
*  Anyway, joining us now from the Pentagon, our own Jennifer Griffin. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Is1orqeAQsM&t=6.6000000000000005s)]
*  Jennifer, what are you hearing there? [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Is1orqeAQsM&t=9.96s)]
*  Well, Sean, it's very clear that the U.S. military would like to distance itself from [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Is1orqeAQsM&t=11.64s)]
*  these strikes inside Iran. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Is1orqeAQsM&t=17.2s)]
*  We've heard from U.S. defense officials that the U.S. military was not involved. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Is1orqeAQsM&t=19.28s)]
*  We also are learning from Israeli security sources about what went down earlier today. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Is1orqeAQsM&t=24.0s)]
*  I am told that there was a Cabinet meeting inside Israel and that the war Cabinet believed [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Is1orqeAQsM&t=31.48s)]
*  that they were getting together to talk about a ceasefire in Gaza, a possible hostage deal. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Is1orqeAQsM&t=37.32s)]
*  And then when they were brought into the room, they were—many of them were asked to sign [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Is1orqeAQsM&t=43.08s)]
*  nondisclosure agreements, and they were told that they were really brought together because [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Is1orqeAQsM&t=48.2s)]
*  they were moving forward with the strikes against Iran's nuclear program. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Is1orqeAQsM&t=52.839999999999996s)]
*  I'm told from well-placed sources that this will go on for days and that some of those [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Is1orqeAQsM&t=56.959999999999994s)]
*  targets include not just the nuclear facilities, nuclear—as well as the ballistic missile [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Is1orqeAQsM&t=62.68s)]
*  sites, but also individuals. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Is1orqeAQsM&t=68.67999999999999s)]
*  And possibly there are indications, reports from the region, that the Iranian general [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Is1orqeAQsM&t=71.56s)]
*  staff was targeted, suggesting that the chief of staff of the Iranian army may have been [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Is1orqeAQsM&t=76.64s)]
*  killed in the strikes and that other Iranian nuclear scientists were also struck. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Is1orqeAQsM&t=83.12s)]
*  If you look back to the way that Israel handled Hezbollah in the north with the exploding [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Is1orqeAQsM&t=88.16s)]
*  pagers, it is likely that they wanted to disrupt the ability of Iran's military, their general [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Is1orqeAQsM&t=93.72s)]
*  staff, those responsible for the ballistic missile program, to be able to respond. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Is1orqeAQsM&t=100.72s)]
*  Israel is bracing itself right now, expecting that there will be some sort of response. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Is1orqeAQsM&t=106.60000000000001s)]
*  But I think if you look at the past, Sean, it's quite clear that taking out that layer [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Is1orqeAQsM&t=111.2s)]
*  of creating chaos amongst those who would call for those ballistic missile strikes is [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Is1orqeAQsM&t=117.84s)]
*  something that Israel has done in the past and would likely have done this time. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Is1orqeAQsM&t=123.56s)]
*  Again, right now there are reports of some explosions in and around Baghdad. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Is1orqeAQsM&t=127.84s)]
*  The U.S. has an embassy there, as well as military personnel based in Iraq. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Is1orqeAQsM&t=133.48000000000002s)]
*  Of course, there are 40,000 American troops across the Middle East. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Is1orqeAQsM&t=139.56s)]
*  They are at bases and in extremely vulnerable positions. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Is1orqeAQsM&t=144.04000000000002s)]
*  The White House and the Pentagon have given a warning to the Iranians not to strike those [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Is1orqeAQsM&t=148.32000000000002s)]
*  bases, but they are prepared. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Is1orqeAQsM&t=154.8s)]
*  And that is why you heard Secretary Hegseth order that ordered departure of military dependents [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Is1orqeAQsM&t=156.96s)]
*  just yesterday, Sean. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Is1orqeAQsM&t=164.16s)]
*  All right, Jennifer Griffith of the Pentagon, tonight. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Is1orqeAQsM&t=165.48s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Is1orqeAQsM&t=168.28s)]
