# ‘GIGANTIC JOKE’: Iran has 'no need for this'
**Fox News - World News:** [June 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-3u1UaHH3Q)
*  Good evening everyone, I'm Laura Ingraham, this is the Ingraham Angle. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-3u1UaHH3Q&t=0.0s)]
*  Thank you as always for spending some time with us. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-3u1UaHH3Q&t=5.48s)]
*  My angle in moments, but first missiles continuing to fly in the Middle East as face-to-face [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-3u1UaHH3Q&t=7.72s)]
*  negotiations between Iran and some European officials started with no immediate signs [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-3u1UaHH3Q&t=12.96s)]
*  of progress. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-3u1UaHH3Q&t=19.28s)]
*  Iran's top diplomat says that Tehran is willing to keep talking, but not to the United States. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-3u1UaHH3Q&t=20.28s)]
*  Iran is launching a wave of attacks against military industrial sites and Iran retaliating [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-3u1UaHH3Q&t=27.68s)]
*  by striking Tel Aviv. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-3u1UaHH3Q&t=33.28s)]
*  And late today President Trump warned Iran, you have two weeks, that's it. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-3u1UaHH3Q&t=35.6s)]
*  The president knows what's at stake, which is why he's giving this timetable. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-3u1UaHH3Q&t=44.6s)]
*  Now we don't want the U.S. involved in another endless war. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-3u1UaHH3Q&t=49.4s)]
*  Trump campaigned on that and he hasn't strayed. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-3u1UaHH3Q&t=53.4s)]
*  There's only so far you can push a peacemaker, but President Trump will do what he has to [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-3u1UaHH3Q&t=72.64s)]
*  do and do what he's always done. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-3u1UaHH3Q&t=77.48s)]
*  He'll try to strike a deal. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-3u1UaHH3Q&t=79.72s)]
*  He was pressed today on the quality of the intel he's gotten on how close Iran actually [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-3u1UaHH3Q&t=81.76s)]
*  is to building nuclear weapons and whether he's done and about face on military interventionism. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-3u1UaHH3Q&t=86.44s)]
*  Twenty years ago you were skeptical of a Republican administration that attacked the Middle East [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-3u1UaHH3Q&t=94.16000000000001s)]
*  country on the idea of questionable intelligence of weapons of mass destruction. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-3u1UaHH3Q&t=98.64s)]
*  How is this moment different with Iran? [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-3u1UaHH3Q&t=103.14s)]
*  Well there were no weapons of mass destruction. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-3u1UaHH3Q&t=105.08000000000001s)]
*  I never thought there were. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-3u1UaHH3Q&t=107.28s)]
*  That was somewhat pre-nuclear. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-3u1UaHH3Q&t=110.24s)]
*  You know, it was a nuclear age but nothing like it is today. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-3u1UaHH3Q&t=111.24s)]
*  And it looked like I'm right about the material that they've gathered already. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-3u1UaHH3Q&t=115.88s)]
*  It's a tremendous amount of material. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-3u1UaHH3Q&t=120.75999999999999s)]
*  And I think within a matter of weeks or certainly within a matter of months they're going to [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-3u1UaHH3Q&t=123.14s)]
*  be able to have a nuclear weapon. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-3u1UaHH3Q&t=127.16s)]
*  We can't let that happen. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-3u1UaHH3Q&t=128.54s)]
*  What intelligence do you have that Iran is building a nuclear weapon? [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-3u1UaHH3Q&t=129.79999999999998s)]
*  Your intelligence community has said they have no evidence that they are at this point. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-3u1UaHH3Q&t=132.51999999999998s)]
*  Well then my intelligence community is wrong. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-3u1UaHH3Q&t=136.04s)]
*  Who in the intelligence community said that? [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-3u1UaHH3Q&t=138.84s)]
*  Your Director of National Intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-3u1UaHH3Q&t=141.16s)]
*  She's wrong. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-3u1UaHH3Q&t=143.96s)]
*  Oh ouch. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-3u1UaHH3Q&t=146.6s)]
*  And President Trump answered one of the most important questions that I think all of you [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-3u1UaHH3Q&t=148.04s)]
*  want to know the answer to. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-3u1UaHH3Q&t=152.0s)]
*  President, are you concerned that Iran or its proxies would wage terror attacks against [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-3u1UaHH3Q&t=153.48000000000002s)]
*  American targets abroad if you order military action? [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-3u1UaHH3Q&t=159.28s)]
*  We're always concerned about that and we have to take them out and be very strong. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-3u1UaHH3Q&t=162.84s)]
*  You're even in danger talking to me right now. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-3u1UaHH3Q&t=167.28s)]
*  Do you know that? [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-3u1UaHH3Q&t=169.44s)]
*  Once the United States gets involved, there is no turning back. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-3u1UaHH3Q&t=172.28s)]
*  Trump is wise to give this more time to play out. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-3u1UaHH3Q&t=175.84s)]
*  Here with me now is Ben and Ben Talableu, Senior Fellow at the Foundation of the Defense [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-3u1UaHH3Q&t=179.32s)]
*  of Democracies. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-3u1UaHH3Q&t=184.56s)]
*  Ben Homm, it's good to see you. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-3u1UaHH3Q&t=185.56s)]
*  Is President Trump taking the right path here by giving Iran, in your estimation, this, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-3u1UaHH3Q&t=188.95999999999998s)]
*  it's essentially a deadline. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-3u1UaHH3Q&t=197.48s)]
*  It could be as long as two weeks, but he didn't say that it might not be shorter than two [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-3u1UaHH3Q&t=199.07999999999998s)]
*  weeks. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-3u1UaHH3Q&t=203.76s)]
*  Pleasure to be with you, Laura. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-3u1UaHH3Q&t=205.44s)]
*  I think it's the million dollar question and you're absolutely right to be asking [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-3u1UaHH3Q&t=206.44s)]
*  it because Trump is giving time, but not necessarily to Iran. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-3u1UaHH3Q&t=209.79999999999998s)]
*  President Trump is giving time to the Israelis to continue to defang the Iranian ballistic [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-3u1UaHH3Q&t=214.64s)]
*  missile threat. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-3u1UaHH3Q&t=219.51999999999998s)]
*  Iran is still home, even though lots of missiles have been intercepted and even though lots [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-3u1UaHH3Q&t=221.12s)]
*  of missiles have been destroyed. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-3u1UaHH3Q&t=225.2s)]
*  Iran is still home to the biggest ballistic missile arsenal in the Middle East. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-3u1UaHH3Q&t=227.12s)]
*  So that is a critical mission that the Israelis are continuing to carry out, both against [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-3u1UaHH3Q&t=231.1s)]
*  medium-range systems as well as against their launchers. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-3u1UaHH3Q&t=235.79999999999998s)]
*  The Israelis continue to go after a whole network of missile, military and nuclear infrastructure, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-3u1UaHH3Q&t=238.76s)]
*  so continuing to impose costs on this regime, which increases actually President Trump's [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-3u1UaHH3Q&t=243.68s)]
*  leverage in the short to medium term if he does give them this full two weeks. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-3u1UaHH3Q&t=248.04000000000002s)]
*  Well, Iran's Deputy Foreign Minister was asked today why his government had ramped [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-3u1UaHH3Q&t=252.8s)]
*  up the production of enriched uranium. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-3u1UaHH3Q&t=258.96000000000004s)]
*  This was his response. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-3u1UaHH3Q&t=261.52s)]
*  Watch. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-3u1UaHH3Q&t=262.72s)]
*  To use that as a pretext to use aggression against Iran, that is something that we used. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-3u1UaHH3Q&t=273.68s)]
*  Benham, this is protectual. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-3u1UaHH3Q&t=285.48s)]
*  The percent of uranium that they possess for peaceful purposes only and America and the [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-3u1UaHH3Q&t=288.40000000000003s)]
*  West is making a grave mistake in supporting these strikes. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-3u1UaHH3Q&t=296.64s)]
*  Forgive me Laura, but this is a gigantic joke. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-3u1UaHH3Q&t=300.6s)]
*  The Islamic Republic of Iran has no need for domestic uranium enrichment, not just talking [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-3u1UaHH3Q&t=303.36s)]
*  about all of its energy and oil and gas wealth that I can use for this kind of electricity [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-3u1UaHH3Q&t=308.2s)]
*  generation on the home front. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-3u1UaHH3Q&t=313.76s)]
*  But today, the Islamic Republic gets less than 1 percent or just over 1 percent of electricity [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-3u1UaHH3Q&t=315.52s)]
*  from nuclear sources for its entire grid. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-3u1UaHH3Q&t=321.84s)]
*  Everything else is from sources that the Islamic Republic has domestically been producing. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-3u1UaHH3Q&t=325.08s)]
*  So all of the uranium that the Iranians are producing, large swaths of it are just sitting [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-3u1UaHH3Q&t=329.44s)]
*  there in storage. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-3u1UaHH3Q&t=333.91999999999996s)]
*  That's why in Fordow, this 300 feet underground fortified military nuclear facility, all this [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-3u1UaHH3Q&t=334.91999999999996s)]
*  uranium is just sitting there highly enriched. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-3u1UaHH3Q&t=340.4s)]
*  And just to really disprove the Deputy Foreign Minister's point there, Iran is the only [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-3u1UaHH3Q&t=342.88s)]
*  country in the world that does not have civil nuclear naval propulsion, so they don't [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-3u1UaHH3Q&t=346.71999999999997s)]
*  have nuclear submarines, which take 60 percent, that is producing 60 percent, that doesn't [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-3u1UaHH3Q&t=351.0s)]
*  have nuclear weapons already. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-3u1UaHH3Q&t=357.23999999999995s)]
*  So this should be a dead giveaway. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-3u1UaHH3Q&t=358.48s)]
*  And just for the audience to know as well, countries that are producing 60 percent are [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-3u1UaHH3Q&t=360.4s)]
*  not 60 percent of the way there. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-3u1UaHH3Q&t=364.64s)]
*  Uranium enrichment is logarithmic, not linear. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-3u1UaHH3Q&t=367.24s)]
*  So 60 percent is actually more akin to 90 plus percent of the way there. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-3u1UaHH3Q&t=370.08s)]
*  All right, Ben, thank you as always. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-3u1UaHH3Q&t=375.04s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-3u1UaHH3Q&t=378.24s)]
