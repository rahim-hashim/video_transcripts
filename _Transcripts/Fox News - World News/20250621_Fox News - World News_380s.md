# The US does not want to get dragged into this, KT McFarland says
**Fox News - World News:** [June 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksd7HL91gzQ)
*  Fond is really special ops veteran Aaron Cohen and former deputy national security advisor KT McFarland [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksd7HL91gzQ&t=0.0s)]
*  KT you and I both worked for president trump [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksd7HL91gzQ&t=6.36s)]
*  We have watched him deliberate and make hard decisions you especially in the national security capacity [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksd7HL91gzQ&t=9.32s)]
*  I want to know from you. How do you think he's consuming information right now? [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksd7HL91gzQ&t=15.72s)]
*  And do you ultimately think he decides to strike for dough? He said today, maybe that won't be necessary [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksd7HL91gzQ&t=19.96s)]
*  You know you and I have been there with him [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksd7HL91gzQ&t=26.34s)]
*  I've been in the situation room with him when he was facing similar kinds of things where he was trying to decide [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksd7HL91gzQ&t=29.14s)]
*  Should he attack the Syrian airfields that were being used for chemical weapons attacks against his people? [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksd7HL91gzQ&t=34.82s)]
*  President Trump is really good at this. He's thoughtful. He goes around the room. He asked that you know his secretary of state defense intelligence [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksd7HL91gzQ&t=40.66s)]
*  Community, what's the situation? [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksd7HL91gzQ&t=49.260000000000005s)]
*  What are our weaknesses what could go wrong what could go right and then he probably comes up with a couple of options of his own [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksd7HL91gzQ&t=51.82s)]
*  He's very thoughtful about it. He takes all the information in and then he makes a decision [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksd7HL91gzQ&t=57.82s)]
*  He doesn't delegate the decision. He owns the decision [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksd7HL91gzQ&t=62.86s)]
*  He makes a decision and then he once he makes a decision [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksd7HL91gzQ&t=66.3s)]
*  He lets it be carried out. He lets the military do it when the thing that sort of trigger [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksd7HL91gzQ&t=68.86s)]
*  I know with President Trump is when he says will the president of the United States [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksd7HL91gzQ&t=74.14s)]
*  That sort of trigger I know with President Trump is when he says we'll see or let's see what happens [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksd7HL91gzQ&t=77.98s)]
*  That means he's not ready to make a decision the events have not played themselves out yet [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksd7HL91gzQ&t=83.82000000000001s)]
*  And that's why I think he's given himself two weeks to decide what's Israel going to do in two weeks [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksd7HL91gzQ&t=88.46000000000001s)]
*  How much more are they going to degrade the capabilities? What's going on with the ayatollah? Is he going to go to negotiate? [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksd7HL91gzQ&t=93.26s)]
*  Is he not going to go to negotiate? What's going on in the inner circle? Is a regime change possible? [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksd7HL91gzQ&t=98.38000000000001s)]
*  All those things are still to be played out. Yeah, he deliberates then he acts [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksd7HL91gzQ&t=102.94s)]
*  It's why Soleimani is no longer on the face of the earth [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksd7HL91gzQ&t=106.7s)]
*  It's why al-baghdad is no longer on the face of the earth [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksd7HL91gzQ&t=109.10000000000001s)]
*  You know Aaron as you've been with Israeli special forces [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksd7HL91gzQ&t=112.3s)]
*  And to that point about KT and President Trump being very deliberative and strategic in the things he does [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksd7HL91gzQ&t=116.22s)]
*  I want to pull up this headline from the times of Israel how an israeli-american deception campaign [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksd7HL91gzQ&t=122.86s)]
*  Lulled iran into a false sense of security Israeli officials says Trump's warnings to Netanyahu not to attack [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksd7HL91gzQ&t=128.46s)]
*  As well as stories of Israeli officials flying to the us and prime minister taking a short vacation [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksd7HL91gzQ&t=135.18s)]
*  We're all there to fool the regime. I put this up [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksd7HL91gzQ&t=140.94s)]
*  Because this president and sounds like netanyahu they play some four-dimensional chess [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksd7HL91gzQ&t=144.70000000000002s)]
*  So do you believe Aaron that there's some strategy going on to what we're hearing from netanyahu and from trump publicly? [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksd7HL91gzQ&t=149.1s)]
*  Well, it's good to see kaylee. I do believe that there is strategy going on here. This is a very serious business [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksd7HL91gzQ&t=157.34s)]
*  There was a ton of deception that's been happening over the last several months [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksd7HL91gzQ&t=163.1s)]
*  We saw how israel's intelligence agency mulsad was able to infiltrate iran months in advance and set up drone bases [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksd7HL91gzQ&t=166.46s)]
*  missile trucks [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksd7HL91gzQ&t=175.58s)]
*  And and who knows what other? [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksd7HL91gzQ&t=177.34s)]
*  intelligence asymmetrical intelligence operations they're conducting right now [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksd7HL91gzQ&t=179.72s)]
*  But where i'm at with all of this kaylee is that we need to understand [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksd7HL91gzQ&t=184.78s)]
*  That it's not military strikes alone that are going to stop this threat it will by time [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksd7HL91gzQ&t=188.94s)]
*  But really what has to happen is complete decapitation [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksd7HL91gzQ&t=195.17999999999998s)]
*  Of that nuclear program, but there's multiple pieces that need to be layered [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksd7HL91gzQ&t=198.77999999999997s)]
*  So hitting the program and the people running it kaylee then we need to think about in israel [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksd7HL91gzQ&t=203.42s)]
*  Disrupting the kud's force commanded control, which is why how we got 30 generals into one room [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksd7HL91gzQ&t=209.39999999999998s)]
*  Trick them and hit them with a missile and it was lights out crippling the irgc cyber warfare and regional influence as well [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksd7HL91gzQ&t=214.94s)]
*  Disorienting the leadership long enough for the iranian people to start to move here. Is there a potential shift of power? [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksd7HL91gzQ&t=224.04s)]
*  Going after the nukes are great and striking iran is great [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksd7HL91gzQ&t=232.7s)]
*  But at the end of the day that poison ideology, which is past 60 percent in that bunker [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksd7HL91gzQ&t=236.54s)]
*  Is really what the threat is and so [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksd7HL91gzQ&t=243.42s)]
*  I don't really think that the strikes are enough. We need to be looking at the macro picture here, which is [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksd7HL91gzQ&t=246.7s)]
*  Is palavi enough to be put into power? [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksd7HL91gzQ&t=253.26s)]
*  Can we get dissent from generals and police chiefs under palavi? [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksd7HL91gzQ&t=256.22s)]
*  And will the iranian people be able to get enough confidence in israel and america's operation here? [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksd7HL91gzQ&t=261.1s)]
*  To say the irgc is weak. We have nothing to be scared of [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksd7HL91gzQ&t=268.78000000000003s)]
*  Let's take back our country. So that's why i'm out with that kt. I want to play a quick sound bite for you [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksd7HL91gzQ&t=273.26s)]
*  This is ram emmanuel. He brought this up last night really interesting comparison 1994 bill clinton in the situation room [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksd7HL91gzQ&t=278.3s)]
*  Now i'm haunted by two things not haunted, but I have a flashing yellow light [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksd7HL91gzQ&t=286.7s)]
*  In 1994 same room situation room bill clinton was getting very basically his security team [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksd7HL91gzQ&t=291.26s)]
*  bombed north korea [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksd7HL91gzQ&t=298.3s)]
*  Carter president carter having gone there messed it up and messed up that opportunity and now you have a nuclear north korea [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksd7HL91gzQ&t=300.86s)]
*  Kt is this a 1994 moment? [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksd7HL91gzQ&t=307.18s)]
*  You know, you don't know the question is is it which moment is it is it going to be like libya where [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksd7HL91gzQ&t=311.66s)]
*  Top of the dictator and then something even worse happens or is it going to be like the fall of the soviet union? [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksd7HL91gzQ&t=316.3s)]
*  Where topple the dictator and democracy happens one of the things that president trump has said [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksd7HL91gzQ&t=322.14s)]
*  Time and again, no boots on the ground regime change [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksd7HL91gzQ&t=327.58000000000004s)]
*  I mean how many times has he made the speech where he said to everyone in the world? [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksd7HL91gzQ&t=330.7s)]
*  You choose your own governments. You choose your own leaders. You choose how you want to you know, run your affairs [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksd7HL91gzQ&t=334.86s)]
*  So I think I would really take issue [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksd7HL91gzQ&t=339.98s)]
*  I don't think president trump is actively looking for regime change if the iranian people want to do it [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksd7HL91gzQ&t=342.14000000000004s)]
*  That's one thing but to push it on them, then we own it then what happens the day after? [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksd7HL91gzQ&t=347.02000000000004s)]
*  We do not want to get dragged into another forever war [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksd7HL91gzQ&t=351.98s)]
*  And unless the iranian people themselves have a plan [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksd7HL91gzQ&t=355.82s)]
*  I really hesitate to think what would happen if we start taking out everybody ourselves [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksd7HL91gzQ&t=359.65999999999997s)]
