# Gen. Keane reveals the characteristics the made Operation Midnight Hammer a success #shorts
**Fox News - World News:** [June 22, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpW60omOXkM)
*  And I think the operation had four major characteristics of it to help it be successful. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpW60omOXkM&t=0.0s)]
*  One was the operational security of the operation. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpW60omOXkM&t=5.1000000000000005s)]
*  And that is really tough to maintain in our open, democratic society that we have. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpW60omOXkM&t=8.040000000000001s)]
*  And we know that things do have a tendency to leak out. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpW60omOXkM&t=13.64s)]
*  Everything leaks in Washington. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpW60omOXkM&t=16.46s)]
*  And then everybody—you know, listen, for the last week or two has been focused on this [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpW60omOXkM&t=17.6s)]
*  operation, and yet it didn't leak. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpW60omOXkM&t=22.2s)]
*  The deception helped considerably in that, in terms of the missile—I mean, the planes [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpW60omOXkM&t=25.5s)]
*  flying initially west, but the actual planes flew east to the target. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpW60omOXkM&t=31.86s)]
*  I think the president contributed to the deception operation as well, when he said, well, I'm [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpW60omOXkM&t=37.54s)]
*  going to make a decision in a couple of weeks. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpW60omOXkM&t=42.34s)]
*  The truth of the matter was the decision was already made or made very close to that statement [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpW60omOXkM&t=44.7s)]
*  he made. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpW60omOXkM&t=50.2s)]
*  And everybody was thinking there was time here. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpW60omOXkM&t=51.22s)]
*  And then characteristic of military operations, when we're going after something that we [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpW60omOXkM&t=54.06s)]
*  have to destroy, to ensure that, we use overwhelming force. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpW60omOXkM&t=58.480000000000004s)]
*  And you saw that. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpW60omOXkM&t=63.18000000000001s)]
*  Most everyone was saying two to three of these MOPs were going to be used. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpW60omOXkM&t=64.18s)]
*  Fourteen. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpW60omOXkM&t=68.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpW60omOXkM&t=69.7s)]
*  Multiple aircraft to deliver all of those. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpW60omOXkM&t=70.7s)]
*  And then the additional missiles and taking down three targets that the Israelis wanted [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpW60omOXkM&t=73.44s)]
*  help on, not just one. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpW60omOXkM&t=78.06s)]
*  And then the thing that was emphasized is the flawless execution. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpW60omOXkM&t=80.38s)]
*  And I think the audience had a complexity, got a feel for the complexity of military [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpW60omOXkM&t=84.64s)]
*  operations. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpW60omOXkM&t=89.46s)]
*  And I really applaud the chairman for providing those details. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpW60omOXkM&t=90.46s)]
