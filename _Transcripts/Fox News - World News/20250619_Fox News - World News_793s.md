# ‘The Five’ on Trump’s options for Israel-Iran conflict: ‘PEACEFULLY OR VIOLENTLY’
**Fox News - World News:** [June 19, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMrcWMOkf04)
*  Hello everyone, I'm Dana Perino along with Paul Morrow, Jessica Tarlaw, Jesse Waters [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMrcWMOkf04&t=0.0s)]
*  and Greg Gutfeld. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMrcWMOkf04&t=8.24s)]
*  It's five o'clock in New York City and this is The By. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMrcWMOkf04&t=9.24s)]
*  President Trump is keeping them guessing and giving a big deadline on whether the US military [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMrcWMOkf04&t=18.48s)]
*  is going to get involved in the deadly conflict between Israel and Iran. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMrcWMOkf04&t=22.84s)]
*  Now this comes amid a massive escalation. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMrcWMOkf04&t=26.36s)]
*  Officials say more than 70 people were injured after an Iranian missile barrage slammed into [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMrcWMOkf04&t=28.96s)]
*  a hospital in Israel. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMrcWMOkf04&t=33.2s)]
*  The IDF striking back by targeting more Iran nuclear sites, including a reactor. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMrcWMOkf04&t=35.08s)]
*  President Trump meeting all day with his top intelligence officials and Caroline Levitt [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMrcWMOkf04&t=39.84s)]
*  is sharing the president's latest thinking. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMrcWMOkf04&t=43.46s)]
*  Have a message directly from the president and I quote, based on the fact that there's [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMrcWMOkf04&t=46.72s)]
*  a substantial chance of negotiations that may or may not take place with Iran in the [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMrcWMOkf04&t=51.6s)]
*  near future. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMrcWMOkf04&t=56.36s)]
*  I will make my decision whether or not to go within the next two weeks. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMrcWMOkf04&t=57.52s)]
*  Iran has all that it needs to achieve a nuclear weapon. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMrcWMOkf04&t=62.36s)]
*  All they need is a decision from the supreme leader to do that and it would take a couple [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMrcWMOkf04&t=65.96000000000001s)]
*  of weeks to complete the production of that weapon, which would of course pose an existential [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMrcWMOkf04&t=69.88s)]
*  threat not just to Israel but to the United States and to the entire world. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMrcWMOkf04&t=74.88s)]
*  The conflict between Israel and Iran causing the view to make some pretty outrageous comments [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMrcWMOkf04&t=79.94s)]
*  and comparisons will be Goldberg just stepped in it. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMrcWMOkf04&t=84.17999999999999s)]
*  Earlier today I imagined what it would have been like if you had been on the set and what [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMrcWMOkf04&t=103.3s)]
*  you would have said to Whoopi when she said that. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMrcWMOkf04&t=107.42s)]
*  Her reaction is born of identity politics. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMrcWMOkf04&t=109.82s)]
*  If you help these Jews you're going to hurt the blacks, which is weird coming from a lady [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMrcWMOkf04&t=113.39999999999999s)]
*  named Goldberg. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMrcWMOkf04&t=117.56s)]
*  But I believe on the view they have a rule. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMrcWMOkf04&t=118.97999999999999s)]
*  One panelist has to say something so crazy every day that everybody else looks sane and [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMrcWMOkf04&t=122.36s)]
*  that day was Whoopi's and Joy Behar and Sonny Huston suddenly don't look totally bat poop [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMrcWMOkf04&t=128.7s)]
*  nuts. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMrcWMOkf04&t=134.85999999999999s)]
*  I think she's like, it seems to me since Trump 2015, 2016, she's now just operating on non-conscious [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMrcWMOkf04&t=136.34s)]
*  thinking. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMrcWMOkf04&t=143.62s)]
*  Everything is a reflex and she says what's easily retrievable. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMrcWMOkf04&t=144.62s)]
*  It's Whoopi AI. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMrcWMOkf04&t=148.74s)]
*  It's not even a real Whoopi anymore. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMrcWMOkf04&t=150.58s)]
*  She just has race, race, race, race, race and she just pulls out of it. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMrcWMOkf04&t=152.06s)]
*  One of the many benefits of Trump is his refusal to land in the world of the half opinion. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMrcWMOkf04&t=155.42000000000002s)]
*  He thinks it through. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMrcWMOkf04&t=162.22000000000003s)]
*  Both sides, both sides traffic in half opinions. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMrcWMOkf04&t=165.5s)]
*  We don't want war, half opinion. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMrcWMOkf04&t=169.14000000000001s)]
*  We don't want Iran to get the nuclear bomb, a half opinion. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMrcWMOkf04&t=171.9s)]
*  And those are the easiest opinions to have because no one's going to disagree with you [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMrcWMOkf04&t=175.5s)]
*  on either one because you're not discussing the risk of both decisions. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMrcWMOkf04&t=179.26000000000002s)]
*  Both decisions have risks. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMrcWMOkf04&t=184.42000000000002s)]
*  So in a weird way half opinions are propaganda. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMrcWMOkf04&t=186.34s)]
*  Telling the story without a risk is a lie and it helps you advance your cause. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMrcWMOkf04&t=189.70000000000002s)]
*  That's propaganda. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMrcWMOkf04&t=194.1s)]
*  So then you look at Trump. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMrcWMOkf04&t=195.38s)]
*  This is a good example. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMrcWMOkf04&t=197.1s)]
*  People could say Americans could drop bunker busters to destroy Iran's facilities. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMrcWMOkf04&t=199.1s)]
*  That's a half opinion. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMrcWMOkf04&t=205.85999999999999s)]
*  What does Trump do? [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMrcWMOkf04&t=207.34s)]
*  He says, do they work? [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMrcWMOkf04&t=208.34s)]
*  He thinks it through by asking the question that bureaucrats don't ask because they don't [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMrcWMOkf04&t=211.34s)]
*  want to sound stupid, but he's actually asking, does it work? [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMrcWMOkf04&t=216.22s)]
*  I think that's why we elected him. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMrcWMOkf04&t=220.9s)]
*  One of the reasons is that he isn't going to do anything where he's going to lose. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMrcWMOkf04&t=223.14000000000001s)]
*  That's why I didn't believe that he lost in 2020. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMrcWMOkf04&t=228.34s)]
*  And he's right. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMrcWMOkf04&t=230.62s)]
*  But he won't step in until he knows it's going to work. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMrcWMOkf04&t=232.74s)]
*  And so you kind of, you voted for him. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMrcWMOkf04&t=237.16000000000003s)]
*  You got to trust him. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMrcWMOkf04&t=239.3s)]
*  The other thing I was thinking about, Paul, is he's got a remarkable skill of keeping [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMrcWMOkf04&t=240.3s)]
*  people guessing but being very transparent. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMrcWMOkf04&t=245.10000000000002s)]
*  It must be very confounding to people in Iran who are trying to figure this guy out. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMrcWMOkf04&t=248.61999999999998s)]
*  But he's basically showing you his work but also keeping it a secret. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMrcWMOkf04&t=253.61999999999998s)]
*  When you think about it, he's talking about a deal, right? [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMrcWMOkf04&t=258.02s)]
*  And they're sitting in Tehran saying, deal? [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMrcWMOkf04&t=260.38s)]
*  What deal? [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMrcWMOkf04&t=262.21999999999997s)]
*  What are the options that we have here? [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMrcWMOkf04&t=263.21999999999997s)]
*  Because if you think about it, where do we stand? [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMrcWMOkf04&t=265.09999999999997s)]
*  Our red line is absolutely no enrichment, right? [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMrcWMOkf04&t=267.74s)]
*  And we're supposed to have unfettered access to all the uranium enrichment sites. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMrcWMOkf04&t=270.34s)]
*  That's the deal we got now. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMrcWMOkf04&t=275.14s)]
*  That's what the AIEI is supposed to be doing right now. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMrcWMOkf04&t=276.82s)]
*  And they told us to go pound send. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMrcWMOkf04&t=279.09999999999997s)]
*  I think really what's going on. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMrcWMOkf04&t=280.61999999999995s)]
*  I'm not advocating for any of the positions here because at the end of the day, you have [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMrcWMOkf04&t=281.61999999999995s)]
*  to remember something. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMrcWMOkf04&t=284.9s)]
*  They have a lot more facts than we do up in on Capitol Hill. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMrcWMOkf04&t=285.9s)]
*  Trump is operating off of far more facts than we are. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMrcWMOkf04&t=289.05999999999995s)]
*  So at the end of the day, as Craig said, we elected them. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMrcWMOkf04&t=291.26s)]
*  We got to trust them, right? [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMrcWMOkf04&t=293.9s)]
*  But the immediate issue is furred out. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMrcWMOkf04&t=295.14s)]
*  I mean, that's just it. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMrcWMOkf04&t=298.26s)]
*  So you don't have to go all the way. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMrcWMOkf04&t=299.41999999999996s)]
*  People talk about regime change and everything else. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMrcWMOkf04&t=300.94s)]
*  You just got to mitigate the immediate issue. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMrcWMOkf04&t=302.5s)]
*  If you do that and take, like I said, take the deal off the table. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMrcWMOkf04&t=305.44s)]
*  If you get rid of the immediate threat, well, then you bought some time. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMrcWMOkf04&t=308.84s)]
*  Now, ultimately, regime change is where this thing has to devolve to. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMrcWMOkf04&t=312.71999999999997s)]
*  At the end of the day, whether you like it or not, you have an adversary who cannot exist [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMrcWMOkf04&t=316.59999999999997s)]
*  without that bomb. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMrcWMOkf04&t=321.35999999999996s)]
*  The mullahs cannot list long term without that bomb. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMrcWMOkf04&t=322.35999999999996s)]
*  They learn the lessons of Gaddafi. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMrcWMOkf04&t=324.91999999999996s)]
*  We need this thing. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMrcWMOkf04&t=326.44s)]
*  They're going to keep trying. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMrcWMOkf04&t=327.44s)]
*  That's the solider's tool. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMrcWMOkf04&t=328.44s)]
*  So you got this adversary. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMrcWMOkf04&t=329.67999999999995s)]
*  They say they want to kill you. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMrcWMOkf04&t=331.28s)]
*  They're trying to get the bomb. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMrcWMOkf04&t=332.4s)]
*  At the end of the day, at some point, they got to go. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMrcWMOkf04&t=333.48s)]
*  But you don't need that right now. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMrcWMOkf04&t=335.68s)]
*  You just got to mitigate the immediate problem, which is furred out. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMrcWMOkf04&t=337.12s)]
*  What I think he's doing is, and that's why I think you can see this two week window. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMrcWMOkf04&t=340.28s)]
*  The last thing he wants is any American blood here. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMrcWMOkf04&t=344.68s)]
*  And right now, the Iranians still do have some offensive capacity. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMrcWMOkf04&t=348.4s)]
*  They do have the ability to fire missiles, maybe hit some American assets. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMrcWMOkf04&t=351.76s)]
*  And in many ways, almost worst, almost worst, is hitting some of our adversaries, excuse [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMrcWMOkf04&t=354.72s)]
*  me, some of our allies. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMrcWMOkf04&t=359.64s)]
*  You get some dead Europeans and et cetera in some places inside the Red Zone in Iraq. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMrcWMOkf04&t=360.96s)]
*  We got an international McGillan. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMrcWMOkf04&t=365.59999999999997s)]
*  That's the last thing he wants. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMrcWMOkf04&t=367.47999999999996s)]
*  I think he's buying time, waiting till they are out of that capacity. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMrcWMOkf04&t=368.47999999999996s)]
*  And then my own opinion, I think that's when he moves. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMrcWMOkf04&t=373.12s)]
*  And then ultimately, long term, if you notice, we hit their internal security. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMrcWMOkf04&t=376.32s)]
*  That's the besiege. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMrcWMOkf04&t=379.52s)]
*  That's the one who keep their people down. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMrcWMOkf04&t=380.52s)]
*  The Israelis took that out yesterday. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMrcWMOkf04&t=383.12s)]
*  They're also now hacking the media and saying, rise up, rise up. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMrcWMOkf04&t=385.2s)]
*  Unlike what we saw during the Green Revolution, I think long term, that's the second stage. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMrcWMOkf04&t=388.56s)]
*  But the first stage is fertile. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMrcWMOkf04&t=393.15999999999997s)]
*  And from where I sit, you've got to mitigate that. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMrcWMOkf04&t=394.79999999999995s)]
*  Dana, can I ask Paul a question? [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMrcWMOkf04&t=396.68s)]
*  It's important. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMrcWMOkf04&t=398.76s)]
*  Yes, sure. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMrcWMOkf04&t=399.76s)]
*  What's a McGillan? [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMrcWMOkf04&t=400.76s)]
*  Do I have to explain all the NYPD is? [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMrcWMOkf04&t=401.76s)]
*  I don't know what it is either. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMrcWMOkf04&t=405.59999999999997s)]
*  I thought I would look it up later. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMrcWMOkf04&t=406.59999999999997s)]
*  You don't know the term McGillan? [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMrcWMOkf04&t=407.59999999999997s)]
*  No, what is it? [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMrcWMOkf04&t=408.59999999999997s)]
*  It's like related to Figezi. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMrcWMOkf04&t=409.59999999999997s)]
*  He said, Paul used a phrase, pound sand. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMrcWMOkf04&t=411.59999999999997s)]
*  I have a feeling that if they do go through with this, that's exactly what this would [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMrcWMOkf04&t=416.2s)]
*  be, pounding some sand. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMrcWMOkf04&t=418.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMrcWMOkf04&t=420.76s)]
*  When he says it could last two weeks, I'm looking at what two weeks is away from, and [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMrcWMOkf04&t=421.76s)]
*  that would be July 4th. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMrcWMOkf04&t=426.2s)]
*  So I could see Trump lighting up the skies over Iran on the 4th of July. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMrcWMOkf04&t=427.88s)]
*  Or I could see him doing it this weekend. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMrcWMOkf04&t=431.96s)]
*  Maybe he's bluffing. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMrcWMOkf04&t=434.12s)]
*  I have no idea. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMrcWMOkf04&t=435.12s)]
*  But it looks like it's moving pretty quickly because if you take out the underground nuclear [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMrcWMOkf04&t=436.12s)]
*  You can't just then just sit back and watch and let the Iranians retaliate and hit your [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMrcWMOkf04&t=442.48s)]
*  bases and hit your ships. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMrcWMOkf04&t=447.32s)]
*  You have to have a pretty significant bombing campaign to neutralize any sort of Iranian [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMrcWMOkf04&t=449.38s)]
*  offensive capacity. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMrcWMOkf04&t=454.38s)]
*  That's missiles, command and control. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMrcWMOkf04&t=455.82s)]
*  You got to hit everything. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMrcWMOkf04&t=457.6s)]
*  So you're just not a sitting duck. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMrcWMOkf04&t=458.6s)]
*  When we think about negotiations, Trump's made it pretty clear. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMrcWMOkf04&t=461.24s)]
*  This thing's either going peacefully or violently. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMrcWMOkf04&t=464.94s)]
*  And the decision's the Ayatollah. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMrcWMOkf04&t=467.70000000000005s)]
*  Ayatollah's 86 years old. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMrcWMOkf04&t=470.0s)]
*  He's been in power for three decades. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMrcWMOkf04&t=472.92s)]
*  He's a religious revolutionary. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMrcWMOkf04&t=475.28000000000003s)]
*  Is this the kind of guy that's going to negotiate? [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMrcWMOkf04&t=478.0s)]
*  He's a proud old man that's probably going to go down fighting. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMrcWMOkf04&t=481.36s)]
*  Now the question is, if you hit these underground facilities, does he stay in power? [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMrcWMOkf04&t=486.68s)]
*  Can he stay in power? [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMrcWMOkf04&t=492.6s)]
*  Can he wield power in a country where you've lost your ballistic missiles and you've lost [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMrcWMOkf04&t=494.08000000000004s)]
*  your only leverage, which is your nuke? [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMrcWMOkf04&t=498.44s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMrcWMOkf04&t=500.52s)]
*  So do you leave him in power and wait for a coup? [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMrcWMOkf04&t=501.52s)]
*  Or do the Israelis get so pissed after hospital strikes that they're going to just go in and [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMrcWMOkf04&t=503.88s)]
*  launch a decapitation strike? [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMrcWMOkf04&t=509.32s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMrcWMOkf04&t=510.8s)]
*  The thing about Iraq and Iran that makes it a lot different is the geography. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMrcWMOkf04&t=511.8s)]
*  If you look at Iran, it's surrounded by mountain ranges. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMrcWMOkf04&t=515.2s)]
*  So it's very hard for foreign fighters to pour in from all over the region. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMrcWMOkf04&t=520.52s)]
*  Not only do they have the borders that are surrounded by mountains, I mean look at that, [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMrcWMOkf04&t=526.36s)]
*  you have two major deserts in there. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMrcWMOkf04&t=529.66s)]
*  So once you get over the mountains and through, you have deserts you have to go through. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMrcWMOkf04&t=532.26s)]
*  So this is not Iraq. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMrcWMOkf04&t=536.8s)]
*  And also, if you do, God help us, if you do go in and there is some sort of coup and you [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMrcWMOkf04&t=538.28s)]
*  have to maintain some sort of government there, remember what happened in Iraq, the debathification. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMrcWMOkf04&t=543.92s)]
*  That backfire. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMrcWMOkf04&t=551.74s)]
*  Everyone in the military, every cop, every civil administrator, every bureaucrat, and [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMrcWMOkf04&t=553.1800000000001s)]
*  then all those guys got pissed off and then left with a gun to form a militia and there's [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMrcWMOkf04&t=557.86s)]
*  no one to run the country. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMrcWMOkf04&t=562.1800000000001s)]
*  So things have been learned. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMrcWMOkf04&t=563.62s)]
*  Or since all options are on the table, Dana, I can see Trump just letting the Israelis [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMrcWMOkf04&t=565.62s)]
*  get their hands even dirtier and launch commando raids into this site. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMrcWMOkf04&t=570.22s)]
*  So when he says all options are on the table, they are. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMrcWMOkf04&t=574.26s)]
*  And I agree. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMrcWMOkf04&t=577.3s)]
*  I trust Donald Trump to make the right decision here. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMrcWMOkf04&t=578.42s)]
*  Whatever he does, I think it'll be the right call. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMrcWMOkf04&t=581.0999999999999s)]
*  What's also interesting, Jessica, is the polling that came out last night that shows a great [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMrcWMOkf04&t=583.5s)]
*  majority of the American people are concerned that Iran could have a nuclear weapon and [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMrcWMOkf04&t=588.18s)]
*  that they support action. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMrcWMOkf04&t=592.4599999999999s)]
*  And I think what's interesting, you could get online and you can go way down deep and [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMrcWMOkf04&t=594.02s)]
*  you could be online for two days straight while you're sitting at home waiting to come [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMrcWMOkf04&t=597.6199999999999s)]
*  back to work until the medicine kicks in. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMrcWMOkf04&t=600.38s)]
*  And then you get a poll like that and you're like, okay, actually people are pretty sane. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMrcWMOkf04&t=603.8599999999999s)]
*  I think another question that Foxful asked was about does the Israeli state, does the [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMrcWMOkf04&t=608.58s)]
*  Israeli strikes make the world more dangerous? [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMrcWMOkf04&t=615.5s)]
*  And 59 percent said yes to that. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMrcWMOkf04&t=617.82s)]
*  So you can, as usual with polling, you can find the answer that you want in there. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMrcWMOkf04&t=620.0600000000001s)]
*  And I would say it's a uniform feeling that people know that Iran is an adversary, that [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMrcWMOkf04&t=624.3s)]
*  they don't want them to have a nuclear weapon. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMrcWMOkf04&t=628.74s)]
*  But once you start having a conversation about regime change, Americans get very skittish [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMrcWMOkf04&t=630.58s)]
*  about this. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMrcWMOkf04&t=634.98s)]
*  It was the first time at least that I had heard a senator mention it this morning, [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMrcWMOkf04&t=636.02s)]
*  Tom Tillis was being interviewed, and he said it's time for regime change. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMrcWMOkf04&t=639.74s)]
*  And that is something that really flies in the face of Donald Trump, the peacetime president [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMrcWMOkf04&t=644.46s)]
*  or Donald Trump as the campaigner. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMrcWMOkf04&t=649.34s)]
*  I think that if this is packaged as we are going to take out their nuclear weapons, but [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMrcWMOkf04&t=653.3000000000001s)]
*  we are not trying to take over their country and we're not going to get engaged in decades [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMrcWMOkf04&t=660.4200000000001s)]
*  long wars that we have no business being in, people remember what that was like and they [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMrcWMOkf04&t=665.26s)]
*  don't enjoy it. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMrcWMOkf04&t=669.3s)]
*  It's also interesting to me, Senator Mark Warner, who is the ranking Democrat on the [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMrcWMOkf04&t=671.62s)]
*  Intel committee, was echoing what Tulsi Gabbard had testified to back in March, where she [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMrcWMOkf04&t=675.18s)]
*  essentially said Iran is not on the precipice of having this weapon. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMrcWMOkf04&t=680.66s)]
*  Do you believe that? [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMrcWMOkf04&t=683.9399999999999s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMrcWMOkf04&t=685.9s)]
*  I don't think Mark Warner has any reason to back up Tulsi Gabbard for fun. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMrcWMOkf04&t=686.9s)]
*  He didn't vote for her. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMrcWMOkf04&t=691.1s)]
*  He doesn't think that highly of her. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMrcWMOkf04&t=692.46s)]
*  And so I believe that Bibi Netanyahu is taking advantage of the situation and he knows that [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMrcWMOkf04&t=694.22s)]
*  Trump is going to back him up and that Trump believes that the Israelis have earned this. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMrcWMOkf04&t=700.0600000000001s)]
*  I'm going to use the point, Greg, that I was supposed to make two days ago, that he has [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMrcWMOkf04&t=704.6600000000001s)]
*  faith in the Israelis to be doing what's in, quote unquote, the best interests of the region. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMrcWMOkf04&t=707.98s)]
*  But you're going to have a real issue if this turns into a redux, putting aside the topography [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMrcWMOkf04&t=713.26s)]
*  of Iran, of what we have already seen before, and you're not going to have an American appetite [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMrcWMOkf04&t=719.6600000000001s)]
*  for it. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMrcWMOkf04&t=724.06s)]
*  I also wanted to note, I was listening to Admiral Stravidis, I always mess up pronouncing his [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMrcWMOkf04&t=725.06s)]
*  name, and he was talking about the implications of hitting Fordow. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMrcWMOkf04&t=728.74s)]
*  And he said, you could essentially be creating a dirty bomb. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMrcWMOkf04&t=731.86s)]
*  So you explode this nuclear facility and then you have enriched uranium just flying around [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMrcWMOkf04&t=734.62s)]
*  in the sky and you could be poisoning people. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMrcWMOkf04&t=739.5s)]
*  And that's something that I hadn't heard discussed before and should be a consideration. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMrcWMOkf04&t=743.38s)]
*  But if Israel can essentially get rid of their missile capacity, just wear them out, maybe [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMrcWMOkf04&t=747.06s)]
*  that's what the two weeks is. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMrcWMOkf04&t=752.02s)]
*  We'll see what they have after two weeks. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMrcWMOkf04&t=753.34s)]
*  Can I throw in one curveball at the end here? [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMrcWMOkf04&t=754.62s)]
*  Is it a McGilla? [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMrcWMOkf04&t=757.26s)]
*  Yes, here's the McGilla. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMrcWMOkf04&t=759.26s)]
*  If Ukraine had kept their nuclear weapon, this wouldn't have happened. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMrcWMOkf04&t=761.22s)]
*  There wouldn't have been a... [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMrcWMOkf04&t=765.1s)]
*  That's the Gaddafi part. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMrcWMOkf04&t=766.6600000000001s)]
*  Right. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMrcWMOkf04&t=767.6600000000001s)]
*  And also they were told that we would protect them if we took away their nuclear weapons. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMrcWMOkf04&t=768.6600000000001s)]
*  Yeah, so maybe we don't do that again. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMrcWMOkf04&t=771.22s)]
*  I got to say. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMrcWMOkf04&t=775.26s)]
*  I was away for two weeks. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMrcWMOkf04&t=778.7800000000001s)]
*  That was not the take I expected. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMrcWMOkf04&t=779.82s)]
*  I am going to have one heck of a commercial break. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMrcWMOkf04&t=781.14s)]
