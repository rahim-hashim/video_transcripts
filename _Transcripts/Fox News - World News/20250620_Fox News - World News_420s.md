# BREAKING: Iran has enough enriched uranium for nuclear bombs, IAEA chief says
**Fox News - World News:** [June 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA98jrY1IeE)
*  first return to Mike Tobin with the very latest on the ground in Israel. Hi, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA98jrY1IeE&t=0.0s)]
*  Mike. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA98jrY1IeE&t=4.0s)]
*  Good morning, currently. Good morning, Todd. Once again, Israel, southern [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA98jrY1IeE&t=6.4s)]
*  Israel took a hit from an Iranian missile. It hit in the town of Bear [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA98jrY1IeE&t=9.5s)]
*  Sheva, very near an apartment and an industrial complex causing fire and [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA98jrY1IeE&t=12.96s)]
*  damage on the ground. No reports of injuries. There are reports that this [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA98jrY1IeE&t=17.400000000000002s)]
*  single missile made its way through the air defenses because one of the [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA98jrY1IeE&t=21.64s)]
*  interceptors malfunction. There were no reports of injuries again. Beer. Sheva [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA98jrY1IeE&t=25.240000000000002s)]
*  is the same town where yesterday a missile hit the Sirocco hospital, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA98jrY1IeE&t=29.44s)]
*  resulting in dozens of minor injuries, some of them serious. The director [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA98jrY1IeE&t=32.36s)]
*  general of the International Atomic Energy Agency tells me in an exclusive [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA98jrY1IeE&t=36.24s)]
*  interview, Iran does have enough uranium for several nuclear bombs, and [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA98jrY1IeE&t=40.120000000000005s)]
*  the regime is just a quick step away from enriching to weapons grade [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA98jrY1IeE&t=45.120000000000005s)]
*  uranium. However, he said he saw no plans for Iran to take that step, and [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA98jrY1IeE&t=48.56s)]
*  he believes even at this stage, diplomacy is the path to prevent Iran [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA98jrY1IeE&t=54.2s)]
*  from acquiring a nuclear weapon. I believe that there is a way to, um, take [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA98jrY1IeE&t=58.28s)]
*  this danger or this concern out of the table, uh, in a in a negotiated way [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA98jrY1IeE&t=65.58s)]
*  with a very robust. As I said, I've been in conversations, very good [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA98jrY1IeE&t=73.12s)]
*  conversations with Steve Witkoff and with the Iranians as well. I believe [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA98jrY1IeE&t=77.12s)]
*  that there are ways in which we can make sure that Iran does not get a [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA98jrY1IeE&t=82.64s)]
*  nuclear weapon. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA98jrY1IeE&t=88.04s)]
*  Now Israel reports every day their fighters and drones are taking out [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA98jrY1IeE&t=91.10000000000001s)]
*  missile systems in Iran. Today we have images of that. The idea says strikes [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA98jrY1IeE&t=94.04s)]
*  were carried out in the areas of Isfahan and Tehran, saying their equipment, the [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA98jrY1IeE&t=98.34s)]
*  equipment that you see in these images are both radar installations and missile [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA98jrY1IeE&t=102.62s)]
*  systems intended to strike Israeli aircraft for days. Now Israel says that [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA98jrY1IeE&t=106.44000000000001s)]
*  their fighters have enjoyed air superiority, meaning they can operate [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA98jrY1IeE&t=111.22s)]
*  at will in the skies over Iran without the risk of being shot down. Carly and [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA98jrY1IeE&t=115.32s)]
*  Todd. Okay, Mike Tobin live for us in Tel Aviv. Mike, thank you. Let's bring [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA98jrY1IeE&t=119.6s)]
*  in Ben Ham Ben Tala Blue Iran program, senior director and senior fellow for [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA98jrY1IeE&t=124.44s)]
*  the Foundation for Defense of Democracies. But hum, it's great to see [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA98jrY1IeE&t=129.32s)]
*  you. Thank you so much for joining us. So yesterday we also learned that [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA98jrY1IeE&t=132.56s)]
*  President Trump is going to make his final decision within two weeks on [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA98jrY1IeE&t=134.72s)]
*  whether or not the U. S. Will take military action against Iran. So how do [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA98jrY1IeE&t=138.48s)]
*  you feel about that two week deadline? Great to be with you and good morning. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA98jrY1IeE&t=142.64s)]
*  Listen, I think all eyes will be on President Trump and on the U. S. In these [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA98jrY1IeE&t=146.79999999999998s)]
*  two weeks. But given that deadline, it gives the Israelis significant time to [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA98jrY1IeE&t=151.0s)]
*  continue to erode the long range strike capabilities and really defang the [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA98jrY1IeE&t=155.7s)]
*  Iranian missile, military and nuclear apparatus. So should the president decide [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA98jrY1IeE&t=160.0s)]
*  to enter the U. S. Actually has less work here. So this is consistent both [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA98jrY1IeE&t=163.79999999999998s)]
*  with the president's philosophy and with the idea of America first. What do you [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA98jrY1IeE&t=167.76s)]
*  make of the theory that this two week window from Trump is merely a delay [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA98jrY1IeE&t=171.88s)]
*  tactic to allow Israel to perform a covert op inside Fordo to do exactly [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA98jrY1IeE&t=174.96s)]
*  the same thing that the bunker buster would do, which is destroy Fordo? Well, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA98jrY1IeE&t=180.68s)]
*  the covert op designed to ferry out the uranium would be 100% safer would be [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA98jrY1IeE&t=185.68s)]
*  100% more secure way because you wouldn't know if you would know actually [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA98jrY1IeE&t=191.48s)]
*  if the uranium was not destroyed in some kind of blast or explosion. But [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA98jrY1IeE&t=195.12s)]
*  conversely, it comes with a lot more risks. I don't see this, by the way, as [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA98jrY1IeE&t=200.32s)]
*  some kind of covert op or Psy op or anything designed to buy time for that. I [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA98jrY1IeE&t=203.95999999999998s)]
*  actually see it as designed to buy time for the Iranians to realize how much of [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA98jrY1IeE&t=208.12s)]
*  a bind they are, how much they have critically lost and how much President [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA98jrY1IeE&t=211.92s)]
*  Trump is giving them one last chance before really hitting pedal to the [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA98jrY1IeE&t=216.2s)]
*  medal here. To be honest, just looking objectively as an outsider, the only [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA98jrY1IeE&t=219.44s)]
*  thing that is standing between the collapse of this regime and certain and [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA98jrY1IeE&t=223.4s)]
*  death is President Trump. So President Trump has a real capability to say it's [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA98jrY1IeE&t=228.28s)]
*  dismantle or else. So over the past week, and it was a week when we learned that [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA98jrY1IeE&t=232.36s)]
*  Israel did strike inside Iran, the axis of resistance has been very quiet. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA98jrY1IeE&t=238.4s)]
*  Hezbollah, the Houthis Hamas, how do you feel? How do you think that Iran feels [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA98jrY1IeE&t=244.44s)]
*  about the lack of response from their terror proxies? They feel alone and [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA98jrY1IeE&t=249.24s)]
*  afraid. And if I had to, you know, connect the dots, this is probably one reason why [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA98jrY1IeE&t=255.12s)]
*  the Israelis witnessed and sense that this is a sense of opportunity. The fact [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA98jrY1IeE&t=258.6s)]
*  that Hezbollah and Hamas have been deracinated and neutered, the fact that [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA98jrY1IeE&t=262.96s)]
*  the U.S. had been dealing with the Houthis, the fact that the Shia militias [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA98jrY1IeE&t=267.48s)]
*  in Iraq were too afraid to fire or whose firing was not necessarily [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA98jrY1IeE&t=270.52s)]
*  impactful throughout the course of the wars of the post-October 7 Middle East, [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA98jrY1IeE&t=275.48s)]
*  meant that the Islamic Republic lost one major leg of its conventional deterrent. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA98jrY1IeE&t=279.28000000000003s)]
*  Conversely, as you see with the missile strategy not performing as well either, [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA98jrY1IeE&t=283.56s)]
*  the other leg of the regime's conventional deterrent had fallen in. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA98jrY1IeE&t=287.28000000000003s)]
*  And given the fact that the regime is weak at home, economically bankrupt, [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA98jrY1IeE&t=290.8s)]
*  socially has a little to no base at home, this is all why the Israelis sense that [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA98jrY1IeE&t=294.64s)]
*  this was now or never. I want to add something to all the ills that the [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA98jrY1IeE&t=299.56s)]
*  current regime is undergoing right now. Despite talk of these ongoing [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA98jrY1IeE&t=303.32s)]
*  negotiations, do we really believe that an 86 year old religious zealot, quite [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA98jrY1IeE&t=307.68s)]
*  frankly, to your point in that last answer, with absolutely nothing to lose, [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA98jrY1IeE&t=313.2s)]
*  is really going to negotiate? That's my big concern here. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA98jrY1IeE&t=316.96s)]
*  Well, the real art of the deal for the president is to make this 86 year old [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA98jrY1IeE&t=321.47999999999996s)]
*  zealot that you mentioned, which is the Middle East's longest-running contemporary [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA98jrY1IeE&t=324.92s)]
*  dictator, to do exactly what his predecessor did, which he called drinking [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA98jrY1IeE&t=328.4s)]
*  from the poison chalice or settling for a suboptimal solution, forcing him to do [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA98jrY1IeE&t=332.8s)]
*  what he doesn't want to do. But in the case that his ideology almost certainly [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA98jrY1IeE&t=337.36s)]
*  overwhelms his pragmatism and his desire for survival, that he should know [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA98jrY1IeE&t=340.92s)]
*  that the U.S. has all the capability and all the intent to really help make a [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA98jrY1IeE&t=345.0s)]
*  nation that is a 88 million person nation not any longer be a hostage to that 86 [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA98jrY1IeE&t=349.24s)]
*  year old individual. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA98jrY1IeE&t=355.20000000000005s)]
*  We already showed a little bit of the celebration that took place in New [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA98jrY1IeE&t=357.04s)]
*  Jersey when Edan Alexander came home yesterday. We'll show a little bit more [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA98jrY1IeE&t=359.84000000000003s)]
*  in the show as it progresses. But how do you think that this war with Iran is [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA98jrY1IeE&t=363.24s)]
*  impacting the remaining hostages in Gaza? [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA98jrY1IeE&t=368.64s)]
*  Well, there are some folks who are saying it's overshadowing it completely. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA98jrY1IeE&t=371.64s)]
*  I don't see that at all the case. If you're going after the sponsor of the [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA98jrY1IeE&t=375.84s)]
*  the multiple terror proxies that the regime has created or cooperated in the [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA98jrY1IeE&t=380.32s)]
*  Middle East, you're doing the right thing because you're disconnecting the dots [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA98jrY1IeE&t=384.2s)]
*  between the patron and the proxy. And the more pressure you have on the patron, [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA98jrY1IeE&t=387.52s)]
*  the more leverage actually Israel has on the proxy, be that in the Gaza Strip [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA98jrY1IeE&t=391.48s)]
*  with Hamas or any other one that it seems to be fighting occasionally has [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA98jrY1IeE&t=396.48s)]
*  blown the north still. This is actually leverage that Israel has to actually be [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA98jrY1IeE&t=399.88s)]
*  able to press to get the hostages back. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA98jrY1IeE&t=404.04s)]
*  We will be watching it all. Ben Humban, Telly Blue, thank you so much for joining us. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA98jrY1IeE&t=406.20000000000005s)]
