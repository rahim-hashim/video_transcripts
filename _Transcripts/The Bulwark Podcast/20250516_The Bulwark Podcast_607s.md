# EMBARRASSING: MAGA Wants To Jail Comey Over Meme THEY Started! (w/ Peter Hamby)
**The Bulwark Podcast:** [May 16, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CETricDfaaE)
*  Free speech does include cringe live laugh love memes [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CETricDfaaE&t=0.0s)]
*  It does free speech does include seashells that say 86 47 [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CETricDfaaE&t=3.72s)]
*  You should also be pretty mad when the director of the FBI and the director of the National Intelligence [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CETricDfaaE&t=9.06s)]
*  Says that we should jail somebody for a meme [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CETricDfaaE&t=14.48s)]
*  Former FBI director Jim Comey posted kind of like a live laugh love themed [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CETricDfaaE&t=16.96s)]
*  former FBI director Jim Comey posted kind of like a live laugh love themed [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CETricDfaaE&t=23.96s)]
*  Instagram post. It's kind of like a live laugh love energy was a seashells on a beach walk and it said 8647 [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CETricDfaaE&t=30.96s)]
*  If you haven't figured that out yet and you're a listener [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CETricDfaaE&t=40.96s)]
*  We assume it stands for 86 47 as in get rid of 47 or we're out we're done with 47 [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CETricDfaaE&t=44.96s)]
*  47 being Donald Trump the 47th president. We've had a very normal reaction from our government to that [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CETricDfaaE&t=52.96s)]
*  to that silly resistance post. Cash Patel sent out a tweet that the FBI is monitoring this [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CETricDfaaE&t=59.96s)]
*  and they're giving the Secret Service all the necessary support they need [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CETricDfaaE&t=66.96s)]
*  Trump said that Jim Comey called for his assassination and that he's a dirty cop [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CETricDfaaE&t=69.96s)]
*  and here's Tulsi Gabbard [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CETricDfaaE&t=73.96s)]
*  Do you believe Comey should be in jail? [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CETricDfaaE&t=75.96s)]
*  I do. Any other person with the position of influence that he has [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CETricDfaaE&t=77.96s)]
*  people who take very seriously what a guy of his stature his experience [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CETricDfaaE&t=84.96s)]
*  and what the propaganda media has built him up to be [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CETricDfaaE&t=89.96s)]
*  I'm very concerned for the president's life. We've already seen assassination attempts [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CETricDfaaE&t=93.96s)]
*  I'm very concerned for his life and James Comey in my view should be held accountable and put behind bars for this [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CETricDfaaE&t=98.96s)]
*  Jailed. We should be jailed for a cringe resistance post. Peter what do you make of that? [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CETricDfaaE&t=105.96s)]
*  Well first of all a lot of thoughts here. One I'm glad 86 is now [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CETricDfaaE&t=112.96s)]
*  Everyone knows what 86 means apparently. When I was growing up my dad used to say 86 all the time [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CETricDfaaE&t=117.96s)]
*  because he had restaurant background. It's like a restaurant term [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CETricDfaaE&t=121.96s)]
*  Kick someone out or finish the dish or whatever. I guess it also has a military meaning [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CETricDfaaE&t=125.96s)]
*  Was your dad calling for the assassination of the people? [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CETricDfaaE&t=131.95999999999998s)]
*  No he sure wasn't calling for that. And look the Washington Post [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CETricDfaaE&t=134.95999999999998s)]
*  I don't know how's your dad. He's got a nice demeanor. He doesn't seem like the kind of person [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CETricDfaaE&t=140.95999999999998s)]
*  What kind of hat is that? What do we call that hat your dad wears? [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CETricDfaaE&t=144.96s)]
*  I don't know. He used to have these Panama Jack hats. It's just a cool hat. I don't know [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CETricDfaaE&t=148.96s)]
*  Anyway he doesn't seem like a man calling for assassinations very often but I don't know. TBD [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CETricDfaaE&t=154.96s)]
*  So a few thoughts on what Tulsa Gabbard said. No one in the media and on the left likes James Comey [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CETricDfaaE&t=158.96s)]
*  Like she's pretending that he's some sort of left wing hero [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CETricDfaaE&t=167.96s)]
*  He's got some fans. It's a niche group. He's in the bulwark lane [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CETricDfaaE&t=173.96s)]
*  Norm's loving entrance like James Comey [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CETricDfaaE&t=177.96s)]
*  Okay fine. He is not some sort of archangel out over on the left among Democrats or whatever though [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CETricDfaaE&t=183.96s)]
*  The other thing is this just two points to this. This falls under the category of stupid shit that people post on the internet [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CETricDfaaE&t=191.96s)]
*  James Comey probably shouldn't have posted it but he also shouldn't worry about going to jail or being investigated [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CETricDfaaE&t=199.96s)]
*  And then the Washington Post actually just today did a good roundup of all the times Donald Trump and Trump people have posted [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CETricDfaaE&t=203.96s)]
*  About political violence and threatening violence or winking at violence and specifically using the term 86 [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CETricDfaaE&t=212.96s)]
*  Matt Gaetz used it one time in 2024. He said that his political allies had 86 three party leaders in recent months [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CETricDfaaE&t=220.96s)]
*  He was referring to McConnell stepping down Jack Psobiak set called at one point in 2022 to 86 46 that would be Joe Biden [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CETricDfaaE&t=228.96s)]
*  None of these people were in jail. Not all these people were in jail. Pizza gate Jack straight to El Salvador [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CETricDfaaE&t=236.96s)]
*  No jury, no trial or sending them straight to El Salvador. If AOC gets in in 2029 you better watch out pizza gate Jack [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CETricDfaaE&t=242.96s)]
*  The stupid the stupid shit here is people like Tulsi and Kristi Noem and cash are like they know the way to warm Mr. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CETricDfaaE&t=251.96s)]
*  Trump's heart is to post about something like this. So like part of me when we first talked about this yesterday [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CETricDfaaE&t=260.96000000000004s)]
*  I was like, oh god, this is just like performative stupid social media bullshit so they can salute dear leader. Nothing will come of it [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CETricDfaaE&t=265.96000000000004s)]
*  I'm sure James Comey is going to get a knock on the door. I don't think he's going to El Salvador prison [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CETricDfaaE&t=272.96000000000004s)]
*  One other thing though that like I've been thinking about a little bit lately and you might disagree with this is the press and Democrats [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CETricDfaaE&t=278.96s)]
*  kind of moved on pretty quickly from the assassination attempt in Butler, Pennsylvania [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CETricDfaaE&t=286.96s)]
*  Like I don't think a lot of people in the elite spaces and like the big blue affluent cities kind of appreciate how much that turned Trump into like this messianic figure with his people [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CETricDfaaE&t=292.96s)]
*  And like there were one and a half assassination attempts on Donald Trump during the campaign. So it's like James Comey is not going to do it account [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CETricDfaaE&t=305.96s)]
*  No shooter is going to go listen to James Comey's little like Outer Banks seashell message to go shoot the president [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CETricDfaaE&t=312.96s)]
*  But you know, there is some like I wasn't really a resistance guy for starters and I get you know [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CETricDfaaE&t=319.96s)]
*  I mean Gerald Ford had a couple of assassination attempts. You don't hear about that. You don't learn about that in school [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CETricDfaaE&t=325.96s)]
*  I mean, I'm not trying to downplay it. It was really bad. I've been it's just like I don't know what did you want the media to do? [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CETricDfaaE&t=329.96s)]
*  And they did a whole convention night about it. That's his pictures on the side of [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CETricDfaaE&t=334.96s)]
*  I gave him a Tesla cyber truck with his bloody picture on the side of it. I don't know. People talk about it. I just don't know what [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CETricDfaaE&t=339.96s)]
*  Because we're of a certain age, we should just reflect back on when Sarah Palin had her super PAC and she put crosshairs on people on Democrats and vulnerable districts [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CETricDfaaE&t=347.96s)]
*  And everyone in the Fox News world like sorry everyone in the mainstream media the lame stream media lost their minds over this and it was stupid [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CETricDfaaE&t=357.96s)]
*  It was just a dumb thing. She by the way almost won a defamation case against the New York Times for saying for the time saying in an editorial [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CETricDfaaE&t=366.96s)]
*  She was threatening political violence. She lost that case. But you know, it's the Internet is just fucking stupid man. It's just fucking stupid [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CETricDfaaE&t=374.96s)]
*  Maybe just don't post that from a man from a man of the Internet. That's your to say we're to get more into the technology dystopia towards the end of the pod [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CETricDfaaE&t=384.96s)]
*  I do want to do a little bit more Bill Maher prep for you though on this topic because our man Scott Jennings listeners know this [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CETricDfaaE&t=393.96s)]
*  I he was sketching as well as my colleagues got Jennings worked for job and I gotta tell you I wasn't I didn't really love him that we're just gonna whisper that [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CETricDfaaE&t=401.96s)]
*  And I do feel a little vindicated on that front I've known him since 2014 I did a big profile of McConnell during that reelection primary with Matt Bevin back then [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CETricDfaaE&t=409.96s)]
*  Yeah, and Scott Scott and Holmes and I went to a minor league baseball game in Louisville and now he's now it's now Scott's famous so so he doesn't he doesn't [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CETricDfaaE&t=420.96s)]
*  He doesn't perceive that there's gonna be tension tonight because he posted this picture of you and him and Bill Maher and he said common sense and free speech will be debated by us all and to promote this [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CETricDfaaE&t=429.96s)]
*  Did you did he did he get your approval on that? No, but I believe in common sense Tim. I'm not I'm not free and free speech. We interesting to see if he does though [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CETricDfaaE&t=440.96s)]
*  So I'm wondering if this comes up. So I think as part of the prep today, I'm gonna I'm gonna I'm gonna pretend like I'm Scott Jennings. I'd like to hear your reaction tonight [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CETricDfaaE&t=448.96s)]
*  Let's do it. Bill Maher asked him about what do you think about this James Comey post and Scott Jennings like well, well, it's sad and pathetic that he's got TDS [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CETricDfaaE&t=456.96s)]
*  Okay, James Comey has TDS. He's wandering around the beach looking at rocks. People don't people don't want the bias from the FBI [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CETricDfaaE&t=465.96s)]
*  Okay, people don't want this bias and the liberals have lost their mind and I don't I don't know if there's an actual crime here [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CETricDfaaE&t=473.96s)]
*  But let's be honest depraved leftists have blood lust for Donald Trump. It's unacceptable. These are sick people [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CETricDfaaE&t=480.96s)]
*  It must be stopped. They're gonna keep losing elections because they've gone insane and I'm sad that James Comey has become one of them [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CETricDfaaE&t=487.96s)]
*  Okay, okay, we can agree with that. Okay [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CETricDfaaE&t=493.96s)]
*  Do you want to respond to that? Yeah, Peter, what do you think? I mean, I just I'm gonna say what I just told you [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CETricDfaaE&t=498.96s)]
*  I'm sorry, like that's a good sketch and his impression I guess but like, you know, there is some there is some there is some TDS out there in the world [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CETricDfaaE&t=504.96s)]
*  Yeah, sorry. Okay, while we're doing prep because I used to be a media prep person if that does come up you might just consider raising [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CETricDfaaE&t=512.96s)]
*  I don't know free speech does include cringe live laugh love memes. It does free speech does include seashells that say 86 47 and it's probably bad [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CETricDfaaE&t=519.96s)]
*  And if you're if you're mad about free speech and and the thing that you're mad about is that like annoying liberals wag their finger at you when you say [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CETricDfaaE&t=530.96s)]
*  Pussy or whatever when you say something inappropriate you get wagged a finger and you think that's a threat to free speech [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CETricDfaaE&t=539.96s)]
*  You should also be pretty mad when the director of the FBI and the director of the National Intelligence says that we should jail somebody for a meme [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CETricDfaaE&t=546.96s)]
*  I don't I just I don't think that that would be a very popular take if it was James Comey saying he was gonna jail pizza Jack pizza gate Jack [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CETricDfaaE&t=554.96s)]
*  Psoebia I don't think that Scott would be for that. So that might be something to bring up just a nice a good point. We're brainstorming. Yeah. Yeah [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CETricDfaaE&t=561.96s)]
*  Okay, right. Yating as we say right. Whiteboard, you know, you're gonna keep getting warmed up as this podcast goes along that time you get out there tonight [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CETricDfaaE&t=568.96s)]
*  And we're gonna give you a cocktail. You're gonna be nice and loose [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CETricDfaaE&t=576.96s)]
*  You [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CETricDfaaE&t=584.96s)]
