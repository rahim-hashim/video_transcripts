Video Description: A miracle food paste for malnourished children, that taxpayers have already paid for, is collecting dust in warehouses. Drugs donated to fight parasitic infections remain undistributed and are nearing their expiration dates. American-purchased ambulances sit idle because they have no gas. USAID was shut down in the name of government efficiency, but instead, we've spent at least $6 billion to dismantle it—and we've killed a lot of kids in the process, despite what Elon and Marco Rubio say.

# How Trump’s USAID Cuts Wrecked Lives and Killed Children (w/ Nick Kristof)
**The Bulwark Podcast:** [June 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0)
*  It's just maddening. I mean, especially for something that said it was about government [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=0.0s)]
*  efficiency. The State Department has one estimate that the cost of shutting down USAID was $6 [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=4.16s)]
*  billion. You know, so instead of saving money, they've spent $6 billion, killing a lot of [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=11.36s)]
*  kids. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=17.88s)]
*  Hello, and welcome to the Bored Podcast. I'm your host, Tim Miller. Delighted welcome to [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=18.88s)]
*  you. New York Times columnist. His books include a memoir, Chasing Hope, published last year, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=29.24s)]
*  two time winner of the Pulitzer Prize. He's also the, more importantly, the general manager [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=33.879999999999995s)]
*  at Christoph Farms, which produces hard cider, Pinot Noir. I'm not a Pinot Noir man myself. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=38.12s)]
*  Chardonnay and Rosé in the Willamette Valley. It's Nick Christoph. What's up? [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=43.32s)]
*  Hey, well, I just can't believe you are starting off by admitting you're not a Pinot Noir fan. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=47.92s)]
*  The best wine ever. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=53.2s)]
*  I know that movie sideways made it very popular. And so I pretended to like it for a little [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=55.6s)]
*  while and I just finally came up came around to admitting that I just don't. It's not for [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=59.6s)]
*  me. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=64.48s)]
*  You know, you've got to keep on with the fakery. I, one of our family tales that I kind of won [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=65.48s)]
*  my wife over at a party by bringing her a Pinot Noir when everybody else was an afflicting [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=70.32000000000001s)]
*  Cabernet Sauvignon. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=75.68s)]
*  Well, I have to check out your Rosé, the Christoph Rosé. That's really more. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=76.68s)]
*  It's an amazing Rosé. It really is. And it's just so nice to have something to distract [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=82.0s)]
*  myself from all the mess in the world under Washington. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=85.92s)]
*  Yeah, I bet. I bet. Well, I want to talk a little bit about your Oregon life at the end. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=88.64s)]
*  But what prompted us to reach out, I'm so I so appreciate that you came on the pod was, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=93.44s)]
*  I don't know, you got a month ago now. Marco Rubio was testifying that your reporting about [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=98.12s)]
*  the impact of USAID cuts was a lie. You wrote a response column where you say, I see Secretary [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=107.92s)]
*  Rubio as a good man doing bad things. I thought that was a little generous, but we'll get [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=112.36s)]
*  into that. And then you replied by telling him to meet Evan Anzu, who you met in Africa. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=117.8s)]
*  So why don't you we start by sharing Evan's story and then we'll talk more broadly about [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=123.34s)]
*  your reporting. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=126.4s)]
*  Yeah. So I made a trip to South Sudan at the beginning of March to try to gauge the impact [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=127.4s)]
*  of USAID cuts. And at that point, Elon Musk had said that no one had died from those cuts. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=133.32000000000002s)]
*  And, you know, within an hour of beginning my reporting in South Sudan, I had the names [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=139.32000000000002s)]
*  of a bunch of people who had died, including kids. And so Evan Anzu was a little boy who [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=146.12s)]
*  was an AIDS orphan. His parents had died. And the only way he could access ARVs, anti-retrovirals, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=154.8s)]
*  was through a social worker who was paid by this program, PEPFAR, that George W. Bush [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=162.8s)]
*  had started. And so those intermediaries, those social workers were cut out. And how [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=168.12s)]
*  is a little boy going to access ARVs? He doesn't. And then he gets an opportunistic infection [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=174.4s)]
*  and dies. And, you know, that happened to him. It happened to a boy called Peter Dundee. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=181.4s)]
*  It happened to a little girl called Ekal Deng. And it is happening to people all over the [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=187.9s)]
*  world. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=193.14000000000001s)]
*  Well, it's probably, talk to us about your reporting. I'm just extremely interested since [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=194.14000000000001s)]
*  you're, you know, I'm sitting in my hole here in New Orleans shouting at the screen, but [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=197.62s)]
*  you're actually, you're there. You've done several trips. So can you talk about where [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=202.66s)]
*  you've gone and just at the broadest level? [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=206.1s)]
*  So my first trip in March was to South Sudan and to some degree to Kenya. Kenya was a little [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=209.26s)]
*  less affected. South Sudan was brutally affected. And then just recently, I'm just back from [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=215.78s)]
*  a trip to West Africa, a follow-up trip where I was mostly in Sierra Leone and Liberia. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=222.06s)]
*  And again, you know, what you see everywhere is kids dying unnecessarily of really simple [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=227.73999999999998s)]
*  things, of malaria, of diarrhea, and indeed of HIV-related infections, of malnutrition. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=234.42s)]
*  And you see women dying in childbirth. And, you know, that is because USAID truly was [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=242.42s)]
*  flawed in some ways, but it was also saving six lives a minute as our best guess. And [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=249.42s)]
*  when you take that away, you get people dying. And I just wish that Marco Rubio, instead [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=256.41999999999996s)]
*  of denouncing my reporting, would come with me on a trip and I'd be delighted to show [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=262.41999999999996s)]
*  him some of these kids who are starving. And I think, I would like to think that would [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=266.41999999999996s)]
*  at least melt his heart. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=271.42s)]
*  Yeah. We'll get back to Rubio. I'm skeptical about that. It's a good instinct. I appreciate [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=273.42s)]
*  your instincts on that. So just help me paint a picture. So you're going, like I wouldn't [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=278.42s)]
*  even know where to start, right? You go to Sierra Leone and what, like the embassy? Are [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=282.42s)]
*  you working with NGOs? And what part of it, what are you looking at? [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=287.42s)]
*  You know, normally I might drop in on an embassy to talk to officials there, but these days [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=291.42s)]
*  I kind of think I would get any ambassador in trouble, get him fired if I showed up in [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=297.42s)]
*  the embassy. So basically what I was doing was dropping in on villages. And so I dropped [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=302.42s)]
*  in on one village and I asked if there had been any children who had died. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=310.42s)]
*  So you had a translator? [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=316.42s)]
*  Yeah. So I had a translator and we found a local health worker who had been kind of laid [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=318.42s)]
*  off in all this chaos, but he showed me around and I asked if anybody had died in that village [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=325.42s)]
*  recently. And they said, oh, you know, this little boy died. So we went and talked to [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=331.42s)]
*  the mom and it turned out that he had had malaria. Normally the local health worker [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=337.42s)]
*  would have had the malaria treatment, the medicine, and also the hospital would have [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=346.42s)]
*  had his backup because of the collapse of USAID. Neither of them had this really cheap [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=351.42s)]
*  malaria medicine and the baby died. And now as it turned out that mom had, she had her [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=358.42s)]
*  second child was also sick with malaria and the hospital and the health worker still didn't [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=368.42s)]
*  have antimalarials. And you just, you know, you just see this mom with a sick child and all [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=375.42s)]
*  these arguments that I hear about, oh, this isn't our responsibility and we should look [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=382.42s)]
*  after our own kids. This is a mom with a sick child. She's already lost one child because [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=388.42s)]
*  of the sudden way in which USAID was cratered. And she's, you know, she's going to, you know, [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=392.42s)]
*  she's at risk of losing another because of politics in Washington, because of decisions made [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=399.42s)]
*  in Washington. My people have never been to places like this village. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=405.42s)]
*  Do folks there like understand what's happening? Like it's related to Washington or like, [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=409.42s)]
*  so I regularly ask people, you know, do you know who the president of the United States is? [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=415.42s)]
*  And, you know, in the villages, most people did not know some of them had heard of Trump. If you [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=420.42s)]
*  mentioned it, they were sometimes aware of USAID and sometimes aware that USAID had, you know, [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=425.42s)]
*  that there had been big problems with it. They were aware that medicine was less available. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=433.42s)]
*  I visited one village again, just kind of, I just went with some health workers off into the [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=439.42s)]
*  mountains and I heard of a woman who had died in childbirth. And so we went to the village. We [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=445.42s)]
*  found her dad and her sister and she had hemorrhaged in April and there had been a hospital [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=452.42s)]
*  donated by USAID two years ago for that kind of eventuality. And so they called the ambulance and [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=461.42s)]
*  the ambulance crew said, well, the funding has been cut for fuel for our ambulance. And so if you [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=470.42s)]
*  bring us fuel, we can, you know, we can go rescue this woman, Yama Freeman, but, you know, that's [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=477.42s)]
*  not going to happen. And so a bunch of, she's badly hemorrhaging and a bunch of the strongest [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=484.42s)]
*  young men in the village, they put her in a hammock and put her on their shoulders and they ran down [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=492.42s)]
*  this red mud path 10 miles toward the hospital and shouting encouragement and shouting, [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=498.42s)]
*  encouragement to her as they go, you know, keep on going, Yama. And she dies on route for want of [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=506.42s)]
*  fuel for an ambulance that we had already donated. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=512.4200000000001s)]
*  That's like a fucking comedy of heirs. And that's so sad. What, so are things like, there's some, I [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=518.4200000000001s)]
*  guess, conversation that things are that like they have uncancelled some of this stuff. So you were [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=524.4200000000001s)]
*  there most recently, like, you know, help me sort through that. Like what is still, you know, what [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=530.4200000000001s)]
*  is still part of the Doge cuts? You know, what have they, you know, put back into place? [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=535.42s)]
*  So that is true that some things have been uncancelled. The problem is it's very hard to figure out [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=540.42s)]
*  what is being uncancelled. And it, you know, it was this quite complicated system where you had [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=546.42s)]
*  different groups doing different things. So one group would supply the ARVs and other would provide the [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=552.42s)]
*  health workers who, who administer them. Another would look after the, you know, the supplies in a [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=560.42s)]
*  warehouse. You know, somebody else would coordinate among the different NGOs. Somebody else would do [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=571.42s)]
*  viral load checking. And this, you know, this all kind of collapses. So some elements have been [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=577.42s)]
*  preserved, but they often don't work together with the other elements. And so some malaria programs are [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=584.42s)]
*  coming back, for example, but the malaria medicine in one county in Liberia, it was being stored in this [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=592.42s)]
*  medical warehouse that the county had and USAID had, they had contracted to upgrade the warehouse. And [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=600.42s)]
*  they started the work and the roof was torn off. And then that's when the stop work order went out. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=606.42s)]
*  So now the medical warehouse has no roof. So, okay, in theory, they're providing malaria medicine again, [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=612.42s)]
*  but all of a sudden there is no roof on the medical warehouse. And, you know, it's just things like this [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=621.42s)]
*  you hear over and over and over. And, you know, it's just a very, very complicated system. And so [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=627.42s)]
*  it's just maddening. I mean, especially for something that said it was about government efficiency [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=636.42s)]
*  to see the toll of the inefficiency. The State Department has one estimate that the cost of shutting down [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=642.42s)]
*  USAID was $6 billion. You know, someone said it's saving money. They've spent $6 billion killing a lot of kids. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=653.42s)]
*  So getting to see how that process works, I wonder how you respond to, you know, I've seen Elon has done a little bit of [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=660.42s)]
*  the rent and JD, I guess, actually this was JD, not Elon, but Elon has said this. JD was repeating something [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=668.42s)]
*  Elon had said. He was on Theo Vonn's podcast. Theo was asking him about, you know, the USAID and these [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=674.42s)]
*  horror stories. And JD confidently says, well, you know, did you know that the USID was going to be [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=680.42s)]
*  doing something to help people? And the rest of it was all grift and it was, you know, people skimming off the top [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=686.42s)]
*  and these NGOs are folks are getting rich. Like, how would you respond to that? Like criticism having seen it all [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=692.42s)]
*  on the ground? So I think there's something to the critique that too much money was going to the USID. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=700.42s)]
*  It's just going to be a whole lot of people. And so I think that's the, you know, the, the, the, the [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=706.42s)]
*  contractors in the, in the beltway and the beltway bandits as they're called. I think there's, you know, something to that [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=716.42s)]
*  critique. There have been efforts to have more money go. But I mean, the real reason so much of the money isn't being [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=722.42s)]
*  handed directly to people on the ground is that it's going to say to buy vaccines. So I mean, one of the most [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=728.42s)]
*  life saving efforts is called Gavi, the vaccine Alliance. It has saved 18 million lives so far. And, you know, [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=734.42s)]
*  it is this very efficient international body that is buying vaccines for malaria, for HPV to prevent cervical cancer, [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=742.42s)]
*  et cetera, et cetera. And, you know, it's not going to help to give somebody in Liberia $5 and tell them to go buy their [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=750.42s)]
*  vaccines. You have to coordinate the same with the global fund against AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=758.42s)]
*  You know, there are some things that are more efficient when the money is spent in a global way. And so, you know, [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=764.42s)]
*  but I mean, it was the room to reform USAID. Absolutely. Was it too bureaucratic? You know, totally. You know, [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=772.42s)]
*  PEPFAR, I think some spent more than it needed to on, on the, on the, on the, on the, on the, on the, on the [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=780.42s)]
*  PEPFAR. I think some spent more than it needed to on some kinds of salaries in a way that disrupted the ecosystem. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=790.42s)]
*  Could that have been spent more efficiently? Yeah. But, you know, what we got was reform. It was demolition. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=798.42s)]
*  Yeah. And when you're talking about waste also, I've, I've in some of your columns, you, you wrote the two things that struck me [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=804.42s)]
*  just about the current waste that's now happening in the, in the reform system, which is there was something called [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=810.42s)]
*  something called plumpy nut. I guess we've already manufactured through an official here in America, which is now not getting to people. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=817.42s)]
*  And then there are the Merck medicines. Talk about those. Yeah. So the plumpy nut, plumpy nut is this miracle peanut paste that [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=822.42s)]
*  over the last 20 years or so, 20 years or so has been developed and it just brings severely acutely malnourished children back to life. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=831.42s)]
*  It's incredible to see it, how effective it is. And it is one reason why malnutrition mortality has come down a great deal. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=838.42s)]
*  So right now a child is dying of malnutrition about every 15 seconds. And meanwhile, the US taxpayers have already purchased [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=847.42s)]
*  185,000 boxes of plumpy nut that taxpayers own that is sitting in a warehouse in Rhode Island, gathering dust because the state department, given the collapse of USAID, [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=857.42s)]
*  doesn't really know what to do with it. And it's manufactured here. It's manufactured in the US. It's creating jobs here. We've already paid for it. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=872.42s)]
*  Exactly. And it's already been sitting in a warehouse in Rhode Island doing nothing. That's correct. And there's another 500,000 boxes in Georgia in a kind of similar situation. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=881.42s)]
*  There are two manufacturers in the US, one in Rhode Island, one in Georgia. And this is just... I mean, talk about waste. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=892.42s)]
*  You think the richest man in the world could figure out how to get that to Africa, you know, if it wasn't for US, if he didn't want USAID to do it because the communists were in USAID or whatever, [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=897.42s)]
*  you think he could figure out how to get the boxes to Sierra Leone? Yeah. I mean, it's inefficiency, but it's inefficiency that is killing kids. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=905.42s)]
*  And, you know, it just... I can't tell you how heartbreaking it is to see a child with severe malnutrition. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=914.42s)]
*  And I think that's because they don't cry. They don't show pain. They don't show any expression. They barely turn their heads. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=926.42s)]
*  They're basically... the body is saving every calorie it can just to keep the major organs functioning. And they look a little like zombies, and their eyes follow you, but they're so expressionless. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=939.42s)]
*  And it just... it just breaks your heart. And meanwhile, we can... we've paid for the plumpy nut to save their lives. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=953.42s)]
*  And then, you know, as you suggest, there's something similar that I went to a warehouse in Sierra Leone in a gated compound. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=960.42s)]
*  The security guard let me into the warehouse. And there is enough medicine for... to prevent river blindness, this terrible scourge of blindness, enough medicine to help 7 million people in Sierra Leone. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=967.42s)]
*  It's donated by Merck. Merck then shipped it to Sierra Leone. So we didn't even pay for this. We didn't even pay for this. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=984.42s)]
*  Every dollar... and basically the US just has to pay for distribution. And every dollar in this... this is called mass drug administration. Every dollar in mass drug administration leverages $26 in donated drugs. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=992.42s)]
*  It's there. And now... but the US canceled the drug administration. And so it's sitting there gathering dust and the... and some of it is approaching expiration dates. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=1006.42s)]
*  When it expires, the, you know, destruction of these drugs will be expensive. It's just... it's just this nightmare. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=1021.42s)]
*  What... and what is river blindness that the drug prevents? River blindness, it's a disease that... it's a parasitic disease where the parasites go behind the eye and they destroy the optic nerve. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=1029.42s)]
*  And it is painful. It means that very... that large areas can no longer be farmed. People have to flee. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=1042.42s)]
*  And it's been one of the great successes, partly because of Jimmy Carter. He... they discovered that this... this deworming medicine, ivermectin, can control river blindness, can prevent it. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=1052.42s)]
*  And Merck has been donating... I forget how many doses of this for years now. And so... [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=1066.42s)]
*  Wait, is it ivermectin? [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=1075.42s)]
*  Yeah, it's the same... [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=1077.42s)]
*  The miracle drug that the Vagabee people thought cured COVID and everything? [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=1078.42s)]
*  Yeah. And, I mean, but ivermectin doesn't work on COVID. Boy, it works with the river blindness. And it's... I mean, it's... it's an incredibly effective drug. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=1082.42s)]
*  Can't we use that propaganda? You know how great ivermectin is. We want to bring it to the people of Sierra Leone. It's sitting... it's just wasting away. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=1094.42s)]
*  I mean, the paradox is that Merck makes money on ivermectin largely to deworm American pets. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=1103.42s)]
*  So they... you know, if you... when you deworm a dog or a horse in the US, it's with ivermectin. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=1112.42s)]
*  And then they use those supply lines to produce ivermectin to provide free ivermectin. It's the brand name, Mectizan, to Africa to wipe out river blindness. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=1121.42s)]
*  It's... it's more than... it's... river blindness has come down more than 90%. Jimmy Carter gets a special shout out. He was heroic in focusing attention on this. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=1134.42s)]
*  It's been one of the great public health successes of the last 25 years. And now... [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=1144.42s)]
*  And it sounds like the great... that public health success and the great public health success of the Bush administration with HEPFAR just being totally... just axed for nothing, essentially. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=1149.42s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, they were... I mean, it's a measure of whether it's HEPFAR under President Bush or the river blindness or the strides against polio against leprosy. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=1159.42s)]
*  You know, one doesn't hear about leprosy anymore. That's because it's gone down about 90... I don't know, 97% or something. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=1172.42s)]
*  You know, there really have been huge strides. And now, again, they're in doubt. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=1178.42s)]
*  All right. Well, you and I could not be more aligned on this. I mean, I guess you're doing the Lord's work while I'm just sitting here. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=1185.42s)]
*  But it's hard for me to come up with challenging questions to you. But luckily, you posted an article recently where some of your readers were upset with you. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=1190.42s)]
*  And so I want to go through a couple of those questions. But before we get to the readers, here was Rubio's response. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=1197.42s)]
*  When you asked Rubio to do an interview about these accusations that you were lying, he cowardly declined to do that. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=1203.42s)]
*  He then provided a written statement and said America is already the most generous nation in the world. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=1210.42s)]
*  We urge other nations to dramatically increase their humanitarian efforts. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=1215.42s)]
*  If you had the chance to talk to him, what would you have said to him about that? [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=1220.42s)]
*  Well, I'd point out that it is true that the U.S. donates more than any other single country. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=1224.42s)]
*  I mean, the U.S. donates more than Luxembourg or Liechtenstein. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=1230.42s)]
*  We're a big country. Per capita, we don't we donate rather less than the average member of the OECD, for example. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=1234.42s)]
*  And we donate 0.24 percent of GDP. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=1244.42s)]
*  Norway donates more than one percent. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=1250.42s)]
*  So and I'd also note that when the U.S. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=1253.42s)]
*  slashed aid, that also created a permission structure in which other countries promptly followed suit. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=1257.42s)]
*  So instead of spurring other countries to do better, it actually led them to cut aid themselves. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=1264.42s)]
*  So Britain cut aid, France cut aid, Netherlands cut aid, I think Belgium cut aid. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=1270.42s)]
*  And the result is this perfect storm in places like South Sudan or Liberia or Sierra Leone or Eastern Congo, [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=1275.42s)]
*  where kids are dying and women are dying in childbirth. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=1284.42s)]
*  It's hard to be like. It's not actually crazy for the New York Times columnist to say to the secretary of state, let's let's talk about this. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=1287.42s)]
*  Well, it's traveled to Africa and it is just I know he has like four jobs. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=1295.42s)]
*  And, you know, he's, you know, he's kidnapping students based on their op eds and stuff. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=1299.42s)]
*  But like if he truly believed in this policy, that this was inefficient, you know, that we could do better. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=1304.42s)]
*  The secretary of state, many sectors have gone to Africa, visited Africa, talked about, you know, met with locals. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=1312.42s)]
*  It is it's notable that that is not part of this program at all. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=1318.42s)]
*  No, I mean, Rubio is interesting because he was, you know, he's a smart guy. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=1323.42s)]
*  He's well informed. And historically, we know that he has been a champion of USAID, I think, [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=1329.42s)]
*  both for humanitarian reasons, but especially for the projection of soft power for the way that it is a way of dealing with China. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=1338.42s)]
*  And, you know, since being appointed secretary of state, that has just completely collapsed. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=1347.42s)]
*  And now he's just an echo chamber for Donald Trump. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=1353.42s)]
*  And, you know, that's what ambition does to you. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=1357.42s)]
*  And it's kind of it's really sad to watch. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=1362.42s)]
*  Have any high ranking Trump officials gone to the countries that were receiving USAID? [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=1365.42s)]
*  I can't think of any. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=1370.42s)]
*  Yeah, me neither. All right. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=1372.42s)]
*  I want to some of the other arguments you got from readers. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=1374.42s)]
*  There are and this is kind of related to what Marco just said. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=1378.42s)]
*  But what do you say to the more good faith arguments about America first that like we have a lot of problems here. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=1381.42s)]
*  They're hungry kids here. You know, we just don't have the resources for this. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=1389.42s)]
*  It's not about, you know, the fact that we're black hearted or whatever. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=1394.42s)]
*  It's just, you know, we got to do the best we can. We got to take care of people here. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=1397.42s)]
*  What do you say to that? [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=1401.42s)]
*  I mean, it's a fair point. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=1403.42s)]
*  There's a there's I think we do have real needs at home. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=1405.42s)]
*  And I, you know, in my when I write my tiny little checks at the end of the year, I have to weigh things I care about abroad against needs at home. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=1409.42s)]
*  I make the point, though, in I mean, in trying to weigh those in my own mind, both for my giving and for government policy. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=1418.42s)]
*  I note that the needs abroad are simply vastly greater than those at home that ended. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=1428.42s)]
*  It is far cheaper to save a life abroad than at home. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=1436.42s)]
*  Like I mentioned that woman whose child whose baby had died of malaria. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=1440.42s)]
*  So when the hospital didn't have the drug, she could have gone out to a pharmacy and purchased it. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=1444.42s)]
*  It would have been about twenty dollars and she scrambled and she could not find twenty dollars in time. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=1451.42s)]
*  We could, you know, twenty dollars can save a life abroad. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=1457.42s)]
*  The Aero V's to save a little child like Anzo Evan Anzo, who we talked about earlier, that cost about 12 cents a day. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=1461.42s)]
*  You know, you cannot save lives at with that kind of money at home. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=1472.42s)]
*  And also, I think that there is a danger with the American First argument that it becomes a complete lack of compassion for people of different skin color or different passport color. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=1478.42s)]
*  And, you know, it was also true in the 1930s, 1940s that we had real problems at home, real inequities at home. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=1496.42s)]
*  Yet clearly we should have done more to bring in Jewish immigrants from Europe, for example, instead of turning them away. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=1504.42s)]
*  And so we yes, there are tradeoffs. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=1512.42s)]
*  Yes, I don't I don't have any perfect algorithm for how much we spend abroad versus how much at home. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=1516.42s)]
*  But fundamentally, I don't think that not spending 12 cents a day to keep a child alive in South Sudan is going to mean that fewer kids in the US are going to be living and thriving here. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=1522.42s)]
*  Yeah, I guess that thing is it's not just and you mentioned the point to point zero to GDP or whatever. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=1534.42s)]
*  But the tangible example I always bring up is in Trump's first term, 2019, the tariffs caused all this disruption in the agriculture industry. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=1540.42s)]
*  And so we did a bailout of farmers and that farmer bailout cost basically the cost of USAID. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=1549.42s)]
*  Like it's essentially one of the entire program. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=1556.42s)]
*  Right. And that's just one thing that we did that people barely even remember internally. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=1559.42s)]
*  I think you mentioned the example of the Yemen bombings. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=1563.42s)]
*  Right. Which yeah. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=1565.42s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, we spent seven billion dollars bombing Yemen since the fall of 2023. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=1567.42s)]
*  Seven billion dollars. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=1573.42s)]
*  And you know, you think about what that could have done, how many kids lives that would have saved around the world. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=1575.42s)]
*  And we didn't even notice the Yemen bombing and it didn't really achieve anything. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=1582.42s)]
*  And, you know, we we could have done so much good with that money. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=1588.42s)]
*  You know, you think about the you know, we can afford a parade and a military parade in Washington, but we can't afford to keep Efinon so alive. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=1593.42s)]
*  Really? Yeah. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=1603.42s)]
*  You're turning me into a bleeding heart live here, Christophe. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=1604.42s)]
*  We're going to get to some democratic stuff at the end. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=1606.42s)]
*  Just a couple of these other pushback arguments really quick. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=1609.42s)]
*  This one is vaguely compelling to I think if you don't really know what's happened around the world, but I understand why this would be a compelling argument to people. [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=1612.42s)]
*  But it's we've been pouring tens of billions of dollars into other countries for many decades and nothing changes. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=1619.42s)]
*  We don't have any results. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=1625.42s)]
*  So, you know, what what? [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=1627.42s)]
*  Obviously, this is not a valuable program. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=1629.42s)]
*  So let me push back. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=1631.42s)]
*  I'd say that the most extraordinary thing happening in the world over the last 50 years has been incredible progress against global poverty. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=1634.42s)]
*  And so, for example, in 1950, 27 percent of children died before the age of five. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=1644.42s)]
*  Now we're down to just under 4 percent of children. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=1652.42s)]
*  It's incredible progress. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=1657.42s)]
*  When I was a kid, a majority of human beings had always been illiterate throughout human history. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=1659.42s)]
*  Now we're pushing 90 percent adult literacy. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=1664.42s)]
*  When I graduated from college. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=1667.42s)]
*  That's about to go back down thanks to AI and TikTok. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=1668.42s)]
*  But, you know, we're doing the we're doing all right. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=1671.42s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=1673.42s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=1674.42s)]
*  You know it. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=1675.42s)]
*  I made my first trip through Africa in 1982 and just comparison today in terms of less leprosy, less river blindness, less extreme poverty, fewer people dying of malaria. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=1677.42s)]
*  It's just staggering. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=1695.42s)]
*  The last pushback you got, which it was like reminded me of my new the new liberal cultural milieu I'm swimming in now because I didn't hear this argument before from very many people. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=1696.42s)]
*  But it's the de-groather, the lefty de-groather argument, which was essentially as you put it, providing food aid may seem merciful, but it's just going to lead to population increases and more people starving down the road. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=1708.42s)]
*  We need family planning and fewer children in Africa. [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=1720.42s)]
*  I'm like I could not like that. [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=1724.42s)]
*  I'm physically repulsed by that. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=1726.42s)]
*  But I understand that people at Mavit. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=1728.42s)]
*  So I wonder, I would like to hear what you think of that. [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=1730.42s)]
*  So I mean, that's very much a Thomas Malthus argument that and it's wrong. [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=1733.42s)]
*  So the reason people have a lot of children is because they think that there are many children will die. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=1741.42s)]
*  And so if you help keep those kids alive, they have fewer children and you see that around the world. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=1750.42s)]
*  I mean, India used to be the kind of the center of the Malthusian nightmares. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=1755.42s)]
*  And now the average, the total fertility rate that the number of women, Indian women will have over her lifetime is 2.0. [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=1762.42s)]
*  That's less than replacement level, which is 2.1. [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=1771.42s)]
*  And so, you know, absolutely we need to support family planning and give women control over the number of children they will have. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=1775.42s)]
*  There are 300 million women worldwide who need support with modern family planning and we can help them with that. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=1785.42s)]
*  But that should not come at the expense of keeping their babies alive. [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=1792.42s)]
*  I mean, that's just grotesque. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=1797.42s)]
*  Indeed. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=1799.42s)]
*  OK, I want to go to El Salvador. [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=1801.42s)]
*  It's just the worst horror that we're inflicting on people, I think, in this administration. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=1805.42s)]
*  It's competitive category. But you wrote about El Salvador, but you started the story, started the column with a story about your father who had been disappeared. [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=1811.42s)]
*  And and how he was eventually released thanks to the advocacy of a French diplomat, Robert Morrissey. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=1822.42s)]
*  Morrissey, yeah. [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=1830.42s)]
*  And you talked about how the lesson of that. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=1831.42s)]
*  So maybe just share that story a little bit. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=1834.42s)]
*  So my dad's family, they were Armenians in Eastern Europe and they spied on the Nazis during World War II. [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=1836.42s)]
*  They got caught. [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=1848.42s)]
*  Some of the family members were killed by the Nazis. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=1850.42s)]
*  Others were executed by the Soviets. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=1855.42s)]
*  My dad fled and was in a concentration camp in Yugoslavia. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=1858.42s)]
*  And then this French diplomat, Robert Morrissey, who had nothing to gain. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=1863.42s)]
*  It wasn't really his job to worry about. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=1871.42s)]
*  My dad was a Romanian citizen, about Romanians and Yugoslavian prison camps. [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=1873.42s)]
*  But he did. And my dad was spared. [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=1878.42s)]
*  Then my dad got to France and then a Presbyterian church in Portland, Oregon, sponsors a way to come to the US. [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=1882.42s)]
*  It wasn't clear my dad was going to get a visa. [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=1894.42s)]
*  And two French journalists spoke up for my dad and he was able to get the visa. [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=1899.42s)]
*  Should journalists really be suggesting to an American ambassador to give somebody a visa? [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=1904.42s)]
*  Not clear. But I exist because all these people did things that were kind of at the edge. [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=1909.42s)]
*  So I contrast that compassion and empathy that was directed at my dad that was completely transformative. [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=1915.42s)]
*  I don't know what the opposite of empathy is, but just the gratuitous cruelty that has been directed at so many people today, [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=1926.42s)]
*  whether it's AIDS orphans in South Sudan, whether it's immigrants here. [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=1939.42s)]
*  And absolutely we need to control our borders. [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=1944.42s)]
*  Absolutely there are difficult trade-offs that need to be made. [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=1948.42s)]
*  But just grabbing people off the street and shipping them to a brutal prison in El Salvador, [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=1951.42s)]
*  I mean, that's just going out of your way to be cruel and heartless. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=1959.42s)]
*  Yeah, merciless. It's horrific what they're doing. [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=1964.42s)]
*  And I appreciated the story because it spoke to the element of, [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=1968.42s)]
*  I think that sometimes there's a hopelessness that people feel about this sort of thing. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=1976.42s)]
*  Okay, well, this is just not something that is resolvable at this point. [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=1981.42s)]
*  They can have legal remedies and all that. But the story shows that it's not quite right. [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=1987.42s)]
*  By drawing attention to this sort of stuff, by pressuring them, [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=1992.42s)]
*  despite the fact that many of the people executing this policy are cruel and depraved and kind of heartless [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=1997.42s)]
*  and don't really care that much about the lives of the Venezuelans that have been sent to El Salvador, [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=2004.42s)]
*  they still don't like negative PR. [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=2008.42s)]
*  And Bukele is still going to have to deal with the world after Trump. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=2011.42s)]
*  That'll happen at some point, right? There are contingencies. There are ways to do this. [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=2015.42s)]
*  And the story of your dad, I think, highlights... [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=2020.42s)]
*  To me, I read it as like bucking people up to try and not to have a learned helplessness. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=2023.42s)]
*  You know, one thing I often hear from people is that the problems are so vast [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=2029.42s)]
*  that anything I do is only going to be a drop in the bucket. [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=2036.42s)]
*  And, you know, in a sense, that is true. [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=2039.42s)]
*  There are so many... there are close to five million kids a year who die somewhere around the world under the age of five. [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=2041.42s)]
*  And, you know, that's heartbreak. We're not going to solve that. [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=2049.42s)]
*  But it is pretty easy to save some of those lives really cheaply. [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=2052.42s)]
*  And yes, that's a drop in the bucket in a sense. [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=2058.42s)]
*  But, you know, my dad was a drop in the bucket. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=2061.42s)]
*  And Robert Porosette, you know, he changed a drop in the bucket in the form of my dad [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=2063.42s)]
*  in the First Vestagerian Church in Portland, Oregon, did the same. [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=2069.42s)]
*  And I exist because of those drops in the bucket. [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=2073.42s)]
*  You know, drops in the bucket, that is how you fill buckets. [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=2076.42s)]
*  And it doesn't, you know, change the overall trend. [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=2078.42s)]
*  But boy, it's meaningful and it's powerful to save individual lives and transform those trajectories. [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=2086.42s)]
*  So do you have any thoughts on edge case examples of what people could do about the El Salvador situation in particular? [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=2094.42s)]
*  And when I talk to democratic politicians, part of me is like, shouldn't Democrats and European countries [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=2100.42s)]
*  and stuff start to threaten El Salvador and, you know, say that you're going to be treated like Venezuela and North Korea if you continue this? [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=2106.42s)]
*  I don't know. Are there other do you have any other thoughts on dealing with the disappearings? [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=2112.42s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I think that Bukele is he cares about his image. [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=2118.42s)]
*  He puts a great deal of emphasis on his image. [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=2121.42s)]
*  He's very popular within El Salvador because while he's been brutal, [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=2125.42s)]
*  he has also vastly improved the security situation. [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=2131.42s)]
*  Yeah, quality of life is improved in El Salvador. [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=2135.42s)]
*  Yeah. And so but he cares about his image. [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=2137.42s)]
*  If you're not wrongly jailed into the Robocop prison, for everybody else, the quality of life is improved. [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=2141.42s)]
*  And so, you know, I think by the power of embarrassing leaders like that, I think that really counts. [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=2147.42s)]
*  And I, you know, I've seen how when you write letters about a political prisoner, then, you know, sometimes they don't do any good. [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=2158.42s)]
*  Miraculously, sometimes they do lead somebody to be released. [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=2170.42s)]
*  Kim Dae-jung was a South Korean dissident. [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=2175.42s)]
*  He was almost executed and he was a thorn in the side of the South Korean officials. [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=2179.42s)]
*  But they did spare his life under pressure. [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=2187.42s)]
*  They eventually released him under pressure. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=2192.42s)]
*  And then I watched as he became South Korea's president. [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=2194.42s)]
*  You know, one can there are vulnerabilities. [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=2199.42s)]
*  One can imperfectly have real effect on improving human rights. [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=2202.42s)]
*  All right. Let's talk about the Democrats for a second. [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=2208.42s)]
*  You thought you thought about leaving your perch as a scribe and farmer and to to run for office in there in Oregon. [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=2210.42s)]
*  I didn't I didn't take off for a variety of reasons, but just through that experience. [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=2218.42s)]
*  And since that happened, obviously, Trump is one again. [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=2223.42s)]
*  Like, what's your assessment of like, what do you think you had to offer? [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=2226.42s)]
*  What's your assessment of what the Democratic Party is not offering right now? [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=2230.42s)]
*  What are the gaps in your in your estimation? [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=2234.42s)]
*  So I guess I'd mention a couple of gaps. [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=2238.42s)]
*  And, you know, certainly there are many Democrats who are very aware of this. [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=2241.42s)]
*  I'm not bringing something dramatically new to the picture, but I'm very aware of the challenges in working class America, [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=2245.42s)]
*  partly because my hometown here, Yammil, Oregon, is very much a working class community. [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=2254.42s)]
*  And the traditional employers were agriculture, timber and light manufacturing. [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=2261.42s)]
*  Those jobs went away and meth arrived. [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=2267.42s)]
*  And at this point, more than a third of the kids on my old school bus are gone from drugs, alcohol and suicide. [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=2271.42s)]
*  And it has been devastating to watch. [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=2279.42s)]
*  And people feel betrayed by what they perceive as elites. [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=2282.42s)]
*  And they have a point. [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=2288.42s)]
*  They you know, we we've lost more than a million people since 2000 through overdoses. [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=2290.42s)]
*  And we have not had a policy that is remotely as serious as that problem. [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=2298.42s)]
*  I think there is a problem with condescension toward working class Americans. [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=2306.42s)]
*  And so I, you know, I would like to see some some Democrats are good at, you know, not talking down. [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=2311.42s)]
*  You know, Robert Kennedy, the they're not not R.F.K. Junior, but the the original him. [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=2319.42s)]
*  He was brilliant at despite his privileged background at really listening to and communicating with working class Americans. [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=2324.42s)]
*  And you have Marie Gluz and Camp Perez out there in Washington, Oregon, but the Pacific Northwest, right across the border. [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=2333.42s)]
*  Kind of jump your jump to your mind. [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=2338.42s)]
*  Totally, totally. [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=2340.42s)]
*  You know, it's it's talking about, you know, not so much about these 30,000 foot levels about democracy is talking about just the daily issues that people are struggling with. [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=2341.42s)]
*  And and so I think the Democrats have to do a better job of that. [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=2353.42s)]
*  And also, we just have to do a better job fixing our blue parts of the country. [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=2359.42s)]
*  And that's particularly true in the West Coast. [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=2364.42s)]
*  And, you know, these days in Chicago, we are great at saying that, you know, housing is a human right. [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=2366.42s)]
*  But we do a really bad job of addressing homelessness on the West Coast, California and Oregon in particular. [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=2374.42s)]
*  And we, you know, we deeply believe in education. [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=2381.42s)]
*  And yet education outcomes in Oregon, for example, are near the bottom of the country. [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=2386.42s)]
*  And, you know, we've got to do a better job addressing the governance in our own places, partly because we care about governance and partly because we unfortunately become a talking point for Republicans in Wisconsin, Ohio, Georgia, et cetera. [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=2393.42s)]
*  When we screw up. [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=2413.42s)]
*  How you mentioned the housing thing, I think about Oregon, there's this map, a I put out this map was like a county map of where there's housing shortages is throughout the country. [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=2415.42s)]
*  And, you know, it's and it's like most of Oregon is on the map, like towards the higher end, like 10% housing shortage significant. [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=2425.42s)]
*  I wonder how much that is running into environmentalism. [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=2434.42s)]
*  Do you think we did the Malthusian stuff earlier? [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=2437.42s)]
*  Is that the issue or is it red tape stuff or is it lack of like what do you attribute that to? [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=2439.42s)]
*  So my read I've been persuaded by the evidence that it's basically that we're not producing enough housing and that as a result, housing is expensive. [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=2446.42s)]
*  When people have looked at does homelessness correlate to addiction? [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=2458.42s)]
*  Does it correlate to poverty? [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=2463.42s)]
*  No, what really correlates to is high rents and and and difficulty in producing new housing housing shortages. [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=2465.42s)]
*  So why Oregon's producing in San Francisco? [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=2474.42s)]
*  I get it. You have limited land and all that. [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=2477.42s)]
*  Like Oregon's got plenty of space. [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=2479.42s)]
*  It's not like Oregon's overcrowded. [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=2481.42s)]
*  Why isn't Oregon building enough housing? [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=2482.42s)]
*  So it has been in many ways an issue of regulation. [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=2484.42s)]
*  We are very proud of our land use laws, which we pioneered in the 1970s and they have preserved wild spaces. [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=2489.42s)]
*  We don't have a big sprawl problem in Oregon, but it is a lot more costly to put up new housing in Oregon. [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=2497.42s)]
*  So Vancouver, Washington, just right across the border from Portland and an average home in Vancouver on the Vancouver side is about $100,000 less than a similar home on the Portland side. [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=2508.42s)]
*  And rents, you know, people, I think people associate addiction with homelessness because obviously you look out in the street and those who who are struggling tend to be those with mental health problems with addiction. [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=2523.42s)]
*  And that's all real. [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=2536.42s)]
*  But partly it's simply a, you know, if you don't have enough housing, the people who aren't competent enough to get it and don't have the money to get it are those, you know, with various other problems. [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=2537.42s)]
*  And so, you know, we focused very much on preventing evictions. [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=2548.42s)]
*  But if you're short 170,000 housing units, then that's the basic structural problem. [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=2554.42s)]
*  And just things like making it easier to have basement apartments, to have rooming houses. [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=2561.42s)]
*  We used to have solutions to homelessness like trailer parks and and rooming houses, boarding houses. [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=2566.42s)]
*  And then we zoned them out of the way and got rid of them. [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=2573.42s)]
*  All right. Well, it's been good. What is what is being the general manager of a farm mean? [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=2577.42s)]
*  Are you out there picking grapes or what were this morning before you came on? [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=2581.42s)]
*  Where you was your hands in the dirt this morning? [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=2585.42s)]
*  Before I came on, I ran through the vineyard. I'm not sure if that counts. [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=2588.42s)]
*  My morning run is around there. [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=2591.42s)]
*  So this is the family farm where I grew up. [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=2594.42s)]
*  I mean, actually, right now I'm in the house where I grew up. [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=2597.42s)]
*  And we know part of it was we were just trying to my wife and I were trying to figure out how we could address some of the problems that I was writing about this lack of good jobs in the area. [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=2601.42s)]
*  And so we think our role is principally advocacy. [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=2614.42s)]
*  But we thought, well, you know, if we can we used to have a cherry orchard, if we can maybe do something that adds a little more agricultural value, then that'll be good for the community. [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=2617.42s)]
*  Maybe help with some tourism. [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=2626.42s)]
*  And so we got the kids to pledge their commitment. [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=2628.42s)]
*  And then so we started this family wine and cider business. [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=2632.42s)]
*  And everything that could grow could go wrong. [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=2637.42s)]
*  Did you know, we we put a impregnable deer fence around our vineyard and an apple orchard. [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=2640.42s)]
*  And then after we'd finished it, enormous expense and trouble, it turned out that we had imprisoned some deer inside our impregnable deer fence with nothing to eat, grapevines and an apple trees. [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=2647.42s)]
*  And plenty has gone wrong, but we have managed to reduce, I think, some well, some award winning cider, some wines that have very much impressed the wine critics. [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=2660.42s)]
*  And it's and I've got to say that sounds like the answer is and some jobs because you're not out there picking the grapes and some jobs. [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=2676.42s)]
*  And, you know, and it's been good for me, I think, also because as a liberal columnist, I rarely meet a regulation I don't like. [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=2685.42s)]
*  And all of a sudden, as a small business owner, I'm regularly outraged at this for that effort to regulate me. [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=2693.42s)]
*  And so it's, you know, it's good to see the world through a different prism sometimes. [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=2698.42s)]
*  And if people want to if they want some great Chardonnay, Rosé, or Pinot Noir, they should check out ChristopheBarms.com. [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=2702.42s)]
*  All right. Well, I've got to radicalizing you to the cutting red tape neoliberal abundance agenda. [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=2710.42s)]
*  All right. Last thing, you know, since you're there, people are like, what groups are still doing good work in Africa that I could donate to or support? [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=2718.42s)]
*  Is there any do you have any suggestions on that front? [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=2728.42s)]
*  Absolutely. So on this trip, the groups I've been suggesting are Hill and Keller International, which does a lot of work on blindness and nutrition. [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=2730.42s)]
*  And they were the ones who were supposed to be who would have distributed this river blindness drug. [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=2740.42s)]
*  And if they can raise enough money, it still will be distributed. [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=2746.42s)]
*  And then so that's one option. I, you know, I mentioned deworming. [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=2750.42s)]
*  There's a group called deworm the world, which very efficiently deworms kids. [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=2757.42s)]
*  And, you know, this is so cheap to do. You can deworm a kid for about a dollar a year. [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=2762.42s)]
*  They stay in school more. They do better. [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=2769.42s)]
*  And the this malnutrition is miracle paste, plumpy nut. [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=2773.42s)]
*  So the two organizations in the U.S. that make it and that can send it abroad, they're both nonprofits. [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=2778.42s)]
*  I recommend one is a DCA nutrition. That's E.D. E.S. I.A. nutrition in Rhode Island. [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=2788.42s)]
*  And there is manna nutrition, M.A. N.A. manna nutrition in Georgia. [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=2795.42s)]
*  And so that's what you know, those are some sort of three great options. [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=2801.42s)]
*  Helen Kellein International deworm the world and either it is here or manna nutrition for this peanut paste. [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=2806.42s)]
*  Great. Well, I will contribute and we'll put the links in the show notes. [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=2814.42s)]
*  And I really appreciate the work you've been doing. And let's stay in touch. [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=2817.42s)]
*  Thank you. I appreciate that. Thanks for the conversation. It was fun. [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=2821.42s)]
*  Thanks so much. We got to get you on pinot noir, though. [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=2824.42s)]
*  Not going to happen, baby. I'm going to try out that Christophe Rosé. [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-em2VqmUMj0&t=2826.42s)]
