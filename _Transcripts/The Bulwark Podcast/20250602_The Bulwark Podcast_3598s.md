Video Description: Mike Johnson and Russ Vought outright lied on camera about the proposed Medicaid cuts and the impact they would have on millions of Americans. Marco Rubio lied about the children who are dying because of USAID cuts. And Joni Ernst is reimagining Christianity to be about Jesus teaching his followers not to care about the sick and the poor because they're going to die anyway. And through it all, Peter Thiel is doing everything in his power not to die. But one saving grace is that Ukraine kicked some Russian ass this weekend. Bill Kristol joins Tim Miller.

# MAGA Loves Evangelicals AND Gay Vampires!? (w/ Bill Kristol)
**The Bulwark Podcast:** [June 02, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg)
*  I do think it's kind of weird that the Maggots have created a coalition that extends from [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=0.0s)]
*  let people die because heaven awaits evangelicals to like atheist gay vampires [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=4.72s)]
*  trying to defeat the linear passage of time. It's pretty broad. It's pretty broad group. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=9.68s)]
*  Hello and welcome to the Bulwark podcast. I'm your host, Tim Miller. It is June 2nd already, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=21.92s)]
*  somehow. It's summer of 2025 and June is when you get fascist hell and it's Monday and so that is [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=27.2s)]
*  why I am here as usual with Bill Kristol. How you doing Bill? Fine, Tim. How are you? [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=33.92s)]
*  I'm doing pretty darn well. We had just a wonderful week of events. It was great to see everybody [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=40.16s)]
*  last week in Nashville and Chicago. I was a little weary but I got a day of rest yesterday [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=45.04s)]
*  and so life is good. We have some good news to start with for once. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=52.32s)]
*  Russia experienced what's been called Russia's Pearl Harbor yesterday. A little brief on what [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=58.480000000000004s)]
*  happened. If people missed it, Ukraine launched an unprecedented drone strike deep inside Russia, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=64.48s)]
*  targeting dozens of strategic bombers at several different bases. They launched 117 attack drones [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=69.44s)]
*  from trucks that had been covertly placed near Russian air bases as far as Siberia. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=78.32s)]
*  Around 40 Russian military planes were reportedly hit. As Zelensky said, 34% [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=84.08s)]
*  of Russian strategic bombers were hit and they were supposed to have another [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=89.19999999999999s)]
*  in the so-called peace talks in Istanbul today and Zelensky had announced that like Putin, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=94.47999999999999s)]
*  he's sending his flunkies this time as well. So a change in momentum, if you will, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=99.6s)]
*  what has happened in there? I don't know what your reaction was and what you're hearing from folks. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=105.52s)]
*  I was excited and pleased and awfully impressed by the military capabilities of the Ukrainians, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=110.32s)]
*  but also not just military but intelligence and covert. A lot of this was, I guess this [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=116.8s)]
*  was a year and a half long planned operation, getting the truck into place and all that [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=124.16s)]
*  coordination of it. It's really something impressive and heartening. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=129.52s)]
*  Generally, I was saying this to someone just over the weekend here in New York. I'm very [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=135.12s)]
*  worried about Ukraine. I wish we had an administration that supported it. Obviously, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=139.44s)]
*  it's terrible and it's great that Trump isn't doing so. In the end, if you told me on January [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=143.28s)]
*  20th what it looked as if Trump was just going to go all in for Putin and the Europeans might [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=149.28s)]
*  not step up and there might be an actual catastrophe on the front in Ukraine. If you [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=154.8s)]
*  told me that we would be where we are now here on June 2nd, I would be a little surprised, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=161.68s)]
*  pleasantly surprised. I think they're up there. Turns out they've been underestimated all along, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=166.48000000000002s)]
*  the Ukrainians. They continue to be underestimated. We are doing at least the intelligence cooperation [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=172.08s)]
*  still. There's some arms flowing. Europeans have stepped up more, but mostly the Ukrainians. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=177.44s)]
*  All honor to the Ukrainians who are fighting this underdog fight with such [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=182.0s)]
*  courage and resiliency, but also with intelligence and ability. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=186.88000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, that was a funny David Fromm tweet yesterday. It was like, pretty soon Europe's [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=193.76000000000002s)]
*  going to have to worry about whether they're going to get Ukrainian security guarantees. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=197.84s)]
*  I guess they did this operation also without telling us, which is also interesting and noteworthy, [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=202.4s)]
*  given the fact that obviously a lot of what was needed in the first few years was like our support [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=208.0s)]
*  was required, particularly on the intelligence side. I think that is also just a positive sign [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=213.44s)]
*  about their capabilities. Maria Avdiva, who I follow, who does security and war updates, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=218.88s)]
*  gave a pretty astonishing blow by blow of what they did. They kind of moved these mobile cabins [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=228.0s)]
*  into Russia and the drones were hidden under the roofs of the cabins, kind of a Trojan horse type [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=235.84s)]
*  situation. Then when the signal hit, all the roofs opened remotely all over Russia. They took out [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=242.08s)]
*  these bombers that Russia can't build anymore. They're kind of old Cold War era bomber planes. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=248.88s)]
*  Obviously, it has the implications as well because we've seen the degree to which they've been [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=256.64s)]
*  pummeling Ukraine in the last week or two. I did a YouTube interview with my guy, [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=261.28s)]
*  Kalin, from Kyiv last week. People can go check out just about the degree of their [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=266.08s)]
*  Russia's attack on Ukraine. It has that positive development as part of it as well. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=270.8s)]
*  If you want to put it in a broader context, I don't want to get into too much wishful thinking. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=277.52s)]
*  God knows the Ukrainians are paying a horrible price and all of us will if Putin continues to [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=282.24s)]
*  be able to fight this war unmolested except for direct Ukrainian counterattacks. We could certainly [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=289.28s)]
*  be doing so much more. Maybe it suggests that the forces of liberal democracy, the forces fighting [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=294.71999999999997s)]
*  against tyranny and against brutality and against invading one's neighbors can be reasonably strong [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=300.47999999999996s)]
*  even if the US sits it out basically. I do think if the US goes full in on the other side, that's [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=308.0s)]
*  just a terrible problem. Maybe there's enough ambiguity in Trump's own mind, enough resistance [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=314.48s)]
*  from some of his administration, maybe from Congress. Not to put too great hopes there [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=321.6s)]
*  either, but a little bit of a sense that he can't go all the way to Putin. Lindsey Graham has AD [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=327.6s)]
*  co-sponsors for this resolution toughening sanctions on Russia. Maybe the forces of [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=332.88s)]
*  liberal democracy and decency can at least hold their own despite the fact that the US is [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=338.72s)]
*  absent from the playing field for the next four years. That would be the hopeful big picture [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=344.72s)]
*  version of what Ukraine is accomplishing. I appreciate that you went there because I had [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=349.68s)]
*  some darker thoughts associated with it, but I agree there's something to what you said. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=354.64000000000004s)]
*  I want to get into the US part of it in a second, but it is pretty alarming to me about the [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=359.52000000000004s)]
*  implications for the future of war. I went from immediately being quite excited as I was deep [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=366.72s)]
*  diving on the various social media threads of military accounts that I follow about how cool [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=372.16s)]
*  this attack was. On the other hand, all credit to Ukraine of course for plotting this and [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=380.72s)]
*  the ingenuity, but it does take us into a whole new world where these retrofitted Chinese drones [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=388.72s)]
*  can just pop over a target. I don't know that we have the seriousness of leadership that might [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=398.47999999999996s)]
*  be required to combat that future. I don't know if you had any of those feelings as well. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=408.0s)]
*  I do. My version of that was reading up a little bit on AI stuff this weekend, [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=414.4s)]
*  which is scary and provides some great opportunities as well obviously in medical [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=420.23999999999995s)]
*  research and other things, but has many scary activities both in terms of war, [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=424.56s)]
*  but also in terms of surveillance and other anti-liberal measures here at home. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=429.12s)]
*  With a serious administration that was center right or center left, honestly I don't know if [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=435.36s)]
*  it would make much difference in this case, that tried to grapple with this new technology in terms [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=439.92s)]
*  of regulations and what to encourage or what to discourage or where to try to create some barriers [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=444.48s)]
*  to trying to getting stuff and other places where it's foolish, you can't do it. We benefit [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=449.76s)]
*  from the trade. Anyway, whatever. A serious administration thinking seriously about this, [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=455.2s)]
*  we could be fine. We're pretty good at adapting to new technology and hopefully taking some of the [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=460.8s)]
*  upsides and minimizing the downsides, but there will always be some downsides. You're right. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=467.44s)]
*  I get back to always three and a half more years, more than three and a half, what is it? Three and [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=473.12s)]
*  two thirds, still more years of Trump and his people in there, Tulsi Gabbard running intelligence [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=477.04s)]
*  and Trump and Hegseth. I mean, it's going to be, it's risky. It's really risky. I mean, that's, [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=482.72s)]
*  I guess what people, I just don't feel like even people on our side are fully appreciated [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=490.88s)]
*  where we could be at the end of 2028. If they just continue on the path, they naturally kind of like [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=494.88s)]
*  to go out, which is both very dangerous and damaging to the country in many ways, but also [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=501.12s)]
*  just so foolish and short-sighted and stupid that one pays the price for that too, right? [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=505.6s)]
*  Yeah. The tail risk is definitely something that I was talking about a lot last year to people, [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=512.5600000000001s)]
*  not effectively enough, I guess. And also just kind of the potential for national suicide for [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=517.84s)]
*  no reason. But to this point about kind of the stupidity of the people that are supposed to be [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=525.28s)]
*  minding the store here. This is an NBC article over the weekend. Tulsi Gabbard is exploring ways [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=532.72s)]
*  to revamp Trump's routine intelligence briefing in order to build his trust in the material [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=538.8000000000001s)]
*  and make it more aligned with how he likes to consume information. That's very delicately put [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=544.08s)]
*  by NBC. They go on, one idea that's been discussed is possibly creating a video version of the [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=550.08s)]
*  presidential daily brief that's made to look and feel like a Fox News broadcast. There are five [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=557.6s)]
*  sources with direct knowledge of the discussions that provided this information to NBC, I think, [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=564.16s)]
*  which shows that there's some alarm on the inside about what kind of material is getting to Donald [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=571.0400000000001s)]
*  Trump. This was not in the NBC story, but kind of a related news item was that maybe last year, [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=577.9200000000001s)]
*  folks don't remember, Marco Pudo wrote for us about Natalie Harp, the human printer, the printer [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=584.72s)]
*  that just prints out random shit for Trump. And I was reading an article about how she has been, [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=588.96s)]
*  part of how Laura Loomer has been getting her info to Trump is that Natalie prints out her tweets [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=594.32s)]
*  and puts them on Trump's desk. And he can't read the presidential daily brief because that's too [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=600.8000000000001s)]
*  long and they're big words, but he can read 280 characters from Laura Loomer. So I don't know how [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=606.5600000000001s)]
*  much there's to say about this, but in contrast to the Ukrainian ingenuity, Donald Trump needing a [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=613.76s)]
*  security briefing via Fox and Friends is a little alarming. It's terrible. I mean, I gather since my [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=619.76s)]
*  day, the PDB, the presidential briefs and all the other intelligence documents, of course, incorporate [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=625.76s)]
*  video. That's not the issue. We incorporate video and the work as we're here, right? I mean, [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=630.08s)]
*  obviously, that's fine. It's the kind of dressing it up as a fake Fox News broadcast, because that's [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=638.0s)]
*  the only way Trump will assimilate it. It's pretty, it's not great. We have some characters [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=643.12s)]
*  from Fox News. Well, some pundits. Laura Ingram's like the ambiguously gay sidekick, whatever that [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=650.48s)]
*  guy's name with the painted on hair. You got to get him in there. Maybe Greg Gutfeld, you need a [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=658.5600000000001s)]
*  little bit of a comedic relief. I think that's going to be important that you have people playing [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=663.68s)]
*  roles. Remember when Tom Nichols got to be a character on Succession? He was a pundit on [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=670.8s)]
*  Succession. So you have one of those situations. You have a bad guy character, somebody for Trump [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=676.0s)]
*  to be like, oh, whatever that person says, I'm a no on that. They're never Trump. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=682.16s)]
*  I think I'm looking at that guy. I think you have a great future there. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=686.16s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know. Maybe you, Bill. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=689.3599999999999s)]
*  Maybe me. Maybe I'm worse generation. Maybe me and his PDB. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=690.8s)]
*  We're going to negatively polarize Trump into making the right decision by putting a fake [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=693.68s)]
*  pundit on Fox that he doesn't like to tell him to do the other thing. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=697.52s)]
*  Yeah, we have to be careful what we say, right? I guess. Oh my God. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=700.96s)]
*  All right. Well, you can at least laugh at it. You on Sunday, the Crystal Sunday Conversations, [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=706.96s)]
*  which I recommend, you had Jonathan Cohn, our colleague on yesterday, to talk about kind of a [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=713.36s)]
*  wide range of things in the health space and what's happening with HHS, what's happening on the Hill, [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=720.16s)]
*  the Medicaid cuts. What struck you most from that combo? [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=726.88s)]
*  You know, the beneath the goofiness of RFK and the people around RFK. I mean, there's real [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=731.36s)]
*  damage being done both right now in terms of what vaccines are being recommended in terms of the [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=737.52s)]
*  near and medium term future, in terms of the cuts to Medicaid or spillover into Medicare, [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=743.28s)]
*  into health care more broadly. And then really in terms of the medium and long term future, [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=748.96s)]
*  in terms of vaccine development, for example, it's like, it's not just if you don't approve this [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=753.36s)]
*  vaccine or don't approve that one for the rough, certain people, or you send weird mixed signals [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=757.76s)]
*  on vaccines, vaccine makers, tend to then make some decisions, vaccine producers, rather, you know, [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=762.0s)]
*  will make some decisions about where to, what vaccines to produce, will there be a steady market [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=767.6s)]
*  for them? Can they sell, is the U.S. the right place to be the base for doing them? Maybe they [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=772.4s)]
*  should do more abroad. And then of course, you put it together with all the craziness about the [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=777.6s)]
*  universities and the immigration stuff. And you really have a, I was talking to someone about [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=782.72s)]
*  this last night who knows that world pretty well here in New York, actually. I mean, [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=787.6s)]
*  you have real damage being done to our future, I mean, to our medical future, to our future [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=792.64s)]
*  in innovation and technology, to our competitive future. I mean, it's really, is there a single [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=798.24s)]
*  complex of policies, universities, immigration, RFK Junior in charge of health, the Medicaid cuts, [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=805.36s)]
*  the health care cuts in general, that does more, is there a better, is there a stronger case of [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=812.24s)]
*  self-inflicted damage to the future of this country? And it's all unambiguous, incidentally. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=817.92s)]
*  Like, there's no downside to having the most professional and treatment of vaccines possible [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=822.24s)]
*  and the best scientific and medical knowledge. There's no downside to having more and more people [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=829.6s)]
*  come and study here and participate in scientific and medical progress and also just medical, [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=834.16s)]
*  providing medical care for people. There's no downside to what we've been doing, honestly, [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=840.4799999999999s)]
*  with the universities in terms of biomedical research and leading the world for 40, 50 years. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=845.5999999999999s)]
*  It's not as if this, sometimes policy areas, as you well know, have trade-offs and this kind of like, [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=850.64s)]
*  oh, it's a little bit of a tough call and maybe we, government's expanded too much here and stuff. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=855.68s)]
*  This is like one of the least ambiguous policy areas, broadly speaking, I think, [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=859.76s)]
*  that one could think of. And we're doing what we can to damage ourselves, I think. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=864.64s)]
*  I can even steel manning their side. They don't even really present a downside. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=870.3199999999999s)]
*  I like the only thing I can think of. And unfortunately, I've followed an increasing [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=876.0799999999999s)]
*  number of Maha accounts. So I feel like I know what their arguments are. Like, there's the attack [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=882.3199999999999s)]
*  on the gain of function research that's happening in China. This idea that there's some risky type [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=887.8399999999999s)]
*  of research that led to conceivably the lab leak of COVID. And so, but that's like a very narrow [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=892.3199999999999s)]
*  thing, right? That's like, who we look into, is there a very specific type of research that [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=899.76s)]
*  maybe the risks outweigh the benefits, right? On the university research here in America, [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=904.9599999999999s)]
*  they haven't even presented anything like that. The argument is essentially, we don't like [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=912.9599999999999s)]
*  how the university's handled campus protesters. And so we're going to punish their research arm. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=921.3599999999999s)]
*  Right? Like, it's not as if there's, and I guess there's some argument maybe about waste, [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=927.52s)]
*  like some of this stuff is being wasted. But I mean, that is just like, the number is so tiny [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=931.68s)]
*  compared to the budget. It's hard to take that seriously when they're, you know, gonna just [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=937.36s)]
*  explode the deficit with their bill. So it's like, they're not, they don't even, right? Am I wrong? [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=943.52s)]
*  What does what does what Cohn and others say about that? [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=947.84s)]
*  No, I think he would agree. The conventional when I was in actually the George H.W. Bush [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=950.56s)]
*  White House, Vice President Quiro was in charge of something called the Competitors' Council. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=955.76s)]
*  One of the things we tried to do was speed up the approval of drugs to sort of make the whole NIH, [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=959.36s)]
*  CDC, FDA process, which is a complicated process, but important, obviously, you want safe drugs and [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=965.92s)]
*  drugs that are effective, as promised and so forth. But to speed that up and to streamline it a bit, [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=971.84s)]
*  I guess, that was a more traditional conservative critique of big liberal bureaucracies, or just big [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=979.52s)]
*  bureaucracy, let's just say. And it was a reasonable one at the time. But I think we did a fair amount. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=985.52s)]
*  It was kind of a technocratic critique, right? Like Obama administration had an effort to do. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=990.0s)]
*  Right. And people like us pointed out, and I think people pointed this out both on the left and the [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=994.3199999999999s)]
*  right, and this is very much of a case where you could have a centrist agenda going forward that [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=999.12s)]
*  would be quite, you know, healthy, that, you know, why is it that we suspend a lot of these [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=1002.88s)]
*  regulations where we really have an emergency and want to produce drugs, whether for the pandemic [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=1007.92s)]
*  or for AIDS. I mean, that would suggest that now, you don't want to suspend, maybe you do need, [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=1012.08s)]
*  you're not going to act like everything's a super emergency. And so you're going to have some [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=1016.5600000000001s)]
*  more standard procedures, but maybe you do want to look at your standard procedures and make them a [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=1020.64s)]
*  little friendlier to the new drugs, even if they're unusual or haven't, you know, but gone through [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=1024.08s)]
*  22 years of, you know, controlled trials and so forth. So that's all a reasonable debate to have. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=1030.4s)]
*  And if we had a healthy politics, we would have it. I guess I do, I don't know how much Biden, [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=1035.8400000000001s)]
*  they've done a lot of this behind the scenes. You have responsible people running, I think, [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=1040.56s)]
*  these agencies. I do think it was, it just is a political point, but I've just been sort of [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=1044.6399999999999s)]
*  stewing over it recently. The Biden administration's failure to explain, even when it was doing probably [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=1049.28s)]
*  some good things, to explain those good things caused huge damage. It made it seem like the [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=1053.76s)]
*  alternative was status quo, big government bureaucracy, no one in charge, no one reforming [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=1058.48s)]
*  anything or Trump. Now, for all I know, Ashish Shah, who I know actually somewhat who's been on [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=1065.2s)]
*  some conversations with me, and I think maybe on some stuff with you, and he was a dean at Brown, [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=1071.3600000000001s)]
*  and then he went into the Biden administration to run the efforts against the pandemic. He's a smart, [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=1075.8400000000001s)]
*  I talked to him, I mean, he is in favor of reforming certain things, you know, and so [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=1081.04s)]
*  we're most intelligent people in this area. And for all I know, he did, sadly, but the fact that [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=1084.32s)]
*  I, I mean, maybe I should have followed this more closely, but the fact that I have to say for all I [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=1090.0s)]
*  know is, I think, an indictment of the Biden administration and its communications people, [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=1093.52s)]
*  but also the broader effort on the pro-Biden Democratic side over the last four years. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=1101.2s)]
*  The reform agenda just got lost in the kind of returning to normalcy agenda, which was a [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=1108.8s)]
*  reasonable agenda, especially for the first little while. But anyway, that's obvious. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=1113.84s)]
*  Is there, just one more thing, was there anything specific, I know that Cohn talked about or wrote [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=1120.32s)]
*  for us about the cancellation of this bird flu vaccine and how that is like a very great risk? [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=1124.9599999999998s)]
*  I don't know, was there anything else specific or was there anything else? [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=1131.04s)]
*  So I think both the cancellation of that research and then also the kind of totally [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=1133.76s)]
*  wobbly and inconsistent guidance last week on COVID, on the COVID shot for pregnant women, [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=1138.0s)]
*  yes or no, and that's dangerous, obviously, in some way. But the cancellation, just on that one, [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=1144.1599999999999s)]
*  I think people, if they want to watch that discussion, I had with Jonathan, it would be [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=1149.2s)]
*  very interesting. What was being funded was, in effect, Moderna, which was the key in developing [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=1152.72s)]
*  mRNA, the pandemic, the COVID vaccine, is trying to set up a platform to use mRNA, I don't even [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=1158.32s)]
*  understand this well enough to say the words right, research or production, you know, for many other [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=1167.92s)]
*  vaccines. And that's very promising, just as, in fact, they got a COVID vaccine was faster than [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=1172.32s)]
*  they thought. They might be able to get a lot of other vaccines that work much faster than one [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=1177.2s)]
*  would have thought, thanks to mRNA. And that's what Moderna wanted to research. So they cancelled [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=1181.04s)]
*  the program that was, Kennedy could have still said, hey, look, we're going to do this program [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=1186.64s)]
*  so we can really see what we could do. Now, we're not going to approve these drugs without [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=1191.04s)]
*  extremely careful, these vaccines without extremely careful tests. And I don't think [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=1194.88s)]
*  the tests have been careful enough in the past. And we're going to have twice as many tests and [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=1199.28s)]
*  be super alert to all side effects, all the kind of Kennedy stuff, most of which is nonsense. But [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=1202.72s)]
*  still, he could have done some of that, you know what I mean? And still gone ahead with this funding, [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=1207.2s)]
*  this platform, as I understand it, would provide for very fruitful research. At one point, [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=1212.56s)]
*  Jonathan made is, you know, if we don't fund it, others will. And one of the others that will is [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=1218.16s)]
*  China. And do we want to be in a position in five or 10 years when there's a bird flu outbreak, [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=1221.76s)]
*  and there's very, very promising mRNA vaccines, and China has them, we don't. We have to ask China, [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=1226.88s)]
*  hey, could we have some of those vaccines? You know, we got vaccines. We're the ones with the [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=1234.0800000000002s)]
*  shitty ones. Exactly. You're right. Right. We were so, you know, we're so used to being kind of number [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=1237.44s)]
*  one, in a way that getting treated well as a word by our allies, and some degree by the world, [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=1243.1200000000001s)]
*  that we took it for granted that we would get the vaccines when they were developed, [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=1249.68s)]
*  in January of 2021. We a lot of them were developed, not developed in the US, [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=1252.8s)]
*  literally not produced in the US, a lot of them were produced in Europe for various [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=1257.9199999999998s)]
*  random reasons, where the drug companies had facilities and so forth. But everyone understood, [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=1260.96s)]
*  look, we were going to get a very good chunk of them at first, and other countries did too. And [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=1265.84s)]
*  it seemed like it was distributed pretty fairly. But do we want to be in a position five or 10 [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=1270.48s)]
*  years from now when a our European allies, of course, aren't very feeling terribly well [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=1275.36s)]
*  disposed to us because we're seeking to be picking fights with them all the time. And they're [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=1279.12s)]
*  thinking, you know what, I love, we love the people, good people of the US, but we'll just [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=1282.3999999999999s)]
*  make sure that every single person here in the EU gets the vaccines first. And especially, do you [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=1285.6s)]
*  want to be dependent on China? So I think that the kind of, again, the way in which we're just [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=1292.1599999999999s)]
*  hurting ourselves for the future, totally pointlessly, is what's striking. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=1295.76s)]
*  Jonathan Cohen's newsletter is so good, by the way. Go to thebullwork.com and check out the [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=1301.9199999999998s)]
*  breakdown. It's been a really important ad for us as he kind of digs deep into policy stuff. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=1306.24s)]
*  He's particularly strong in the health area, but we've got a bunch of other policy things. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=1310.96s)]
*  Are you sick of drinking your calories or waking up hungover, or, you know, looking for something [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=1318.56s)]
*  to have that would spice up a little afternoon hangout with friends, but that isn't going to [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=1324.64s)]
*  leave you feeling yucky the next day? I would turn to Seoul with their out of office gummies, [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=1330.08s)]
*  and out of office beverages. Hey, for example, was hanging out with some other parents yesterday, [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=1336.08s)]
*  it's a little Sunday afternoon. You know, I don't know, Sunday afternoon, not really in the market [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=1341.9199999999998s)]
*  for drinking. We got a big week ahead of us. So turn to the Seoul out of office beverages. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=1347.12s)]
*  They're light, they've got, they're bubbly. It's like having a little bubbly water, a little fizzy. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=1353.84s)]
*  Yeah, it's adding to the enjoyment of a beautiful Sunday afternoon here in New Orleans. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=1360.8s)]
*  Seoul is a wellness brand. Seoul's a wellness brand that believes feeling good should be fun and easy. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=1365.28s)]
*  They specialize in hemp drive THC and CBD products designed to boost your mood and help you unwind. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=1369.84s)]
*  They're best selling out of office gummies. We're designed to provide a mild relaxing buzz, [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=1375.44s)]

*  you know, for the real ones out there, there's also a perfect buzz, noticeable high or a fully [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=1390.16s)]

*  Bring on the good vibes and treat yourself to Seoul today. Right now, Seoul is offering my audience [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=1406.5600000000002s)]

*  Somebody who's not that strong on healthcare policy is Senator Joni Ernst, a Republican from [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=1454.88s)]
*  Iowa. You like that transition? She taped a psychotic selfie video in a cemetery [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=1459.44s)]
*  that mocks the people who were upset with her previous comment during a town hall that everyone's [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=1469.92s)]
*  going to die, so we shouldn't worry that much about the Medicaid cuts. I want to play part of [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=1476.24s)]
*  the audio of that selfie video for our listeners' audio pleasure. I made an incorrect assumption [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=1480.96s)]
*  that everyone in the auditorium understood that yes, we are all going to perish from this earth, [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=1491.5200000000002s)]
*  so I apologize, and I'm really, really glad that I did not have to bring up the subject [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=1502.16s)]
*  of the tooth fairy as well. But for those that would like to see [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=1510.0s)]
*  eternal and everlasting life, I encourage you to embrace my Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=1516.72s)]
*  I mean, yeah, if you're in a hole, stop digging and all that. I guess not in her case. I mean, [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=1527.36s)]
*  when I first saw— In a cemetery, you can keep digging. You want to go six feet under? [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=1532.24s)]
*  When I first saw—maybe it was your tweet, honestly, that said, oh my God, she's now doing [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=1535.84s)]
*  an audio from a cemetery to kind of where she's kind of not really apologizing, but almost making [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=1540.32s)]
*  fun of people who thought her earlier comments were a little insensitive. And she's doubling [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=1545.04s)]
*  down. I thought, well, it's kind of tasteless actually to make jokes about a cemetery. I mean, [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=1550.24s)]
*  I assumed she was just done a video from her office, you know? And someone was saying it's [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=1556.48s)]
*  from a cemetery. But in fact, it's literally— I guess it is, right? I mean, a cemetery— [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=1561.52s)]
*  Yeah, no, she's walking through a cemetery taping this video. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=1566.6399999999999s)]
*  And that's unbelievable. The tooth fairy—how does the tooth fairy come into this? [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=1569.76s)]
*  It's confusing. I think what she's trying to say is that people, like grownups, understand that [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=1573.92s)]
*  eventually they die and they understand that the tooth fairy is not real. But the metaphor doesn't [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=1580.72s)]
*  really work, you know? Because she was trying to say to people that they need to come to terms [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=1585.68s)]
*  with something that does happen. And I guess she's trying to say that's similar to being aware about [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=1593.28s)]
*  something that doesn't exist. It's pretty strange. [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=1600.0s)]
*  Pretty strange. Tooth fairy is not really—it's a nice little thing about teeth, not about death. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=1602.08s)]
*  I mean, it's a little weird. I was just discussing the tooth fairy the other day with one of our [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=1607.12s)]
*  granddaughters actually. Yeah, I'm glad the tooth fairy is going strong here. I kind of would have [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=1612.08s)]
*  thought this is an issue, right? The 21st—I know you would know about it, I suppose. Like you think [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=1616.8s)]
*  quarter way through the 21st century—I'm not saying this critically. I'm just sort of [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=1621.44s)]
*  struck that maybe it's one of those things that would have been big in 1940 or 1970 and have [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=1624.8000000000002s)]
*  evaporated by now, but it seems to be doing fine. I find the tooth fairy deeply creepy. As a quick [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=1629.6000000000001s)]
*  aside, like what is this person doing? She's stealing children's teeth. She's bringing them [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=1634.4s)]
*  to an imaginary land. She's building a home with the children's dirty teeth. I find it creepy. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=1640.0800000000002s)]
*  And I was against—I was going to be a no and, you know, take the children and steal the joy [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=1644.96s)]
*  from my child, but my husband wisely suggested that that was probably not right and we should [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=1649.44s)]
*  just go along with the roost for a while. And she likes it, right? The tooth fairy. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=1654.48s)]
*  She does. They all love the tooth fairy. I think they don't overthink it the way we do, you know. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=1658.0s)]
*  But then the final thing—I mean, I don't want to get too earnest, but I don't know. Using this as [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=1662.0800000000002s)]
*  an opportunity—I don't know, I guess, who paid for this video, whether this was the taxpayers or [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=1666.56s)]
*  the—her campaign, I don't know—to proselytize, if that's the right word, in favor of her particular [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=1670.96s)]
*  lord and savior, is also a little bit—like, once upon a time, actual sitting government officials [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=1677.8400000000001s)]
*  thought they should keep their religious—they went to church fine and they—Biden certainly is [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=1682.64s)]
*  a good Catholic and went to Mass a lot and would occasionally talk about what it meant to him, [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=1687.04s)]
*  obviously, his religion. I don't think he went around telling everyone else, you know what, [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=1691.1200000000001s)]
*  if you want to really improve your life, you should become a member of the Roman Catholic Church. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=1694.32s)]
*  So I find that a little— [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=1699.92s)]
*  It's worse than that, actually, Bill. I appreciate that you're being gentle in that critique, but [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=1700.88s)]
*  I—it would be inappropriate if you were doing a video that was something like—I don't know, [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=1707.76s)]
*  let's say it was about, you know, a culture of life and society and how you want to protect the [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=1715.28s)]
*  unborn, and then when they're born, you want to make sure that they have, like, the support that [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=1723.2s)]
*  they need and the mothers do, right? Or let's say you're doing a video about—if you're a [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=1727.2s)]
*  Democrat Christian, you're doing a video about how USAID should be funded, and as Christians, [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=1731.04s)]
*  we should care about people throughout the world, and I'm a Christian, and I got—you know, [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=1736.32s)]
*  okay, you know, again, at the very end, being like, you should join my faith would still be [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=1740.1599999999999s)]
*  not in our tradition and a little inappropriate, but in this case, she's using the Christianity [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=1745.52s)]
*  as a shield for an effort to cut health care funding for poor people. Like, that's not a [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=1752.8s)]
*  Christian. There's nothing that's like, oh, you know, Jesus really wanted you to understand [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=1760.16s)]
*  that we should let the poor die because they would be welcomed into the bosom of heaven [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=1765.1200000000001s)]
*  afterwards, and so there's no sense for us to worry about our fellow, the sick, and, you know, [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=1770.96s)]
*  the indigent. We shouldn't worry about them because you get eternal life with me. That was [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=1778.48s)]
*  not the fucking message. You know, I went to Catholic school. I heard, you know, we didn't [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=1782.96s)]
*  read as much of the Bible as the evangelicals did. They're more Bible-based than us, but I got the [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=1790.08s)]
*  gist, and it wasn't like, let the poor sick people die because it doesn't matter because heaven [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=1796.72s)]
*  exists. That's not actually the point of the faith. And it wasn't, let's make jokes about [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=1802.72s)]
*  efforts to stop, to help poor people from being sick and possibly dying. But, you know, let's, [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=1808.8799999999999s)]
*  it wasn't like, those jokes are fine because we all believe in heaven anyway, so what does it matter? [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=1815.4399999999998s)]
*  That's kind of, yeah, that's what she's saying. Yeah. Which is really saying, I believe, however, [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=1819.84s)]
*  if we can, is, of course, people like me and many of my donors and wealthy backers don't have to [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=1825.52s)]
*  worry about this because it's Medicaid and we don't do that. We don't do, you know, we don't [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=1834.16s)]
*  need Medicaid. I mean, don't we think that subtext of this is a kind of creepy, we don't care that [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=1837.52s)]
*  much about the people on Medicaid? Yeah. Well, and I think the subtext is you shouldn't listen to my [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=1843.3600000000001s)]
*  critics because they're godless. Yeah. It's also like, don't listen to them. They're godless. Don't [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=1846.96s)]
*  listen to them. We're going to cut your Medicaid. Yeah. I guess my last comment on it is just the [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=1850.96s)]
*  tone is also so condescending. Like, had Kamala Harris ever taped a video that had that level of [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=1858.88s)]
*  sneering condescension towards a voter that's concerned? Honestly, Fox News would never stop [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=1866.16s)]
*  talking about it. I mean, it would still be talked about into the 2080s. There would be an AI Fox host [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=1873.2s)]
*  talking about, remember that time? I mean, just think about the, like Obama clinging to the guns [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=1878.4s)]
*  and religion comment, which was like, poorly put, like he was intended to, like he was trying, [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=1883.2s)]
*  he was intending to be, you know, to provide an explanation for people. And he's doing so in a [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=1890.48s)]
*  condescending manner. She is sneering at the people that showed up to her town hall and mocking them. [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=1896.32s)]
*  Honestly, it would just be wall to wall forever. And Democrats, and by the way, if it was a [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=1903.68s)]
*  Democratic Senator or Kamala or whoever that had done something like this, all of the Democratic [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=1908.48s)]
*  media would be, you know, attacking her and saying, oh, we're so condescending. We need to [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=1914.96s)]
*  have some self-reflection. I can't imagine that's what's happening on Fox today. This is just [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=1920.8s)]
*  not really related, but it came across my feed today. Your friend, Peter Thiel, [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=1926.16s)]
*  he had an interview where he was talking about, this is an old interview, but it was re-upped. [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=1931.76s)]
*  He's talking about how he's trying to extend his lifespan. And he's taking nicotine as a [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=1937.92s)]
*  nootropic drug because it raises IQ. He's got HGH pills to promote muscle mass. He's taking [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=1944.88s)]
*  semaglutide. He's changed to a weekly injection of Monjaro. He's taking another drug that he [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=1951.6000000000001s)]
*  thinks will have a significant effect in suppressing the cancer risk. I do think it's kind of weird that [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=1959.44s)]
*  the Maggots have created a coalition that extends from let people die because heaven [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=1964.4s)]
*  awaits evangelicals to like atheist gay vampires trying to defeat the linear passage of time. It's [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=1969.2800000000002s)]
*  a pretty broad group. I don't know. It is. And Peter, I think sometimes, I used to think sometimes [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=1974.88s)]
*  that he was a Catholic or had some of his friend leaders or parts of Catholic thought. And so that [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=1982.16s)]
*  also was a little, yeah, I've never understood that. That's been a surprise to me, the extent to which [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=1988.8000000000002s)]
*  they've knit together a coalition that, as you say, is full of intellectually incoherent, to say [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=1993.12s)]
*  the least, element. Again, Nietzschean strongman, will of will to power, and Christian sanctity. [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=1998.6399999999999s)]
*  Whatever you think about either, each serious people in each tradition knew that they were [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=2008.4799999999998s)]
*  opposed to the other. Serious Christians were not really on board with Nietzscheanism. And Nietzsche [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=2012.8799999999999s)]
*  was not on board with earnest Christian humility and so forth. And so I don't know. It's a good [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=2018.56s)]
*  lesson actually about political coalitions. I think especially true, and Umberto Eco makes [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=2025.6799999999998s)]
*  this point, this fantastic essay on fascism, which I recommend you can Google it. And people [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=2030.08s)]
*  can Google it. And the fascism for quasi-fascism is a funny combination of a lot of different [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=2035.84s)]
*  emotions and psychological aspects. And they don't cohere. That they cohere, it is in their hatred of, [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=2044.24s)]
*  I would say, freedom and liberal democracy and some aspects of just modernity and all of that, [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=2050.8s)]
*  the bourgeois society. That's the coherence. But the rest of it is a mishmash, but it doesn't make [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=2056.4s)]
*  it less powerful. And that's a very important, there's a lot of our friends, and I fall into [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=2062.4s)]
*  this trap sometimes too, you know, aha, I pointed out an intellectual contradiction from four [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=2066.2400000000002s)]
*  worlds. Well, that's nice. Look, it's not nothing. It's important to point out. And sometimes it [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=2071.68s)]
*  shows the way to a political cleavage that can be exploited, which we should do more of. That's [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=2077.04s)]
*  another discussion. But the aha, intellectual contradiction point doesn't mean that they can't [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=2081.44s)]
*  cheerfully go ahead. And the Nietzscheans can try to send the dark-skinned immigrants away because [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=2086.56s)]
*  they believe in race science and the, I don't know, I mean, every element, they can come together [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=2091.52s)]
*  in very bad and hateful policies, I guess. Yeah, well, and then the evangelicals can [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=2099.44s)]
*  go along with it because of the belief in now Christian nationalism. And I think part of the [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=2104.7200000000003s)]
*  reason why it does go here is that most of the Christians have refashioned their Christian [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=2108.64s)]
*  belief to eliminate some of the humility and some of the other elements that you mentioned. [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=2113.44s)]
*  You know, I don't think I got to tell you about this game-changing product I used before a night [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=2123.04s)]
*  out with drinks called Zee Biotics Pre-Alcohol because in Chicago and Nashville at our events [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=2126.48s)]
*  last week, several of you, several of our listeners came up and asked me if I was taking my pre-alcohol. [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=2132.88s)]
*  And so the brand awareness has reached the Bullwork Podcast listeners. But if you're not aware, [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=2140.4s)]
*  it's a, the Zee Biotics Pre-Alcohol probiotic drink is the world's first genetically engineered [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=2146.48s)]
*  probiotic. It was invented by PhD scientists to tackle rough mornings after drinking. Here's how [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=2151.12s)]
*  it works. When you drink alcohol, it gets converted into a toxic byproduct in the gut. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=2156.0s)]
*  It's a buildup of this byproduct, not dehydration. That's to blame for rough next days after drinking. [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=2160.08s)]
*  Pre-Alcohol produces an enzyme to break this byproduct down. Just remember to make pre-alcohol [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=2165.6s)]
*  your first drink of the night. Drink responsibly and you'll feel your best tomorrow. All right, [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=2170.0s)]
*  we're going to be using Zee Biotics. We've got our big event, our world pride event, the fundraiser [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=2174.0s)]
*  coming up this Friday. Hope to see you all there in Washington, D.C. Friday, June 6th. And I'll be [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=2178.48s)]
*  bringing the pre-alcohol. We're going to be going out afterwards. I heard John Lovitz even [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=2183.44s)]
*  go out to the club with me afterwards, which is, which should be an experience. And so we know we're [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=2187.36s)]
*  going to have a big night. Zee Biotics, that's going to be the first drink of the night here. [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=2193.6s)]
*  For you guys, summer's here, which means more opportunities to celebrate the warm weather. [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=2197.76s)]
*  So before that backyard barbecue, don't forget your Zee Biotics Pre-Alcohol. Drink one before [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=2202.4s)]
*  drinking and wake up feeling great and ready to take on the next day and all that summer has to [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=2207.44s)]
*  offer. Go to zeebiotics.com slash the bulwark to learn more and get 15% off your first order. [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=2211.92s)]

*  Another one of those topics is on immigration. You know, and we do this every week, but I just [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=2235.36s)]
*  don't want to lose it. I think it's important not to stop mentioning the horrors of what they're [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=2242.24s)]
*  doing on immigration because otherwise people just begin to accept it. Just two snapshots from the [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=2247.8399999999997s)]
*  weekend. In San Antonio, three migrant children were taken into custody and restrained with zip ties. [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=2253.2s)]
*  The children, two boys and a girl, were between the ages of nine and 12. They were detained after [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=2260.24s)]
*  an immigration judge had dismissed their case. The immigration judge had dismissed their case. [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=2265.6s)]
*  ICE didn't know what to do with them. They were zip tied. There's a reporter from San Antonio [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=2270.16s)]
*  that's been covering it. They're eventually released. But again, what are we doing? [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=2274.96s)]
*  In Boston, Marcelo Gomez, age 18. He's an honor student. He's going to a volleyball [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=2279.3599999999997s)]
*  tournament ahead of his high school graduation, which was to have been yesterday. He spent his [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=2284.3199999999997s)]
*  high school graduation in a cell with 30 other men. He was the youngest one there. He's not criminal. [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=2289.2799999999997s)]
*  They did not accuse him of any crimes. He was brought to America from Brazil at the age of five. [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=2296.96s)]
*  On the way to the volleyball tournament, ICE detained him. They chained his ankles and wrists [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=2304.3999999999996s)]
*  and put him into the cell where, as far as I know, is when we're taping it here this morning, [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=2311.2s)]
*  he's still there. This is just madness. This is madness. It's inhumane. It's not keeping me [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=2316.48s)]
*  to be safe. It's shameful. Whatever you think about what we should do with folks who are brought [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=2321.44s)]
*  to this country. Yeah, horrible. I guess so they can hit their quotas. It's easier to hit your quota [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=2326.7200000000003s)]
*  of deportations or detentions, planning for deportation, en route to deportations. [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=2332.7200000000003s)]
*  If you go hang out outside courthouses where people are actually showing up for legal, [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=2339.68s)]
*  been told to show up by ICE, and are showing up per instructions from the authorities, [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=2344.4s)]
*  then they have this gimmick. I don't know if they did this in the Texas case. They asked, actually, [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=2348.8s)]
*  the judge dismissed the case. But then if you've only been there two years, you can be deported [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=2354.0s)]
*  in an expedited way. You're in a way you don't have as many protections. The dismissal is actually a [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=2358.0800000000004s)]
*  fake way of letting them just seize you. The Massachusetts case is horrifying. An 18-year-old [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=2363.6800000000003s)]
*  honors high school student who's been there since he's five. There's a case also of a woman [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=2370.7200000000003s)]
*  from the Philippines, I believe, and I think a nurse maybe, who's been here for decades, [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=2374.88s)]
*  like 40 years or 50 years or something. And it was obviously in her 60s or something, [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=2379.52s)]
*  50s or 60s, who was detained for three months by ICE. I mean, the degree of just idiotic cruelty. [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=2383.84s)]
*  But also let's talk about use of resources. My impression is the entire DHS and FBI and [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=2389.2000000000003s)]
*  a large chunk of other law enforcement agencies are focused on maybe including some FBI agents, [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=2394.56s)]
*  since they seem to show up at some of these detentions, are focused on immigration, [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=2400.96s)]
*  but especially on the mass deportation. That's their agenda. Maybe they should focus a little [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=2405.6s)]
*  more on individuals who are possible domestic terrorists. I know the Trump administration [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=2412.4s)]
*  doesn't let you use the word domestic terrorists. Some can be native-born Americans. That was the [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=2416.7200000000003s)]
*  case of the shooter here in DC less than two weeks ago who killed two Jews at the, in fact, [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=2420.96s)]
*  at the Jewish Museum in DC after a peaceful meeting there. And of course, the weekend [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=2428.88s)]
*  yesterday in Boulder, it was someone who had come from Egypt, had been, I guess, had overstayed a [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=2436.4s)]
*  tourist visa, then had gotten to work at Plyford asylum. So he got a work permit. That had expired. [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=2442.6400000000003s)]
*  You know, maybe if they had more people looking at middle-aged single men whose work permit had [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=2447.6s)]
*  expired and making sure those people aren't a threat and maybe if appropriate, even deporting [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=2453.36s)]
*  them back to their countries if they're safe or at least having an eye on them, you know, that would [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=2459.1200000000003s)]
*  be a better use of resources than, I mean, so apart from the moral protestance of it all, [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=2465.1200000000003s)]
*  the misuse of resources and of going after these students and nurses and people who have been here [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=2471.84s)]
*  for decades, people who are manifesting no threat to anyone. And now we've got 350,000 Venezuelans, [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=2479.76s)]
*  I'm going to just say off 98% of whom are no threat to anyone and are living in Florida and [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=2485.0400000000004s)]
*  their neighbors would probably report them if they were a threat. And they're going to waste, [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=2489.84s)]
*  you know, apart from the, again, inhumaneness of it, waste resources going after them instead of [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=2494.0s)]
*  focusing on some people who should be focused on in terms of possible threats. Yeah, I mean, there's [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=2499.36s)]
*  the opportunity cost side of the resources, right, to your point, particularly, I think it's very [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=2506.16s)]
*  relevant to bring up, especially with this guy from Egypt, which I'm going to get into more in a [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=2511.6s)]
*  second in Boulder. But there's also just the financial resources, right? I mean, Kristi Noem, [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=2515.44s)]
*  this is like the kind of thing that would be a huge scandal in another administration that just [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=2522.96s)]
*  gets lost. But the DHS is spending way more than has been allocated, right? And again, so we have [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=2527.92s)]
*  the supposed fiscal responsibility, we're doing Doge, we're doing government efficiency. Well, [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=2535.04s)]
*  DHS keeps spending money, like it's part of the deportations and there are other things that they're [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=2539.36s)]
*  doing that have not been authorized by, you know, Congress. And Kristi Noem was in front of Congress, [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=2545.44s)]
*  I think it was last week, it was two weeks ago, and was asked about this and was basically just [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=2552.96s)]
*  like, whatever, like, we're just going to do what we want, right? And so they are overspending, [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=2556.4s)]
*  it is going to be a boon for the private prison industry, which is like, I guess, one of our one [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=2563.04s)]
*  of the prime domestic industries now under the Trump administration. But, you know, it's not, [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=2567.28s)]
*  you know, it's not fiscally efficient, right? Like, we're not doing, like, we're spending more than [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=2573.36s)]
*  than we had allocated to spend. And also, just like, what, like, why are we doing this? Right? [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=2580.64s)]
*  Like, some of these people, a lot of times this is used as an excuse for deportations, right? Which [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=2587.28s)]
*  is like, well, you know, the cost of the health care services for undocumented immigrants is just [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=2591.6s)]
*  too high, and we can't afford to pay it, so we got to send it back. But in a lot of these cases, [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=2597.52s)]
*  these are people that are working in the country that are paying taxes that are not on the [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=2601.7599999999998s)]
*  government role that actually we're making money from them because they're paying into Social [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=2606.4s)]
*  Security, but not taking it out because they're illegal. And so we're taking people that are [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=2609.7599999999998s)]
*  contributing to society and, you know, at some marginal number, like actually adding, you know, [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=2614.64s)]
*  to the intake on the budget. And we're putting them in a prison where we have to monitor them 24-7, [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=2620.72s)]
*  feed them, right? Like all the lawyers that you got to pay for to deal with all this, right? [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=2628.56s)]
*  It's crazy. It's insane. Like, what is the point of having an 18-year-old in prison? You're worried [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=2633.12s)]
*  he's going to flee? You're trying to get him to flee back to Brazil. It's insane. And this, [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=2638.64s)]
*  the budget reconciliation bill has tens of billions, maybe even over $100 billion [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=2643.6s)]
*  for DHS basically for both prison capacity, basically, or detention capacity, as well as [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=2648.6400000000003s)]
*  for some immigration judges. And so they can re-invite these things who faster. Maybe the [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=2655.2000000000003s)]
*  immigration judges isn't a bad idea. That's something I think the Biden administration may [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=2658.96s)]
*  propose. But again, some of that money could be used to beef up counterintelligence at the FBI, [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=2662.1600000000003s)]
*  for example. But Kash Patel is busy firing so far as I can tell everyone at the FBI who knows [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=2666.6400000000003s)]
*  anything about this and shaking up- And showing up to random immigration raids. [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=2671.6000000000004s)]
*  Right. No, he's told them he's got these offices focusing more on immigration, not on counterterrorism. [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=2676.0s)]
*  Those things could overlap at times, maybe as in Boulder. But again, in a normal administration, [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=2681.84s)]
*  there are ways to reallocate resources, obviously, in light of changing conditions. I never know which [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=2686.88s)]
*  cabinet member to get most outrage about. Hex F had his moment in the sun, and that was pretty [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=2692.64s)]
*  unbelievable with the, and then the signal thing. Then Robert F. Kennedy Jr. I can't believe this [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=2698.0s)]
*  guy is in charge of HHS. And then I think about Kristian Ohm for a minute, and I think, well, [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=2703.04s)]
*  she's the worst. She wins that company. I don't know. What do you- [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=2707.68s)]
*  Rubio overseeing an international campaign of death, taking away medicines from the world's [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=2711.36s)]
*  poorest people, maybe. And while also jailing random students in this country because he [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=2718.32s)]
*  doesn't like their opinion on the Gaza war. That's a pretty good nominee. [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=2724.8s)]
*  And Pam Bondi's got some really wonderful people there at Justice, doesn't he? That guy in [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=2727.6s)]
*  Gracia, is that his name? Who's some kind of- Oh, yeah. We're about to get to him. [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=2732.4s)]
*  Okay. So I mean, which is your choice? I'm sure you're a good judge of these kinds of things. [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=2735.6s)]
*  Who's the actual most repulsive and reprehensible cabinet secretary? [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=2740.48s)]
*  I keep changing. So this is a good question. Repulsive and reprehensible is different from [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=2746.64s)]
*  worst. We did this game at the Chicago show. And for worst, I said Nutlick, just because he's so [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=2750.0s)]
*  bad as compared to what another Department of Commerce secretary would be. He's creating so [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=2755.92s)]
*  much damage. But most reprehensible, I don't know how you cannot pick Rubio. Maybe it's just [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=2760.24s)]
*  because I expected more from him. But I mean, he has abandoned everything that he argued for [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=2766.4799999999996s)]
*  in his 2016 campaign about his view of America's role in the world. And the result is tens of [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=2773.4399999999996s)]
*  thousands of deaths. There's a Nick Kristof column this weekend about how Rubio accused him of lying [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=2778.9599999999996s)]
*  about the deaths that are resulting from the cuts to USAID and PEPFAR. And Kristof's [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=2784.24s)]
*  like, no, I'm not lying. Here's pictures of the kids that are now dead because they weren't [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=2790.16s)]
*  getting their medicine. Just one foot down the net quickly is interesting. And it ties into what [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=2795.52s)]
*  we're talking about with health care. If they want to say, America first, we can't be responsible for [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=2800.48s)]
*  every kid in Africa who might have a disease. And so we're cutting back on all this humanitarian [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=2805.6s)]
*  stuff. It's not something I like. It's not something I don't think the American people would support. [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=2811.12s)]
*  I think we're wealthy enough to run a USAID program and PEPFAR. But it's not an [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=2815.92s)]
*  intrinsically insane position. Obviously, you can't do everything. And there are other things [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=2821.44s)]
*  you don't do abroad in terms of humanitarian. So, OK, we're going to cut back on this. We've [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=2825.28s)]
*  overdone it. We're America first. That's sort of, and I'd say on health care, too, we can't, [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=2829.2000000000003s)]
*  it's just we can't have as big a Medicaid program as has grown up over the last decade or two. So [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=2836.0s)]
*  we're going to cut back. And we're sorry. We're going to try to make sure to limit the damage. [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=2840.7200000000003s)]
*  But that's not what they say. They just lie. No one is being hurt by USAID cuts. No one is [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=2845.36s)]
*  being hurt by Medicaid cuts. That's literally impossible. I mean, it's actually we're taking [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=2850.08s)]
*  money away from these people that are scamming you. Right? Like that's what they're saying. [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=2855.36s)]
*  We're saying we're, yeah. I mean, as I said, there's an honest conservative argument for doing less [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=2858.8s)]
*  abroad and at home for the government doing less. And they're scared to make that even that argument, [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=2864.88s)]
*  though. And so it's all yes, you say it's either we're just stopping fraud and abuse, [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=2870.1600000000003s)]
*  or we're or there is no effect. I mean, so what's his name? Voss, speaking of reprehensible [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=2874.6400000000003s)]
*  characters, the OMB director goes on TV, as it just says, there's no what did he say? There's no, [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=2879.76s)]
*  no one is losing coverage, or no one is going to be hurt by these Medicaid cuts. It's literally [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=2886.8s)]
*  impossible. The way they're saving money is by having some people not get coverage who are [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=2893.6000000000004s)]
*  currently getting coverage. I'm glad I got you riled up before the end. You know, I felt like [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=2898.72s)]
*  we were a little sleepy at the start. All right. So before we get to I want to get into the anti [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=2905.04s)]
*  semitism stuff as the final topic, but just really quick, I just want to make sure you don't have [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=2909.12s)]
*  any thoughts on the Glenn Greenwald sex tape or on Washington Post, former Washington Post reporter [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=2913.04s)]
*  Taylor O'Rourke and quasi endorsing 911. Those are two pretty I didn't even know about the second [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=2917.7599999999998s)]
*  and the first I'm kind of leaving I'll leave to some of our colleagues here at the full work, [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=2922.64s)]
*  okay. All right. Don't leak people's sex tapes is my yeah, that's that's fucking rude. And 911 was [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=2926.2400000000002s)]
*  bad. What is this? What is this tale of around thinks it was she's that social media reporter [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=2934.0s)]
*  that's kind of crazy. That's like still wearing an N95 mask everywhere, even like outside in the park [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=2939.2000000000003s)]
*  now in 2025. And she was the person that was covering the social media beat for the Washington [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=2944.88s)]
*  Post and other other places. And she's got gone crazy and she had a post about how old people [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=2949.76s)]
*  don't understand that young people have a different view on 911 and have come to understand that [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=2955.52s)]
*  like the terrorists had some points. This is this is what's happening on tic tac right now. [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=2960.08s)]
*  I mean, we do have 911 truthers, if I can just point out who have been at, you know, at welcome [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=2965.84s)]
*  with the White House had dinner with Trump, probably in the administration, maybe not at the [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=2971.04s)]
*  very top tier, I guess even Patel didn't quite go there. But certainly at the second and third tier, [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=2974.4s)]
*  they've mingled with those people, right? So why are we surprised that I mean, that this is all now [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=2978.8s)]
*  respectable? We shouldn't be surprised. It's a great point. All right. Let's end with some [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=2983.92s)]
*  anti semitism talk. I've got kind of a rant about about anti semitism and also kind of about how [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=2988.1600000000003s)]
*  media how we've been covering some of this stuff. You know, particularly to the Nazi salutes. So [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=2996.4s)]
*  before I get into my rant, what do you have any any additional thoughts from what you shared earlier [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=3002.0s)]
*  about what we saw in Boulder yesterday? I mean, it's anti semitism is an awful thing. And it really [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=3006.48s)]
*  it's it's just a terrible curse that for Jews, obviously, but really for all of us and but it [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=3010.48s)]
*  should be combated. But no, I want to hear your rant. Okay, here's my rant. You can you can react [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=3016.96s)]
*  to it. So like, there are very serious threats right now to anti semitism. That's like very [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=3021.12s)]
*  obvious to Jewish folks listening and probably most folks listening. You know, it's it is across [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=3026.8s)]
*  the ideological spectrum. Like, right, you have a shirtless guy trying to globalize the Intifada [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=3032.56s)]
*  in Boulder yesterday, like lighting a Holocaust survivor on fire. That's very serious and horrible. [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=3037.2s)]
*  And like we should be dealing with it. As you mentioned earlier, this guy Paul and Gracia, [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=3043.12s)]
*  he's a supporter of Holocaust and I are Nick Fuentes and other right wing anti semitism. He [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=3047.2s)]
*  was named to lead the Office of Special Counsel in the Trump administration. You know, Jews are [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=3051.9199999999996s)]
*  being harassed at synagogues, we've got a wide range of, like, you know, of threats that have [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=3056.96s)]
*  coming from folks. And so like, when I see that, I, we want to make sure that we are covering it [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=3065.1200000000003s)]
*  and that folks are aware and that and I think it's particularly true for young folks. You look at [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=3072.0800000000004s)]
*  polls of younger folks and what their views are of of Israel or anti semitism of Jews broadly [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=3076.88s)]
*  is like quite alarming. And so like one thing I don't really love about people in our world [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=3083.44s)]
*  is like really the kind of comedic over emphasis on on like pointing and calling people Nazis [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=3090.4s)]
*  in other contexts. And the thing I'm particularly thinking of right now is like the Elon Musk and [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=3100.56s)]
*  ban and Nazi salute thing. I don't know if you saw this, but Cory Booker was over the weekend in [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=3105.36s)]
*  California and he did the same thing. It was like he's putting his hand to his heart and then doing [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=3110.2400000000002s)]
*  the hand like the wave. I would recommend the politicians not do that the hand over the heart [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=3115.2s)]
*  and the wave. But as a result, like Elon is on Twitter this week, I'm like gleefully mocking [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=3120.48s)]
*  all the people who called him a Nazi by like comparing the the video of him and Cory Booker. [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=3126.56s)]
*  And I just I'm sorry to say that like you hate to hand it to Elon or anything, but he has a fucking [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=3134.56s)]
*  point. And like on this podcast, like I tried really hard not to do that. And I think that [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=3139.28s)]
*  there are a lot of news people like really like just straight news people who who covered that [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=3145.0400000000004s)]
*  and and like tried to do it to inform people and maybe did it in a way that didn't inform people [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=3153.92s)]
*  that well. And there are a lot of like resistance media people that were doing it in a way that they [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=3159.1200000000003s)]
*  thought they were helping by like being like see Elon's a Nazi, Elon's a Nazi. Like the thing is [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=3162.5600000000004s)]
*  like these guys are doing actual terrible shit. Like there is like SS style shit happening with [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=3167.2s)]
*  some with ICE targeting not Jews, but like targeting groups of people and sending them [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=3174.7999999999997s)]
*  to foreign prisons. Like that's happening. That's the real thing that's happening. As we mentioned, [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=3179.4399999999996s)]
*  like the cutting of USAID like then Bill Gates's line about the richest man in the world being [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=3182.56s)]
*  responsible for the deaths of the poorest people in the world. That's the thing to go after Elon [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=3187.52s)]
*  on that is legitimate. Like the anti the hiring this guy into the administration who seems to be [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=3191.68s)]
*  a legit Nazi sympathizer. Like that is a thing to criticize these guys about. And so I think that [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=3198.48s)]
*  like when we do the silly stuff that like undermines all that. Right. And and like and people who think [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=3205.7599999999998s)]
*  they're being helpful are actually like helping Elon now do propaganda and be like see that you [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=3212.08s)]
*  guys you should just reject them anytime that they make level this attack on us because they [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=3219.04s)]
*  would never make that attack on Cory Booker when he did the same hand motion that I did. And so [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=3224.56s)]
*  like that's it. Sometimes I get people who are like who want me to do more of that kind of stuff. And [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=3229.12s)]
*  I just I don't think that it's I think that it is actually does does harm to the cause. And I think [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=3233.68s)]
*  that it creates an unseriousness about the threat of anti-Semitism when it's really serious. And [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=3240.88s)]
*  this is not an argument that we should not fight and we should not try to fuck with [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=3246.96s)]
*  with these assholes when they're trying to fuck with other people. Like I'm for all that. But like [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=3250.32s)]
*  I just think that we should be smart about it and that we should give the fascist hell in a way that [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=3255.44s)]
*  is helpful. And and I just kind of ignored this when the Elon C Kyle thing was happening. Then [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=3260.48s)]
*  retrospect I feel like I should give Sarah Longwell credit. And I think it was Sarah that was like I [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=3268.48s)]
*  don't I think that we should focus on other things. And I think that she was right about that. [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=3273.04s)]
*  So anyway that's my that's my global you know that's very hot take on anti-Semitism. [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=3276.64s)]
*  That's interesting and and I think correct and a good reminder beyond anti-Semitism too. I mean [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=3281.6s)]
*  so just on the line of the Nazi thing I mean he endorsed the AFD the neo-Nazi party in Germany. [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=3288.64s)]
*  That's when he was a senior White House official and in fact the vice president vice president [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=3294.56s)]
*  Vance did as well. And then Mubio had to is your favorite cabinet member had to chime in and follow [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=3299.8399999999997s)]
*  along. That's serious like the U.S. government is endorsing a party that entire the Europe Europe [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=3304.72s)]
*  as a whole not just Germany and European conservatives as a whole have said repeatedly is beyond the pale [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=3310.3199999999997s)]
*  and has obvious Nazi and extremist elements deeply embedded in it. Maybe you could even say at the [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=3316.3199999999997s)]
*  heart of it. So that's a real thing. And as you say having giving these people jobs in the Trump [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=3321.7599999999998s)]
*  administration that's a real thing. And the policies they're pursuing God knows immigration [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=3326.0s)]
*  and others that's a real thing. And to be fair you can say on the left there's some real things [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=3329.9199999999996s)]
*  that are very deplorable. You know very much that should be explored I believe in terms of votes and [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=3333.84s)]
*  and policies they endorse and so forth. But yes I think focusing on deeds and policies [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=3338.32s)]
*  is better than focusing on the symbolic and just real shit. Yeah I can also make him defend that [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=3347.04s)]
*  just as a strategic matter like make Elon defend the fact that like that this is this America first [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=3351.36s)]
*  party doesn't care about what's happening around the world except for oh wait no the only times [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=3357.1200000000003s)]
*  we do cares when we're endorsing the neo-nazi party in Germany and welcoming white Afrikaners [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=3360.96s)]
*  to America and besides that we want to let everybody around the world die. [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=3366.48s)]
*  Make them defend that like make like Elon it was a sputtering mess trying to defend the Bill [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=3371.04s)]
*  Gates attack on him in this interview he did. I think it was in Qatar that I was watching. [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=3376.08s)]
*  Like he was at some economic forum in the Middle East and he's a sputtering mess trying to defend [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=3381.52s)]
*  that. So like there's plenty of shit to attack them on and so criticize so do that right and [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=3386.08s)]
*  then you don't have to get into this fucking situation where Cory Booker is in Sacramento [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=3392.56s)]
*  doing a thing and now like they feel like they have a get out of jail free card now. [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=3398.0s)]
*  It's just it's not smart and it does you know it gets I see what gets the clicks like it gets clicks [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=3402.56s)]
*  I see what people do it but you know everybody should should maybe be a little bit more wise. [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=3408.72s)]
*  Do you have any wise final words for us Bill? [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=3414.32s)]
*  With the threat that just the obvious one the threat is real and it's fine to make fun of [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=3416.96s)]
*  these guys to some degree obviously it is for sure it's more fine even I would say and this I think [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=3422.0800000000004s)]
*  is where actually we're not doing enough the liberals aren't doing enough in general [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=3426.32s)]
*  pro-democracy forces to accept to use politically to use the gaps and the possible rifts to open up [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=3430.1600000000003s)]
*  cleavages among them that's just as a political matter a prudent thing a sensible thing to do. [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=3437.6000000000004s)]
*  Our colleague Joe Pertico had an interesting piece that Musk criticized the big beautiful bill [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=3442.0s)]
*  in Congress the reconciliation bill Democrats haven't really used that much now Democrats [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=3446.7200000000003s)]
*  democratic officials don't want to quote Musk and I kind of agree with them that you know as a source [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=3452.0800000000004s)]
*  but then it's sort of legitimizing but third this is why we have third party groups right in existence [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=3455.84s)]
*  to sort of say hey to to say to MAGA types especially the Musk friendly MAGA types [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=3460.7200000000003s)]
*  you know hey your guy must doesn't like this bill either yes you can do a lot of [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=3467.84s)]
*  accentuating the cleavages but yeah simply the the mocking it it sort of reduces the [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=3472.7200000000003s)]
*  the seriousness of the situation I think. Yeah or mock when it does when it merits it right like [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=3479.92s)]
*  rather than like mocking the way that like lets that otherwise you're just like a cog in this big [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=3485.44s)]
*  fucking content game like whether you're you're doing one thing and your people are cheering and [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=3489.84s)]
*  then he's doing another thing calling your people stupid and his people are cheering like nobody's [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=3494.2400000000002s)]
*  fucking achieving anything about any of that anyway the globalized zandifada stuff is [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=3497.36s)]
*  is alarming it's concerning and are and so related but separate from this conversation about Elon and [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=3503.52s)]
*  so our our thoughts got to the victims there and just like the idea that one of the one of the women [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=3511.6800000000003s)]
*  that was targeted was a holocaust survivor just it darkens the heart it's pretty it's pretty sad [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=3517.44s)]
*  so anyway that is that we uh we're here we're gonna be keep giving fascists hell here it's [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaiYL860yg&t=3524.24s)]
