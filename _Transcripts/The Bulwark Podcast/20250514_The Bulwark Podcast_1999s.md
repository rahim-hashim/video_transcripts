Video Description: The five men on the Supreme Court are so easily triggered and seem to be making law based on their emotional needs. Meanwhile, they also see discrimination in some of the best things about America, like equality or the First Amendment's Establishment Clause. Leah Litman joins Tim Miller.

# Is SCOTUS the GOP’s Revenge Machine? (w/ Leah Litman) | The Bulwark Podcast
**The Bulwark Podcast:** [May 14, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI)
*  So, on the one hand, they want to rein in the executive branch. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=0.0s)]
*  On the other hand, now, Congress basically doesn't exist anymore. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=4.54s)]
*  And so, the Trump administration is just issuing executive orders like, we're deciding how [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=8.48s)]
*  much those MPIC costs today. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=13.44s)]
*  And tomorrow we're doing the... [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=15.08s)]
*  Hello, and welcome to the Bullard Podcast. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=18.16s)]
*  I'm your host, Tim Miller. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=26.12s)]
*  She's a professor of law at the University of Michigan, second straight University of [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=27.52s)]
*  Michigan guest, held to the victors. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=30.439999999999998s)]
*  She's also co-host of the podcast, Strict Scrutiny. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=32.68s)]
*  She clerked for Anthony Kennedy, and she's the author of a brand new book, Lawless, How [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=38.16s)]
*  the Supreme Court Runs on Conservative Grievance, Fringe Theories, and Bad Vibes. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=42.56s)]
*  It's Leah Lippman. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=46.480000000000004s)]
*  What's going on, girl? [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=47.480000000000004s)]
*  You know, same old, same old. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=48.480000000000004s)]
*  Everything is amazing. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=51.44s)]
*  World is looking great. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=52.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=53.44s)]
*  Who's got it better than us? [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=54.44s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=57.36s)]
*  Thanks, Jim. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=58.36s)]
*  Marbaugh. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=59.36s)]
*  That's my sport reference for the day for you. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=60.36s)]
*  Okay. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=63.12s)]
*  I want to do book stuff and like, get, you know, kind of refresh my old Federalist Society [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=64.12s)]
*  originalist muscles from, you know, my Republican days on the back half of this. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=69.48s)]
*  But first, I, you know, just because there is so much going on, you know, I've had several [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=74.88s)]
*  people like pitching me about when to have me on the, come on the pod to talk about upcoming [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=80.03999999999999s)]
*  Supreme Court cases. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=83.88s)]
*  And I'm just like, y'all talk to me at the end of May. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=84.88s)]
*  Like, there's too much shit going on, like, like daily day to day to like get into what's [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=87.47999999999999s)]
*  coming on the Supreme Court docket. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=91.6s)]
*  But I figured this would be a good chance to just get a little overview with you. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=93.24s)]
*  The big case is coming up, you know, that will obviously be digging in too deeper as [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=97.8s)]
*  the rulings are coming down. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=101.6s)]
*  So I mean, I just glanced out this morning, we got gender care for minors, gay kids, books [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=102.8s)]
*  ban, alien enemies act, a break of Garcia. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=107.02s)]
*  What what jumps out to you? [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=110.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=111.8s)]
*  I definitely think the Trump administration is doing the Supreme Court a real solid just [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=112.8s)]
*  by drowning out coverage of what they might be up to, because the court has a bunch of [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=116.52s)]
*  big cases on their docket. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=121.08s)]
*  So there's the gender affirming care ban that you noted United States versus scrimmety. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=122.8s)]
*  That's about whether laws that ban gender affirming care trigger heightened scrutiny, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=126.96s)]
*  whether courts have to look closely at them, or whether courts are just going to basically [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=131.51999999999998s)]
*  sign off on them. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=134.72s)]
*  That could obviously have a ton of implications for Republican controlled Congress adopting [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=136.26s)]
*  a federal ban on gender affirming care or on the Constitutional Miners just for minors. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=140.72s)]
*  No, even for adults, because if the Supreme Court says laws that ban gender affirming [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=145.84s)]
*  care don't discriminate on the basis of sex, and don't discriminate on the basis of gender [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=150.92s)]
*  identity, then laws that restrict that care for adults would also get super deferential [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=156.84s)]
*  review. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=163.16s)]
*  So yeah, that case could be hugely significant. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=164.16s)]
*  Then they have the religion in schools cases. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=168.6s)]
*  So there's the LGBTQ book case that you mentioned about whether parents can challenge a school [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=171.64s)]
*  district's decision to have storybooks with LGBT characters in them, because that apparently [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=178.08s)]
*  triggers Sam Alito, as well as other religious and social conservatives. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=183.56s)]
*  Mrs. Alito for sure. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=187.68s)]
*  Oh yeah, for sure, for sure. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=189.48s)]
*  And also apparently Neil Gorsuch, who read Pride Puppy and had an utter fucking meltdown. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=191.44s)]
*  So he looked at this book, which is a puppy at a... [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=197.2s)]
*  I'm not familiar with Pride Puppy. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=199.6s)]
*  Is that like someone in a pup mask at a Pride conference? [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=201.04s)]
*  No, it's a little dog at a Pride parade and teaching kids what you will find at a Pride [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=203.67999999999998s)]
*  parade. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=209.32s)]
*  And Neil Gorsuch looked at this book. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=210.32s)]
*  There's a woman in a leather jacket. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=211.79999999999998s)]
*  And he was screaming at the top of his lungs at the advocate, why are you letting kids [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=213.79999999999998s)]
*  look for bondage and sex workers and BDSM? [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=219.22s)]
*  And the advocate is like, that's a woman in a leather jacket, Neil. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=222.73999999999998s)]
*  So there's that. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=225.58s)]
*  I'm glancing at some of the pictures now. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=227.42000000000002s)]
*  Oh, there is the puppy has a little neckerchief. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=229.86s)]
*  The neckerchiefs are popular with the gays. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=234.10000000000002s)]
*  So that's not surprising. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=236.06s)]
*  Yeah, I'm not seeing any bondage here, but I'm just kind of glancing. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=237.06s)]
*  So wow. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=241.46s)]
*  Okay. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=242.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=243.46s)]
*  So there's that one. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=244.46s)]
*  There's also a case about whether states have to create religious public charter schools. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=245.82000000000002s)]
*  You heard that right, whether states are required to create? [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=250.98000000000002s)]
*  Required to? [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=253.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=254.5s)]
*  I think Sam Alito, Brett Kavanaugh think it's actually unfair discrimination for a state [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=256.42s)]
*  to charter secular schools, but not religious ones. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=259.94s)]
*  Yes, they are literally declaring unfair, unconstitutional, the establishment clause, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=262.82s)]
*  which heretofore had prohibited religious schools, but pay no mind. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=268.34s)]
*  We'll get back into the originalism on the back half of that. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=272.82s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=276.06s)]
*  How that fits with the originalism thesis. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=277.06s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=279.06s)]
*  I could go on. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=280.06s)]
*  Any number of Trump cases might make their way back to the Supreme Court. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=281.54s)]
*  I think you mentioned Alien Enemies Act and Abrego Garcia. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=284.74s)]
*  Of course, the court is also hearing the big case about the birthright citizenship executive [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=287.26s)]
*  order. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=291.14s)]
*  So technically, the question they are asking is whether trial courts have the authority [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=292.14s)]
*  to block policies on a nationwide basis, or instead have to limit their rulings just to [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=297.42s)]
*  the states in which they reside or the states that challenge a policy. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=302.94s)]
*  So that's a big case. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=306.82s)]
*  There's a case that could kneecap what remains of the Voting Rights Act and whether it actually [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=308.62s)]
*  protects against districting that dilutes the political power of racial minorities. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=313.58s)]
*  So many big cases. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=318.62s)]
*  And again, the Trump administration is just drowning all of this out. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=319.62s)]
*  What about the Doge cases? [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=325.22s)]
*  Is any of that going to make the Supreme Court, either like the probationary federal workers [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=328.98s)]
*  over fired or the access to the Social Security Administration? [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=332.5s)]
*  That stuff still wind up through the courts right now. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=335.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=337.94s)]
*  So if it ends up at the Supreme Court anytime soon, it's going to be on the shadow docket [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=338.94s)]
*  or emergency docket. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=342.58s)]
*  That is, the Trump administration or plaintiffs might run up to the Supreme Court asking them [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=344.21999999999997s)]
*  to put on hold some lower court ruling or asking for an emergency injunction. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=348.65999999999997s)]
*  Those aren't cases the court heard argument in or full briefing that we're necessarily [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=353.26s)]
*  expecting a decision by June. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=357.3s)]
*  That would be more on like a last minute basis. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=359.41999999999996s)]
*  But we are expecting by June something on Alien Enemies Act and the Venezuelans. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=361.38s)]
*  No. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=365.53999999999996s)]
*  So I mean, not necessarily. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=366.53999999999996s)]
*  It really depends what happens in the lower courts because the court hasn't granted for [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=368.42s)]
*  full review any Alien Enemies Act cases. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=373.22s)]
*  But of course, these cases are developing so quickly in the lower courts. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=376.98s)]
*  It's super possible something ends up there. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=381.02000000000004s)]
*  It's interesting because I was one of the lawyers, one of the immigration lawyers I've [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=383.02000000000004s)]
*  been talking to said that there was like something that there was an encouraging development [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=387.42s)]
*  some of the Venezuelans have been sent to Scott were like granted to be part of the [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=393.98s)]
*  what's the fucking legal term part of the group, part of the class. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=400.78000000000003s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=405.86s)]
*  I need a second cup of coffee this morning. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=406.86s)]
*  Part of the class. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=408.70000000000005s)]
*  But then then there's like it was another court ruling that I guess is calling that [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=409.70000000000005s)]
*  into question. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=414.38s)]
*  So I guess like who has standing and who's part of like all of that is is kind of tricky [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=415.38s)]
*  when it comes to people that are not like technically here legally, which was the case [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=420.26s)]
*  for maybe not all of the Venezuelans, but most of them. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=424.65999999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=427.86s)]
*  So the Supreme Court basically created this situation where individuals in different states, [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=428.86s)]
*  they all have to challenge their potential expulsions and detentions because the D.C. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=433.78s)]
*  District Court, he had blocked the Alien Enemies Act nationwide. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=440.09999999999997s)]
*  But the Supreme Court said, no, no, no, no, no, you can't do that. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=444.5s)]
*  Every individual has to litigate their case in habeas class actions. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=448.18s)]
*  And so those rulings are going to be limited to, you know, anyone who is detained in a [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=453.34000000000003s)]
*  particular district or state. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=457.82s)]
*  And so, yes, people in some places are protected. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=459.98s)]
*  People and others aren't. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=462.90000000000003s)]
*  And that's why the Trump administration is like trying to move people between jurisdictions [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=464.38s)]
*  to get them into places where they are protected. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=468.16s)]
*  And yeah, it's just crazy. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=470.66s)]
*  Just like looking back what they've done so far this year, you know, whenever I have a [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=474.44s)]
*  legal person on, there's kind of a variety of views on just like how catastrophic it [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=480.88s)]
*  is versus like, well, actually, they've, you know, in a couple of places, particularly [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=486.24s)]
*  Amy Coney Barrett has shown some surprising pushback on the Trump administration, particularly [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=490.48s)]
*  in the Brega Garcia case and some of these immigration cases. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=496.48s)]
*  What do you make of what we've seen so far this year as far as these kind of shadow docket [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=500.24s)]
*  cases? [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=506.0s)]
*  Yeah, I think thus far, honestly, the Supreme Court has tried to avoid any big rulings and [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=507.0s)]
*  tried to defer saying anything that big about the Trump administration. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=512.72s)]
*  Yes, Justice Barrett has occasionally joined with the Democratic appointees, you know, [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=517.16s)]
*  and Chief Justice Roberts on some matters. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=521.24s)]
*  But even when the court has ruled against the Trump administration, they've given the [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=523.0s)]
*  administration some wins and some wiggle room to work with, like in the Brega Garcia order, [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=527.4000000000001s)]
*  or even in the United States Agency for International Development case, they waited to release [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=533.2s)]
*  their ruling until after the government was under obligations to actually pay out the [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=538.0s)]
*  funds. So it's yeah, anyway. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=544.0s)]
*  So they have ruled against the Trump administration sometimes, but avoided doing so in pretty [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=546.6s)]
*  pointed or harsh ways. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=550.6800000000001s)]
*  The other big kind of policy legal cases that are coming up, sort of active Trump policies, [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=553.48s)]
*  is the trade case. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=559.0400000000001s)]
*  I guess yesterday, this is outside of the Supreme Court wheelhouse. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=560.0400000000001s)]
*  There's a three-judge panel on the Court of International Trade that held the first some [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=563.24s)]
*  oral arguments on the cases challenging the legal basis for Trump's administration's tariff [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=566.6400000000001s)]
*  framework. I guess there are at least seven of these cases out there trying to nullify [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=570.96s)]
*  Trump's tariffs. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=576.24s)]
*  What do you what do you make of that? [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=577.4000000000001s)]
*  Like whether that is something that might possibly happen or what do you think of the [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=579.12s)]
*  merits of the trade cases? [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=585.32s)]
*  Yeah, so it's a tough case because presidents have been granted substantial powers under [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=587.12s)]
*  the International Economic Emergency Powers Act, as well as over foreign trade and tariffs [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=594.36s)]
*  more generally. And so I think the courts at that hearing were very nervous about trying [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=600.28s)]
*  to second guess the president's determinations about whether there was an unusual and [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=605.16s)]
*  extraordinary threat, even though Donald Trump's claims for why there is are just insane. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=610.24s)]
*  Like the trade deficit has existed for a really long time. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=614.16s)]
*  That's neither unusual nor extraordinary. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=616.92s)]
*  But the court didn't seem to be comfortable with any kind of rule that the lawyers challenging [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=619.28s)]
*  the tariffs had offered for when courts could say something wasn't actually unusual or [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=624.56s)]
*  extraordinary. And then there are the host of doctrines and rules that the Republican [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=629.4399999999999s)]
*  appointees on the Supreme Court have come up with, like the major questions doctrine, [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=634.12s)]
*  the idea that agencies can't do anything that big under statutes that are generally [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=638.32s)]
*  worded or the non-delegation doctrine, which is supposed to limit the extent to which [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=643.52s)]
*  Congress can confer authority to make regulations on non-legislative entities. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=647.6s)]
*  The problem is the Republican justices have basically created these rules that gerrymandered [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=653.36s)]
*  in exceptions for things Republicans wanted to do. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=659.2s)]
*  So the major questions doctrine might not apply to the president or the non-delegation [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=663.0799999999999s)]
*  doctrine might not restrict the president's ability with respect to foreign affairs and [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=667.88s)]
*  trade. And so it's unclear to what extent at all these doctrines that the Supreme Court [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=671.5999999999999s)]
*  invented are going to be much use in these cases. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=677.68s)]
*  Yeah, and I guess maybe this transition us to the book a little bit, but just on the [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=681.92s)]
*  merits of the interesting example of what you're just laying out is the Chevron doctrine, [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=686.12s)]
*  the Chevron case, right, where kind of simultaneously the Supreme Court has said that [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=691.32s)]
*  the agencies cannot do things that are not specifically legislated via Congress. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=698.9200000000001s)]
*  And it was basically an attack on the EPA and these other agencies who had there's [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=706.36s)]
*  broad funding about what kind of regulations that they were going to do or broad language [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=712.24s)]
*  about what kind of regulations they could do. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=716.1600000000001s)]
*  And then, you know, there's this kind of deference towards the agency heads and what [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=717.6s)]
*  that could mean. And the Conservatives Free Court wanted to rein that in and force [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=721.8000000000001s)]
*  like Congress to be very specific about what those regulations are. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=726.44s)]
*  So on the one hand, they want to rein in the executive branch. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=729.36s)]
*  On the other hand, now, Congress basically doesn't exist anymore. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=733.64s)]
*  And so the Trump administration is just like issuing executive orders like we're deciding [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=737.52s)]
*  how much it was MPCOS today and like tomorrow we're doing that. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=742.5600000000001s)]
*  You know, and so how do you sense that the court is going to kind of balance those two or [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=745.72s)]
*  maybe they're not going to try to balance? [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=750.9599999999999s)]
*  Yeah. So I think there are kind of two different things going on. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=752.6s)]
*  One is I agree with you. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=756.16s)]
*  There's always been this ridiculousness in the Supreme Court's insistence that they are [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=757.9599999999999s)]
*  going to somehow teach Congress to legislate. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=761.84s)]
*  Like, if only the Supreme Court justices undid Chevron and adopted this major questions [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=765.04s)]
*  doctrine, then of course, Congress would just buck the fuck up and start passing more [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=770.48s)]
*  legislation. And it's like, how delusional are you to think that you could [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=774.36s)]
*  single handedly do this? [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=779.72s)]
*  Like, it's not about you. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=781.4s)]
*  And yet they still cling to this fantasy world that just does not describe the reality [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=783.4s)]
*  that we are living in. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=788.96s)]
*  And then, you know, they have also, while they have been skeptical of administrative [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=790.36s)]
*  agencies like the EPA, they have simultaneously been very pro presidential power. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=795.52s)]
*  And these things, right, sit in uncomfortable tension with one another because, of course, [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=800.56s)]
*  right, the idea that an administrative agency can't do shit because it's not the [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=806.24s)]
*  legislature could also be said about the president and yet doesn't seem to give them any [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=810.76s)]
*  pause. And one more thing just on Chevron. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=815.72s)]
*  This is just like this perfect like you were for it before you were against it. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=818.92s)]
*  I mean, Chevron was originally this Republican supported doctrine because it was announced [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=822.8s)]
*  in a case involving the Reagan's EPA. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=828.16s)]
*  And guess who was the head of the EPA at the time? [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=831.36s)]
*  Neil Gorsuch's mom and Gorsuch Burford. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=834.7199999999999s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=837.8s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=839.7199999999999s)]
*  So I kind of write about this in the book as like part of Neal's villain origin story, [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=842.28s)]
*  like his mom got chased out of the EPA. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=846.8s)]
*  And this apparently has given him a complex against the administrative state, which he's [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=849.48s)]
*  been out to get ever since. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=853.48s)]
*  But, yeah, no, it was really wild in the oral argument about overruling Chevron. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=854.88s)]
*  The lawyer who is challenging Chevron was asked, do you want to keep the result in the [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=859.1600000000001s)]
*  Chevron case? And he literally said, well, with respect to Gorsuch's to Justice Gorsuch's [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=864.0400000000001s)]
*  mother's EPA, I think she got she got it right. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=869.36s)]
*  Basically, it's just it's so wild, like how messy that entire scene is. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=872.12s)]
*  So what was the original like Gorsuch's mom as the Reagan EPA administrator? [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=877.52s)]
*  Was going further than Chevron, the corporation thought was, you know, and so they're [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=883.76s)]
*  challenging the rule, the regulation, I guess. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=888.72s)]
*  Well, so, yeah, she was deciding basically when power plants needed permits in order [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=891.4s)]
*  to construct new pollution emitting devices, devices under the statute. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=896.64s)]
*  The statute has rules. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=901.44s)]
*  It's like, OK, if you make a new device, new stationary source, like you need a permit. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=902.48s)]
*  And she said that doesn't include when an existing power plant makes new pollution [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=906.32s)]
*  emitting devices like within the power plant, as opposed to making an entirely new [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=910.76s)]
*  power plant. So that's interesting. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=914.72s)]
*  So this is related to kind of what I want to talk to you about. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=917.96s)]
*  I mean, the. I was challenging old David French about this a couple of weeks ago, and [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=920.56s)]
*  we can continue to hash out this conversation and then weeks ahead. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=925.8s)]
*  But to me, like, I don't want to say that there was no that there never was any [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=929.6s)]
*  coherent, genuine, ideological, you know, conservative view of the court. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=935.88s)]
*  I obviously there are always debates on the right, but like the originalists or the people [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=940.88s)]
*  that are Scalia or whatever, that there's nobody ever that had, you know, coherent view [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=944.36s)]
*  of like what the court's role was, you know, in relationship to the Constitution. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=948.76s)]
*  So I think that there was some of that. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=952.48s)]
*  But I think that as we've gotten into the Trump era, what has been revealed is that [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=954.6s)]
*  similarly to the Trump era, the Trump era is a very, very, very, very, very, very, very [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=960.0s)]
*  too across many other elements of conservatism. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=965.76s)]
*  It was a much, much more about power than maybe they wanted to let on or wanted to even [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=968.48s)]
*  believe themselves going back. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=974.2s)]
*  And that what we're seeing now is a lot of the conservative legal movement kind of [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=976.04s)]
*  backfilling like the rulings that they want or the political outcome that they want and [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=981.36s)]
*  then pushing for a ruling that supports that, regardless of whether it fits within, you [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=987.76s)]
*  know, whatever your your constitutional rubric had been, you know, during the Reagan era. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=992.88s)]
*  What do you I mean, obviously, I think you believe that. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=998.48s)]
*  But could you kind of hash that out and how you get into it in the book? [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=1001.48s)]
*  Yeah, definitely. So the first chapter in the book is partially about the rise of [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=1005.64s)]
*  originalism. And I'm definitely sympathetic to the idea that for some people, originalism [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=1009.76s)]
*  was this kind of pure on its own inherently correct method of interpreting the [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=1014.88s)]
*  Constitution. But originalism to other people was also this intuitive way of explaining [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=1020.24s)]
*  why certain decisions of the Warren court, as well as Roe versus Wade, was wrong. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=1026.32s)]
*  Right. Like they knew they had an intuition that, of course, these things cannot be [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=1031.16s)]
*  correct. And originalism was an easy way of explaining why that was so. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=1035.16s)]
*  And then for other people, originalism was a way of advancing an ideological agenda. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=1040.68s)]
*  You know, Ronald Reckon's attorney general, Ed Meese, you know, just stood up in front of the ABA [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=1046.48s)]
*  and was like, yeah, originalism, that's a way to roll back civil libertarianism. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=1051.72s)]
*  That's a way to advance, you know, our traditional social issues platform. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=1057.16s)]
*  You know, that's also what Stephen Markman, who was one of the assistant attorney generals, [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=1062.1200000000001s)]
*  wrote about originalism again in the 80s. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=1066.4s)]
*  So I think originalism has always been different things to different people. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=1068.4s)]
*  And like any method of interpretation, you know, it has its virtues and it has its vices. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=1073.28s)]
*  You know, it was sold as its principled, its neutral, right. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=1078.76s)]
*  It's easier to apply than other methods. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=1082.7199999999998s)]
*  I think those things are debatable, but that's not to say people didn't believe them. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=1084.8799999999999s)]
*  And that's not to say people weren't pushing originalism for never those reasons. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=1088.76s)]
*  So, you know, I agree with you that originalism, textualism, any method of interpretation [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=1095.04s)]
*  is always going to appeal to some people just on its own terms. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=1100.16s)]
*  But, yeah, then along comes Sam Alito and you put any method of interpretation in his hands [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=1103.1200000000001s)]
*  and he's going to do whatever the fuck he wants with it. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=1109.92s)]
*  And, you know, the Republican judicial selection machine found enough people like that [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=1112.2s)]
*  and perfected the process such that they could give them this tool [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=1118.0800000000002s)]
*  that sounded really nice in judicial confirmation hearings and sounded objective [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=1123.5600000000002s)]
*  and could be explained in, again, like abstract technical ways. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=1129.2s)]
*  But everybody knew what they were going to do with it. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=1133.04s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, you can describe it in the title there as bad vibes, right? [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=1137.08s)]
*  Just how they're going to justify this. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=1142.52s)]
*  And certainly there's some bad vibes around this Supreme Court, [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=1144.6s)]
*  specifically, you know, around Ms. Alito. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=1148.48s)]
*  She is a bad vibe. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=1151.3999999999999s)]
*  She is like a human bad vibe. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=1153.9199999999998s)]
*  I look at all this and I was like paging through it. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=1156.4799999999998s)]
*  And to me, it's like, honestly, I think what we've learned over the past five years [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=1159.1599999999999s)]
*  is that everything, it's like culture all the way down. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=1165.1599999999999s)]
*  Like everything is about kind of like an imaginary or real, in some cases, [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=1168.36s)]
*  culture war that they're in. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=1173.04s)]
*  But sometimes it's a real cultural war over real issues. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=1174.84s)]
*  And sometimes it's kind of this imaginary, I don't like these other guys. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=1177.32s)]
*  And it's more of like a high school cafeteria, like rival gang type thing [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=1180.76s)]
*  than anything actually deeper. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=1184.4s)]
*  And it's like we've now seen in the Trump administration, like he has shat [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=1186.16s)]
*  on every single supposedly principled constitutional argument imaginable. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=1190.24s)]
*  He's shed on every free market argument that every pencilhead on K [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=1197.68s)]
*  Street ever pushed over my entire life. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=1202.48s)]
*  And yet, 96 percent of the people, including most of the Supreme Court, [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=1205.4s)]
*  CBD on Amy Coney Barrett, like has just gone along with it. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=1210.84s)]
*  And it's and then to me, it's just because it's like my side good, [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=1214.8s)]
*  the other side bad. And it's like really not much more than that. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=1218.56s)]
*  Yeah, no, I mean, I definitely think there is some aspect of that. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=1221.76s)]
*  And I think when you say it is about culture, you know, I view the Republican [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=1225.6s)]
*  appointees on the Supreme Court as being acculturated in this like [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=1230.28s)]
*  conservative grievance industrial complex that has taken over the Republican [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=1233.68s)]
*  party. You know, that is the energy that defines them. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=1238.4399999999998s)]
*  They view, you know, Democrats, progressives, anyone that doesn't agree with them [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=1241.76s)]
*  as attacking them and coming after them. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=1246.1999999999998s)]
*  And so they have made the law kind of fashion based on the emotional needs [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=1249.6s)]
*  of at least five men and maybe Amy, right, who believe that equality [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=1254.56s)]
*  is actually a form of discrimination and calling racial discrimination [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=1259.56s)]
*  is actually discrimination. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=1264.8400000000001s)]
*  Like, it's just this nutty kind of worldview where they have such strong main [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=1266.1200000000001s)]
*  character energy that they can make, you know, again, LGBT storybooks about them. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=1270.44s)]
*  They can make the establishment clause into rank discrimination against, [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=1276.72s)]
*  you know, religious and social conservatives. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=1280.68s)]
*  And so when that is the worldview that they were socialized in and when that is [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=1282.76s)]
*  what is being repeated to them in this media ecosystem, they are not going to [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=1289.3200000000002s)]
*  have a political and cultural network that they are a part of. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=1294.6s)]
*  That is, I think, how they perceive most of the cases and many of the issues [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=1298.44s)]
*  that come before them. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=1303.76s)]
*  Yeah, let's talk about the Fed Soc role in all of this, because there also kind of [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=1305.08s)]
*  exists to Fed Sox, right? [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=1309.32s)]
*  Like there are lawyers who go to random schools that go to end of law schools [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=1311.44s)]
*  in the country and are and have more conservative legal views. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=1315.6399999999999s)]
*  And they join little Fed Soc clubs and it helps them get hired for jobs. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=1319.6s)]
*  And then there's like the D.C. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=1323.6799999999998s)]
*  feds and there's some overlap. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=1325.0s)]
*  There's some bleed between the two groups. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=1327.1599999999999s)]
*  Right. Then there's the D.C. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=1328.4399999999998s)]
*  Fed Soc, which is Leonard Leo and the political activists that are that have [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=1329.76s)]
*  pushed this concern, this grievance culture that you've laid out and and tried [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=1334.4799999999998s)]
*  to place the people from the clubs who I think most fit their grievance ideology [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=1339.4399999999998s)]
*  into powerful positions. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=1344.6799999999998s)]
*  So I just talk about how important that is in this whole, you know, and what you [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=1345.9199999999998s)]
*  get into in the book. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=1350.1999999999998s)]
*  Definitely. And I hear a lot of what you are saying in the comments that I see on [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=1351.2s)]
*  social media from many of the lawyers who are in the federal society, but not in, [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=1357.0400000000002s)]
*  you know, the inner circle of the federal society, because they'll make jokes about [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=1362.0s)]
*  how well, Leonard Leo didn't tell me, you know, who I should vote for or Leonard [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=1365.6000000000001s)]
*  Leo didn't tell me what I should think. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=1369.2s)]
*  And it's like that can be true. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=1371.5200000000002s)]
*  Right. Of course, they run all of this programming where they are not necessarily [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=1373.7600000000002s)]
*  getting to know every single lawyer who attends all of these bar association [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=1378.08s)]
*  events, right, in random cities, right, and different schools throughout the [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=1382.32s)]
*  country. And yet that is also part of what gives them purchase and cover, you [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=1385.52s)]
*  know, to do the other things that Leonard Leo is doing, because if you don't [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=1391.04s)]
*  understand how this debating society, right, and how this institution that just [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=1394.76s)]
*  provides forum and networking can also be engaged in this system of selecting [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=1400.2s)]
*  nominees, figuring out who's going to do the things they want to do, then you are [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=1407.56s)]
*  kind of getting the, you know, wool pulled over your eyes. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=1412.24s)]
*  And so I agree, it can do both. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=1415.56s)]
*  It just so happens that doing both things operates to the benefit of the inner [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=1417.8s)]
*  circle part. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=1422.12s)]
*  Right. It gives them more power and influence and allows them align parts of [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=1422.9199999999998s)]
*  the group to essentially put people in these extremely powerful road positions [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=1426.1599999999999s)]
*  where they have control over massive decisions that influence the whole [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=1432.6799999999998s)]
*  country. Right. And so, like, you know, I don't know, I always say this sometimes [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=1436.48s)]
*  to like college campuses when I speak on and it's like, well, you know, some of [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=1439.56s)]
*  my candidates that I worked for looking back on my time, the Republican Party [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=1444.32s)]
*  were good. I still like, right, are good people. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=1447.44s)]
*  And I think we probably have good judgment. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=1450.84s)]
*  And yet, like, if you find yourself as part of a group and you find yourself [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=1452.8s)]
*  having to say, well, my little corner of the group is good. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=1457.04s)]
*  You know, like that's maybe should be a sign that the group that you're in isn't [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=1461.6799999999998s)]
*  that great. There's a splinter effort you should consider. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=1466.52s)]
*  Right. Totally, totally fair point. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=1470.36s)]
*  What do you make of this? I think that the suitor, the appointment of suitor is [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=1473.9199999999998s)]
*  maybe something that hypercharged something. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=1482.6s)]
*  I agree. We're always on this path. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=1487.52s)]
*  Right. Like we're on we're on this, you know, our whole culture, our whole society [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=1489.24s)]
*  has been politicized. So eventually the Republican legal movement was going to be [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=1493.28s)]
*  politicized more and more over time. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=1497.24s)]
*  I feel like that's inexorable. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=1499.32s)]
*  But yeah, Democrats haven't really picked up on that just yet. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=1500.96s)]
*  OK, that's a great point. That's a great point. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=1504.84s)]
*  Why is that? Do you think then we'll get to suitor? [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=1506.48s)]
*  Why hasn't this is one of those things where I feel like I'm not on the inner [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=1508.28s)]
*  circle. I'm not in the inner network. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=1511.68s)]
*  So I don't have real insight into this because I'm screaming at them all the time [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=1513.48s)]
*  to get with the program. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=1517.0s)]
*  And yet they're not listening. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=1518.64s)]
*  This inner circle operates very differently. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=1520.16s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, there are a lot of things that are politicized on the left, no doubt. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=1522.64s)]
*  But certainly the legal argument, like this sort of rubric, like the institutional [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=1526.28s)]
*  legal world has been politicized on the right. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=1531.56s)]
*  I get to say you can't even compare it. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=1533.4s)]
*  It's not even the same ballpark. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=1535.16s)]
*  But, you know, so the suitor gets appointed to the Supreme Court and ends up, you [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=1536.72s)]
*  know, siding more and more with the liberals over time. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=1543.52s)]
*  You know, when I was coming up in Republican politics, there was just this [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=1546.52s)]
*  conventional wisdom, right? [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=1549.52s)]
*  You know, it's kind of this part of this anti-elite sentiment, right? [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=1550.68s)]
*  Like we pick these elites, they go to these elite liberal Ivy Leagues. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=1553.32s)]
*  They say they're conservative, but they get to D.C. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=1556.92s)]
*  and they start going to the cocktail parties. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=1559.76s)]
*  And over time, they start to get more and more liberal. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=1562.04s)]
*  And like that, that served as the rationale for, you know, we need to be more [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=1565.04s)]
*  aggressive about identifying people that are going to be part of our culture war, [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=1572.88s)]
*  part of our grievance war, part of on-side at all times. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=1580.0s)]
*  And I don't know. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=1584.6000000000001s)]
*  What do you make of that? [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=1586.2s)]
*  Like kind of the suitor experience hypercharged, the appointment of these [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=1586.92s)]
*  more kind of partisan ideological judges? [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=1591.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=1595.2800000000002s)]
*  So I don't mean to blame David Souter about this. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=1595.8400000000001s)]
*  He also just died. [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=1598.3200000000002s)]
*  You know, rest easy, King. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=1599.0400000000002s)]
*  You know, it wasn't his fault. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=1601.0s)]
*  I'm just saying it just happens to him. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=1602.24s)]
*  It is not his fault at all. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=1604.28s)]
*  But in addition to this fueling a desire to select individuals who they knew better [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=1606.52s)]
*  and thought would be more reliable votes, it also fueled them wanting to throw their [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=1612.52s)]
*  own cocktail parties, right? [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=1616.68s)]
*  And offer the justices their own PJ trips and create, you know, an alternative media [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=1618.16s)]
*  ecosystem so that they would receive their claps, you know, for doing the things that [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=1623.32s)]
*  the conservative legal movement wanted them to do. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=1628.4s)]
*  So that's also, you know, part of the story of the post-suitor role. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=1631.1200000000001s)]
*  Social incentive structure and anti Georgetown cocktail party circuit. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=1633.92s)]
*  I love that. [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=1637.96s)]
*  That's a great point. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=1638.96s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=1639.92s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=1640.84s)]
*  But yes, this is part of the tragedy of David Souter, who is an independent jurist [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=1642.08s)]
*  who did really care about the facts. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=1647.6s)]
*  And in my view is someone who I would describe as a real small C conservative [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=1650.56s)]
*  judge, right? [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=1655.8s)]
*  Like very incrementalist, didn't want to do real shockwaves through the law. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=1656.64s)]
*  And soon after he is appointed to the court, he decides not to overrule Roe versus [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=1661.68s)]
*  Wade. And that is what sets off these calls of no more suitors. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=1666.08s)]
*  And that's spawned, you know, the kind of increase in the federal society's focus on [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=1670.92s)]
*  identifying nominees who could be trusted as well as, you know, creating this social [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=1676.96s)]
*  incentive structure and professional incentive structure for them to do the quote [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=1681.84s)]
*  right thing. I don't know why the call ended up being no more suitors rather than no [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=1686.1999999999998s)]
*  more Kennedys, because like he did it too. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=1691.1599999999999s)]
*  And he had initially voted to overrule Roe and then changed his mind. [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=1693.32s)]
*  But he was Catholic, I think, honestly, because I think there are a lot of Catholics in [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=1698.32s)]
*  this world, you know, and I just think that he is more so like culturally felt more [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=1703.0s)]
*  like one of them than suitors who kind of felt like this like Northeast defeat, like [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=1709.2s)]
*  fucking Rockefeller, Republican or whatever from a different time. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=1714.28s)]
*  And then, of course, they didn't they didn't scream about Justice O'Connor because she's a [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=1718.24s)]
*  woman. And so, of course, she couldn't be counted on to do the right thing. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=1721.2s)]
*  And Reagan Victor. [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=1723.72s)]
*  What? That's a good point. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=1725.24s)]
*  What? Talk to about Kennedy. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=1727.64s)]
*  Is there any do you have any? Well, how was he able to buck this? [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=1729.6000000000001s)]
*  Do you have any memories or any thoughts about about Justice Kennedy? [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=1732.16s)]
*  Yeah. So obviously, I was not there during Planned Parenthood versus Casey. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=1735.32s)]
*  But I think he has real views about what the Supreme [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=1739.9199999999998s)]
*  Court is for and is very sold on a perception [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=1745.08s)]
*  of the court as this independent neutral arbiter in certain ways. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=1751.48s)]
*  And so the pressure, the political movement to overrule Roe versus Wade, I think, made [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=1756.08s)]
*  him uncomfortable because this is not a man who was at all right, like pro-choice or [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=1762.12s)]
*  sympathetic to the arguments about Roe versus Wade. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=1767.36s)]
*  I mean, he wrote anti-abortion chivalrous into the U.S. [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=1771.08s)]
*  reports when he said without evidence, he conceded there's no data to back this up. [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=1774.0s)]
*  He said, of course, like most women come to regret their abortions. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=1779.08s)]
*  So I think that, yeah, it was it was really his sense [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=1783.12s)]
*  of the court and his desire for it to be independent of politics that probably pushed him and Casey. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=1788.36s)]
*  Wow, how refreshing that is. What a different time. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=1793.76s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=1797.12s)]
*  It's the Supreme Court justice that's like, I'm going to do rulings that go against my [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=1797.7199999999998s)]
*  personal views because I feel like that's what the law says. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=1802.1999999999998s)]
*  That's that feels quaint. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=1805.08s)]
*  Sounds like a fiction book to me. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=1807.32s)]
*  Seriously, definitely not from our era. [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=1810.0s)]
*  All right. Do you have any? I guess I have one more for you. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=1812.52s)]
*  What's the setting aside Dobbs? [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=1815.24s)]
*  And well, I guess I guess let's do a medal stand. [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=1818.8s)]
*  We've got we've got Dobbs and we've got, you know, telling the president that he's immune from crimes. [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=1821.88s)]
*  So what would you say is the third decision that is the most representative of the [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=1828.1200000000001s)]
*  conservative grievance, fringe theories and bad vibes of the Supreme Court? [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=1833.32s)]
*  Man, you're really going to make me pick one. [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=1836.8s)]
*  OK, I'm going to pick two and I'm going to. [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=1838.56s)]
*  OK, a fourth person medal stand is like a little shorter stand for number four. [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=1840.44s)]
*  Exactly, exactly. You always need a first runner up. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=1844.3200000000002s)]
*  So 303 Creative versus Olenus, you know, the recent case where they said violated the [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=1847.0s)]
*  First Amendment to apply Colorado civil rights law that prohibited discrimination on the [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=1852.0800000000002s)]
*  basis of sexual orientation to a wedding website designer. [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=1857.5600000000002s)]
*  And the reason why I just think that is like perfect conservative grievance cannibalizing [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=1860.48s)]
*  the law is first, they insist, well, this case doesn't involve discrimination on the [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=1864.64s)]
*  basis of sexual orientation, because sure, she wouldn't make a website celebrating a [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=1869.0400000000002s)]
*  same sex wedding. But guess what? [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=1873.08s)]
*  She wouldn't make a website for a straight couple that also wanted to celebrate a same [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=1875.0s)]
*  sex wedding. And it's like, get the fuck out of town. [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=1878.96s)]
*  I love these guys. I'm always like, I was trying to get in a fight with somebody over [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=1883.28s)]
*  this case. I was like, I would be on your side if you can find me a single case of a [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=1886.1999999999998s)]
*  baker or a wedding website maker who would not make a make a website for someone who's [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=1890.0s)]
*  on their fourth wedding, a straight couple who's on their fourth wedding or like some [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=1894.9199999999998s)]
*  other a straight couple is on some other that does some other violation of or a straight [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=1898.52s)]
*  couple who had premarital sex. [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=1902.68s)]
*  Like if you can find me one example of this, then I'll maybe think consider your arguments [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=1904.64s)]
*  that it's not about discrimination. [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=1909.24s)]
*  But it's hard to find one of those. [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=1910.8s)]
*  It's always seems to be the gays. [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=1912.28s)]
*  Exactly. Exactly. [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=1913.96s)]
*  And at the same time, they say, well, definitely not discrimination on the basis of sexual [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=1915.28s)]
*  orientation. It is discrimination against religious and social conservatives because [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=1919.52s)]
*  that's really what equality is. [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=1923.72s)]
*  So, yeah, vibes all the way down, conservative grievance, etc. [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=1925.4s)]
*  Then I'd say law of democracy cases like Shelby County versus Holder, where they just [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dPtVsqE1VI&t=1928.6000000000001s)]
