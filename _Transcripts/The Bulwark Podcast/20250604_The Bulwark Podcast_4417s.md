Video Description: The lovelorn TACO trader has been hanging by the phone at 2am hoping China's Xi will call him to make a tariff deal. But that call is not coming without America paying a very high price— because world leaders know that Trump is a feckless, desperate negotiator. Meanwhile, Republicans are blowing off Elon's take-down of the reconciliation bill and prepping to turn themselves into roadkill in the midterms. Plus, Scranton Joe went missing in the White House, and the Dems need to stop listening to the very smart and very sophisticated (202) babies who think sharing the right pronoun is more important than kids actually knowing what a pronoun is.
Rahm Emanuel joins Tim Miller.

*  going to sell out probably today. So I appreciate you guys. Up next, I have a long interview [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=42.0s)]
*  because it was good, man. It was good. I just we had to keep I had to keep it rolling. Alright, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=47.56s)]
*  so we've got a marathon with Rahm Emanuel. I hope you guys enjoyed as much as I did. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=51.44s)]
*  Stick around for that. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=56.2s)]
*  Hello and welcome to the Bulwark podcast. I'm your host, Tim Miller, delighted to welcome today [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=60.48s)]
*  for his first time a guy whose former titles include Congressman, White House Chief of Staff, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=65.0s)]
*  Mayor, Chair of the DCCC, Ambassador to Japan. You figured it out. It's Rahm Emanuel. What's up, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=69.84s)]
*  Rahm Emanuel? How you doing, man? I'm good. I'm good. Not to be a jerk, but I thought I'd start [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=76.52s)]
*  right where I want to begin. You left two titles off. Okay, great. Which titles? I don't know. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=81.47999999999999s)]
*  You're not the only person. Everybody seems to forget these two. I was caucus chair for the [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=88.16s)]
*  Democrats. I just didn't want to say caucus. Yeah, I got it. Cactus caucus. And the second thing is I [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=93.84s)]
*  was a senior advisor for policy and strategy for President Clinton. We really should have forgot [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=99.36s)]
*  Bill Clinton. Yeah, the Clinton thing seems to sorry about this. I'm leaning for coffee. The [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=105.32s)]
*  Clinton title seems to kind of statue of limitations phased out. I guess that's probably right. Though [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=109.64s)]
*  I think we could learn some things from that era. How old were you then when you had that job? [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=118.12s)]
*  31st, 32 when I entered the White House, 31 when I entered the campaign. 32, you're a young man. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=121.4s)]
*  If you look back on that now, what do you think about that era as to what the wise and grays? [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=129.8s)]
*  Do you have any reflections on the Clinton? Oh, yeah. I saw President Clinton three weeks ago. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=135.8s)]
*  We had about an hour together and also HRC. Yeah, it was the most formative period of time for me [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=142.4s)]
*  politically foundational, I would say. And when you look back at, I mean, you look at today's [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=150.79999999999998s)]
*  standards, I mean, I think about the fact that we couldn't get an attorney general based on paying, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=158.56s)]
*  forgetting to pay taxes for the help at the house for maiden otherwise. And you look at some of the [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=165.76s)]
*  not only cabinet members today, you look at what the president is doing, a fundraiser, you look at [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=174.24s)]
*  the congressional hearings over the Lincoln bedroom, you look at crypto fundraiser at the White [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=178.88s)]
*  House and investor meeting. I mean, it's so that's one standard I look at what started an impeachment [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=183.76s)]
*  over, you know, with Monica Lewicki. But on the other hand, I look at the balanced budget, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=190.96s)]
*  a formative I remember, and it's been informative to me when I negotiated the Children's Health [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=196.07999999999998s)]
*  Insurance Program with Bruce Reed and Gene Sperling to I led the effort taking out the [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=200.07999999999998s)]
*  NRA for both the Brady Building assault weapon ban. And it's always striked me. Now this is [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=205.44s)]
*  therapy, so I'm just going to get off my chest, you know, people Bill Clinton was a small board [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=211.76s)]
*  president, balancing the budget small, passing the assault weapon ban against the NRA small [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=216.16000000000003s)]
*  taking on the insurance companies against for children's health 10 million children without [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=221.76000000000002s)]
*  health care, small first president to do anything on climate change, the Kyoto Accords. And I saw [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=225.44s)]
*  I always and then I think appropriately, we can get into this if you want expanded NATO that included [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=231.28s)]
*  Poland, Romania, Hungary, the Czech Republic. So what's that? Hungary was maybe a mess in [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=237.68s)]
*  retrospect with the principal. Good. You couldn't see that far ahead. Some people think America was [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=245.04s)]
*  a mess on that right now. That was the standard. Since we're doing therapy talk what I mean, [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=250.72s)]
*  you've already taken me a different direction than I wanted to start. But like I have I'm curious. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=257.12s)]
*  Now you said you just you saw HRC and bill last week. What's their what's their level of [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=260.88s)]
*  they depressed? Are they down? Are they listening to podcast and getting getting more and more [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=265.2s)]
*  bleak by the day about their outlook on the future? Bill Clinton would I mean, Bill Clinton [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=270.32s)]
*  embodied never stop thinking about tomorrow. He's angry about the fact that we're thinking about [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=275.84s)]
*  yesterday and keep thinking about yesterday's. But his like two things you remember in 1992, [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=280.71999999999997s)]
*  he ran the theme song was don't stop thinking about tomorrow. When he goes to Oklahoma, [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=288.64s)]
*  help after immediately after the bombing 1995 at this, what was then the service and it became [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=296.4s)]
*  a religious service. He said we will be with you as many tomorrow's as it takes to rebuild. He was [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=305.28s)]
*  always both optimistic, hopeful for a kid from hope Arkansas and future oriented and 96 real life. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=311.84s)]
*  The theme and I think appropriately was a bridge to the 20th century, 21st century. And so that [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=320.16s)]
*  I don't I would not characterize. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=327.44s)]
*  HRC has got to be depressed. Someone's got to be depressed in that house. You got to bring balance [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=329.28000000000003s)]
*  in a relationship. Yeah, I don't there's a lot to be upset about. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=333.28000000000003s)]
*  She's a first of all, I'm very careful about, of course ever [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=337.36s)]
*  saying anything about my conversations. Anger would I would not use depressed as the adjective. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=343.44s)]
*  Let's just say that and I'll leave it there. Okay, I'm very careful. I never talked about [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=350.40000000000003s)]
*  enough. I'll let you once I would never want that when I was mayor and I didn't or ambassador and [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=356.24s)]
*  I wouldn't want it and I don't do it to any of the three presidents I worked for. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=363.44s)]
*  All right. Maybe I'll invite HRC on. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=366.64s)]
*  I want to get into you and the Democratic stuff for most of the pod, but we do have some new [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=369.68s)]
*  stuff we got to talk about first that we got the big the big ugly over on the hill. Whatever we're [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=375.44s)]
*  calling it the reconciliation bill. Elon yesterday put this out on his on his social platform. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=381.04s)]
*  I'm sorry, but I just can't stand it anymore. This massive outrageous pork filled congressional [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=387.36s)]
*  bill. I'm sorry, but I just can't stand it anymore. This massive outrageous pork filled congressional [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=392.15999999999997s)]
*  spending bill is a disgusting abomination shame on those who voted for it. You know you did wrong. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=396.32s)]
*  It will massively increase the gigantic budget deficit 2.5 trillion. I guess you got to hand it [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=401.12s)]
*  to Elon on one. So what do you make of the bill and of the this kind of conversation happening? [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=407.04s)]
*  Look, well, I'm going to just talk to you about I mean, where I'm at one. There's a lot of people [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=412.32s)]
*  in the party that's oh, the Democrats don't fight don't fight. Well, you don't have a gavel and you [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=422.8s)]
*  don't have the bully pulpit. But what you can do is win in 2026 and it's framing up for a win. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=426.8s)]
*  Because I think Democrats in the country are very energized and independents are two to one against [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=434.8s)]
*  the incumbent party and the incumbent party is not exactly energizing historically when Trump's not [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=441.12s)]
*  on the ballot. They don't energize. They don't vote like they did when he is. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=445.28s)]
*  In my view, this bill structures exactly where you want that campaign. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=448.56s)]
*  It's tax cuts for the wealthy and health care cuts for the many. I have advocated and I'll say it here. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=458.72s)]
*  I would do a press conference with a big portrait of Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, Tim Cook, everybody that [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=464.96s)]
*  went to the inaugural right on the right side of the left side of the podium. On the right side, [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=472.96s)]
*  I'd have 40 kids. And the reason 40 is because 40% of all American children today get their [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=478.0s)]
*  health care from Medicaid or CHIPs, the Children's Health Insurance Program. And I would say why did [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=484.16s)]
*  these billionaires get millions and millions of dollars in new tax cuts and these kids can't get [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=488.48s)]
*  the right to see their pediatrician? Make it simple. And that is exactly what this bill achieves. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=493.68s)]
*  It cuts health care for working middle class families and their children and it gives tax [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=499.92s)]
*  cuts to billionaires that won't even see it. The only money these billionaires see is what their [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=505.92s)]
*  accountant tells them. They don't even know what they have. They don't know what their worth is. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=511.36s)]
*  The idea that you're giving everybody that attended that inaugural for President Trump a tax cut [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=516.5600000000001s)]
*  worth billions and billions and billions of dollars and kids cannot see their pediatrician. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=522.88s)]
*  And that is a fact of life and the Republicans keep trying to run, hide, camouflage exactly what [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=530.48s)]
*  they're doing. And the bill is going to chase them right down and they're going to be roadkill for it. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=535.76s)]
*  What are they doing? Can you steal man their point? I honestly don't even understand who [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=541.36s)]
*  likes this bill or what the case is for it. Well, the president referred to as one big, [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=546.0s)]
*  beautiful bill. It's the official name, actually. It's in the eye of the beholder. And my view is [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=552.8s)]
*  you should go see an eye doctor because this is not by anything. This isn't the Melania of bills? [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=561.6s)]
*  I wouldn't call it that. She's more beautiful than this bill. This is the ultimate sausage making and [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=567.52s)]
*  it has nothing to do with economics. It has everything. We got to score a victory. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=575.28s)]
*  The crux of this is eviscerating health care for middle class and working middle class families and [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=580.24s)]
*  a literally throwing out of the helicopter cash to billionaires. That is what's going on. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=590.2399999999999s)]
*  Make no doubts about it. And the more and more the people, not only the public learns, the more and [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=596.88s)]
*  more the members who voted for it learn, the more they're trying to run away from it. And it will [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=603.4399999999999s)]
*  find you even when you're hiding, even when you're wearing camouflage and you will be roadkill for [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=607.76s)]
*  this. And they know it. And now they're trying to do everything they can to, say, walk away from [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=613.68s)]
*  this. And what's going to now I'm going to get into that's the political side of it or the public [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=620.0799999999999s)]
*  communication side. I saw today, Senator Thune was saying, well, we're going to because there's no [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=624.4s)]
*  Republican senator that cares about the salt, the tax deduction for local government. And you got a [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=630.56s)]
*  bunch of Republicans in the House who went off and said, oh, I got a $40,000 salt deduction. And [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=636.24s)]
*  that was a high watermark. And now they're going to have to sell, if they want to stand by it, [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=645.6800000000001s)]
*  all these cuts because there's nobody in the Senate that cares about what they care about. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=649.92s)]
*  Couldn't happen to a better group of the three monkeys. And I refer to see no evil, hear no evil, [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=655.36s)]
*  speak no evil. That's how you refer to the Republican congressional wing of the party. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=661.2s)]
*  Yeah. What do you make of the dead point that Elon was bringing up? And you already mentioned the [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=664.8s)]
*  Clinton years balanced budget stuff. I do think sometimes I have Democrats on the pod. They're [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=670.56s)]
*  hanging their hat on the great fiscal responsibility work that they did back when, you know, Michael [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=674.72s)]
*  Jordan was winning championships. So it's been quite a minute since the Democrats were really [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=680.16s)]
*  doing really well on that front. But is this a moment to use that? [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=684.56s)]
*  Let me, let me, let me, if I may, it's your podcast. It's your world. Let's hash it out. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=688.8s)]
*  Well, if you go back, so the only two presidents since 1992 that actually did anything from a [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=695.6s)]
*  fiscal restraint standpoint, Bill Clinton obviously balanced the budget three years [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=705.92s)]
*  a row. The surplus was so good. Alan Greenspan gave a blank check and a green light for Washington [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=710.48s)]
*  to go spend and they spent, they did, but also president Barack Obama. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=716.08s)]
*  He had a horse down his throat after the stimulus and after the Republicans won the House. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=721.2800000000001s)]
*  Well, in all due respect, I would say to you, if you wanted to, after the financial meltdown, [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=725.2800000000001s)]
*  to try to do spinach economics, you would have created the depression that we were all trying [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=731.12s)]
*  to avoid. But the person that gets lost in this, this will show you my bipartisan, this is a moment [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=736.0s)]
*  of bipartisan. No, I mean, he paid a political price for this, but George Herbert Walker Bush, [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=742.4s)]
*  41 and Bill Clinton deserves a lot of credit, a lot of leadership. We, we did both through the [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=747.6s)]
*  first budget and then the balanced budget, the 93 budget of president Clinton. But president Bush, [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=752.64s)]
*  when he agreed to what Senator Mitchell want in the 1990s, raising revenue, set the foundation [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=760.48s)]
*  that Bill Clinton and the Democrats in both 93 and then bipartisan wise in 97 with the balanced [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=768.32s)]
*  budget actually built on. And that's created the economic balance budget for three years. Plus the [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=775.6s)]
*  economy was growing at unprecedented rate because of the introduction of both the internet, certain [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=782.0s)]
*  things were happening in the private sector that complimented the public sector. And the person [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=786.88s)]
*  that gets lost in all the, no, we are better fiscal stewards. No, no, no. George Bush paid [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=794.08s)]
*  a political price, 41. I can't say that about 43, but 41 paid a massive political price because he [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=799.52s)]
*  broke a pledge from 88 when he said, read my lips. You're not going to get fiscal discipline [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=806.96s)]
*  and put America's fiscal house on a trajectory that's just called stable to, I wouldn't say [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=815.28s)]
*  living with means, but stable and manageable without taxes and specifically taxes on the very [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=823.04s)]
*  well to do. Just not. And everybody that says you can do it is deceiving and lying to you. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=829.4399999999999s)]
*  And that's the example. Barack Obama raised taxes on the wealthy, Bill Clinton raised taxes on the [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=837.5999999999999s)]
*  wealthy, Barack Obama and Bill Clinton cut taxes for working lower class, George Bush raised taxes [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=842.7199999999999s)]
*  in all three times and did other things to spending. We're not going to spend here going, [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=848.08s)]
*  I'm not going to play O and B director, but in these things to spend. But yes, the carbon, [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=853.84s)]
*  at least I actually believe, I actually, we have proof that we did it, but you're not going to get [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=862.8000000000001s)]
*  there and we got to stop. We got to actually level with the American people about that. And [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=866.64s)]
*  it's going to be hard because we've been living for the last, including what happened under [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=870.4000000000001s)]
*  President Biden. We've been growing, we've been having deficits as if we're fighting a war [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=875.04s)]
*  and there's no war to show for it. And we're not making a lot of progress that way. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=880.56s)]
*  So you were the point man in 06 when the Democrats took- [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=884.88s)]
*  What's that? [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=888.0799999999999s)]
*  You were the point man in the House in 2006. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=888.64s)]
*  Oh yeah. I thought you said you were a point in 06. I was a point in 04. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=890.64s)]
*  You were the point man. Point guard. You're the John Paxton of the 06 effort to get Nancy Pelosi [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=893.12s)]
*  into the speakership. I have a quick quiz for you and then I want to learn some lessons. I was on [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=899.4399999999999s)]
*  the other side of you in that one. We almost, we almost nabbed you in Iowa three. Do you remember [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=904.48s)]
*  the Iowa three race? Can you pull it? Is that Nagels? No, it's Boswell. Boswell. Yeah. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=908.96s)]
*  Jeff Wimberty. We almost snuck you. It was the second closest one. It was my first job, second- [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=916.0s)]
*  Wasn't that 52-48? Yeah, about. Yeah. Yeah. We'll pull it up here to see if that's right. That sounds [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=921.6800000000001s)]
*  about right to me. I think it was three points. I think it was like a 3.7% spread. It wasn't exactly [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=928.0s)]
*  a full four, but keep going. It was a great race. So what do you learn from that for these guys now? [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=934.08s)]
*  What do you tell Hakim if he calls you about what they should be doing this time? [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=941.6s)]
*  So there's a couple things. You have, obviously it goes without saying as a guy who started in [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=947.6s)]
*  politics, raise money, money, money, money. Okay? But on the thematics, don't make it harder than it is. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=956.08s)]
*  Run against, as I laid out in this thing, the three C's, corruption, cruelty, and chaos. It's a [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=964.1600000000001s)]
*  referendum on them and the rubber stamp Republican Congress and using the tax cuts for the wealthy [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=970.5600000000001s)]
*  and the healthcare cuts for the many. That's the prism. Second, below that, picking your districts. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=977.2800000000001s)]
*  I would have two categories. Any district Donald Trump won 55 or less. Recruit, have a surfboard [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=985.36s)]
*  or surfer in that district. And we'll come back to what kind of surfer and what kind of bailiing suit [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=992.48s)]
*  they're wearing, et cetera. Then I'd have a category kind of 56. And I haven't seen all the [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=996.96s)]
*  districts and based on media buy, et cetera, but I would go 56 to 59. Let's just call it that category [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=1003.76s)]
*  because you're early and you're going to see whether this wave peters out or grows. But the [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=1009.44s)]
*  makings of the wave, which I believe are there, you're going to also have to study and rip apart [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=1015.04s)]
*  what's going on in Virginia specifically in 2025 and understand it. Third, this is very important [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=1019.76s)]
*  data. Nobody's really paid attention to this. To me, this was very, very revealing last week. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=1026.16s)]
*  Mr. Volpe did some focus groups, et cetera, among working men. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=1034.08s)]
*  Stupily, the Democrats are spending $20 million trying to understand it. It's the dumb, [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=1037.76s)]
*  it tells you how stupid we are that somebody would actually, it's as stupid as what the [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=1042.72s)]
*  Republicans did on Hispanics, et cetera, after. Yeah. Yeah, I was there for that. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=1048.32s)]
*  Yeah, I bet you that's legal. So here's the thing. He does the study, but the in there is the roadmap [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=1053.6799999999998s)]
*  and the issue that works with 18 to 35 year old men, most potently- [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=1064.1599999999999s)]
*  Porn. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=1072.08s)]
*  Is the fact that the Republicans were cutting veterans' benefits and it really drove them like [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=1072.56s)]
*  no other issue, not minimum wage, that drove them. Pause. In Florida, in the special election, [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=1078.56s)]
*  the day that we had both Wisconsin, the two specials, I harped on this. Didn't know why, [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=1087.44s)]
*  but it was in Escambia County where Pensacola is, there's 14% veterans. The national average is six, [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=1092.96s)]
*  so it's more than double. Donald Trump wins that district in 2024 by 19%. The Democrats in this [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=1100.48s)]
*  special win Escambia County, Pensacola by plus three. So that's a 22 point swing. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=1110.32s)]
*  Then when you look at this data by Volpe, it tells you that veterans and the cuts that both [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=1118.0s)]
*  Elon Musk and the Republicans are pushing is a huge opportunity to start a dialogue [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=1122.96s)]
*  with young men, working men of all ethnicities and races. Pause. Recruitment. We did this by [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=1128.3999999999999s)]
*  gut in 06. Now you have the data, both 06, 08, and 2018 and 2022 recruit heavily veterans. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=1136.08s)]
*  Unbelievable, because by, I've always said the messenger was part of the message. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=1145.84s)]
*  And you know, whether you're in the Air Force, whether you're in the national security, whether [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=1152.32s)]
*  you're, and it doesn't have to be male, as both Abigail in Virginia is showing you, the Senator. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=1156.16s)]
*  Yeah, Alyssa doesn't. But that profile [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=1162.5600000000002s)]
*  calms down a set of cultural barriers where the rest of the Democratic message and character [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=1168.64s)]
*  gets hurt. And so to me, rubber stamp, corruption is core and center. This bill, hang it around [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=1174.88s)]
*  their neck, make them choke on it, and then have a bunch of people that look at and help [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=1183.68s)]
*  communicate that we're a safe set of hands. Then the last and final, spend all your time on them. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=1192.0800000000002s)]
*  It's not about us. Us is the recruitment. Build the case. And if I said, there's a lesson out of 06. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=1200.48s)]
*  When I first did the first website ever, and I did the house that Tom Delay built, and it was [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=1208.0s)]
*  a website about all the corruption, everybody kind of like, this is a gimmick. But by the time [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=1212.96s)]
*  16 months played out, Bob Nay, Duke Cunningham, Renzi out of there, the house that Tom Delay... [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=1219.3600000000001s)]
*  Mark Foley is the one that fucked us. I just looked at this, 51-47, you're pretty close. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=1226.4s)]
*  Yeah, that was pretty good. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=1231.04s)]
*  I said it's a little... [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=1233.44s)]
*  Yeah, well, you weren't tied. You broke our momentum. And then Foley kind of goes with his, [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=1234.24s)]
*  no, no, you weren't tied. Anyway, fast forward, [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=1241.4399999999998s)]
*  somewhere in the spring of 2026, early summer, and I would lay out a 6 in 2026. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=1248.4799999999998s)]
*  We had, the last time there was a minimum wage, the number one issue in 6 and 06 [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=1258.2399999999998s)]
*  was raising the minimum wage. And that was the last time I never got rates. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=1263.04s)]
*  So I would have referendum, referendum, referendum. Here's what we'll do if we get [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=1266.8s)]
*  the keys to the car, 6 months. Don't make it hard. And what I would say to the Democrats, [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=1271.9199999999998s)]
*  which I know how caucuses develop, don't have a bad case of the for reals. This is not about now. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=1277.6s)]
*  They don't sit there and sit there and spend hours and hours about the comma. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=1283.84s)]
*  Well, what is the income group? Shut up. 6 in 2026. I don't want to get... This is the problem. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=1287.84s)]
*  Democrats have a horrible degenerative gene that think they're actually when they're in the minority, [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=1296.8s)]
*  they're governing. No, it's on them. It's a referendum on them. They are the rubber stamp. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=1302.9599999999998s)]
*  And then you just have to be a safe set of hands. Not experts. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=1309.84s)]
*  I'm looking at all that. The recruiting thing is so important. It's something that anytime [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=1313.76s)]
*  a Democrat calls me, I'm like, find people who didn't go to fucking college or who went to college [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=1316.8799999999999s)]

*  I'm so sick of having valedictorians being every Democratic candidate. It's like, oh, wait, we [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=1328.7199999999998s)]
*  recruited the one person who was from this district, but then moved to New York to work [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=1334.3999999999999s)]
*  at the hedge fund and then came home to run for... No. Here's what I would tell you. I remember when [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=1338.3999999999999s)]
*  I was bringing the candidates up to the caucus in 2005, somebody that was an Air Force [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=1343.9199999999998s)]
*  pilot, somebody that worked in the intelligence area and without naming names because the member [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=1351.44s)]
*  is still a member, grabbed me by the... I remember she grabbed me by the hair and says, [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=1357.28s)]
*  these aren't Democrats. And I said, well, I said, let me just be, well, I said the big change we made [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=1364.4s)]
*  in 2006, the candidate you recruited did not have to fit the Washington standard. Washington had to [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=1372.3200000000002s)]
*  be flexible enough to fit the district standard. We changed the priority and we opened up... Now, [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=1379.04s)]
*  again, you had Iraq, that horrible, horrendous war and people were done. And you had people in these [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=1385.04s)]
*  swing districts, they're purplish, lean, slight red, that were... That the profile of a person out of [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=1395.12s)]
*  national security, small business, football player, sheriff, they opened up a segment of voters that [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=1402.08s)]
*  were just waiting but hadn't voted Democratic. And I just said, well, let me just... And I remember [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=1409.84s)]
*  telling the member, I said, one, they're going to vote for Nancy Pelosi. Two, they're committed to [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=1414.72s)]
*  the 6-0-6. That's better than half the caucus today. So I said, get off my back. And I... [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=1420.8s)]
*  That's the big challenge. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=1427.52s)]
*  Obviously, I've allowed insults to be forgotten. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=1429.12s)]
*  Yeah, clearly. I know. We're going... You've pulled some of the 90s already. Do you feel like [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=1432.3999999999999s)]
*  Hakeem has been doing well? What did you have a grade for him so far? [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=1437.52s)]
*  Yeah. I thought the vote, he pulled everybody in it. Look, there's more in the many respects, [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=1441.04s)]
*  and this is a bad sign of what's happened on redistricting, the Democrats today, [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=1448.0s)]
*  and again, I'm showing, obviously, going back to Bill Clinton, the Democrats today, geographically, [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=1455.1200000000001s)]
*  ideologically, et cetera, are more of a unified whole than when you had people from all parts of [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=1460.88s)]
*  the country and all parts of the... So from that perspective, Hakeem's had an ability to consolidate [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=1469.52s)]
*  them and find a way to keep them unified. Nobody broke ranks like on this big, beautiful [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=1476.32s)]
*  abomination. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=1483.84s)]
*  Partly because it was so shitty. I mean, even Jared Golden is like... [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=1484.32s)]
*  Well, that's life. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=1487.04s)]
*  ... yeah, right. But yeah, no, no, no, good. No, I'm with you. That's good. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=1487.9199999999998s)]
*  I mean, that could be... Yeah, it was crappy. Yeah. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=1490.72s)]
*  They probably could have put together a bill that would have gotten Jared [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=1494.08s)]
*  Golden and said he said it was the worst bill he's ever seen. So... [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=1496.56s)]
*  Yeah. Okay. So look, I mean, you can't blame him for making good politics out of that, Hakeem. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=1499.6799999999998s)]
*  That's what leadership is. Now, you got to... And also, you used... Early on, I want to correct, [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=1505.92s)]
*  Paxton was part of a team. So you got to put your team out there and Hakeem is the great leader, [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=1511.8400000000001s)]
*  but he's got to have a team that knows how to recruit, how to raise money, [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=1516.48s)]
*  knows how to message, et cetera. And don't make the message making a sausage making process. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=1519.3600000000001s)]
*  It's not legislating. Message is about communicating to people, persuading them [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=1524.0800000000002s)]
*  who are not yeses to become yeses and keeping... And the one thing that we have right now, [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=1529.28s)]
*  Elon Musk and the president are the gift that keeps on giving. In America, [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=1535.04s)]
*  you have an incredibly energized democratic base. So half the battle is already taken care of. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=1542.48s)]
*  Now we got to get from 47 to 51. Yeah. Our lives now are on that 4%. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=1550.56s)]
*  I want to do a little bit of the democratic messaging. Talk in a sec, just really quick, [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=1558.4s)]
*  two other things on the Trump administration. He's put out this about China. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=1561.2s)]
*  Let me ask you a question. How come I knew the number on the Boswell race, [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=1563.52s)]
*  51, 47 slightly better than you who are living and breathing? I had responsibility for 50 of these. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=1568.32s)]
*  This is what it's... This is the answer, Ram. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=1573.44s)]
*  Did you try to bury that? [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=1574.48s)]
*  This is the answer to that question, Ram. It's when you look back on your life, [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=1575.6000000000001s)]
*  there are different kinds of people in this world. And there's some people that look back [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=1581.3600000000001s)]
*  and have negative views on how things have gone and they remember the worst things. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=1585.28s)]
*  Apparently you, you remember the meanest thing somebody said about you in 1997. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=1591.1200000000001s)]
*  For me, I look back and I remember the five-leaf. I spin things to myself. It's like motivated [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=1594.64s)]
*  reasoning. And I'm like, we only lost that race by three, right? That was close when we thought, [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=1601.3600000000001s)]
*  no, we lost by four and a half. I look back and I bump myself up a point and a half in the memory. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=1605.3600000000001s)]
*  The truth is the number there, 51, 47, is closer. Yeah. So anyway, keep going. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=1611.68s)]
*  I'm just being a jerk. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=1616.64s)]
*  No, let's do it. I'm going to be a jerk here in a sec. We got some Trump stuff. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=1617.84s)]
*  He put this bleed out this morning. I like President Xi of China, always have and always [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=1622.48s)]
*  will, but he is very tough, all caps and extremely hard to make a deal with. That's kind of a beta [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=1628.0s)]
*  tweet for me, but you were Japanese ambassador, so this is kind of a point. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=1633.52s)]
*  I was US ambassador. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=1636.8799999999999s)]
*  US ambassador to Japan. Yes, thank you for correcting me. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=1638.48s)]
*  I was not representing Japan. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=1640.48s)]
*  Okay. Well, you know, okay. We don't have to get into the semantics here, [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=1641.9199999999998s)]
*  I think people are following. But as part of that, obviously in a lot of conversations about [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=1646.88s)]
*  the right way for us to counter China. How do you think the Trump administration is doing on that [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=1652.32s)]
*  score? Well, let me just, so one thing out of the bat, every government does profiles of the other [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=1657.52s)]
*  leaders. Now, not all the countries in the world, but trust me, there's a profile of President [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=1667.04s)]
*  Trump in every country, foreign ministry, et cetera. Donald Trump, the headline of his profile, [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=1673.44s)]
*  Donald Trump is a chump. That's the profile. That's the story and the headline. He, they know it. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=1680.88s)]
*  That's why he got under his skin about the taco, et cetera. He is desperate, desperate [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=1687.44s)]
*  to get on the phone with Xi and Xi knows it and it's going to string him along because he's a [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=1694.24s)]
*  chump. And I used to say this to Bill Clinton, going back to the balanced budget, [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=1699.76s)]
*  because he would at night, he'd take your phone call and he would not give away the story, but he [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=1704.4s)]
*  was much more malleable than we were at the, so I called him in the morning. I said, look, I spent [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=1710.48s)]
*  two hours every morning cleaning up what you gave away at night. So here's the deal. You want to get [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=1715.76s)]
*  to a yes. The other side's got to know you can live with the no. And if you can't communicate that, [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=1720.8s)]
*  I'm putting a play school phone on your, on your nighttime nightstand. That's it. I'm not letting [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=1727.04s)]
*  you do this anymore. I said, I spent the last week from 8 AM to 10 30 cleaning up. I said, so the [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=1731.76s)]
*  other side has to know at the end of the day, you're comfortable. Like on welfare, you vetoed two, [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=1739.12s)]
*  you finally got something. They got to know you're comfortable with a no. You can live in your skin. [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=1746.1599999999999s)]
*  And if you can't communicate that call me, I'll talk to you, but don't call them. [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=1752.48s)]
*  You're the no man. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=1756.9599999999998s)]
*  No, no, I was, but we'll say a couple of things, but the other thing, so I think going now fast [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=1758.3999999999999s)]
*  forward to Trump, she, first of all, the Chinese will not put G in a moment because they've already [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=1764.1599999999999s)]
*  realized the president was deceptive about the conversation they had. That never happened. [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=1772.8799999999999s)]
*  Yeah. Right. They saw Zelensky, they saw South Africa leaders. They've seen other things. They [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=1777.6799999999998s)]
*  don't think he's very, that he announced certain things on conversations with Putin that also are [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=1782.7199999999998s)]
*  not true. So they are not going to put G in there. And if they do do eventually, in the end of the [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=1787.12s)]
*  day, America will have to give away the store before they get on the phone. This is going to [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=1793.6799999999998s)]
*  be the most expensive calling card we've ever had. And the president is not a good negotiator. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=1797.76s)]
*  Contrary to his vision, we have six bankrupt businesses. He gives away the store before he [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=1805.12s)]
*  gets to the table. He doesn't hold anything back. He's desperate for a press release and G is in. [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=1810.6399999999999s)]
*  And I keep saying this on the substance and you got to know the substance. If you wanted to [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=1817.12s)]
*  increase manufacturing jobs, we had 500,000 manufacturing jobs in America on day one with [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=1821.6799999999998s)]
*  a help line on site. Fill those. You now we're supposed to be adding manufacturing and the auto [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=1826.9599999999998s)]
*  industry is saying we're going to close. We're actually going backwards under Donald Trump's [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=1832.4s)]
*  tariffs. And I and G sitting there and saying, I'm just going to keep squeezing and squeezing [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=1836.4s)]
*  and squeezing. And he's going to walk out because Trump's a chump. And that's what's happening. [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=1841.44s)]
*  And the problem and the other problem is if you're going to confront China, [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=1847.8400000000001s)]
*  now you can pass, do a grade on the export controls we negotiated. But on the technology [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=1855.52s)]
*  China hated the export controls, we had Japan, Korea, the Dutch and Taiwan. The big five were aligned. [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=1862.24s)]
*  Problem with Donald Trump. He's pissed off all our allies. Nobody is going to stand with the United [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=1872.6399999999999s)]
*  States. So we're on this solo flight when we had literally a full plane and we had Europe ready to [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=1878.72s)]
*  Europe was confronting China, both militarily, strategically, politically, economically. They [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=1885.84s)]
*  were aligned on us on fighting their coercion, Australia, etc. We had we had also not to leave [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=1890.8s)]
*  Australia out, but on the chip side, I was doing the export control. We had now Japan just saw what [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=1896.1599999999999s)]
*  we just did to them on the tariffs on steel after the Nippon thing. They're going to sit there and [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=1903.44s)]
*  look at the bonds that were the Treasury notes were offering our biggest purchase form purchaser. [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=1910.08s)]
*  They're not going to go not to the level they used to. This was this is the most like everything [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=1914.96s)]
*  Donald Trump does. He's impulsive, never thought through the next move, whatever you want to say [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=1921.2s)]
*  about China. And I don't over inflate them because G has made plenty of mistakes, busting the real [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=1926.72s)]
*  estate bubble, busting the this municipality bubble, attacking the private sector in there. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=1932.48s)]

*  Well, it's meaningful to me. It's my anniversary. It's my anniversary. Yeah, 32 years. [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=2080.88s)]
*  We're coming up on your anniversary. You were 15 minutes early for your first date, I learned, [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=2085.36s)]
*  in the green room. And I want to know what- She deserves combat pay. [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=2089.6s)]
*  She does. She does. I'm getting a taste of it right now. What's the thing that has fucking [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=2093.2000000000003s)]
*  pissed you off the most about the first five months here? What has really pissed you off, [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=2097.92s)]
*  like major blood boil? Major wife annoyed that you were ranting about it to her and had her say, [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=2104.32s)]
*  Ram, I get it. I do think that Donald Trump, [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=2110.7200000000003s)]
*  look, no president has a perfect hand handed off. He had an economy that was growing. He had [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=2115.52s)]
*  the respect around the world. We had the world kind of organized around our areas. [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=2122.1600000000003s)]
*  And he has fundamentally set America back in the world. That's one. And here at home, [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=2126.08s)]
*  he has exasperated this kind of what I call a Hunger Games politics, pitting American [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=2134.88s)]
*  against American. Look, I would say this, you know, when I was ambassador, I learned a lot about Japan, [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=2142.56s)]
*  learned a lot about China, learned a lot about the Indo-Pacific stuff. I did not know it was a great [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=2150.88s)]
*  experience. Actually, being aware, I learned a lot about America, being able to see it from a [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=2154.96s)]
*  distance rather just be in the scrum of the match. And we have incredible, incredible strengths. [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=2160.16s)]
*  And I'll just tell you my one conclusion. There's nothing China does that scares me. [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=2168.64s)]
*  There's this stuff here at home that worries me about the future. And Donald Trump is not just [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=2173.84s)]
*  stylistically, etc. Substantively pitting American against American. And I am furious at this moment [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=2181.68s)]
*  in time. Historically, he could actually do something that pushes America into the future [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=2189.04s)]
*  and makes it more for the working families of this country and the middle class of this country. [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=2198.24s)]
*  And he has pissed it away. Now, is it recruitable? America is an unbelievably resilient country. [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=2203.2799999999997s)]
*  But he has pissed it away. And I can do that, whether it's on the universities and research side, [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=2210.08s)]
*  I can do it as whether it's on the kind of the tax bill that he has everywhere you go. [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=2215.68s)]
*  He took this moment and he could have gone this way, you know, with that famous, [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=2222.4s)]
*  when you get to a fork in the road, take it, you'll be there. And he'd taken every time the wrong fork, [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=2226.56s)]
*  wrong road in that fork. This conversation makes me want to do the [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=2232.48s)]
*  quote about how America will never be destroyed from the outside. If we lose, it'll be because [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=2238.0s)]
*  we destroyed ourselves. But that's actually a fake Abraham Lincoln quote. That's not a real one. But [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=2241.68s)]
*  whoever made up the fake quote is pretty good. Let's give it to Mark. He's not here. [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=2246.24s)]
*  Let's give it to Mark Twain. I want to get into democratic strategy talk. And I've been watching [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=2252.72s)]
*  some of your interviews. And I want to play the audio of one. You have one particular group of [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=2258.24s)]
*  people within the coalition that you're mad at. And I want to listen to you. [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=2262.56s)]
*  I've done a lot of podcasts. [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=2267.6s)]
*  No question. Let's listen to the audio. Please. [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=2268.88s)]
*  To my view, you have a Yeti cup. You fund WBZ NPR. Sit down, listen and say you're sorry. [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=2271.2s)]
*  And I include myself in the same mistakes. If you have a Yeti cup, [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=2277.92s)]
*  be quiet, sit in the corner and listen. Stop talking. [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=2282.16s)]
*  I have a podcast, Ron. You're going to make me sit in the cup chair with my Yeti cup and stop [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=2286.0s)]
*  talking. I'm not allowed to talk now just because I drink out of a lovely Yeti cup that keeps my [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=2289.8399999999997s)]
*  water cool. First of all, when you tweeted that after I said that, my daughter, who's now on her [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=2294.0s)]
*  Navy ship out in the Indo-Pacific, sent me your tweet. So I want to first, and if my memory serves [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=2299.84s)]
*  me correctly, it's the same Yeti cup. It is the same one. I only have one. [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=2306.4s)]
*  We're not gratuitous over here, Ron. I don't have seven Yetis. I just have my one, [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=2311.28s)]
*  you think Yeti cup. My daughter has one. I want to say one thing. I'm a non-podcast. I [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=2315.36s)]
*  was doing an interview with the editorial page, the New York Times, et cetera, off the record. [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=2321.28s)]
*  And I said the same thing. If you have a Yeti cup, shut up. You have something to learn. [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=2325.6000000000004s)]
*  Sit in the corner and actually take notes. What is my swag when I leave? A Yeti cup with a New [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=2330.96s)]
*  York Times logo on it. Yeah, I do. I say that. And I'm really tired. The party used to be a broad, [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=2336.88s)]
*  big umbrella, big tent party. And like everything, the college educated, very smart, very [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=2345.6s)]
*  sophisticated, know how the world worked. The Aspen Institute attending, Brookings Scholarship [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=2354.96s)]
*  attendees and readers of all the journals, sitting around telling everybody how to live their lives. [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=2359.92s)]
*  And they were coastal, et cetera. Now I'm doing this from Chicago, the third coast in America. [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=2366.88s)]
*  And I'm just, you guys have run this car straight into a wall, sit down, shut up, [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=2371.92s)]
*  and actually you have a moment to learn something and stop telling people how to live their lives [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=2377.84s)]
*  because you don't know squat. And nobody's had the balls to tell you that. And I just did. [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=2381.36s)]
*  Maybe it's the Stanley Cup people that are the real problem. I think that this is right for [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=2388.0s)]
*  this reason. Did you say the Stanley Cup? The Stanley Cup. That's the Stanley Cup that's in [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=2393.52s)]
*  Vogue right now. That's what they're doing. There's a lot of real Americans drinking out [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=2398.24s)]
*  of Yeti cups out there hunting. But I take your point. My question is, okay, so you're appealing [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=2403.12s)]
*  to me with this. Shut up, you coastal libs, telling people what words that they need to use [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=2412.0s)]
*  and stop doing that and start actually trying to be responsive to people's lives. Amen. Okay. [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=2417.7599999999998s)]
*  And I'll tell you why. Fundamentally, and this relates to politics, so we should be, [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=2423.68s)]
*  the moment the American dream becomes unaffordable is exactly when our politics become unstable. [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=2433.36s)]
*  You want to strengthen democracy? Strengthen the American dream. That break, both, and I [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=2440.4s)]
*  put it on the Iraq war, which was built on a lie. I put it on the liar loans from the financial [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=2447.92s)]
*  sector and the elite who are responsible to never even think they had anything to do with it, [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=2453.76s)]
*  destroying people's livelihoods. Give people a chance to buy their first home. Give them a [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=2458.08s)]
*  chance when their doctor says you need this healthcare that they don't have to spend six [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=2464.96s)]
*  hours on a phone with some insurance bureaucrat arguing about whether the doctor's medication [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=2468.0s)]
*  and or recommendations are going to be paid for. Stop making them take money out of their 401k [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=2474.96s)]
*  to cover their paycheck. That doesn't go far enough. And to me, we, and I say this, we meaning [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=2482.2400000000002s)]
*  Washington, everybody involved in this should have a moment of self-reflection and realize [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=2488.0s)]
*  you're on the coast. Your kids are fine, but that's not good enough. It's not the American dream. [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=2492.7200000000003s)]
*  If only 10% of the children in America get access to it, the other 90%. And the system is rigged [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=2497.28s)]
*  on behalf of your children and my children. It is. They're going to succeed. I got three great kids. [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=2504.32s)]
*  They all went not just to good schools, they're morally and ethically, I think, grounded. Two are [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=2511.6800000000003s)]
*  in the armed service, one full time. One is a reservist. The other one works also in the national [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=2516.32s)]
*  security space on the thing you were not allowed to say called climate change. And I think, but [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=2522.4s)]
*  do I think my, in the end of the day, I think Amy and I is where on the, we did what we were supposed [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=2529.28s)]
*  to do as parents and our kids go to school. But you can't be content just because your kids are [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=2533.76s)]
*  okay. That's the responsibility you have if you're in public life that other kids, other families [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=2538.2400000000002s)]
*  aren't. And so to me, I do think these Yeti drinking, hiking, Aspen Institute, punks should [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=2544.1600000000003s)]
*  just shut up. Stop telling people how to live their lives and listen to the anguish. And I'll [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=2552.32s)]
*  give you one experience. I told Amy this, it was, we started this thing called Chicago Star [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=2558.88s)]
*  Scholarship. First city to do it. You get a B average and earn that in high school. We made [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=2564.48s)]
*  community college transportation and community college books free. Three years, you use it, lose [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=2570.08s)]
*  it. And I said, you should come when we announce this. Amy, I want you to see this. I had done [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=2576.0s)]
*  like this. I started in 2014. Anyway, 2016, we had three more years. She came in the 2019 one. [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=2582.88s)]
*  And parents would start, come up to you, hug you with tears in their eyes. [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=2590.6400000000003s)]
*  It's a Trump story now. No, no, no. Mr. Emanuel. No, no, no. Sir. I want you to do me a favor. [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=2599.2000000000003s)]
*  This is the Yeti Cup part. Shut up and learn something. Okay. [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=2606.4s)]
*  Because you gave them a chance that they didn't have to pick which child went to college because [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=2613.04s)]
*  they didn't have enough money for both. You helped them that free community college. You helped them [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=2619.36s)]
*  not thinking about a second job or a second mortgage. And to them, this one thing, their child [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=2624.1600000000003s)]
*  earned it with a B average. We didn't just give it. It made a world of difference in their lives and [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=2631.04s)]
*  a world of difference where they weren't failing as a parent. It's an Amy saw it. I remember on our [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=2639.12s)]
*  ride home to saying that was the most powerful thing I've seen in your tenure. And it always [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=2645.6s)]
*  struck me. And I, uh, the kids, some of the kids did a book for me, et cetera, their own stories. [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=2651.7599999999998s)]
*  And then we did this thing called Chicago star plus, which is if you kept your B average in [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=2657.44s)]
*  community college, all the universities in the Chicago area gave you 20 to 50% off years, three [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=2661.2799999999997s)]
*  and four. It made a fundamental difference. Things that I and Amy could do for Zach, Alana, and Lata. [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=2667.52s)]
*  Parents sat up at night, not knowing whether they could do it for their two children or three [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=2676.0s)]
*  children. And we, and we, and the American dream put them in this unprecedented, untenable situation, [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=2681.7599999999998s)]
*  which kid goes to college and which doesn't, which of us are going to take a second job. [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=2689.28s)]
*  And to me, you can't be content if your kids are fine. [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=2695.2799999999997s)]
*  And I really didn't, you and I both work in politics. You go back in our politics, [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=2700.24s)]
*  forget Donald Trump, put him aside for a second. It becomes unstable. It's, and it becomes [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=2706.0s)]
*  rickety. Exactly when each successive year, Washington stands on the sidelines as long as [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=2714.24s)]
*  their kids are okay. And I put this on both parties, but other people's, you know, housing [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=2722.24s)]
*  becomes unaffordable. College people turn themselves into pretzels for their kids. [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=2728.64s)]
*  The 401k is no longer a savings account, but it's a basically a pay now, you know, buy now pay later [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=2733.6s)]
*  type of deal. It's crazy. And healthcare, most importantly, I remember my father on Thursday [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=2740.8799999999997s)]
*  nights was on call, dinner conversations. He was taking the phone. He never spent any time [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=2745.9199999999996s)]
*  as a doctor arguing with an insurance company about whether this young child could get this [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=2751.6s)]
*  procedure. And today we've made life. The dream has basically turned into a nightmare. [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=2757.8399999999997s)]
*  So, okay. So take that Yeti cup and put it where the sun doesn't shine. [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=2764.08s)]
*  I'm happy with my Yeti cup. I agree with 80% of what you said. And I totally agree with what you [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=2770.96s)]
*  said about my kids, your kids being fine. So that's a B average. [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=2776.48s)]
*  Yeah, no, that's pretty good. It's B average. You can get to the community college. And I don't mean [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=2779.68s)]
*  to minimize. I don't want to minimize at all how important that experience was for those kids, [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=2783.7599999999998s)]
*  because it really was. And I think that's a great program. Here's the problem. The other kids in [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=2788.24s)]
*  their community college class are the ones that the Democrats are losing ground with. It's like, [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=2792.7999999999997s)]
*  how do you get, how do you actually get to these people? Because you say like, oh, I'll put the [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=2797.9199999999996s)]
*  turn to like, Trump doesn't actually give a fuck about any of them. Like, let's just be honest. [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=2802.0s)]
*  He doesn't. And yet, they those are the types of voters across all races that are moving towards [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=2805.68s)]
*  Trump and away from the Democrats. And I hear you about how, like, obviously, at an individual level, [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=2812.64s)]
*  there are a lot of people that are going through hard times, but at a group level, actually, [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=2820.48s)]
*  like things are not worse, meaningfully now that they were 1995. When you went, Clinton was elected, [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=2824.64s)]
*  they're not. Okay. So why are they right? But I mean, when Clinton was in, I was just trying to [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=2830.56s)]
*  keep the keep a whole number. I'm just trying to break. I'm trying to break your thought. Thank [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=2837.2s)]
*  you. Right. So what? So what? What is the problem? Why can't you let me let me do two things. One is [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=2841.44s)]
*  beyond the Chicago Star, one of the other things that I wrote about this multiple times, [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=2848.4s)]
*  we're the first city only city and only no state's done this. [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=2852.72s)]
*  You could not get your high school diploma unless you showed us a letter of acceptance from college, [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=2856.0s)]
*  community college or branch of the armed forces or a vocational school. So not just your children, [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=2862.96s)]
*  my children had a post high school plan. We made it universal across the city, every race, [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=2869.2s)]
*  every income, every gender, everything. 99.4% compliance. So that's number one. Well, you're [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=2874.8s)]
*  going to not graduate and stop. You're going to think about tomorrow. Your kids think about [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=2883.12s)]
*  tomorrow. There's a lot of kids in the city of Chicago and across this country that they don't [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=2887.8399999999997s)]
*  have a four year horizon. They barely make a four week horizon. And we're going to change that [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=2891.7599999999998s)]
*  horizon. And we're going to start believing in yourself. Now, the other reason, now to the core [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=2895.3599999999997s)]
*  question, why did Democrats have problems? Because we're punks. And we talk like not only talk like [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=2900.08s)]
*  punks, we talk down to people, we get caught up in a set of issues that aren't relevant. [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=2905.92s)]
*  Think about all this about transgender and sports, etc. There's hundreds of thousand NCAA athletes. [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=2911.52s)]
*  And there's 10 transgender athletes in sports. And this is crazy. As I said in education, we have [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=2918.64s)]
*  the worst reading scores and math scores in 30 years. And we're arguing about bathrooms and locker [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=2928.2400000000002s)]
*  rooms and not the classroom. This is we got one child. That's part of the reason why you're losing [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=2933.76s)]
*  with those voters though. It's not you're not talking about it. The Republicans are talking [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=2938.88s)]
*  about it. And the Democrats didn't have a good answer to it. No, well, that's why they're losing [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=2942.32s)]
*  the voters. The answer is to be honest about it. We're not going to know we're going to we're not [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=2946.4s)]
*  going to talk about the child trying to figure out the pronoun. And that's a legitimate issue. [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=2951.36s)]
*  We're going to talk about the rest of the class that doesn't know what a pronoun is. [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=2954.6400000000003s)]
*  And we're going to we're going to make sure the classroom is the focus of our education policy, [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=2959.04s)]
*  not the name of the school, and not whether you get a bathroom access. And we're going to return [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=2963.84s)]
*  to the core issue. Now take an example out of Mississippi. They're leading the country in [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=2968.56s)]
*  reading scores. Why? Because they're fundamentally focused on attendance, reading, what I call my art [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=2973.68s)]
*  program. A for attendance, R for reading, and T for the truth. We're going to have to tell parents [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=2978.64s)]
*  exactly where your kids are. And here's my thing is that across a whole and the reason Bill Clinton [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=2987.12s)]
*  and Barack Obama won, they were culturally in the mainstream. We look like we're culturally on the [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=2991.84s)]
*  extreme or on or off sides out of bounds. And we have to get back to being an understanding [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=2997.12s)]
*  where people live their lives, how they live their lives and stop telling them. [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=3004.96s)]
*  So what do you want to do? That's a specific example of a cultural issue where you think [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=3008.48s)]
*  the Democrats are out of bounds with the mainstream that they should be back. [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=3012.48s)]
*  I'll give you three. One is the whole issue of pronouns, etc. Two, using and being told [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=3016.24s)]
*  Latinx when it didn't even resonate with Latino voters. They're immigrants. They see themselves [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=3022.96s)]
*  as that. Okay. Number three, I just had my third one. Hold on. You interrupted. I'll give you [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=3030.2400000000002s)]
*  another one. Bill Clinton ran on 100,000 community police officers. My uncle was a cop in Chicago. [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=3036.4s)]
*  We talked about defunding the police. And then when you say stop it, they said, well, it doesn't [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=3041.92s)]
*  mean that. Well, then don't use the English language because usually when people say something, [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=3046.08s)]
*  it's to communicate something. And I'll just give you those three cultural issues. [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=3050.72s)]
*  And I think I think we're and the other I mean, I could go on and on. But to me, [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=3055.4399999999996s)]
*  we were caught on a set of issues and didn't anchor ourselves, not just in the kitchen table. [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=3059.6s)]
*  And this metaphoric notion that the only thing you talk about at the kitchen table are your bills. [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=3067.68s)]
*  You also talk about who your kids friends are, what they're watching on social media, [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=3072.56s)]
*  what's happening at the homeless, homeless encampment that's down the block from your house. [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=3077.2799999999997s)]
*  We were totally a wall from and we wanted only thing we wanted to say was the only issues [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=3081.4399999999996s)]
*  and their core is the cost of living. But if you're trying to be a respected party that doesn't lose [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=3088.0s)]
*  demographic groups, you have to be anchored. Now, let me give you one other piece of this. I want [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=3093.7599999999998s)]
*  to get this point across because I think it's really important for the party. We've decided our [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=3099.4399999999996s)]
*  politics is identity politics. And we're losing ground with quote unquote, African American [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=3104.48s)]
*  his pathos. So if your politics is based on everybody except white people and black ladies, [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=3111.52s)]
*  actually, but that's one. So one, we went backwards and we decided to anchor our politics. [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=3116.2400000000002s)]
*  Because if you do identity, the other side gets to do identity. I'm going to break the news to [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=3124.32s)]
*  Democrats. The other side has more identity than you do. Just do the math. That's number one. So [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=3128.2400000000002s)]
*  it's a bad premise to your politics. Number two is an example of that. Look, Joe Biden was the [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=3134.0s)]
*  first president to ever walk a picket line. And we went backwards with working families. We again, [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=3142.48s)]
*  most progressive president, most progressive since Lyndon Johnson's or Truman from a Democratic [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=3149.44s)]
*  side. There's just no doubt about that. Yet our party decides to run down Bill Clinton, Barack [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=3157.84s)]
*  Obama, both get elected, reelected, both win the bat of the Midwest and win Ohio. [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=3163.12s)]
*  And we went backwards and we're not ready to assess whether the way we're approaching this [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=3169.44s)]
*  is fundamentally from a strong from a theoretical case, flawed. And we approach politics like, [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=3174.96s)]
*  okay, let's go down this punch list. Here's what this group needs here. And then we're sitting like [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=3182.72s)]
*  we treat the American people like we're Margaret Mead and look, look, they have thumbs. Who knew? [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=3188.48s)]
*  Politics is not anthropology, for God's sakes. All right. I'm going to throw two theories at you. [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=3195.52s)]
*  One that is mine and one that is, well, one that is coming from other factions of the party. [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=3201.52s)]
*  Okay. So I agree with everything you said about the three issues, the pronouns, like putting, [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=3206.56s)]
*  you know, if you are, I'd hate to pick on Elizabeth Warren because plenty of people did it, [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=3211.76s)]
*  but I just remember her that she did it. She put she, her and her bio. It's like, we know. [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=3214.64s)]
*  Okay. I don't, I get that you're trying to be respectful, but like, we know it's kind of, [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=3218.64s)]
*  it's weird and insulting actually. The Latin X was stupid. So, so, so did a number of others. [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=3221.8399999999997s)]
*  Yeah. So I, yes, I don't mean to pick on her. I need it. I just, that one stuck in my mind. [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=3226.48s)]
*  The, the cops, I agree with you on all that. You know, who else agrees with you on all that? [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=3231.04s)]
*  Joe Biden, right? Joe Biden was not saying, hi, I'm Joe Biden. I'm he, him. He wouldn't know what [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=3235.6s)]
*  that means. He didn't use Latin X and he was also one of the most pro-cop presidents ever. [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=3240.4s)]
*  The problem was that the party's brand didn't improve because he couldn't fucking talk about it. [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=3245.36s)]
*  He couldn't explain it. He wasn't a good communicator. He was too old. And do you look [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=3251.44s)]
*  back at that and say, man, maybe the problem was we just needed somebody with Joe Biden's [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=3256.48s)]
*  views on all those issues, but someone who could actually communicate it to the country in 2025, [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=3261.52s)]
*  2024? Yeah. Yes. Let me also say one other example that you didn't point. In his last state of the [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=3267.36s)]
*  union, President Biden, last state of the union, when he went off script and everybody said, look, [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=3274.0800000000004s)]
*  watch, he said, illegal immigrants. The next day, because a bunch of Washington 202 area code jerks [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=3282.7200000000003s)]
*  yelled at him. He said, I meant undocumented. That was the slowest pitch over the plate. [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=3293.44s)]
*  Had he done his moment like Bill Clinton did, like Barack Obama did on their different issues, [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=3299.6s)]
*  or Jack Kennedy did, and he said, look, man, they're immigrants across the border illegally, [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=3306.0s)]
*  illegal immigrants. You use whatever undocumented, whatever you want. I'm going to say illegal [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=3312.48s)]
*  immigrants. End of story. He would have shown what people want from a president. Nobody thinks you [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=3316.64s)]
*  deserve to go into the Oval Office if a group in Washington can stare you down because they don't [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=3325.6s)]
*  think you can stare down G or poop. Okay. It's a- [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=3329.92s)]
*  But your book, your speech was in there. You were mentioning him from the 1990s. I don't understand. [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=3333.7599999999998s)]
*  How did they let that happen? You were an ambassador in Japan. How did you let this happen, [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=3337.04s)]
*  the Joe Biden co-op? It's all weird people. You could have come home and been like, man, [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=3341.36s)]
*  we've got to save the country. Why didn't any of the adults who knew better, why didn't the adults [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=3347.44s)]
*  who knew better protect him or help him? Or why didn't they push him out and put somebody in who [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=3351.92s)]
*  could do it? I appreciate, let me say this. I do appreciate that you decided that at 7,900 miles [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=3355.76s)]
*  in Tokyo at the embassy, it was my response- Somebody had to do something, man. Donald [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=3362.96s)]
*  Trump got a second term. I was saying it, where was Bruce Reed? Where were these people? Where [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=3367.2s)]
*  was Steve Rick Shetty? Why weren't they like, no, fuck you to these kids that are trying to make [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=3373.2799999999997s)]
*  you change the way you talk? No. Or why weren't they saying, hey, President Biden, you can't do [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=3378.72s)]
*  this. Let's find someone else who can. It is 100% fair, 100%, which is people in the- Look, [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=3383.4399999999996s)]
*  one thing I know about the White House, that Oval Office is seductive and that White House is insular. [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=3391.04s)]
*  And that's what happened. They decided to put a barrier around and he decided he made a decision, [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=3397.6s)]
*  didn't want to hear anything else about it. And it's wrong. And the country, forget the party, [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=3402.48s)]
*  country's more important, paying a massive price for this arrogance. No doubt about it. [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=3407.2s)]
*  All right. That's something, Adrian. No, but I mean, listen, but I want to say something on Joe Biden. [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=3412.48s)]
*  I saw Joe Biden. My first assignment in 1993 was I was assigned by President [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=3417.76s)]
*  Clinton to work with Senator Biden on both the Brady bill and then the Violence Against [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=3428.32s)]
*  Women Act and Assault Weapon Act. And I did that from the White West Wing. He did it from the Senate. [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=3433.44s)]
*  Our offices were next to each other when I was Chief of Staff and he was Vice President. We worked [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=3440.8s)]
*  together on finding the votes for, I can tell you a funny anecdote about finding Arlen Specter, [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=3445.12s)]
*  but finding the votes for President Obama's stimulus bill, his budget, and for the health care. [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=3450.7999999999997s)]
*  And working with the remaining 14 Democrats in the House, the Catholics from the Midwest who [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=3455.52s)]
*  didn't want to support Obamacare. And he and I worked it. And then I worked with him when I was [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=3461.2s)]
*  7,900 miles away in Tokyo. And he was a different person in each of those stages. No doubt about it. [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=3466.72s)]
*  And it doesn't take a genius. And he made a decision and the staff protected him on that [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=3472.16s)]
*  decision. And we're paying a massive price for it. And anybody can says that otherwise, it's full of [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=3476.24s)]
*  crap. But I also think everybody's rewriting history. This was the most discussed issue for [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=3482.0s)]
*  two years. This was not a national security. We're going to brief the president on his PDP [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=3490.08s)]
*  at 8 a.m. in the morning. If everybody thinks this was a secret, it was your subscription to [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=3496.24s)]
*  the New York Times, Wall Street Journal, LA Times, Des Moines Register, name any social media. It [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=3502.24s)]
*  wasn't a day that went by then. It wasn't discussed. [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=3507.04s)]
*  Our listeners were so annoyed on our fan pages on Reddit, they changed the image of the podcast [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=3510.08s)]
*  to Joe Biden is old to kind of troll us about how much we talk about it. [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=3517.6s)]
*  So I want to get back to the end of the day. Now you can sit here and do all the bloodletting on [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=3521.52s)]
*  that. A couple of your pals in that little circle deserve some bloodletting. And I've got a few more [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=3531.2s)]
*  wounds I'd like to put in them. Okay. But my thing, okay, you messed up. We got 2026. [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=3539.6s)]
*  I want to go do a different thing. You've been like, you've been throwing, I've been throwing [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=3547.12s)]
*  pitches down the middle of the plate. You've been knocking them out for the Bulwark audience. [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=3551.68s)]
*  You know, maybe, maybe the cultural stuff, they went a little bit too far. Democrats, you know, [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=3554.9599999999996s)]
*  should be more aggressive. Yeah, right. Strike the strike. Strike the word baby. Okay. You're in my [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=3559.7599999999998s)]
*  wheelhouse on this, right? Democrats should be, I talk more normal, recruit more regular folks, [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=3564.24s)]
*  like care about work guys, people, education, they should talk about. All right. There's a whole [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=3569.2799999999997s)]
*  other group of the party though, that's out there, including some of our listeners that say that's [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=3572.88s)]
*  not it at all actually. And the problem is the neoliberal economic order and that for the [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=3577.36s)]
*  Democrats to get working class people back, it doesn't have anything to do with Latinx, but it [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=3584.2400000000002s)]
*  has to do with populist economics and that the Democrats should go to the path of Bernie and AOC [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=3588.08s)]
*  and that's the way you get people back. What do you think about that? Well, first of all, [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=3593.76s)]
*  you know, I, if I, I got like seven things I want to say. One is which piece of the, which one, [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=3598.48s)]
*  which was it the piece or the prosperity you were most upset about? Okay. The greatest amount of [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=3603.28s)]
*  jobs, greatest amount of growth, greatest amount of respect for the United States. Go pull up the [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=3609.04s)]
*  stories in 1999 where America was the, it was, saw the, you know, it went from a bipolar world to a [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=3612.24s)]
*  unipolar world. Okay. And working class people were voting Democratic. Not only that, he won Ohio [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=3618.48s)]
*  two times. Okay. So give me a break. And then I can say that about Barack Obama and go through all [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=3626.24s)]
*  the democratic politics. So, and whatever you want to say about the Republicans when they have a [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=3631.04s)]
*  president, they're loyal Democrats trash Bill Clinton and Barack Obama. They just happen to be [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=3636.3199999999997s)]
*  the first two Democrats to be both elected and reelected since Franklin Delano Roosevelt. [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=3642.8799999999997s)]
*  One double the size, triple the size of the earning of tax credit. One of the most progressive [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=3648.0s)]
*  credit, one of the most progressive pieces of the tax code. The other one decided to create, [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=3652.3199999999997s)]
*  it could finally got universal healthcare. The other one decided to get children's health [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=3656.48s)]
*  insurance for 10 billion children that had no healthcare. And they did it with, when the [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=3659.44s)]
*  Congress was in the other party, was in the other party's hands, give me a break. And they weren't [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=3664.96s)]
*  perfect. They're human beings. They got a lot, they got a lot more right than wrong. Now I happen to [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=3672.08s)]
*  think as it relates to what you just said, the second part of what you said is the system is [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=3678.32s)]
*  rigged. Oh, let me say one last thing about both Barack Obama and Bill Clinton. They left the tax [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=3684.1600000000003s)]
*  code more progressive than the day they found it. Both of them. And they both did major things on [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=3689.6800000000003s)]
*  climate change, healthcare, retirement security. Okay. Now the system is rigged against the middle [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=3695.04s)]
*  class and it's rigged against their children's access to that dream. That we agree with the [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=3705.6s)]
*  critique. But the idea that you don't, that somehow culture is not a part of this story. [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=3712.0s)]
*  One fact, Bill Clinton, 40% of his advertising wasn't the economy, stupid. It was, and welfare [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=3722.08s)]
*  as we know it. After Jimmy Carter, Walter Mondale, and Michael Dukakis, being a new Democrat was [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=3729.92s)]
*  crux. And the 40%, the most dominant issue in his advertising in the presidential campaign was on [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=3735.92s)]
*  the cultural plane. Let alone through all the policies, children's health insurance, welfare, [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=3742.08s)]
*  minimum wage, et cetera. Guess what? We actually reduced child poverty from the day he walked in [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=3746.88s)]
*  and continued it on down path. Now, number two, in that vein, how you address what I think, [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=3751.76s)]
*  as I said earlier, and I continue to believe is the North Star for the Democratic Party, [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=3759.6000000000004s)]
*  is the American dream, is owning that home, getting starting on your building a family and [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=3764.32s)]
*  building something. That to me is the core piece of this. But the idea that you could ignore this [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=3769.6800000000003s)]
*  other stuff and just scream louder, here's your program. The last four years showed you, [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=3775.84s)]
*  as you said just three questions ago in the back, Joe Biden was most supportive of the police. [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=3784.6400000000003s)]
*  There was a Joe Biden, a Senator, et cetera, that was kind of grounded in what I call Scrat and Joe. [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=3792.8s)]
*  I think in the White House, they abandoned the Scrat and Joe, and he became a Senator Washington [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=3796.96s)]
*  Joe. I think that was a fundamental problem. I would say that the idea that you think families [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=3801.6s)]
*  across the country don't want to know whether, I don't mean to use shorthand, but whether it was [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=3807.6s)]
*  welfare as we know it, 100,000 community police officers, and what it was called in shorthand, [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=3814.08s)]
*  Sister Soulja, or Jack Kennedy going to Texas and saying, I'm not going to take direction from the [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=3819.12s)]
*  Pope, but I'm going to be a president who is Catholic, not a Catholic president, and Barack [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=3823.92s)]
*  Obama saying it's easy to father a child, but it's hard to be its dad, and being honest about that, [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=3827.76s)]
*  showing that you had the courage and strength to speak honesty about some values issues. [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=3833.6000000000004s)]
*  You think if you think people are only their wallet, and they are principally driven by costs, [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=3838.8s)]
*  et cetera, but somehow their value system and their interest in what their kids are watching [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=3844.5600000000004s)]
*  on social media or accessing doesn't matter to them, then you again are drinking from a Yeti cup. [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=3853.2s)]
*  Let me say one thing, that set of issues like what I talked about recruiting veterans, [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=3862.08s)]
*  because you are grounded in mainstream values with exactly the struggles and challenges, [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=3871.3599999999997s)]
*  look, as a parent of three now grown kids, we did certain things to make sure our kids were [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=3877.36s)]
*  buffered against what was happening in the world around them. Parents today feel they can't protect [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=3884.1600000000003s)]
*  their kids from what they're seeing on social media, they can't protect their kids from what's [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=3889.04s)]
*  going on at schools, et cetera. You should be empathetic to that and address that, and we don't. [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=3892.88s)]
*  We think it's a nuisance. That's why recent immigrants are walking away from us. [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=3900.72s)]
*  We talk about immigrants not as immigrants as people of color. No. Today's Hispanic voters from [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIR0G52AX0&t=3910.24s)]
