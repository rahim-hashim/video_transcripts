Video Description: Republican senators could have insisted on someone who was even minimally competent to run our military, but because of their spinelessness, we've now got a SecDef who can't resist texting top secret war plans. Meanwhile, the Supreme Court shows it doesn't trust the Trump administration, and judges on lower federal courts have stopped believing what its lawyers say. And the uncanny relevance of the American revolutionaries' grievances against King George.

# A WAR Is Brewing Between Trump and SCOTUS! (W/ Bill Kristol)
**The Bulwark Podcast:** [April 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ)
*  But it becomes pretty tough to make the case broadly that Chris Van Hollen or the Democrats [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=0.0s)]
*  that are arguing for the rights of these people are on the side of MS-13 gang members when [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=6.0s)]
*  Brett Kavanaugh and Neil Gorsuch are on their side too. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=10.76s)]
*  Yeah, I agree. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=14.4s)]
*  The 7-2 on the emergency opinion is a real sign that they think we have an executive [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=15.4s)]
*  branch that can't be trusted to follow the law. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=19.64s)]
*  Hello and welcome to the Bulldog podcast. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=30.24s)]
*  I'm your host, Tim Miller. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=31.96s)]
*  We have ended up with a double segment for your Monday pod today. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=34.08s)]
*  My colleague Joe Perticone happened to be in Rome this morning for his wedding. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=38.6s)]
*  And so we have a Catholic Rome correspondent who I spoke to about the death of Pope Francis, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=44.92s)]
*  somebody that I feel a little, even as a lapsed Catholic, a little kindred spirit too, or [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=54.0s)]
*  maybe not kindred spirit, but a little connection to Papa Francisco having been the first Jesuit [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=62.0s)]
*  Pope, someone that has acknowledged the existence of gay Catholics and treated them with humanity, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=68.52s)]
*  came to I think really recognition, washing the feet of AIDS patients in Argentina. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=75.72s)]
*  So it's a sad loss of Pope Francis. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=83.91999999999999s)]
*  I get into that at greater length with Joe Perticone in segment two. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=85.91999999999999s)]
*  But up first, it's Monday. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=89.91999999999999s)]
*  He's the editor at large of the Bullwork, not a Catholic, famously. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=91.6s)]
*  It's Bill Kristol. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=95.8s)]
*  How are you doing, Bill? [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=96.8s)]
*  I don't think I'm famously not a Catholic. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=97.8s)]
*  I mean, you're pretty famously Jewish, I guess. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=99.28s)]
*  I'm famously okay with Catholics. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=101.24s)]
*  Some of my best friends are Pitten and are Catholics, and some lapsed and some not lapsed. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=103.19999999999999s)]
*  A lot of converted Catholics in your world, actually. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=107.56s)]
*  A lot of people coming in and a lot going out. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=110.24s)]
*  A lot of movement in the doorway to Catholicism around Bill Kristol. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=112.68s)]
*  Maybe worth mentioning, I guess, that the angel of death, our vice president, J.D. Vance, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=118.80000000000001s)]
*  did visit Pope Francis the day before his death. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=127.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=131.12s)]
*  I mean, it is a little striking. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=132.12s)]
*  I don't follow the inter-Catholic controversies that much. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=135.36s)]
*  I used to be kind of interested in it, but I've sort of lost touch. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=140.36s)]
*  But he seems to have been a very decent man, as a non-Catholic, looking at it from the [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=142.68s)]
*  outside. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=147.24s)]
*  He seems to have been a very decent man in an age that's not very decent in many ways. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=148.24s)]
*  And in that respect, I looked up to him, and I think he was an important public figure [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=153.08s)]
*  for non-Catholics as well. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=160.24s)]
*  Don't you think, in this moment? [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=161.24s)]
*  For sure. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=162.24s)]
*  I mean, it was a noteworthy change. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=163.24s)]
*  Honestly, much more in tone than an actual doctrine. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=165.44s)]
*  There's a lot of the traditionalists, the trad-caths here in America, tried to make [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=169.84s)]
*  him into something that he wasn't, as far as radical change. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=175.72s)]
*  I still can't get married in the church. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=178.68s)]
*  There still aren't women priests. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=180.36s)]
*  It was more about his tone and his rhetoric, which was a pretty striking change from the [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=181.84s)]
*  severe Benedict. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=186.84s)]
*  I think he was so old, I forget, 75, 76, I think, when he ascended to the papacy. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=190.68s)]
*  It was maybe a feeling that this was sort of a transitional pope, kind of that he would [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=196.36s)]
*  back quickly, not to be macabre about it, back quickly to a more traditional type of [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=203.84s)]
*  pope. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=209.24s)]
*  But he ends up really remaking the types of people that are appointed to become cardinal, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=210.24s)]
*  etc. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=218.48000000000002s)]
*  So I don't know, as I get into it, Joe, it's possible that it may be more of a permanent [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=219.48s)]
*  shift more than transition, and we'll see how the conclave shakes out. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=224.51999999999998s)]
*  So that's that. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=230.67999999999998s)]
*  You know, I guess I just would have to recommend one more time that if you have any elderly [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=233.67999999999998s)]
*  family members, I'd recommend they stay away from JD Vance for the near future, just in [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=238.64s)]
*  case. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=244.12s)]
*  People that might be on their deathbed, how about that for a transition? [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=245.12s)]
*  Pete Hegseth, the Secretary of Defense, a crazy Easter Sunday night series of leaks [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=247.88s)]
*  targeting Hegseth. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=255.36s)]
*  He had, I guess he had fired three people, including his chief of staff, with accusations [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=258.12s)]
*  that they'd been leaking, though there's, I think, some dispute on those accusations [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=266.36s)]
*  now last week. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=270.52s)]
*  The New York Times has a story last night about how there's a second signal chat where [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=274.15999999999997s)]
*  he detailed war plans in Yemen. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=279.4s)]
*  And this chat was not started by Mike Waltz, it was started by Hegseth. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=282.4s)]
*  And it included his wife, his third wife, the former Fox News producer, included his [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=286.68s)]
*  brother Phil Hegseth, his personal attorney. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=292.32s)]
*  Why all these people needed to know when the planes were taking off for Yemen, it is unclear. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=297.08s)]
*  So that story is sort of this extension of signal gate and the extension of this notion [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=303.91999999999996s)]
*  that these guys are totally reckless in their behavior around this type of material. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=309.03999999999996s)]
*  And then subsequently, there's a Politico story that was an op-ed really written by [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=315.88s)]
*  this guy, John Olyott, who's been with Trump, whose Trump spokesman dating back to 2016 [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=321.08s)]
*  on national security issues. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=326.4s)]
*  So a longtime Trump person, the article is almost grotesquely sucking up to Trump to [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=327.52s)]
*  a degree that is hard to bear. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=336.88s)]
*  But once you get through all the Trump suck-up stuff, which he has to share to kind of get [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=338.96s)]
*  his bona fides out there, he basically says that Pete Hegseth is an incompetent, he'd [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=345.24s)]
*  been hired by Hegseth to help set up the public affairs office, he turned down a promotion [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=349.88s)]
*  opportunity because it was such a shit show and he essentially says there are more shoes [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=355.6s)]
*  to drop. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=359.72s)]
*  So that's like a basic summary of the Easter Sunday night hit job on Pete Hegseth. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=360.72s)]
*  I'm wondering what your kind of top line reaction was to all that. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=367.6s)]
*  No, an excellent summary. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=370.44s)]
*  And you said it well last night on the video you did right away. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=371.72s)]
*  I mean, this is one side note on the perils of being a morning, early morning newsletter [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=375.44s)]
*  writer. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=380.64s)]
*  I was planning to write on Hegseth, I watched your video and I thought I read the same thing [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=381.64s)]
*  the Times article, the political piece by Trump's former spokesman and had basically [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=385.40000000000003s)]
*  the same thoughts you had, but I thought I'd write a short thing this morning and just [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=389.24s)]
*  put it in as a, you know, just in the document that we do morning shots in. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=393.2s)]
*  I just put in a headline and then I was going to get up early this morning, which I did [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=397.56s)]
*  to write it, which I did. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=400.72s)]
*  And the headline I put in was goodbye and good riddance. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=401.72s)]
*  And I thought that I woke up this morning to the news that the Pope died. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=405.68s)]
*  I thought maybe not, don't have that headline in morning shots, could be misunderstood. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=408.56s)]
*  So I did change, at least I was alert enough to change that. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=414.08s)]
*  And Joe has a wonderful piece in morning shots, morning shots on the Pope, very similar to [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=417.35999999999996s)]
*  the conversation you had with him, of course. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=422.8s)]
*  But no, I mean, it's there are a couple of points about Hegseth. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=424.24s)]
*  It's the degree of irresponsibility, the first participating in the Waltz signal chat was [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=428.64s)]
*  bad, sharing some of the military details in that chat was bad, but it was with at least [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=436.08s)]
*  his peers, his colleagues in the government. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=441.52s)]
*  So he maybe just forgot this wasn't on the right kind of phone, whatever. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=443.96000000000004s)]
*  This is a private, this is done on his own personal cell phone. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=447.64000000000004s)]
*  It's a group that was set up during his confirmation. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=451.2s)]
*  So it doesn't have government officials, it may accidentally have some government officials [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=453.12s)]
*  or some of the people went into government. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=457.6s)]
*  But it was kind of the group working with him on his confirmation, presumably includes [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=458.96000000000004s)]
*  some PR and political types who were helping him out, lobbying the Hill and so forth, who [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=462.68s)]
*  probably didn't go into government, who had no clearances at all, being beside his wife [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=467.0s)]
*  and then the brother and his lawyer, both of whom are sort of in the Pentagon now, but [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=470.71999999999997s)]
*  they have jobs that do not require them to show the flight plans for the attack on Yemen. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=476.15999999999997s)]
*  So totally irresponsible, beyond irresponsible. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=480.15999999999997s)]
*  I mean, would be a firing offense in 10 minutes in any other administration for the SEC to [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=482.64s)]
*  have to have done this. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=487.59999999999997s)]
*  Incidentally, would be a firing offense for anyone in the military who did this and for [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=488.15999999999997s)]
*  any civilian employee working under Pete Hegseth in the Defense Department. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=492.08s)]
*  So that's A, he should be fired. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=497.2s)]
*  B, the Republican senators might have known this was coming. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=500.24s)]
*  They were warned by an awful lot of people, not just us. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=503.28000000000003s)]
*  Just by the evidence of his life, this kind of thing was going to be a big risk. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=506.32s)]
*  And 50 out of 53 of them voted to confirm him, really a disgrace. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=511.04s)]
*  Any one of them could have stopped it, right? [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=515.28s)]
*  Yeah, it's worth just setting on this for a second because I feel like sometimes, [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=516.88s)]
*  you know, even at the bulwark whose mission is to name and shame the Republicans, [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=522.88s)]
*  sometimes we gloss over it because it's just the expectations are like below the earth. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=527.52s)]
*  They're so low for these guys. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=532.8s)]
*  But like, this is the thing. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=534.24s)]
*  It was just utterly obvious to anyone, you know, like my aunt who does not pay attention, [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=536.4s)]
*  you know what I mean? [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=545.28s)]
*  Like the guy at the corner store, right? [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=546.64s)]
*  Like you don't have to pay attention to politics. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=548.7199999999999s)]
*  Anybody that looks at this person, Pete said, has had never run a large organization. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=550.72s)]
*  He was a weekend Fox and Friends anchor, co-anchor. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=555.28s)]
*  His personal life was a total disaster. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=560.5600000000001s)]
*  And just he had had problems with alcohol, whether or not he still does. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=563.6s)]
*  Debatable, but like, you know, I mean, this was a grown man, you know, at a work conference at 1am, [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=568.8000000000001s)]
*  shouting at the hotel staff while drunk, while like cheating on his mistress with a third person, [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=576.0s)]
*  like the whole thing, you know, and then allegedly assaulting her based on that woman, [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=582.08s)]
*  that married woman's testimony. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=587.36s)]
*  And this is just a person that is a disaster across every possible metric. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=589.44s)]
*  Like there's just no way that you could look at this and say, well, you know, [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=594.48s)]
*  his personal life is a problem, but like, look at his resume or his experience running an [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=597.28s)]
*  organization or, you know, he's run a go or, you know, he hasn't run a big organization, [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=601.6s)]
*  but he's shown a lot of great judgment and the other parts of his life, you know, [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=606.0s)]
*  like there's nothing like, and it was blatantly obvious he should not have this job running [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=608.96s)]
*  the world's largest and most important bureaucracy really are the U.S. military. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=614.72s)]
*  And yet these guys support him. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=620.24s)]
*  Tillis has additional private information about how reckless he is and still goes to vote for him, [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=622.96s)]
*  still decides that his reelection prospects, which are looking pretty shitty right now anyway, [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=630.08s)]
*  are more important than just ensuring that the U.S. military is run by somebody who's like [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=635.76s)]
*  minimally competent to do the job. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=641.5200000000001s)]
*  And it is just really shameful that like the senators did not take the opportunity to say, [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=643.76s)]
*  no, no, we can't do this. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=650.88s)]
*  Like deputy, you know, let him give him some training wheels. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=652.64s)]
*  Or can we make him the spokesperson? [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=656.88s)]
*  But we can't confirm this person. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=659.4399999999999s)]
*  And so here we are. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=661.6s)]
*  And they could have, it's scary to vote publicly, I guess, against someone Trump is behind. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=662.96s)]
*  That's no excuse, of course. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=668.56s)]
*  They could have, four of them could have gotten together and told Trump, [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=670.16s)]
*  withdraw this or we're going to vote. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=672.48s)]
*  They could have, the threat probably would have, might have been enough. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=674.4s)]
*  It was with Gates. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=676.24s)]
*  Wicker, the ranking Republican on armed service, Senate Armed Services, [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=677.52s)]
*  had expressed doubts about Hagseth and subsequently just a week or two ago did send [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=681.92s)]
*  a, co-signed a letter asking for the I.G. investigation of the earlier signal chain, [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=688.0s)]
*  which actually may have triggered some of the events that led to this last fiasco with the [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=692.4s)]
*  firings and the like. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=696.48s)]
*  So he sort of like popped his head up a tiny bit over the rampart. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=698.88s)]
*  But again, too little, too late and inexcusable. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=702.48s)]
*  I absolutely agree. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=705.8399999999999s)]
*  And you're right. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=707.4399999999999s)]
*  We all, I've been looking, I was in some other text chat this morning. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=707.92s)]
*  People were joking about how, you know, someone else who's very, [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=711.5999999999999s)]
*  there's another case of gamerhood is now resume enhancement to say the least and lying basically. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=715.68s)]
*  Some other appointee who's up and someone said, yeah, that person will only get, you know, [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=721.04s)]
*  90% of the Republican votes or 95% instead of, you know, 100%. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=724.8s)]
*  You know, it's, but it is terrible. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=729.28s)]
*  I just like, in three months- [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=733.76s)]
*  Worth calling them out. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=734.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=735.5999999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=736.0s)]
*  And it's worth mentioning that like this, this unraveled in three months. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=736.2399999999999s)]
*  And I go a little over three months to the day from inauguration. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=740.3199999999999s)]
*  That these stories came out and it's like, I mean, how bad of how like horrific of a manager [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=745.92s)]
*  she have to be to take a job. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=752.3199999999999s)]
*  And within a single quarter, somebody that you hired that says that they're a friend of yours [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=754.16s)]
*  is already going to the, like think things are so bad that they need to go to the media and say, [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=759.92s)]
*  guys, we got to move on from this guy. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=765.12s)]
*  You know, and that is, I just think that's pretty notable, right? [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=767.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=772.0s)]
*  These three months have felt like many years, but it's only been three months. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=772.96s)]
*  No, totally. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=776.4000000000001s)]
*  And also that you fired your chief of staff and deputy chief of staff, [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=777.0400000000001s)]
*  two people who work directly for you, not people who were came up through the rather being, [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=781.2s)]
*  so to speak, former Lloyd Austin hangovers or whatever. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=786.24s)]
*  Yeah. Or Trump appointees, because they were buddies of his to be secretary of the army, [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=789.0400000000001s)]
*  that kind of thing. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=792.4000000000001s)]
*  People who work directly and the chief of staff to the deputy secretary, [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=793.36s)]
*  the defense who I believe was a Hex Seth Crote who was imposed on Feinberg. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=796.5600000000001s)]
*  These three all get fired. They get anonymously smeared on the way out, [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=800.72s)]
*  apparently smeared on the way out of the door that they were [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=804.24s)]
*  had problems with this leak investigation. They may have leaked classified or sensitive material. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=807.6800000000001s)]
*  They deny it. And apparently, and the guy, OYOT reports that they have none of those even had [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=812.48s)]
*  a lie detector test. So they lie and smear. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=817.28s)]
*  Yeah. I just read this a little bit from him because I think it's important. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=820.08s)]
*  This is from the OYOT article. He said that defense department officials working for Hex [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=823.12s)]
*  Seth tried to smear these fired aides anonymously to reporters claiming they were fired for leaking [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=828.32s)]
*  sensitive information. Yet none of this is true, says OYOT. While the department said that it [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=832.5600000000001s)]
*  would conduct polygraph tests as part of the probe, not one of the three has been given a lie detector [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=837.6s)]
*  test. In fact, at least one of them has told former colleagues that investigators advised him he was [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=842.0s)]
*  about to be cleared officially of any wrongdoing. Hex Seth's team has developed a habit of spreading [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=846.4000000000001s)]
*  flat out easily debunked falsehoods anonymously about their colleagues. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=851.12s)]
*  No, amazing. Now, one thing you noticed and you stressed last night, and I would say I actually [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=854.08s)]
*  noticed too, and this is probably both from our two backgrounds, yours so much more in campaigns [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=860.8000000000001s)]
*  and dealing with the media in that way and maybe a little more in government, I guess, but it's a [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=866.88s)]
*  couple of campaigns. Like, where did this story come from? You know, most people read, I find this [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=871.12s)]
*  all the time, that you and I have had, this is like our professional deformation. We read a story in [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=875.44s)]
*  the paper and the first question is less what it did it say than why is that story there, [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=880.08s)]
*  especially when it's four sources report. Like, well, who are the sources that would have known [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=884.0s)]
*  about this text chain, right? It's a dozen people. Maybe they blabbed about it a lot, but you [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=887.9200000000001s)]
*  probably have to be pretty close to Hex Seth. Probably in DOD, maybe over in the White House, [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=892.96s)]
*  I suppose, possibly, to have leaked this. Four people talking to the New York Times about this. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=898.64s)]
*  I would say the knives are out for him and this is the point you made and it makes you edit, [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=904.0s)]
*  probably some reinforcement from people still in the administration, not just the disgruntled aides [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=908.48s)]
*  because that anyway, so I think that's pretty striking, right? I mean, and the Trump pushback [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=913.12s)]
*  is very lame, I think, didn't it? What was it? It was kind of a non-denial, this is the fake news [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=921.12s)]
*  press going at it. It's not classified. That was their pushback. Not that he didn't do it. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=925.76s)]
*  It's not, yeah, the flight plans of the F-15s are not classified information or sensitive information [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=930.08s)]
*  that shouldn't be shared on a non-secure cell phone with your wife and other friends, buddies. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=934.48s)]
*  Not military people? Yeah. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=941.44s)]
*  Not. So, I mean, I do think that's, it doesn't prove that they're going to dump him. It proves [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=943.12s)]
*  that the knives are out for him and it suggests to me that he could well be dumped in the next day [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=948.0s)]
*  or two. Do you think? Yeah. I mean, day or two, I don't know. Trump is famously stubborn in these [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=952.96s)]
*  cases and it's sort of like what is Hegseth saying? If Hegseth is on the side of Trump, [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=959.52s)]
*  I mean, he could definitely survive. Like we've been plenty of these situations where it's like [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=966.24s)]
*  everybody around is like, Mr. Trump, this guy is crazy, but Trump doesn't care as long until the [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=969.4399999999999s)]
*  guy because the problem for him. So I think it's based a lot more on that relationship, but [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=974.4s)]
*  regardless of whether he stays or not, just the fact that these people close supporters of Trump, [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=979.12s)]
*  close to Trump, close to Hegseth are the ones that are trying to push him out. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=984.96s)]
*  I think it's telling the other thing that you just from your experience in government, [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=989.12s)]
*  it's just worth maybe saying a word about is just like, you know, you do get into these little [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=992.1600000000001s)]
*  bunkers and bubbles and just like speak a little bit. We talked about last night about like the [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=997.76s)]
*  paranoia, right? Like the idea that you would like fire your close aides and then then you're [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=1003.2800000000001s)]
*  blaming them of things. I mean, it seems like a very unstable place for Hegseth to be, [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=1008.8s)]
*  if you're kind of engaging in this in the media at this point. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=1017.76s)]
*  No, totally. I was struck by the paranoia too. And I think at one point one could make it look, [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=1021.12s)]
*  he's done damage in my opinion to our national security in the few months he's been there. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=1025.76s)]
*  A lot of it would have been done anyway, because the policies weren't his idea and someone else [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=1029.44s)]
*  would have pursued the idiotic culture worst off and gotten rid of, you know, taking down Jackie [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=1033.36s)]
*  Robinson's portrait from the Pentagon and gotten rid of books in the Naval Academy and [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=1038.08s)]
*  announced to the Europeans that we're no longer interested in defending Europe. All that stuff [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=1043.12s)]
*  could have been done by some other Trump appointee as sect. But now that this has all happened, [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=1046.1599999999999s)]
*  leaving him there is genuinely bad for our national security in a very deep way. I mean, [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=1051.1999999999998s)]
*  what do you do if you're a serious person of the Pentagon now? I guess you try to work around him, [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=1055.84s)]
*  but I mean, it's that's not so he is literally in a chain of command. I mean, just let's not forget, [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=1061.04s)]
*  this is not like, you know, Secretary of the Interior, it's a little guys kind of embarrassing [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=1066.24s)]
*  and you just have to sort of hope the department cuts and runs itself. He's literally the next to [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=1071.28s)]
*  the chain of command after the president's not even vice president, you know, so it's he can't [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=1075.36s)]
*  and he can't, you know, the staff can't really run and run him on that. God knows whatever, you know, [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=1080.96s)]
*  so I think the degree to which he really does need to be and this is where I get I come back [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=1086.08s)]
*  to the senators, Roger Wicker, the serious Tom Cotton, serious people who care about national [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=1089.1200000000001s)]
*  security. It's intolerable, the situation that he's sect F and they need to tell the president [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=1093.84s)]
*  that and they need to say it privately if they want for a day or two, but then they need to say [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=1098.8799999999999s)]
*  it publicly. Agreed. Just really quick, since you mentioned a aside, my buddy, Ryan Holiday, [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=1102.32s)]
*  who does the Daily Stoic, you might be familiar with his, his work spirit is a non political guy, [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=1108.8799999999999s)]
*  right? He's had said Maga people on his podcast, like it's a podcast about the lessons that you [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=1115.12s)]
*  can learn from the Roman Stoics and these are many books about that as well. And I, he wrote a book [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=1120.96s)]
*  about kind of lessons of fatherhood for the Stoics that I, we did an interview about him. I think it [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=1127.6000000000001s)]
*  was last Father's Day with him as people want to go check that out. Anyway, he was supposed to speak [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=1131.44s)]
*  in the Naval Academy. It wasn't the first time he spoke there several times and they called him and [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=1135.28s)]
*  were like, are you going to mention the book bands? And he said, yeah, you know, I mean, I own a [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=1139.68s)]
*  bookstore. I write books. It's going to be about lessons from the Stoics, including, you know, [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=1147.36s)]
*  things such as you should engage with challenging ideas. You should engage with ideas that you don't [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=1153.28s)]
*  believe in or else you'll not be able to understand the opponent. Like that's a part of, you know, [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=1158.0s)]
*  of war planning and battle planning. And so, you know, he wasn't going to go, it wasn't a never [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=1163.84s)]
*  Trump thing. It wasn't like having me speak there, you know, it was, it was, but there was going to [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=1168.32s)]
*  be a reference to it. They canceled his speech. The Naval Academy, you know, and this is all, [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=1172.16s)]
*  again, like going back to this sort of ham handed like attack on DEI from the TV host. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=1177.8400000000001s)]
*  I mean, he, I didn't know, I forgot you'd interviewed, you talked to Holliday and I don't [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=1184.96s)]
*  know him at all personally, but he wrote a good piece in the New York Times about this a couple [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=1189.2s)]
*  days ago, you know, which people should read and which, and the context in which he was going to [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=1192.3200000000002s)]
*  bring this up, I believe was he was going to talk about Admiral James Stockdale, a hero of his, [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=1196.0s)]
*  and actually of mine too. And I met him once or twice and always been concerned to try to [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=1201.44s)]
*  redeem his reputation from that unfortunate presidential debate in 1992 when he was running [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=1205.6000000000001s)]
*  with Perot, kind of unfair anyway, but he, and he talked about how it helped him as a prisoner of [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=1210.16s)]
*  war, heroic prisoner of war for five years in Hanoi to have read Marx and to have read communist [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=1216.96s)]
*  works. And he took a whole course at Stanford, I believe where he read, you know, it wasn't balanced [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=1222.96s)]
*  even they just read Marxist Leinander's works and he, and this was not, and he writes about this in [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=1230.4s)]
*  his book and he's a genuine hero and he's a hero at the Naval Academy. And even so, they remove [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=1236.4s)]
*  my angel because it might corrupt the young midshipman, I suppose. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=1242.96s)]
*  Crazy. One more thing on Hickseth, just really quick is that the other interesting thing from [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=1246.96s)]
*  the Olyot story is he has this titillating line towards the end, there are very likely more shoes [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=1253.2800000000002s)]
*  to drop in short order with even bigger bombshell stories coming this week. So we'll see from inside [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=1258.4s)]

*  we talked to Ann Applebaum about this somewhat on Friday, but I was seeing the video as it came in. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=1453.76s)]
*  So I've had a few days to kind of let it simmer, but Rubio is in Europe and essentially says [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=1460.5600000000002s)]
*  that Trump's getting bored with this. Like the negotiation isn't working and rather than, [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=1468.0800000000002s)]
*  you know, there were some reports initially that he was pissed. Remember that it was like that I'm [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=1473.2s)]
*  pissed at Putin. Hasn't been any evidence of that or like any actions that would yield [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=1476.4s)]
*  like the type of response that a pissed person would have. And instead, you know, what the [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=1483.68s)]
*  Larko is essentially saying and the Europeans were trying to kind of translate it was like, [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=1489.68s)]
*  we might just be done. Like if he can't get to a deal here and in a weird way is sort of putting [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=1495.04s)]
*  the onus on Zelensky, you know, on this, like if you can't come to a deal, then the US is just [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=1500.4s)]
*  going to be done. What done means, you know, whether that's Intel sharing, whether that's no [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=1505.04s)]
*  more money, you know, like all that's still a little bit vague, but you know, they're kind [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=1510.0s)]
*  of laying the groundwork for just saying good night and good luck. Yeah, I think maybe it's [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=1513.6s)]
*  even a little more direct is there are some reports now, I think from last night and this morning that [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=1519.12s)]
*  we put on the US put on the table on Thursday in Paris, wherever they were, they were meeting [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=1523.6s)]
*  with the Europeans, the deal that we thought would be acceptable, which is a terrible deal for Ukraine, [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=1529.04s)]
*  needless to say, and that's sort of what Rubio is insisting they accept. So either way, you're [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=1534.24s)]
*  absolutely right. The threat is that we walk away and unless he just takes this deal, that's a very [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=1540.16s)]
*  bad deal and leaves Putin in a very strong position and lets Putin succeed, allows Putin to say that [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=1546.48s)]
*  he will have succeeded in his brutal invasion and also has the prospect for moving sanctions and [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=1553.28s)]
*  stuff like that. So yeah, it's what we've all expected, I guess, with again, it's sort of like [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=1560.4s)]
*  this isn't a surprise, you know, this has been the direction Trump and Vance and Hexeth and all [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=1565.76s)]
*  of them have been going for since they took over basically, and certainly since early February, [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=1570.64s)]
*  February, the Munich speeches, but still, yeah, terrible to see it. And I hope this is where the [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=1575.1200000000001s)]
*  Europeans can make a difference because they they I don't know if the Ukraine can make it just with [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=1582.5600000000002s)]
*  Europe, but I'm not sure they can't. They certainly can for a while. And Europe, I think, [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=1586.64s)]
*  is horrified by this and maybe they'll step up. Yeah, and there are mixed views on that. And, [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=1591.3600000000001s)]
*  you know, Michael Weiss, when he was on a couple weeks ago, was very strong on the fact that he [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=1595.3600000000001s)]
*  felt like Europe could do it if they if there was the will, you know, to do it. I just wrote [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=1598.72s)]
*  noting, because it happened over the weekend on this point. Yeah, like, the the deal is on the [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=1604.16s)]
*  table is a bad deal for Ukraine is also not really a deal, right? In the in the way that like, because [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=1610.8000000000002s)]
*  Putin, there was a Easter ceasefire, you might miss this, but Putin announced, you know, that [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=1615.68s)]
*  he would have an Easter ceasefire because, you know, he is, you know, such a religious man, [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=1621.92s)]
*  so respectful of, of the traditions and the faith. And then he went and flouted it, according to the [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=1626.72s)]
*  Ukrainians, there were two 2800 incidents of firing on Ukrainian territory, during the period [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=1633.1200000000001s)]
*  where Putin said that there was a ceasefire. So it was basically one of these, we're calling for a [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=1641.6s)]
*  ceasefire, you don't attack us, because you don't want to be attacked on Easter, but we're going to [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=1646.08s)]
*  keep attacking you. You know, the whole thing is for postures, as I'm ski, gave a speech about [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=1649.84s)]
*  this, where he said that evil may have its hour, but God will have his day, I think trying to [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=1655.4399999999998s)]
*  demonstrate which is on the side of the righteous here on on Easter Sunday. So anyway, it's a pretty [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=1661.1999999999998s)]
*  bleak situation in Ukraine. Even, I guess even more bleak though, we keep speaking about it [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=1669.3600000000001s)]
*  than the situation in El Salvador, where there was the tiniest, you know, green shoot, [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=1677.44s)]
*  you know, which we discussed last week with Kilmar, Braco Garcia, being able to meet with [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=1685.0400000000002s)]
*  Chris Van Hollen, Chris Van Hollen, finally, you know, being the the democratic leader to demonstrate [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=1688.16s)]
*  that you can have, I don't know if you can get results, but make somewhat of a difference [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=1694.64s)]
*  by actually trying and advocating on this issue. I think there have been some reports from El Salvador [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=1699.44s)]
*  that that Braco Garcia is the first person people have seen leave Sukkot, right? Like previously, [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=1706.24s)]
*  anyone that had went in was there, like, and had not been released again. So something to be said [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=1713.52s)]
*  for that, obviously, there's the big sort of, you know, propaganda back and forth with Bukele trying [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=1720.08s)]
*  to like, whatever, you know, make it seem like they were having margaritas and then Trump, [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=1725.28s)]
*  there's some debate online, the guy has Braco Garcia has the tattoos with a marijuana leaf, [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=1731.84s)]
*  a smile and then a cross and a skull. Some claim that that's an MS-13 tattoo, who knows? And then, [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=1738.1599999999999s)]
*  Van Hollen kind of does the full Ginsburg this weekend going around on the shows. [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=1746.5600000000002s)]
*  I'm in for JBL today and write about that and the triad, but I'm for folks want to go check out the [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=1750.72s)]
*  newsletter, but I'm wondering what you made of the Van Hollen's comments upon return. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=1756.4s)]
*  I'm struck by how many Democrats continue to be unhappy with Van Hollen, I guess. I mean, [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=1763.52s)]
*  I just think he's trying to do the Lord's work, he's doing the right thing, probably politically [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=1767.68s)]
*  right thing to do too, but that's kind of secondary in this case, I would say. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=1773.28s)]
*  But I haven't, I've been on, I don't know how many, two or three Zooms, honestly, since he went there. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=1777.84s)]
*  Gee, we're really uncertain whether this was the right thing to do. I mean, Gavin Newsom, [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=1782.88s)]
*  I guess, is the person who said this most publicly on Wednesday and then we wrote about it. People [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=1786.08s)]
*  tried to walk it back a little bit that he didn't really mean to suggest that it was a distraction. [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=1791.52s)]
*  Distraction. Yeah, we shouldn't worry about people getting snatched up, you know, from the streets of [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=1796.72s)]
*  the U.S. and sent to the school in El Salvador. And then suddenly over the weekend, they're trying [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=1801.2s)]
*  to send more, right? There was this big court case that required the 1 a.m. Supreme Court intervention, [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=1805.28s)]
*  which was required at 1 a.m. only because they had no confidence the administration wouldn't do what [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=1810.32s)]
*  it sort of said it would do, kind of, that it would hold up for a while before shipping this next group [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=1814.64s)]
*  out, which they previously pledged, incidentally, not to ship people out until there was notice and [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=1820.64s)]
*  a chance for people to contest the judgment that they were gang members. Meanwhile, incidentally, [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=1824.4s)]
*  Bukele is also saying that he's happy to trade these people to Venezuela in return for some [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=1829.84s)]
*  Venezuelan political prisoners. I don't know if he's just being buffoonish at this point, but again, [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=1836.08s)]
*  it shows what he thinks he's got here. He's got like human capital, human prisoners he can sort of [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=1840.8799999999999s)]
*  trade, like, you know, trafficking in, right, to get other people he wants. It's all beyond grotesque, [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=1847.12s)]
*  and I'm glad Van Hollen did his best, I think, to protest about it and also maybe to influence [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=1852.64s)]
*  others in the government, including the courts who do follow the news after all. And that's one thing [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=1861.44s)]
*  I'm struck by incidentally, just talking to some of the lawyers over the weekend, the degree to [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=1866.4s)]
*  which judges, very different types of judges all around the country, now have discovered you can't [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=1869.44s)]
*  believe what the Trump administration says, even in court. And that is a little, I think the courts [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=1875.1200000000001s)]
*  have had this, maybe it's a conceit, but a kind of thought that, well, lawyers in court aren't going [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=1879.84s)]
*  to be, you know, bullshitting the way politicians do. That's kind of how it worked in the first Trump [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=1886.0s)]
*  term. There was like this little rigamarole, right, where they were basically honest in court. I don't [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=1890.8799999999999s)]
*  want to overstate it. You know, I'm sure that somebody who has a specific memory of a time where [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=1896.3999999999999s)]
*  they lied in court, but like, directionally, they would say one thing in court that was closer to [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=1900.1599999999999s)]
*  the truth, we'll put it that way. And then, you know, Trump would talk or Spicer would talk, [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=1906.08s)]
*  whatever, and they would say something totally different, right? And, you know, at least in that [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=1910.56s)]
*  way, right, like the courts felt like they were dealing with, you know, a counterparty in the [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=1917.1999999999998s)]
*  government that was like, at least giving them the true facts, regardless of how then the [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=1923.12s)]
*  administration would act. Deep questions about that now, and particularly when it comes to the [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=1928.48s)]
*  immigration stuff. And yeah, I don't, I mean, this is what I wrote about, so I don't want to belabor [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=1934.16s)]
*  the point. In the newsletter, people can get my long views. I'm so just disgusted with the idea [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=1938.24s)]
*  that there's even any debate to be had about what Van Hollen did and whether that's the right thing [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=1944.88s)]
*  politically. For starters, like the election is just so far away that it's just so stupid to think [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=1950.48s)]
*  like it's just, it's the hubris to think that some political strategist or some politician in [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=1955.68s)]
*  Washington can know on April 21st, 2025, what will matter in November of 2026 is just like beyond [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=1961.36s)]
*  comprehension. Like you people have no fucking idea. All right, like you have no idea. And let's not [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=1969.52s)]
*  pretend you did. If you knew on April 21st, 2023 that Donald Trump would be elected again, then [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=1974.8799999999999s)]
*  call me and I'll listen to Dostradamus. But like, let's just have a little bit more humility about [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=1982.08s)]
*  what will actually be a big story in 18 months. But like beyond that, [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=1988.5600000000002s)]
*  there have been substantive, like again, Abrego Garcia isn't out of jail. Andri is not out of that [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=1996.16s)]
*  gulag, the makeup artist. There's this new story from The Guardian over this weekend about Arturo [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=2002.0s)]
*  Suarez Trejo, who's this musician who's in North Carolina, who seems like his situation is pretty [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=2007.76s)]
*  similar to the makeup artist who's there in Sokot now, who does not seem to have any [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=2012.24s)]
*  gang ties. Like these people are all still in prison. But like, we got a proof of life of one of [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=2018.24s)]
*  them. There is a stall now on sending more people there. Like the clock matters here, like stopping [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=2025.2s)]
*  the clock, preventing them from sending more and more people, which they obviously have an ambition [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=2031.92s)]
*  to do, including citizens. That like matters. That is a real policy difference. And that stall [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=2037.76s)]
*  is happening because of the actions of the politicians and the lawyers and the judges, [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=2045.76s)]
*  right? Like all of this like matters in a substantive way. And I don't know, there was a [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=2049.92s)]
*  poll that came out about the non-voters over the weekend that I thought was interesting. [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=2056.4s)]
*  When you ask like Democratic leaning non-voters why they didn't vote, a common refrain from a lot [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=2060.32s)]
*  of them is like they didn't think they were very strong, that they were fighting for them. They're [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=2066.0s)]
*  tough, you know? And I don't know, who knows, right? Like if this will be the kind of thing [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=2069.92s)]
*  that people will think. But I don't think it would hurt for the Democrats to demonstrate [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=2074.08s)]
*  that there are some people in the party that have some actual backbone. And maybe, frankly, [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=2078.88s)]
*  that would have some political benefit. And I think that there's an argument for that that is [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=2084.0s)]
*  just as strong as the argument that like people, that the median voter in 2026 is going to think [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=2088.48s)]
*  that the Democrats are for MS-13 or whatever, because they don't think people should be disappeared [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=2094.88s)]
*  to El Salvador. [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=2099.68s)]
*  Yeah, no, I totally agree. And also, I just want one point about, if I could, about the judge, [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=2100.48s)]
*  J Harvey Wilkinson, who wrote the very elephant opinion on Thursday, I guess it was, it's in [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=2105.36s)]
*  Friday's warning shots. And obviously people can read it anywhere about this program, the seizing [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=2109.2s)]
*  of people and sending them to El Salvador and upholding the pause that the lower court had [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=2117.2s)]
*  ordered on this. J Harvey Wilkinson, I know J Harvey Wilkinson a little bit, he wrote for [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=2124.72s)]
*  the Wicker Center a few times, very old fashioned conservative judge Reagan appointee. One of the [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=2129.68s)]
*  things of being an old fashioned conservative though, is you tend to actually defer to the [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=2134.08s)]
*  government more than a lot of civil libertarians sometimes want. And in fact, Wilkinson wrote an [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=2137.04s)]
*  opinion in 2003, I think, upholding some government actions with regard to Guantanamo and Al-Qaeda [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=2142.16s)]
*  prisoners, which was overturned by the Supreme Court actually, because they thought he went too [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=2148.48s)]
*  far and defer to the government. So this is not a guy who's even a libertarian conservative, [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=2152.32s)]
*  particularly, he's really that kind of old fashioned judicial restraints. He is, A, I think we [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=2156.56s)]
*  sort of ex-Republicans can take some pride that one of the most eloquent statements condemning this [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=2161.44s)]
*  policy of Trump's and the actions of the Trump administration is done by an old fashioned [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=2166.7200000000003s)]
*  conservative, a Reagan appointee. But secondly, it is striking, and this was much too far for him. [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=2170.96s)]
*  And so as I said, this is not a guy who was looking to be famous by being a libertarian on this, [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=2176.96s)]
*  his instinct was anything rather the other way. Like a resistance judge. No, he's just appalled, [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=2181.9199999999996s)]
*  just appalled. And this is not consistent with the most fundamental characteristics of the rule of [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=2187.2799999999997s)]
*  law. Yeah, no, the Wilkinson statement was very, very good. And I think that the fact that [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=2194.3999999999996s)]
*  the, that there was a 7-2 Supreme Court ruling also on this, the blocking of additional use [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=2206.0s)]
*  of the Alien Enemies Act, again, is like somewhat encouraging, right? That it's just, [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=2213.36s)]
*  that it's just Alito and Thomas. And so, you know, like you had Stephen Miller out there saying, [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=2219.7599999999998s)]
*  like, you know, that totally undermined their spin, right? Like that the Supreme Court was [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=2225.12s)]
*  actually on their side, like just nonsense spin. And it's like, you can't, you know, [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=2229.36s)]
*  it becomes pretty tough to make, I mean, you can make the case and it will work for the Newsmax [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=2233.84s)]
*  viewers that are not reachable. But it becomes pretty tough, like to make the case broadly [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=2238.88s)]
*  that, like, that Chris Van Hollen or the Democrats that are arguing for the rights of these people [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=2243.44s)]
*  are on the side of MS-13 gang members when Brett Kavanaugh and Neil Gorsuch are on their side too. [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=2248.0s)]
*  You know? In an emergency opinion at 1 a.m. on a Saturday morning, again, not, you know, [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=2254.6400000000003s)]
*  it's just like, you know, which shows then they joined that they weren't, you know, who knows, [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=2259.44s)]
*  what private leave, which ones wanted to do it at 1 a.m. as opposed to the next day or something. [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=2263.28s)]
*  But that, yeah, I agree, the step and two on the emergency opinion is, it's a real sign that they [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=2267.6s)]
*  think we have an executive branch that can't be trusted to follow the law or to follow the decisions [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=2272.0s)]
*  of other courts, because in this case, they thought it was very clear that the previous decisions [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=2278.16s)]
*  should have bound the executive not to send these people further people the next day. [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=2284.56s)]
*  And it all right. It is. I'm going to end with some Hamilton for the cringe resist [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=2290.0s)]
*  libs that are that are listening. So do you have any other news items before we get to the [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=2295.36s)]
*  attack on King George? I saw this tweet from historian. I hate to not credit her. I'm blanking [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=2300.96s)]
*  her name. I'll put it and we'll put the link to it in the show notes. And it was like a list of [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=2306.72s)]
*  the grievances against King George, the Declaration of Independence. And, you know, you read or hear [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=2313.2s)]
*  various times like the various parts of the preamble, like of the Constitution or the like [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=2319.3599999999997s)]
*  the the main thrust of the declaration. But like you don't reread like the list of grievances all [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=2323.7599999999998s)]
*  that often. It's been a while since I had since I had read them. And so I want to read a couple of [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=2328.72s)]
*  them for people because it is pretty it's pretty jarring just how apt it is to our current moment. [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=2334.56s)]
*  Among them, he has he has refused his assent to laws, the most wholesome and necessary for [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=2343.3599999999997s)]
*  the public good. Another grievance for cutting off our trade with all parts of the world, [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=2348.72s)]
*  for depriving us in many cases of the benefits of trial by jury, for transporting us beyond seas [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=2353.52s)]
*  to be tried for pretended offenses. He has excited domestic insurrections among us. In every stage of [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=2360.3199999999997s)]
*  these oppressions, we have petitioned for redress. The most humble terms are repeated petitions have [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=2367.12s)]
*  been answered only by repeated injury. A prince whose character is thus marked by every act, [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=2371.12s)]
*  which may define a tyrant is unfit to be the ruler of a free people. I just the the section [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=2376.08s)]
*  in particular relating to El Salvador, of the transporting us beyond seas to be tried for [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=2382.88s)]
*  pretended offenses is I it's hard to get more on the nose than that. And I gather from my five [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=2388.24s)]
*  minutes of research on this. And I vaguely remember this from decades ago, when I knew a little more [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=2394.88s)]
*  about this. That was actually a pretty big deal. I mean, that it was considered a real affront. I [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=2398.96s)]
*  mean, that they were sending these colonists to England to be tried, instead of being tried before [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=2403.12s)]
*  a jury of their peers here in the colonies. So and the king was doing this unilaterally. So it is [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=2406.96s)]
*  an apt comparison, as are the others. And and I it's another conversation we should have some time. [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=2413.28s)]
*  I think we discussed this briefly the other day. This past weekend is the third 50th anniversary, [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=2420.08s)]
*  obviously, of Lexington and Concord, the midnight ride of Paul Revere and all that. [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=2423.68s)]
*  We're going to spend now the next year plus celebrating the revolution and then actually [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=2428.96s)]
*  beyond that the actual war that follows from the Declaration of Independence, but the next year [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=2433.36s)]
*  plus celebrating up to July 4th, which will be the turn 50th anniversary. Trump will try to hijack [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=2437.84s)]
*  this and make this a ball about his version of America. Very important that we all in our [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=2443.76s)]
*  different ways. I think it should be a decentralized way and millions of different people could do [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=2448.56s)]
*  millions of different things. Historians get up one kind of, you know, series of panel discussions [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=2452.2400000000002s)]
*  and people like us could do other things at the bulwark, but insist that we are the ones defending [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=2456.8s)]
*  the American Revolution. We're defending what America is about. We are the, if I can put it [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=2461.84s)]
*  this way, the patriotic side in this fight. And it's not just a rhetorical trope to talk about, [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=2466.7200000000003s)]
*  you know, Trump is a kind of mad king. It's it's literally the case that he's trying to [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=2472.32s)]
*  abridge the most some of the most fundamental things that that we fought for in the revolution. [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=2478.32s)]
*  Bill Kristol, I'll see you back here again next Monday. [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ68irm5qlQ&t=2483.04s)]
