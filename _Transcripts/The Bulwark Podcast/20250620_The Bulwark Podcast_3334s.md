Video Description: What if it had been a Harris-Cuban ticket in 2024? Well, it turns out the billionaire entrepreneur had been seriously considered for the VP slot—and we can all dream of a potentially different outcome in the election. Meanwhile, the current guy in the Oval Office is failing spectacularly at the number one job of a president: to reduce the stress of the American people, and to communicate trust and hope. Plus, the Dems need to market their policies better, why much of the business community capitulates to Trump, a debate over AI, is Thiel trying to undermine the dollar, meme coins are the scum of the earth, Bluesky needs to let people fight—and the joy of shooting hoops with the kids. Mark Cuban joins Tim Miller for the weekend pod.

# Mark Cuban Pulls NO Punches | The Bulwark Podcast
**The Bulwark Podcast:** [June 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits)
*  Somebody I kind of trust said that they asked you to send in VP vetting papers and you said no the list would be too long [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=0.0s)]
*  Is that true? [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=7.24s)]
*  It is. Yeah [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=9.0s)]
*  Yeah, why didn't you consider you ended up there campaigning with our advice? [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=10.52s)]
*  Well, the second part of that my response was I'm not very good [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=14.040000000000001s)]
*  It's the number two person and so the last thing we need is me telling Kamala, you know the president that no [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=17.400000000000002s)]
*  That's a dumb idea, right? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=24.14s)]
*  Hello and welcome to the Bullard podcast [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=30.0s)]
*  I'm your host Tim Miller delighted to finally welcome an entrepreneur and investor film producer former owner of the Dallas Mavericks, boo [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=32.0s)]
*  He just wrapped the final season of Shark Tank. It's Mark Cuban. How you doing, man? Good, Jim. How are you doing? [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=38.76s)]
*  I'm doing pretty well, you know with the obvious caveats applying the nuggets aren't in the finals tonight [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=43.76s)]
*  Well, I guess we're taping this on Thursday [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=49.04s)]
*  So the finals might be over by the time people hear this tomorrow afternoon and you know, the world has gone mad [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=50.84s)]
*  But my life's good [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=55.760000000000005s)]
*  You know same right? I mean the Mavs aren't in the finals [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=57.8s)]
*  Nothing else would matter right? What else matters? [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=61.239999999999995s)]
*  I've got so much on a book your brain on and limited time [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=63.839999999999996s)]
*  So we'll just try to move through it all I guess since we're doing the never Trump or podcast [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=66.48s)]
*  I just I kind of want to start with the Trump report card from you because you try to be I mean you're you're for [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=70.67999999999999s)]
*  Kamala and for Hillary, but you try to be a straight shooter, which I appreciate [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=75.52s)]
*  You know, you'll you'll give him you'll give him something. I don't like to hand it to him even you know what? [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=79.4s)]
*  I mean, like I said, I'm not a big fan of Trump [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=84.12s)]
*  You know what I mean? Like I'm reluctant. I'm reluctant to be it's like that old drill meme [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=86.52s)]
*  I'm issuing a correction. You don't got to hand it to the terror group ISIL [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=90.96s)]
*  I feel that way about Trump but but how about how about you? [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=94.75999999999999s)]
*  What kind of report card would you give them right now? [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=97.8s)]
*  Just you know across economy for and if it's other we showed that when I was campaigning for Kamala [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=100.16s)]
*  We said we were gonna do we were gonna shut down the border effectively [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=105.39999999999999s)]
*  Right and we talked about how the new plans from Biden [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=110.03999999999999s)]
*  Have reduced the numbers so that they were lower than Trump in his final month, etc [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=113.28s)]
*  He's done it. He shut down the border, you know, and so he he deserves credit for that [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=118.32s)]
*  He said he was going to change the conversation on DEI. I don't think he understands what DEI is [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=123.56s)]
*  And so I don't know how much he's actually changed other than a lot of copypasta and search and replace [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=130.2s)]
*  And obviously there's been times when you know, there's there's been economic impact where programs have had to be shut down [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=136.04s)]
*  But I think generally across the country. I don't think he's had dramatic changes on corporations [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=142.56s)]
*  But he's done what he said he's going to do right? So that's Harvey milk on the boat anymore. Sorry Harvey. All right, Pete [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=147.72s)]
*  No, yeah [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=154.24s)]
*  and so [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=155.96s)]
*  Third, um, I say deportations. He's done it wrong, but he's done it. I think [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=157.44s)]
*  we get confused a little bit on deportations because [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=164.04s)]
*  He puts everything on tape and he makes everything an event which amplifies it [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=167.92s)]
*  But at least the last numbers I saw he wasn't deporting as many people as Joe Biden [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=172.79999999999998s)]
*  I think that's changing a little bit the last couple weeks. Well, I think he's tried to make it seem like it's changed [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=177.44s)]
*  Right, and he's certainly done a lot of high-profile [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=182.04s)]
*  high-profile [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=185.39999999999998s)]
*  Attempts at deportations for sure, but then he walked it back [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=186.95999999999998s)]
*  I mean were the greatest numbers were you know farm hands, you know working in service [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=190.27999999999997s)]
*  Just like just to be technical because part of the reason this is important the deportation thing is very important to me [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=196.07999999999998s)]
*  So I just like part of that is because Joe Biden gets credit for like he didn't shut down the border the first three years [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=200.72s)]
*  Right. So the people some people are coming across the border then they're getting turned right back around. So that's a one [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=206.72s)]
*  You know that counts as a one in but [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=210.85999999999999s)]
*  That number right so now Trump has fewer but there he's doing more of like the raids of like random businesses and people that have worked [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=214.68s)]
*  So no look when I when I was out there for Kamala and I talked to businesses and I would say do you want somebody walking [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=221.79999999999998s)]
*  In the door asking you for all your i9s and then going in and then taking those phone numbers and showing up at people's homes [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=228.32s)]
*  And we're gonna have Elian Gonzalez day in and day out. So he said he was gonna do that and he's done it [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=235.12s)]
*  I don't say that I'm agreeing with it, but he's doing right and I think he's made a lot of mistakes in his approach, etc [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=241.88s)]
*  But then again, you walked it back and the numbers show at least prior to that that he wasn't even hitting on [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=249.07999999999998s)]
*  By the numbers which obviously freaks Stephen Miller out a lot [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=255.32s)]
*  So that's three number four is what he's done on crypto and with the SEC and I'll separate those two, right? [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=258.4s)]
*  Crypto put aside his grift, right? That's ridiculous [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=264.78s)]
*  The Trump mean coin like literally when that Trump mean coin came out [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=267.68s)]
*  I emailed the CEO and the people I knew at Coinbase and said I was embarrassed to be a customer of Coinbase [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=271.12s)]
*  Because they were trading it he's allowed to do a mean coin more sponsor the military parade [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=278.16s)]
*  You mean Coinbase Coinbase? [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=282.52000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, those guys military for those guys, right? [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=284.52000000000004s)]
*  You know, you got to kiss up to the audience of one [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=287.68s)]
*  So but that said I am a fan of crypto and I think there is utility for it [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=291.16s)]
*  But how how Trump has done it with the meme coin is ridiculous, but that's only one that's up for a I guess [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=295.56s)]
*  For B is the SEC the SEC was a mess and though, you know [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=302.44s)]
*  I truly believe Gary Gensler cost comma of the election, but that's a different conversation [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=306.84s)]
*  Sure, but just generally the way the SEC has historically done business and look they came after me for insider trading [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=314.03999999999996s)]
*  I beat them in about three hours in a trial literally in the time it took for lunch. That was it [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=320.56s)]
*  But their whole spiel has been you litigate to regulate [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=326.9s)]
*  Meaning you don't tell anybody what the rules are [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=331.78s)]
*  But if they believe you broke the rules then they're gonna sue you anyway, which is wrong and this guy who's cut in Kamala [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=333.9s)]
*  When I was when I was out campaigning with her and what talking to Doug about it to come as a smart lawyer and we had [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=339.86s)]
*  This conversation you need bright line rules in the SEC [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=346.14s)]
*  So people know what they can and can't do when it comes to starting or running any business right line rules [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=349.48s)]
*  I think will reduce the number of infractions and lawsuits because people know what they can't do [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=354.90000000000003s)]
*  This the new approach that's what they're doing. Yeah [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=360.38s)]
*  So those were his wins about the negatives. Where do you give him some else? Oh [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=364.34000000000003s)]
*  My god, just [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=369.5s)]
*  No leadership, you know, no ability to make a decision [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=371.46000000000004s)]
*  still listens to the last person he talked to is [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=375.66s)]
*  Excluded from the big boy conversations. Um, I mean the list is long [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=379.26s)]
*  How about your wheelhouse? I mean I cuz to me it's like [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=384.94s)]
*  You know like I mean doesn't understand tariffs, but you know, I just look at it a whole picture [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=388.34000000000003s)]
*  I know what you're doing is he's putting together this this bill on the hill that's gonna raise interest [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=393.66s)]
*  I think this is like appreciate it and I wonder I wonder your take on this [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=397.46000000000004s)]
*  Because the first term he did some pretty traditional [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=400.74s)]
*  Republican economics and took a lot of credit for it and pretend like it was his magic business apprentice skills [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=403.34000000000003s)]
*  But it was like kind of the same policies that mark up what jab what I want. Yeah this time [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=407.66s)]
*  It's been it's different and and the the environment's different because of interest rates a bunch of other stuff globally [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=412.78000000000003s)]
*  So we've got a debt busting bill that's gonna increase everybody's interest rates combined with tariffs that is gonna increase everybody's costs [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=417.18s)]
*  combined with deportations and a culture of fear that is that is gonna affect the workforce like you combine all that shit together and [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=423.74s)]
*  I mean people are like it feels kind of status quo II to buy it and accept her in certain industries like right now in [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=431.98s)]
*  People's lives every day, but I don't I think it's gonna start feeling worse for people not too long for now [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=438.1s)]
*  But already is starting to feel worse, right? I think you're gonna have there's two economies in the United States right now [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=443.02s)]
*  There's all the small [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=449.34s)]
*  Towns and cities and states they're getting torched everything that they've forgotten man, you know [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=451.38s)]
*  There's people the forgotten man exactly really [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=458.18s)]
*  Yeah, the real people that you know working on farms that you know, the people who do are do beef [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=461.6s)]
*  You know that do cattle in Nebraska all the states that have to balance their budget now find themselves [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=467.18s)]
*  Short because of all the Doge cuts or all the office closings or the people that are laid off [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=472.82s)]
*  They're all in deep shit. Like one of my fun pastimes is to look at small town newspapers [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=477.98s)]
*  So like I'll get the the parkersburg Sentinel [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=483.36s)]
*  I forget what it's called [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=486.22s)]
*  and I'll just go reading through it because they'll write about the things that are impacting their local community and I want to [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=487.5s)]
*  Understand where the impact the Doge is having or is not having just to check my whole card and [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=493.1s)]
*  Literally, you know the Daughters of American Revolution Museum type thing that money that they got from the states gone [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=498.58s)]
*  Right that the buildings that house, you know Social Security or you know in Parkersburg, West Virginia [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=505.66s)]
*  It's a town of 29,000 and you know, there's the Treasury group there that has [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=511.54s)]
*  2000 employees and I don't you know at least 125 have been fired but all that the whole all these small towns [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=518.26s)]
*  particularly red towns are [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=525.26s)]
*  Decimated and it's only going to get worse and I think though [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=526.98s)]
*  They're gonna have the hardest time with all the economics and even from a terrorist perspective [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=530.26s)]
*  You know when something goes up in cost and you have to ship it to a small town [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=535.0s)]
*  It's a lot more expensive to ship it to a small town [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=538.42s)]
*  So they get double whammy whereas the blue towns that are the bigger more urbane [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=541.3s)]
*  And [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=546.42s)]
*  Consolidated cities they're gonna get hit less New York LA, right? [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=547.6199999999999s)]
*  They'll have an impact there, but it's not gonna be nearly as bad as the small towns. I want to [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=551.5799999999999s)]
*  Do a little bit of going back unfortunately [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=556.9399999999999s)]
*  You mentioned Kamala a couple times as if you were like you're in the room and so I'm gonna start here [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=559.2199999999999s)]
*  We're just a little gossip at first. There was some green room gossip at MSNBC. You ready for this? You ready? [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=564.18s)]
*  I wouldn't tell you this wasn't like pretty good like somebody I kind of trust said that they asked you [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=568.9s)]
*  To send in VP vetting papers and you said no the list would be too long. Is that true? [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=574.5799999999999s)]
*  It is [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=580.62s)]
*  Why didn't you why didn't you consider I mean you ended out there campaigning with our advice [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=583.5s)]
*  Well, did the second part of that is yeah, the second part of that my response was I'm not very good [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=587.3s)]
*  It's the number two person. And so if the last thing we need is me telling Kamala, you know the president that no [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=592.38s)]
*  That's a dumb idea, right? And I'm not real good at the shaking hands [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=599.14s)]
*  Well, I don't know about that [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=603.3399999999999s)]
*  I was talking to Pete Buttigieg a couple weeks ago and I was like I was like give I wanted to you know [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=604.4599999999999s)]
*  Give you a time machine. We're gonna go back in a DeLorean. Like what can we do different? [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=609.38s)]
*  So I want to ask you that same question, but also in the context like if it was you instead of Tim Walls, I [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=612.74s)]
*  Who the hell knows I don't know it feels to maybe different it feels maybe different [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=619.9s)]
*  I mean obviously would have been different my personality is completely different than Tim's my experiences. My backgrounds are completely different [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=623.9799999999999s)]
*  I think I've cut through the shit more directly [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=631.18s)]
*  I'm not a politician and and so it would have been different but it would have been awful [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=634.26s)]
*  She would have fired [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=640.26s)]
*  Present situation, you know, well, yes, that's true. But you know, I [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=642.46s)]
*  Really thought she was going to win [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=648.14s)]
*  Here's why I here's why I want to pick on that and I know you don't want to cook here [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=649.5s)]
*  You're like we would have won if Mark Cuban was VP and I get that I don't even know if I believe that but maybe [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=652.34s)]
*  I think it would have been [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=658.02s)]
*  Meaningfully different in a way that like picking Josh Shapiro [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=659.3s)]
*  Whatever wouldn't have been meaningfully different in a way that's kind of hard to predict [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=661.74s)]
*  But I was listening to you today with my man Theo Vaughn my fellow Louisiana podcaster and you did two hours with this dude [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=664.38s)]
*  And I listened to all of it on 2x speed and I'm like it's hard for me to [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=670.78s)]
*  The most crazy experience ever can see what next yes crazy this wild [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=677.18s)]
*  He's like asking about porn and gay stuff and like then you get into politics and he's all over the map [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=682.42s)]
*  But like at the end of the two hours [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=687.5400000000001s)]
*  It's still hard for me to understand why he's for Trump like there's no real substantive thing. He's gangster [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=689.5400000000001s)]
*  He's gay. That's what he said, right? Yeah, it's vibes. He's gangster [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=696.02s)]
*  But that's most look most people just want to live their life [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=701.0600000000001s)]
*  They want to get up in the morning with a smile and not be stressed in my mind the number one job of any [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=704.7s)]
*  Candidate and this is where Trump is [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=711.34s)]
*  Spectacularly failed the number one job of any president could be to reduce the stress of the people of the car [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=713.7800000000001s)]
*  That's not working. So there's only one at least no look. There's only one thing we all share and that's our president [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=720.4200000000001s)]
*  Everything else is unique to us, you know, or or unique in a thousand different ways [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=727.7800000000001s)]
*  but the president is the one thing we all share and having somebody who [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=732.58s)]
*  communicates trust and hope and [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=737.98s)]
*  Reduces people stress is critical. But the point being is relating it back to Theo [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=740.74s)]
*  It's not his job to think about all that shit. They're not gonna think that you know about [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=745.58s)]
*  They're not gonna think pragmatically about what's best for me and what's best for the country and that's what the Democrats have to learn [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=751.62s)]
*  People just want to get through shit and get to the game like who's gonna win tonight [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=757.7s)]
*  Like am I going out to get drunk? Where are my boys at tonight? [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=762.02s)]
*  You know who's playing who and what we're gonna talk about how gay the Roman Empire was, you know [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=765.82s)]
*  I'm like whether if you get rich enough you get bored with straight sex, whatever other random shitty ones talking about [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=770.62s)]
*  Here's the thing though. I and I am actually I'm not critical Theo [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=775.32s)]
*  I don't and I wit I wish we lived in a world where every single person with a platform like thought a little bit more deeply [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=778.5s)]
*  About policy and you know, I've had chance to meet him and I do not go [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=785.1400000000001s)]
*  I wish that but we don't we live in the world we live in and like the thing that's actually important about that observation [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=788.5400000000001s)]
*  you just made is that like [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=793.58s)]
*  Came away from that thinking like basically [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=795.94s)]
*  He just wanted a guy that wasn't about like he's not ideological a lot of the Democrats look at all that and they're like [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=798.22s)]
*  They're racist. They're conservative. We're not gettable and like this dude like he just it really much came down to [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=803.74s)]
*  He didn't want somebody that was a politician [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=810.74s)]
*  The Trump's vibes are a little more gangster [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=813.1s)]
*  He doesn't like getting his finger wagged at and like that might be shallow [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=815.62s)]
*  But like that's also gettable that makes them get and so that's why I'm like if Cuban was on that ticket they're getting [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=820.3s)]
*  Yeah, right [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=825.8599999999999s)]
*  They're all gettable right look [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=827.3s)]
*  Rogan Theo the Paul's you know the NELT boys. I've been all but Rogan. I've been on they want to talk about sports [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=829.4599999999999s)]
*  They want to talk about girls. They want to talk about getting fucked up. They want to talk about gambling, right? [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=837.9399999999999s)]
*  They don't want to talk about politics [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=843.78s)]
*  99% of people in this country do not want to talk about politics on the day-to-day basis and in fact [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=845.8199999999999s)]
*  They're trying to get away from it [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=852.06s)]
*  So if you're gonna try to connect to them you've got to connect to them on a human level you can't talk [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=853.4599999999999s)]
*  Ideologies you can't ask for [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=858.78s)]
*  Ideological purity you know you can't extrapolate every single piece of shit that happens and say now [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=861.26s)]
*  This is going to happen all the time everywhere [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=867.62s)]
*  That's not how most people think so now this is the part that makes me want to pull my hair out about them though [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=869.6999999999999s)]
*  Because then because when you get to the policy it's like [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=873.6600000000001s)]
*  Most of them are for like Bernie health care stuff [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=876.4200000000001s)]
*  Totally vibing with your cost plus drugs reform stuff which we'll talk about [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=879.3000000000001s)]
*  Against or the Iran war that Trump might be getting us into right now. I guess right and so like on policy stuff like [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=883.46s)]
*  You know on immigration [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=890.62s)]
*  So what does that mean? What does that mean? It means? We don't know how to sell well [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=892.98s)]
*  I told us to Kamala. I told it to Tim [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=897.6600000000001s)]
*  I told it to the people around Kamala our problem isn't our policies our problem is how do we sell them right? [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=899.7s)]
*  How do we make people feel comfortable with what we believe so that they will at least absorb it and [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=906.3000000000001s)]
*  Understand that there's you know that there's something in it for them [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=912.62s)]
*  It's just like our lives that we live on a day-to-day basis [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=916.46s)]
*  The things that we eat the things that we you know how we look at our health have all changed [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=920.0200000000001s)]
*  They changed and over time these things have been you know communicated and sold to us in different ways and we've evolved [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=925.1s)]
*  The Democrats have not evolved [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=932.3s)]
*  Don't the Republicans have evolved if there is no more Republican Party [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=934.7s)]
*  you know, it's the Trump family business and Trump has always been a salesperson and Trump understands that if you make people feel [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=940.02s)]
*  Envious of some other group and then in turn you shit on that other group that they're envious of [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=947.9s)]
*  You can sell them pretty much anything [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=953.9s)]
*  Okay [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=955.66s)]
*  So there's another group of people you hang with that I do have a little more contempt for [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=956.06s)]
*  Than the Theos of the world and that's the rich guys don't hang with motherfuckers guys, you know, okay [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=959.18s)]
*  Well, whatever, you know rich guys better than me then I don't get to talk to rich guys [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=964.3s)]
*  You talk to rich guys sometimes at least maybe don't hang with them rarely at least, you know, you least know [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=967.9s)]
*  Like I just feel like a lot of what you guys do, you know an investing class and all that is it's risk assessment [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=972.6999999999999s)]
*  Right. There's risk assessment that is a central part all this [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=979.9s)]
*  And I just for the life of me can still not wrap my head around the failed risk assessment [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=983.26s)]
*  From these guys on Trump versus Trump versus Biden's last combo. Okay, I'll explain it exactly [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=989.58s)]
*  So even when I was out there trying to talk about cost plus drugs [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=995.34s)]
*  And I went to the white house and Ron I met with Ron playing a little bit [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=1000.62s)]
*  Um for a few minutes and then um, I wanted to meet with Biden. He wouldn't meet with me every single [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=1003.98s)]
*  I wouldn't say he wouldn't he couldn't maybe it was just couldn't but put me aside. Maybe I don't rank right but [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=1010.38s)]
*  every single business person that i've spoken to [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=1016.3s)]
*  Said the same thing that they wanted to get time with biden and couldn't do it [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=1020.9399999999999s)]
*  And whether it was about ai whether it was about crypto whether it was about other businesses [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=1026.1399999999999s)]
*  You know even elon when they were talking about evs. He couldn't get in the room [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=1031.74s)]
*  So their first initial response is this guy doesn't like us so then the question comes biden or kamala [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=1035.74s)]
*  Versus trump, right the response as it we make as it applies to trump because I was like I know this guy [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=1043.18s)]
*  Right. I did a podcast with vivek where I said vivek this guy [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=1049.26s)]
*  Underpaid invoices. Would you ever underpay invoices? No, no [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=1053.4s)]
*  Vivek might but okay doesn't either hear though there [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=1057.1799999999998s)]
*  No, no, but that point like I may not agree with him policy wise, but he's not like that [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=1060.06s)]
*  but in any event like I use the example because that's when um [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=1064.4599999999998s)]
*  Not long after the trials in new york were happening and michael cohen was talking about how trump underpaid invoices [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=1069.34s)]
*  And he was proud of michael when he did the same thing [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=1076.06s)]
*  I'm like I thought when michael said that shit maybe you know when you have this, you know [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=1078.86s)]
*  A little stand-up press conference after the each day's hearing that he would say, of course, I paid everybody [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=1083.34s)]
*  No, right and I would all these guys all these business guys. I would say character is destiny [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=1089.6599999999999s)]
*  Character is destiny. This is what you're going to get and they're like they would always go back to his first term [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=1095.8s)]
*  But he didn't do any of these things in the first term [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=1101.6599999999999s)]
*  He didn't do this this this this and this and we have no reason to expect that he would change [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=1104.54s)]
*  Dramatically and do anything differently than the first term obviously that was wrong, but that was their logic. I I [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=1109.34s)]
*  That was not satisfying to me. It might be true, but it wasn't satisfying. It's like oh [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=1117.1799999999998s)]
*  Oh, i'm a master of the unit [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=1123.98s)]
*  Any of those guys boardrooms 10 years ago and was like will you give me 50 million dollars [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=1128.6999999999998s)]
*  He would have been laughed out of mark andresen would have laughed him out of [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=1133.4199999999998s)]
*  Okay, so let's [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=1137.9s)]
*  But let's take it one step further, right? [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=1139.66s)]
*  So let's talk about them showing up at the inauguration and giving all that money [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=1141.8200000000002s)]
*  Why right and i'm gonna tell you exactly why we are in a zero sum game with artificial intelligence [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=1147.18s)]
*  There are these companies these five six seven companies are spending 60 to 100 billion dollars a year [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=1153.66s)]
*  So that they could potentially win ai [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=1160.78s)]
*  You know who had no interest in talking about that or dealing with that? [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=1163.5800000000002s)]
*  Joe biden I tried to get um, amala [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=1167.26s)]
*  More pushing it and she's dead. But by that time it was already too late [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=1170.54s)]
*  They were already all in and so if you're in a position tim where you just spent 60 to 100 billion dollars [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=1174.54s)]
*  And the requirement so that one guy with one pen can't fuck you over and end that 60 to 100 billion dollars [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=1181.98s)]
*  Is you have to kiss the ring? [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=1189.02s)]
*  If the democratic party said you know what we've got this asshole republican [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=1191.66s)]
*  He'll switch if tim miller goes and kisses the ring and shows up at you know, you're doing it [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=1195.58s)]
*  That i'm not doing it. I've got a great life in my home in new orleans, but I hear you most people are doing it [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=1201.98s)]
*  I'm happy in my little studio. Most people are doing [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=1206.1399999999999s)]
*  No, but you know what i'm saying though, right? Because I do it is a zero sum game [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=1209.1799999999998s)]
*  I think next is literally the next thing on my list, but just I just want to push back on one more element of it [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=1212.9399999999998s)]
*  Okay, I [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=1216.3s)]
*  I don't agree with it or endorse it but I get it in the period between him winning an inauguration day [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=1217.58s)]
*  That again that last two months though, it's just like you look at this guy [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=1223.66s)]
*  I mean forget going into andres and horowitz if he showed up on shark tank for a crossover episode [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=1227.74s)]
*  It's just like this is ridiculous like the downside risk the tail risk of giving of giving him and imagine when he's 82 [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=1233.9s)]
*  What are you gonna do? How do you change it? Okay, they could know what you did [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=1240.14s)]
*  I guess I guess this is my question [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=1243.42s)]
*  Why is it just I literally would say this to nicole wallace would be off air and i'd be like why is it liz cheney and mark cuban? [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=1244.6200000000001s)]
*  And you and me like where is everybody else why didn't they do anything I don't need anything from uh, you know, I mean [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=1250.7800000000002s)]
*  That they literally have hundreds of billions of dollars at risk [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=1258.46s)]
*  The future of their companies that they've spent their entire lives building is at risk [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=1262.22s)]
*  That's why all right your kinder time than I am, which is nice. That's a good instinct. Um, I want to ask you with ai shit stuff [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=1267.66s)]
*  um, you're this is another thing you're more optimistic about than me and um, [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=1273.0200000000002s)]
*  There's a there's an alarming ai story I want to get to [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=1277.18s)]
*  But I just I want you to do a bull pitch for me on ai first before I get to the alarm [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=1280.54s)]
*  I'll tell you what I tell every every kid [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=1284.7s)]
*  I wish I was 16 because the tools that ai provide any [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=1286.8600000000001s)]
*  13 14 15 16 20 25 30 year old kid to go out and start a business [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=1291.88s)]
*  Are amazing that it's like having every professor every library every mentor [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=1297.9s)]
*  Every consultant available at your fingertips to go out and do whatever it is you want [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=1304.78s)]
*  If you never if you didn't graduate from high school if you never even sniffed a community college [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=1310.62s)]
*  If you're willing to spend time with all these new ai tools that are changing by the minute [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=1316.22s)]
*  Because you have the time and the interest to do it you are going to have the most [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=1321.8999999999999s)]
*  significant job advantage competitive advantage [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=1327.08s)]
*  Entrepreneurial advantage this is such a unique time in history when it comes to enabling young kids to do unique things [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=1330.48s)]
*  We've never seen anything like it [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=1338.3200000000002s)]
*  And if you believe in gen a and gen z and what they're able to do for the future put aside, you know [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=1339.8400000000001s)]
*  Our age my age, right if you believe in them and what they're able to do [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=1345.3600000000001s)]
*  I I think it's just going to be I do believe in them. I worry though about [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=1350.64s)]
*  Just even the widening gap that we have now like look I got a seven-year-old. I hear you man [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=1355.28s)]
*  like a 16 year old who's a [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=1359.36s)]
*  Who's a um somebody that's a self-starter who's curious who's interesting and i'm the best time in the world, right? [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=1362.08s)]
*  A 16 year old who's lonely [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=1369.6s)]
*  Who doesn't know what to do with themselves now you've got someone to talk to now you got something [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=1372.08s)]
*  Okay, mark. That's very concerning. That's not a real conversation. That's not a real human though [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=1377.36s)]
*  but but but right so [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=1383.84s)]
*  the [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=1386.8799999999999s)]
*  Having access to a therapist not a real therapist marginal smartphone [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=1388.0s)]
*  It's a read some of the research now in terms of how kids look there are risks, right? [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=1393.92s)]
*  There's been a kid who killed himself, right? There's been kids who get to and in in [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=1398.96s)]
*  Connected to it. So it's it's picture poison [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=1403.6s)]
*  Do you want a kid who's isolated with nobody to talk to at all with no access to therapy? [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=1406.64s)]
*  Now that's a different problem and a different issue [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=1412.0s)]
*  We might be able to solve in another way by giving maybe one of them at the pool or having a local pool [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=1414.0s)]
*  I want them at the community pool instead. Can I pick option three? Well, that's a whole different thing [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=1419.12s)]
*  Well, no option three is going to chat gpt or perplexity and says I need a workout program and I need a social program [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=1424.0s)]
*  So the point being that we have a lot of problems social problems a lot of social problems across the entire spectrum [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=1431.28s)]
*  Of people every city every demographic right no if-and's or buts about it [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=1439.2800000000002s)]
*  Now we can talk about what are the paths we can take to try to fill to solve those problems [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=1444.48s)]
*  and [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=1450.8000000000002s)]
*  All the ones that don't involve ai [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=1452.0800000000002s)]
*  Are incredibly expensive incredibly people intensive and really difficult to implement in any political environment [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=1454.88s)]
*  But on the other hand what we're talking about are the frailties of ai that's relatively new [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=1462.16s)]
*  And so can we get accomplished therapists accomplished psychologists accomplished? [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=1467.1200000000001s)]
*  Sociologists to produce models that are trusted because they define the models [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=1473.02s)]
*  I think the missing the misperception that we have is that there's going to be this one big ai model [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=1477.52s)]
*  That's not going to be the case [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=1483.6000000000001s)]
*  There are those people who are spending the 60 to 100 billion dollars a year [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=1485.28s)]
*  They all have to compete and each of those is not going away [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=1488.96s)]
*  But more importantly there are going to be millions of models [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=1492.72s)]
*  There are going to be millions of things and apps where you can say [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=1497.04s)]
*  The therapist you wish you could have gone to like this was the perfect therapist for you or your child [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=1501.4399999999998s)]
*  That therapist will have a model and that model will have the guardrails that you'd want that they would use in a face-to-face conversation [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=1507.6s)]
*  and if hopefully there's [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=1514.8799999999999s)]
*  A reasonable price then you can use a tele have a telehealth moment where they talk to them [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=1517.8400000000001s)]
*  Ai will make that better not worse [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=1523.44s)]
*  Let's um, there's a key word that you had in their guardrails because I do want to talk about this because I would have [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=1526.32s)]
*  Had if we had we done this I just would have been a dream for me in 2007 [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=1531.04s)]
*  So I would have been a pig in shit and not had the balls to push back on you [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=1534.0800000000002s)]
*  But uh at 2007 I would have agreed with you [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=1536.8s)]
*  I'd been like because I was like south by southwest kid very excited about all these new social social apps [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=1538.88s)]
*  And you know, i've got 18 years of experience now and um, and all the cool stuff about the social web that I was promised [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=1545.44s)]
*  Um, we got we got a some of them now. We got some of them totally different though [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=1553.8400000000001s)]
*  Okay, but part of that was because [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=1559.0400000000002s)]
*  You know, there wasn't a lot of smart regulation these these boomers on the hill did not do you know [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=1561.3600000000001s)]
*  Did let these guys kind of do whatever they wanted and now you're telling me well what the ai [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=1566.96s)]
*  Gazillionaires that want to be trillionaires that are that are doing this ai what they want right now [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=1572.72s)]
*  Is a president who won't who won't fuck who won't do anything who won't put any limits on them any regulation that concerns me [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=1577.68s)]
*  A lot given our experience in the last little round right and that's fair [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=1583.76s)]
*  But the question becomes who are we competing with what are the options available to us, right? And so [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=1588.0800000000002s)]
*  Unlike most technologies historically the u.s is just dominated but now countries are starting to realize france [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=1594.16s)]
*  uk china in particular are realizing that look [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=1601.52s)]
*  This is a race that might end up, you know creating some level of economic and military dominance [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=1606.0s)]
*  And we have to win the ai race and they're not going to have any guardrails [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=1612.6399999999999s)]
*  And so there [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=1617.52s)]
*  Will there be some level of collateral damage? Yes, but it is I don't know well could it be worse than we ever expected? [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=1619.52s)]
*  Yes, um, okay. Yeah, i'm not gonna lie, right? [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=1626.32s)]
*  But but what's even worse? [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=1629.52s)]
*  Is where we know there are no guardrails and nobody will attempt to create guardrails in other countries [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=1632.08s)]
*  And i'd rather have somebody who's you know living domiciled here pays taxes here [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=1638.8799999999999s)]
*  Whatever has a business base here where you know, you always [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=1643.6s)]
*  You can go after somebody when they've done some ai that you know, we don't think is [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=1647.6799999999998s)]
*  acceptable at any level if you just [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=1653.8999999999999s)]
*  Stop it before anybody gets to innovate [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=1656.8000000000002s)]
*  We're not good at determining where innovation will lead to and that's the catch 22 [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=1660.48s)]
*  Now going to social media where the algorithms have gone and the dominance by all these people who are rich [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=1665.6000000000001s)]
*  The good news is from ai is it's so much easier to create competitive applications [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=1671.3600000000001s)]
*  And have different levels of communications. I think people are going to use social media less and you're going to see [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=1676.96s)]
*  And you're going to see and I think a lot of this is just started algorithms like we should have [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=1684.0800000000002s)]
*  Like you should have had a system where like you had to opt in to getting information instead of yeah [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=1688.8000000000002s)]
*  So i'll tell you an argument I got on twitter, right? This was years ago and I said we needed to use real names [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=1693.76s)]
*  I've always been for that and I [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=1698.88s)]
*  But here was the argument against it and maybe you really think right? Yeah [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=1701.52s)]
*  Yeah, all that stuff. Yeah, and so you pick your poison and so but now [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=1706.0s)]
*  When you you know with elon owning twitter and you know meta with suckerberg [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=1711.36s)]
*  And it's all self-enrichment and all that, you know, the question becomes what alternatives can you create? [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=1716.8799999999999s)]
*  The good news is we may not have to create alternatives because ai [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=1722.8s)]
*  If you've seen all the the ai generated videos that are popping up [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=1727.2s)]
*  they will [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=1731.68s)]
*  dominate dominate social media because everybody's trying to arbitrage the economics and make money from it and so it's going to be [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=1732.8799999999999s)]
*  Really tough to know what's real and what's not real and you may not need real people to create entertainment [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=1740.5600000000002s)]
*  Which means that no don't don't do that because that in my mind [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=1746.3200000000002s)]
*  I think it's going to force more face-to-face communications. I I did this thing. I just love that in your pro pitch [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=1751.2800000000002s)]
*  It's like it's going to be hard to tell what's real and what's not real and that's in the positive pitch. Yeah, but [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=1756.88s)]
*  But that is positive in some respects right because it ends up being [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=1762.48s)]
*  Not a syllable. It's not the right term, but [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=1767.52s)]
*  You all it's become so easy to overwhelm to flood the zone if you will with stuff that isn't real [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=1770.4s)]
*  People are going to want stuff that is real and we'll want more face-to-face [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=1777.2800000000002s)]
*  Communications in business as well when you get all these fake voices calling you as a sales bitch [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=1782.14s)]
*  It's like if you're the company that has a salesperson at least knocks on your door or shows up face-to-face [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=1787.6000000000001s)]
*  You're going to appreciate that if you don't know what's real or not [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=1793.0400000000002s)]
*  You're going to want somebody telling it to your face so you know, it's real and that you can trust it [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=1796.56s)]
*  I just had the same conversation with a bunch of doctors an hour ago. The number one business [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=1802.08s)]
*  Attribute is trust [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=1809.36s)]
*  For any app for any business you have to be able to engender trust in an ai world [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=1812.0s)]
*  Yeah for sure right in an ai world [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=1818.88s)]
*  It's easier to do a lot of processes [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=1821.6799999999998s)]
*  But it's going to get harder and harder to get people to trust what you're presenting because the the pedigree is uncertain [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=1824.32s)]
*  The background is uncertain [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=1831.12s)]
*  So when you try to game all these things out and look at second third fourth order, right? [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=1832.7199999999998s)]
*  It's I don't think it's as bad as you think because there's so much competition and I think there's a positive to it [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=1837.6s)]
*  But I understand the risk one more on the risk. No [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=1843.6799999999998s)]
*  Here we go, I haven't even got you the thing that I was going to that I wanted to prompted this topic [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=1847.3600000000001s)]
*  Open ai in a press comment yesterday [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=1852.64s)]
*  Uh, they cautioned that upcoming models will carry a higher level of risk when it comes to the creation of biological weapons [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=1855.44s)]
*  Especially by those who don't really understand what they're doing [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=1862.64s)]
*  It's not a great. That's not a great, you know warning sign like [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=1866.3200000000002s)]
*  On the cigarette pack. It's like might get lung cancer on open ai [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=1870.3200000000002s)]
*  It's like, you know, maybe a random teenager will create a biological weapon. That's a little concerning [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=1873.68s)]
*  Yeah, it's like a cigarette pack sack saying when you like this it might have a blast radius of two miles, right? [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=1878.48s)]
*  No, there's there's look like I said, there's going to be unintended circumstances [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=1883.76s)]
*  There's to be collateral damage just like there are on the internet. Remember when the internet first started hitting [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=1888.0s)]
*  It was like let's see if we can look up how to make an atom bomb, right? [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=1892.3200000000002s)]
*  and you know, and so [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=1896.4s)]
*  Yes, all those things and I would be shocked [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=1898.4s)]
*  That um open ai didn't put guardrails because it's easy to say bomb and da da da da da [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=1902.56s)]
*  But it makes for a great way to to sell yourself and get everybody talking about you [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=1908.08s)]
*  Because look at what gemini's and the difference between gemini and chat gpt is gemini [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=1913.68s)]
*  The guardrails are too too extensive, right? It's like gemini is boring [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=1918.48s)]
*  Whereas chat gpt kisses your ass too much, right? And it [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=1923.6s)]
*  You know, and so they've all made choices but they're in a death war death not being literally [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=1927.1200000000001s)]
*  To see who's going to win market share right now. It's chat gpt, but there's [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=1932.72s)]
*  There they might be the ibm [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=1938.56s)]
*  Of ai models right now [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=1940.88s)]
*  We just don't want to go back to crypto really quick because I do think I i'm so torn on this one [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=1942.8s)]
*  Because I agree with your kind of passing comment earlier that it really hurt the democrats how hostile they were to crypto and gensler [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=1947.44s)]
*  And and I see it. Yeah, I see it in my life just anecdotally with random non-political friends. So I agree with that [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=1953.84s)]
*  and yet like [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=1960.24s)]
*  Crypto needs to be regulated like much and this bill that they put through congress is not it [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=1962.8799999999999s)]
*  And I get I have friends that are in the crypto industry. That's only really for stable. I know yeah [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=1968.4s)]
*  That was only pretty much so they get mad at me [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=1972.8s)]
*  I get friends that are at coinbase at these other at these other platforms [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=1974.6399999999999s)]
*  They get mad at me for my comments on this and i'm like and like well, you know, there's some really legit [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=1977.68s)]
*  Bit bitcoin is legit. The x is legit y is legit and i'm like, okay [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=1982.8s)]
*  But if you walked into walmart and it was like three aisles were legit products and then like 27 aisles were total scams [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=1986.8s)]
*  Huh? [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=1994.3999999999999s)]
*  Well, no, okay, but let's take what you're saying go to amazon, right? [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=1995.28s)]
*  So one of my big things that I pushed and I tried to get kamala, but it was too esoteric [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=1998.8s)]
*  Is all the knockoffs on amazon? [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=2003.36s)]
*  Like all a bunch of my shark tank companies a bunch of shark tank companies period [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=2005.9199999999998s)]
*  It shows on shark tank. They're already on amazon boom income the chinese knockoffs and you probably don't know this but [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=2009.76s)]
*  If you're a chinese company [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=2016.72s)]
*  And you want to sell on amazon? [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=2018.96s)]
*  You don't have to have any nexus in the united states meaning there's no paperwork you have to fill out [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=2020.4s)]
*  You don't have to have a domestic location [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=2025.8400000000001s)]
*  You don't have there's no proof that you file taxes on anything you make [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=2028.3200000000002s)]
*  You can just come in and fuck over as many american companies as you want [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=2032.16s)]
*  So to your point that they're you know, even in real life products [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=2036.3200000000002s)]
*  They're scams left and right and that's a whole lot more expensive than even the crypto now [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=2041.76s)]
*  I get people's I mean just real quick though like I hear you and that's bad and we should have rules against the chinese [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=2046.8000000000002s)]
*  Knockoff guys, but like it's the business person that's getting screwed over in that case like in the in the crypto coin case [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=2052.2400000000002s)]
*  It's not what's the people no, no, no, no, no, no, no getting a product. Yeah walk it in [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=2057.76s)]
*  No, it's tim walking in and thinking he's buying dude wipes one of my shark tank companies and it says dude [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=2062.08s)]
*  Oh, yeah, wipe the three or whatever. Yeah, you don't know the difference. Gotcha. All right. Yeah, so you don't know the difference [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=2069.12s)]
*  So because if they weren't selling anything or I thought you're saying they're just making a cheaper knockoff brand version of it [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=2074.7200000000003s)]
*  But no, they're literally copying. They are they are [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=2079.92s)]
*  Yeah, they're literally copying and making a knockoff and they're getting they're out selling the shark tank companies [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=2082.88s)]
*  And though some of those shark tank big companies have gone out of business, right? [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=2087.84s)]
*  I did at least get my chinese wipes though. Whereas the people invested in milania coin just lost their fucking ass [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=2090.9599999999996s)]
*  But but it's their it's their lottery ticket, right? I hate meme coins. I hate them. I hate them, right? [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=2097.7599999999998s)]
*  I think they're they're the scum of the crypto earth, right? It's a problem [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=2104.08s)]
*  I don't think they should exist but the people who love them look at it as a [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=2108.24s)]
*  Musical chairs lottery ticket that if you know how to play the game [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=2111.7599999999998s)]
*  We've got rules on the lottery man, steve win and those guys you you want to get in the casino business? [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=2114.7999999999997s)]
*  With you, let's like have a lottery where you everybody loses. No, I agree with you [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=2119.8399999999997s)]
*  I hate meme coins. That's what I just said. So we got no problem [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=2124.16s)]
*  I agree, right? [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=2128.56s)]
*  I'd have no problem outline meme points now the crypto people would hate me, right? [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=2129.7599999999998s)]
*  And they do hate me because i'm not purely libertarian on it [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=2133.6s)]
*  But I think to evolve from that pure libertarian history of crypto to get it to where it's made more mainstream [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=2136.24s)]
*  And easy for grandma, which we we've failed at miserably so far. Look, let me say it differently [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=2142.56s)]
*  There's been things that have worked really well with crypto and things that have failed miserably [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=2148.24s)]
*  And things that should have worked well have failed miserably things like smart contracts on ethereum to create, you know [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=2152.64s)]
*  Applications that truly have utility that should have been way further ahead than it is and the reason it's not [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=2159.8999999999996s)]
*  Is because gary gensler made it impossible to follow the rules [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=2166.56s)]
*  Now that's not the same case in other countries. So a lot of companies left [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=2171.3599999999997s)]
*  But when you look at the griffs like the main coins like the milania and drunk coins [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=2175.04s)]
*  That's just a grift and there's just no other way to put it and either you pay a whole lot of tax to grip people [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=2180.48s)]
*  That there's rules there's regulations. I agree with you 100% you worry about [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=2186.7200000000003s)]
*  Paranoid temps coming in now. Do you worry about the teal like the idea that they're trying to move us off of [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=2191.28s)]
*  Fiat currency altogether and the risk associated with that. Does that worry you at all? [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=2196.96s)]
*  Yeah, there certainly is risk right because I forget the name of it, but I lost money um 15 years ago [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=2201.76s)]
*  With this not a bond, but it was it was ri something [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=2208.96s)]
*  Um that said it was it was backed by the dollar and it would never break a dollar until it did [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=2213.68s)]
*  Right in like 2008 and this was a regulated thing [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=2220.2400000000002s)]
*  So there is that risk for stable coins and I think you've got you know, you've got to really [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=2223.36s)]
*  The genius act was a first step, but it's not the last step [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=2230.08s)]
*  I don't think people are going to take it. I think I thought it was a good first step just so we can start [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=2233.3599999999997s)]
*  Making the the point that crypto can be regulated and so because it won't be the last regulation [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=2238.56s)]
*  But to your point is teal trying to undermine the u.s. Dollars. I don't think so, right? Are you 100% sure too much to lose? [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=2244.56s)]
*  No, i'm not obviously nothing about peter tail. I'm 100 sure about right, you know, i've only met the guy once [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=2251.7599999999998s)]
*  But at the same time ben undermines the entire economy and that does no good for anybody [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=2257.12s)]
*  That circles me back to the trump point [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=2261.92s)]
*  I guess this is my whole thing of the trump point the whole time is like [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=2263.44s)]
*  He obviously was going to be bad for the economy to me like it was obvious his stated plans were all very risky [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=2266.7200000000003s)]
*  I agree with you. I agree with you, right? [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=2272.32s)]
*  I mean all the things I said when I was out for kamala turned out to be 100 true [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=2274.48s)]
*  Right. I I was up [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=2279.76s)]
*  I bet it a hundred and I would tell people this and they were like, but he didn't do it before [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=2280.96s)]
*  He didn't do it. It's my people. It's mitch mcconnell and paul ryan's fault [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=2287.76s)]
*  It's my people for jamming through the traditional chamber of commerce republican agenda and letting him brand it, you know, honestly [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=2291.04s)]
*  Yeah, I mean and you know, I kept again i'll say it again characters destiny [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=2298.1600000000003s)]
*  Donald trump is a great marketer great salesperson [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=2302.4s)]
*  And like a lot of salespeople that i've dealt with [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=2305.9399999999996s)]
*  He cares more about closing the sale and saying he closed the deal [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=2308.8199999999997s)]
*  Than following through to make sure the services cost less drugs. How would you fix the healthcare system? Easy question. You have two minutes [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=2312.66s)]
*  I only got two minutes right. Well first what is cost less drugs? [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=2319.9399999999996s)]
*  You go to cost plus drugs.com and you put in the name of your medication [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=2322.8999999999996s)]
*  Let's just say you have cancer and you need a matnip, right? [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=2326.1s)]
*  If this was four years ago, you'd walk into a big pharmacy and that a matnip would cost [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=2329.62s)]
*  $2,000 plus now you go to cost plus drugs.com you put it in we show your actual cost what we pay for it shows up [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=2335.2s)]
*  We show you our markup. It's only 15 percent if you want it via mail order [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=2341.7s)]
*  We have a pharmacist review it for five dollars and five dollars for shipping and handling and that's it [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=2345.54s)]
*  And so you know exactly what it's going to cost you for any of your medications [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=2350.66s)]
*  And we've helped millions of people and saved I don't even know how many lives and helps all however many families [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=2354.18s)]
*  So that's part one part two. How do you fix health care? Right first is transparency? [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=2359.14s)]
*  That's a big part of it [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=2364.5s)]
*  But part two is you look for the leverage points in health care because that's what fucks it all up [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=2365.54s)]
*  When you think about health care, it's really simple, right? [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=2370.9s)]
*  You go to the doctor the doctor either says you need something or you don't if you need something then there's only two questions [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=2373.46s)]
*  What's the cost and how do you pay for it? That's it [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=2379.62s)]
*  The problem with health care isn't the doctors or even the hospitals [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=2382.26s)]
*  It's what we charge and how we ask people to pay for it and a big part of that problem is because [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=2385.7000000000003s)]
*  Of how the whole system is set up if you think about health care plans, whether it's aca whether it's medicare advantage [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=2391.78s)]
*  Whether it's medicare part d you've got some in your for your company, right? [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=2397.46s)]
*  You've got some insurance company that's saying look. Here's the plan. We're going to change it every year here [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=2402.42s)]
*  We're going to have one one plan that has a low premium high deductible and another plan that has a low [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=2407.86s)]
*  High premium and low deductible and young people the people with less money always choose the high deductible and hope they don't get sick [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=2413.86s)]
*  Right, but what they don't tell you is one they set the deductible so high given that you know, [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=2420.82s)]
*  Most of america can't afford four hundred dollars. There ain't no fucking way they can afford to pay their deductible [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=2427.2999999999997s)]
*  Now, you know who loses that money when they can't afford to pay their deductible. It's not the insurance company [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=2432.66s)]
*  It's not the company that you're getting your insurance from it's not the aca plan [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=2438.18s)]
*  It's the fucking hospitals and doctors that they turned into [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=2442.9s)]
*  Prime lenders, you know the the guys will have to take on any risk [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=2447.62s)]
*  And so because of the plans that the insurance companies have designed [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=2451.46s)]
*  Where they don't pay any tension or give a shit if the people can afford the deductibles that they sign up for [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=2454.98s)]
*  And the government hasn't figured out yet that we've got to guarantee it like we can't do a single payer right now [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=2460.1s)]
*  What are your feelings on single payer and saying like to the idea that we can afford that? [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=2466.1s)]
*  I like to be old there was a right. I think it was ryan widen [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=2470.1800000000003s)]
*  it was an old paul ryan thing which will trigger some of the progressive listeners, but it was basically just like a [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=2472.82s)]
*  Public option for like low income. It's like a medicaid thing and it was scaled up and like the higher you go [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=2477.6200000000003s)]
*  Right. We kind of got that with medicaid, right? [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=2482.7400000000002s)]
*  Medicare for all [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=2485.7000000000003s)]
*  Up then yeah, firstly the medicare care for all if you read like [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=2487.3s)]
*  jayapals congressman jayapals [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=2490.98s)]
*  Medicare for all proposal the first thing it says is this this shall be run and organized by [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=2493.06s)]
*  That the secretary of health and human services insane. So rfk juniors running to know [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=2498.34s)]
*  That's all you need to know right but here's the thing right if we introduce transparent just say like cost plus everything was transparent [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=2504.66s)]
*  Right, then you could have cities states counties [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=2511.54s)]
*  And say look here's our budget and if we know exactly what it's going to cost and we can use [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=2516.02s)]
*  You know we can use scientists that extrapolate the data to figure out what our annual budget should be [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=2521.22s)]
*  Then it could start just like canada started their care programs because that's what canada did like in [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=2526.5s)]
*  1947 one of the you know ottawa one of the provinces just said look [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=2532.24s)]
*  We know what it's going to cost we think we can cover it [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=2536.74s)]
*  But you can't do that in the united states of america until you're transparent about all the costs [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=2539.62s)]
*  And if you start doing that the two problem children are the insurance companies and the pbms because they have all the leverage, right? [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=2544.9s)]
*  The pbms control the formularies for 250 million lives and the insurance companies that own the pbms [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=2552.98s)]
*  control the plans the insurance plans for just as many lives and so they have all the leverage if you a [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=2559.3799999999997s)]
*  Divorce formularies from pbms they lose that leverage and you don't need them for formulas anyways [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=2566.3399999999997s)]
*  And so it goes down to a direct cost and if you're transparent on that and the same thing on health care [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=2572.42s)]
*  If you simplify the payment terms [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=2578.3399999999997s)]
*  All of a sudden you can get to single payer, but it's on a municipality county employer or whatever [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=2580.82s)]
*  I'm gonna make a hard turn. I did that two minutes. I know it was three, but that's okay. I'm making a hard turn [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=2586.9s)]
*  It was pretty good [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=2591.2200000000003s)]
*  Health care is the hardest one you asked me like what am I think about the social life my my honest opinion about health care [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=2592.7400000000002s)]
*  Is like it seems like we our current system is the worst of both worlds [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=2597.38s)]
*  Like like a more free market system with a with a big [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=2601.1400000000003s)]
*  Uh a big safety net for like catastrophic would be better [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=2605.06s)]
*  But we don't have socialized would be better like like our system is like it's taking the worst of both of the [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=2608.18s)]
*  Combos, um, i'm making a hard turn into blue sky [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=2612.98s)]
*  Uh just started because you DMed me and you're like, why aren't you on blue sky? [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=2615.94s)]
*  My response to you was like number one [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=2619.46s)]
*  I like fighting as you can tell right here and I don't want to be in a bubble just because I enjoy fighting [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=2621.54s)]
*  Yep, and number two like like bubbles are feel toxic and like the types of fighting that happen in bubbles is not the type [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=2626.74s)]
*  I like and like people are nitpicking me all the time and i'd rather be going across [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=2634.5s)]
*  You know ideological perspectives and cross the line. Yeah, like that's my issue with it [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=2638.98s)]
*  Uh two months later because it's taking us a while to make this happen you blue sky you skied it [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=2643.54s)]
*  Basically my critique of blue sky. So where are you at? You welcome aboard, but where are you at on it right now? [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=2648.5s)]
*  What's the what's the solution? [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=2653.54s)]
*  I'm disappointed right? It didn't have to be that way. They they took the path of not trying to [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=2655.7000000000003s)]
*  bring in [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=2662.02s)]
*  New users that have different viewpoints. They knew that there was a they had a big base of users that wanted ideological purity [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=2663.54s)]
*  They knew it right i've talked to them [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=2670.66s)]
*  And they started to bring in a couple verticals like the mba's got a great vertical [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=2673.22s)]
*  Econ sky is really good book top a book sky rather is really good, right? [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=2677.7799999999997s)]
*  But they've made no effort to go bring in other people. It's not too late [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=2682.2599999999998s)]
*  I actually just wanted to kick him in the ass, right? Because it's disappointing to your point [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=2686.58s)]
*  I want to fight with the people who disagree with me and I want to have in-depth [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=2692.02s)]
*  Conversations to see if I can change their minds or they can change I don't want to have smarmy vice president [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=2696.16s)]
*  JD vance going on just to be a dick about it really [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=2700.02s)]

*  So much [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=2712.02s)]
*  So it doesn't just like I know it just doesn't like it's like oh like it's like it's it wasn't a real attempt to engage though [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=2713.14s)]
*  No, of course not [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=2719.7799999999997s)]
*  Yeah, of course it of course and I I even quote with him and quote squeaded him and said you're lying [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=2721.7s)]
*  Right when he talked about pharmacies paying [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=2727.22s)]
*  For um, I forget what it was but um, I just quote you and said, you know, you're lying, right? [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=2730.34s)]
*  I don't believe you and that's fine [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=2735.46s)]
*  I want that opportunity no matter what the platform because you know if you do it on twitter [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=2736.9s)]
*  You're just your your replies are just going to get destroyed for a month [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=2741.22s)]
*  We're going to close with rapid fire mba, but just first I have to do it [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=2744.1s)]
*  So i'm not going to ask you the obvious question like is I know that you're going to do it [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=2747.14s)]
*  I know you're going to duck it [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=2751.38s)]
*  Or the two obvious questions, but before I get to either of them [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=2752.98s)]
*  It's like so what percent chance are you going to run for president? [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=2755.7799999999997s)]
*  I know you're not going to say you're going to is it zero. It's not zero. It's two percent [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=2759.2999999999997s)]
*  0.0 [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=2764.02s)]
*  nil [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=2765.2999999999997s)]
*  My family my wife repeats that because like there was the the bloomberg article that just came out and asked the question [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=2766.42s)]
*  And she she someone sent it to her and then she saw it. She's what was the dumb and dumber thing, right? [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=2772.6600000000003s)]
*  You're not even going to like be like you're saying there's a chance, you know one in a hundred thousand [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=2777.1400000000003s)]
*  So you're saying there's a chance nothing [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=2781.78s)]
*  No, no, okay [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=2784.82s)]
*  So i'll say it's not a hundred percent zero if all of a sudden trump was on the ballot for a third time [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=2786.1800000000003s)]
*  Right, what if it was what if it was kid? What if it's jd and don jr? [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=2792.5800000000004s)]
*  That's not enough to get you off the couch [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=2796.5s)]
*  No [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=2798.5s)]
*  All right. No, I think you're like here's why I think you're lying to me. Um, I think you're an honest person [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=2799.46s)]
*  But you showed up at the dorkiest never trump her conference in dc [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=2804.1800000000003s)]
*  Where the where the proud boys came and protested us made it kind of interesting. I love the principles first guys [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=2809.54s)]
*  They are great [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=2814.02s)]
*  But i'm like only someone who at least thinks they might run for president would show up to uh this [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=2814.82s)]
*  No, that wasn't it at all. It was the exact opposite [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=2820.1800000000003s)]
*  It was like these people have no idea how to sell they have no idea how to convince people who don't agree with them [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=2822.6600000000003s)]
*  Right. It's easy to convince people in the church, right? Praise the lord. We all agree [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=2828.5s)]
*  It's hard to convince people that the reason you'd like to go to twitter because it's more fun, but it's harder [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=2833.6200000000003s)]
*  Right. You have to find a path in order to do it [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=2840.1800000000003s)]
*  That's why I do these things i've done it for the mod squad and all these other groups, right? [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=2843.6200000000003s)]
*  Because you've got to be able to tell them you can't just because trump you can't just say no to everything trump does [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=2847.7000000000003s)]
*  That is not an approach, right? [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=2853.7000000000003s)]
*  You've got you know, maybe it's this stop clock is right is right twice a day [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=2855.9399999999996s)]

*  He was right on this he was right on this and you can't call people who you support trump a cult [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=2863.06s)]
*  You know, well, they're just look the truth is the truth. No. Okay. Well, let's talk about [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=2868.2599999999998s)]
*  No, but let's talk about that, right? [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=2873.06s)]
*  So like one of my buddies when trump first ran i was like telling him because i've known trump for 25 years [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=2874.3399999999997s)]
*  And i'm like dan, you know guys in the mid 50s like why that? [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=2879.62s)]
*  Let me tell you something mark i've been voting for politicians my entire life and you know what they've done for me [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=2883.62s)]
*  Nothing, you know the definition of insanity [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=2889.46s)]
*  Well his mind that's all that matters, right? It's all that you come around this it's trump's done nothing for him now [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=2892.8199999999997s)]
*  No, so it seems like he's in a cult then he hasn't come around yet. It's been nine years. What has done for him? [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=2898.2599999999998s)]
*  You're a white guy. You're a white guy new orleans, right? [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=2903.8599999999997s)]
*  So just a random white guy new orleans you think that because the dei [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=2906.5s)]
*  You or your brother your uncle your friend didn't get that promotion, right? [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=2911.3s)]
*  So he said he was going to do something about dei in your mind. He did it. You have a cousin that works construction, right? [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=2915.7000000000003s)]
*  He's you know, he thinks that he's not getting [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=2922.9s)]
*  Yeah, right [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=2927.62s)]
*  But he's thinking coming into all this right? [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=2928.42s)]
*  He's thinking i'm not you know, these guys are on the corner and i'm not getting that work because these immigrants, right? [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=2930.7400000000002s)]
*  So I want the border closed did trump do it. Yeah now I want those guys deported [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=2936.82s)]
*  So maybe my wages might be a shittier job, but my wages are going up because the trump do it. Yeah, so now [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=2941.54s)]
*  Tariffs it's going to cost you more money. Yeah, maybe but you know what those first three things that were important to me [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=2948.42s)]
*  Bam bam. Bam trump got it, right? [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=2954.7400000000002s)]
*  And so i'm gonna give him the benefit of the sound like it calls to me because it's like barack [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=2956.98s)]
*  You could just be like barack obama got you out of the iraq war. Is that you're not happy about that [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=2960.5s)]
*  We got you know, what do you have a nephew? That's gay. We got gay marriage now joe [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=2964.26s)]
*  You got a tax cut from george w bush like like like you could do this spin for anybody [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=2968.7400000000002s)]
*  Of course, of course [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=2974.34s)]
*  But this is the here and now right and that also is the difference between the democrats and the republicans [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=2975.38s)]
*  The democrats always extrapolate some anecdotal scenarios and say see he's done it this number of times [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=2980.34s)]
*  So he's going to do it all the time [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=2986.1800000000003s)]
*  I don't think trump voters think that way trump voters look at and say this is me [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=2988.34s)]
*  This is now this is what's affecting my life in in a simple way, right the iraq world [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=2992.66s)]
*  Maybe I had some family there and you know, you know, they're out now. That's great [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=2998.1s)]
*  Maybe you know, we were ahead the great financial mess and he's in um, and um obama helped fix it [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=3002.66s)]
*  Yeah, but that was I don't remember back that far particularly, you know [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=3009.46s)]
*  If i'm if i'm 70 years old the average age of the fox viewer 75 the average age [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=3013.46s)]
*  I'm i'm not hearing any of that shit from fox, right? And if i'm going to an scc school if i'm going to um lsu [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=3019.14s)]
*  Right. I'm not hearing any of that shit, right? I'm i'm hearing, you know all the you know, he kept fixed the ei [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=3027.22s)]
*  He you know took care of immigration deporting the guys who are keeping my buddies [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=3033.7799999999997s)]
*  Because I don't want to go to my buddies who don't want to go to college now [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=3037.7s)]
*  And so the point being is you have to recognize that's the reality like we did the shark tank thing and I went to lsu [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=3040.74s)]
*  Knows obber and it was like, oh my god, they were hating on me. Like they were like [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=3048.8999999999996s)]
*  Oh, yeah, I don't I don't give a shit right but it's you know, it was just interesting to know [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=3056.5s)]
*  and so I really really think that if the if the democrats are going to [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=3061.4599999999996s)]
*  Understand why republicans haven't just turned on trump like it makes so much sense to us that he should [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=3066.24s)]
*  You have to realize that he's batting 750 for most particularly for white guys [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=3072.2599999999998s)]
*  Under the age of you know 50 50 right or 55 [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=3078.42s)]
*  He's doing exactly what he said unless you realize that you have no way to change [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=3083.2200000000003s)]
*  I have your wife call me, um, because I hear you on that. Um, all right, uh last day [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=3088.26s)]
*  So, okay [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=3091.94s)]
*  You really these two two rabid fire mba you realize that you leaving the mabs caused a butterfly [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=3092.66s)]
*  Flapped its wings think about all the people you hurt everyone in dallas [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=3098.02s)]
*  Every lakers hater every tanking team that wanted cooper flag [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=3102.42s)]
*  The bus family is gone now jay more is a billionaire now because of you like [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=3106.42s)]
*  Think about all of the impacts of that decision. What do you ever reflect on that? I mean how insane is what happened? [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=3111.7000000000003s)]
*  I am one powerful motherfucker [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=3120.18s)]
*  That was insane you should have stayed [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=3123.78s)]
*  It was pretty either stay with great commas vice president that I do not like [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=3126.82s)]
*  I would have done it differently in hindsight. I would have done it a lot differently, but uh, the uh, I gotta do nuggets [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=3131.54s)]
*  I'll leave we're in a pickle man. I feel like we're like on on the one hand [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=3137.7s)]
*  If we're one player we almost we took oklahoma city to seven [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=3142.74s)]
*  We're one player away from being nba champions right now on the other hand that they got the camp. They got no camp space [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=3145.94s)]
*  They're stuck with all these what do you do and we don't have a gm. Well a [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=3152.66s)]
*  Isn't it insane? We don't have a gm and b if you became the gm. What will we do? [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=3156.58s)]
*  Help save the nuggets [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=3160.4199999999996s)]
*  Well, first of all your former gm was calvin booth who hit one of the biggest shots in mavericks history second [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=3162.4199999999996s)]
*  Why are you a nugget? I grew up in denver. Oh, okay. Yeah, I live in louisiana now. I grew up in denver [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=3167.8599999999997s)]
*  Okay, okay [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=3172.02s)]
*  So the challenge for all teams right now is [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=3172.8999999999996s)]
*  We're transitioning from the old cba to this new cba with the second apron which isn't a hard tap [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=3176.58s)]
*  But it's pretty damn close and so teams have to all adapt [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=3182.02s)]
*  The the bad news is the good teams it's going to be really hard to keep your good players [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=3186.02s)]
*  The good news is the bad teams are going to get better a lot faster because [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=3191.38s)]
*  You're going to be able to get players for less and still stay under that second threshold. So I think for the nuggets [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=3196.18s)]
*  They're going to have to draft really really well. They're going to have to keep russell westbrook [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=3202.7400000000002s)]
*  And they need one more score, you know [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=3206.98s)]
*  They need another score junior for two for two two quarters for a dollar [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=3209.7s)]
*  Detrae's [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=3214.1s)]
*  It was tough. He hurt his shoulder man. You can't put it on i'm not putting it on me [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=3216.58s)]
*  I'm just looking at our options. All right [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=3219.94s)]
*  I mean yokich yokich is the best player in the nba right then we got a small window [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=3221.54s)]
*  It's not close. Yeah, it's not close. Yeah [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=3225.8599999999997s)]
*  Yeah, and you have a long window because it's not like he's super athletic [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=3228.2599999999998s)]
*  So he'll be able to be really good. So he's 35 36. He's so beautiful watching him. It's unbelievable [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=3231.2999999999997s)]
*  Oh, he's so amazing to watch unreal. It's really been a joy of my life over this horrific political decade to have him [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=3236.5s)]
*  You know what the basketball is that right ball is you still I try i'm not you know, I never was that good [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=3243.62s)]

*  So I was always more of sidelines. Yeah, but I do love it [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=3253.14s)]
*  But still but that's not even the point you don't have to be good, right? [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=3255.62s)]
*  Just the feel of getting out there just solves all the world's problems. My daughter a couple times a week [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_nb7ucits&t=3259.06s)]
