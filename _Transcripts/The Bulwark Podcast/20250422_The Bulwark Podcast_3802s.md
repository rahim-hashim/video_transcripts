Video Description: Trump and the people around him are trying to weaken our constitutional protections like due process. Because people see that the Abrego Garcia story is not about the man, but our rights, and because people keep protesting, the administration is getting rattled. We have to keep gumming up the works. Meanwhile, why aren't the Chamber of Commerce and other business groups howling while Trump single-handedly ruins our country's global economic status? Plus, our fully-grown SecDef is blaming the deep state for his troubles, even though they involve his wife, his brother, and his phone. And Dear Charleston: Please un-elect Nancy Mace. Michael Steele joins Tim Miller.

# Trump’s Cabinet is a “CESSPOOL OF STUPID” (w/ Michael Steele)
**The Bulwark Podcast:** [April 22, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc)
*  That's why I use the word stupid so much because this is so... [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=0.0s)]
*  Stupid fascism. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=3.6s)]
*  Stupid fascism. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=5.6000000000000005s)]
*  Stupid fascism. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=6.6000000000000005s)]
*  It's not even like, you know... [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=7.6000000000000005s)]
*  Like a good Nazi, a good Nazi would take this woman and like put her to work. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=9.6s)]
*  You know, and put her to work. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=14.6s)]
*  You know? [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=16.6s)]
*  And then so then you could go to the people and say, hey, I solved cancer. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=17.6s)]
*  While you're, you know, sending people, your political enemies to El Salvador. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=21.6s)]
*  I don't want to send them good ideas. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=25.6s)]
*  Hello and welcome to the Bullwork podcast. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=30.6s)]
*  I'm your host, Tim Miller. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=35.6s)]
*  He's back. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=37.6s)]
*  He is the former chair of the Republican National Committee. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=38.6s)]
*  He's hosted the Michael Steele podcast, which we're distributing here at the Bullwork. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=40.6s)]
*  The beginning, Monday, May 5th, Michael and his fellow panelists, Simone Sanders Townsend [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=44.6s)]
*  and Alicia Menendez will move to prime time. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=49.6s)]
*  Co-hosts the 7 p.m. Eastern hour on MSNBC. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=51.6s)]
*  You're going prime time, baby. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=55.6s)]
*  Looking forward to it. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=58.2s)]
*  It's a lot of fun and I'm glad to be in this conversation with you as always. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=60.2s)]
*  You're one of my fave people out there. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=64.2s)]
*  And so I'm just glad to be able to come on and shoot the breeze with you and celebrate [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=66.2s)]
*  this new chapters coming up on May 5th. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=72.2s)]
*  I'm excited about it, man. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=74.2s)]
*  Talk to you about prime time. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=75.2s)]
*  Do you have a new support team now? [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=77.2s)]
*  Are they making, are you getting you on a Zempect? [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=79.2s)]
*  Do you have your own personal makeup artist? [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=81.2s)]
*  Like what's the difference with prime time? [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=83.2s)]
*  All I asked for was someone who could put some hair on my head. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=85.2s)]
*  That was, I need more hair for prime time. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=87.8s)]
*  So and the response was just grow out what's left and you can do a comb over. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=90.8s)]
*  I was like, but afros don't comb over that well. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=96.8s)]
*  So it's just, you know, I don't know how that works. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=99.8s)]
*  Now we've got, look, we've got a great team. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=102.80000000000001s)]
*  You know, our executive producer, Kyle Griffin and the production team around him, the writers, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=105.80000000000001s)]
*  all of that, a big portion of that transitions with us to the prime time hour. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=112.8s)]
*  Yeah, the support is a little bit different. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=118.8s)]
*  It's a different game. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=120.8s)]
*  You've got more hands that are part of making the product, which is good. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=121.8s)]
*  And because, you know, look, certainly for our spinco MSNBC, you're, everyone's familiar [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=126.8s)]
*  with, you know, sort of the standalone entity now that will be the new version of MSNBC. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=133.8s)]
*  They're building a wonderful brand, exciting new programming. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=141.8s)]
*  It started with our effort on the weekend from eight to 10 in the morning, Saturday and Sundays. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=146.8s)]
*  And is now kind of grown out to this opportunity in prime time. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=152.8s)]
*  But it's also helped transform how other shows are looking. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=157.4s)]
*  So it's been really, really fun, man, to sort of be sort of the experimental project that works out really well. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=161.4s)]
*  And that is sort of, you know, an example of some exciting things to come. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=169.8s)]
*  And so I'm looking forward to May 5th and seven o'clock and, you know, bring bringing the heat as I want to do. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=175.8s)]
*  All right. Let's bring it. I'm looking forward to it, too, because I'll be able to see you more. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=184.8s)]
*  The seven a.m. Saturday Central Time Hour isn't really kind of how we do things in New Orleans. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=188.8s)]
*  So, you know, I'll get to see you more more at dinnertime than I did. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=194.8s)]
*  Yeah, I was going to say, right. All right. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=197.8s)]
*  You know, seven a.m. Tim's just coming in. He's not going to be watching TV. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=201.8s)]
*  Not checking out Alicia Menendez's takes at seven a.m. on Saturday. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=205.8s)]
*  That's for a different demo. All right. Well, you you're Catholic, right? [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=209.8s)]
*  You went to our church. I am a Catholic schoolboy. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=213.8s)]
*  I thought maybe could have been Pope at one point. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=215.8s)]
*  And yeah. Any thoughts on the Pope's passing possibly because of the smug hot air coming out of J.D. Vance the day before? [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=217.8s)]
*  I won't even I had so many of my friends go say to me, really? [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=225.8s)]
*  His last official visit. Are you serious? [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=230.8s)]
*  Look, you know, I've been very reflective of this pope and for a lot of reasons, [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=233.8s)]
*  because everyone really wanted to reduce his papacy to, you know, right versus left, conservative versus liberal. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=243.8s)]
*  And yes, you could argue, oh, he was progressive on immigration. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=253.8s)]
*  Well, I don't know if my reading of the Bible and the words of Christ around the Beatitudes or what the Lord gave Moses in the Ten Commandments would be considered progressive. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=258.8s)]
*  I think I think it's just kind of common sense. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=273.8s)]
*  I think it's common sense. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=276.8s)]
*  Loving your neighbor as yourself. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=277.8s)]
*  That's progressive. And if that's progressive, what does it say about being a conservative? [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=279.8s)]
*  That I don't love my neighbor, that I don't give a shit about the immigrant, that I don't care about what happens to my fellow man and woman. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=285.8s)]
*  You just can't put him in that box, because I think what the pope was trying to do was say, look, at the core of everything that we do is should be love. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=295.8s)]
*  It should inform how we approach the world. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=307.8s)]
*  And the challenges we have are resolved if we see the humanity of our fellow traveler. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=310.8s)]
*  And so it's been really a reflective moment for me. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=319.8s)]
*  You know, I was an Augustinian seminarian, spent three years in a monastery, roughly. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=324.8s)]
*  And so that also... [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=332.8s)]
*  I have this in my memory somewhere. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=334.8s)]
*  I knew that you had flirted with the priesthood, but I don't think that three years in a seminary was... [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=336.8s)]
*  in a monastery, rather, was something I was familiar with. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=342.8s)]
*  Give us a little color on that. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=344.8s)]
*  Yeah. So I entered the Augustinian order, order of St. Augustine, after I graduated from Hopkins. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=346.8s)]
*  And that August, I went up to Villanova and joined the men there for my first year. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=353.8s)]
*  While I was at Villanova, I taught at one of our high schools, Malvin Prep, and then went up to Massachusetts for my novitiate. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=365.8s)]
*  And spent time up there preparing for simple vows. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=373.8s)]
*  And, you know, that was the journey. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=379.8s)]
*  And then I left right before simple vows because I felt God had called... [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=383.8s)]
*  was calling me to move in a different direction and to take what I learned in that time and apply it to this, what I've been doing since. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=390.8s)]
*  And so it is actually, Tim, informed how I served as lieutenant governor, informed how I served as RNC chairman, a very political position, [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=400.8s)]
*  that that part of my Christian values should direct and help me navigate through some very sticky political stuff. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=412.8s)]
*  And it did. I have a whole different view of how I look at people. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=424.8s)]
*  I used to tell people after I cussed them out, I'd say, you know, this could have been a lot worse because I spent three years in a seminary. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=428.8s)]
*  This went a lot better than it otherwise would have. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=436.8s)]
*  It just looked at me like, OK, whatever. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=439.8s)]
*  This could have been confession. I could have been, you know, giving you 10 Hail Marys, 10 Our Fathers. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=442.8s)]
*  It could have been really painful. Yes. All you need is, all right, start praying. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=447.8s)]
*  But yeah, man, it's a very important time for us. The church is going to go through a transition. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=453.8s)]
*  You know, the who's in, who's out horse race of the election of the next pope is going to ensue after the funeral, if not before. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=459.8s)]
*  But I think the legacy of this pope is going to be a profound one. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=470.8s)]
*  And given that he selected and put in place a significant majority of the cardinals who will be electing his successor, [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=474.8s)]
*  they're not going to necessarily look for a similar type or, you know, the next version of Francis. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=485.8s)]
*  But I think some of the things that he the qualities he he led with there, they're going to realize are important. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=492.8s)]
*  And hopefully the Holy Spirit will lead them to choose the person who will best reflect this time and is best needed for these times. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=501.8s)]
*  I love hearing you talk about that. I can, you know, the Catholic schoolboy, you know, you can hear the other Catholic schoolboy and kind of the language that is used. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=510.8s)]
*  It's funny, the JD Vance of it all, you know, as an adult convert, to your respect, everybody's religious journey. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=517.8s)]
*  But it reminds me there's this great meme from from that I that I saw that really resonated with me listening to you versus listening to JD Vance. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=523.8s)]
*  I want to share with you every lifelong Catholic I've ever met is like, I think we're supposed to give this food to poor people. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=531.8s)]
*  And every adult convert to Catholicism is like the Archon of Constantinople's Epistle on the Pentecostine rights of the Eucharist clearly states that women shouldn't have drivers licenses. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=538.8s)]
*  It is really true. Just like the the rhetoric is for the Archbishop Carol Catholic versus the adult convert JD Vance Catholic is a little different. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=548.8s)]
*  It's a little bit different. It's but that is so well put. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=561.8s)]
*  Exactly. Look, you know, it's it is, you know, for I was kind of marvel. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=566.8s)]
*  And it's true, I guess, for a lot of folks who convert to a new faith that they they have a certain zeal about it that those of us who were born into the faith baptize in the faith at a young age grew up with it. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=573.8s)]
*  You know, that zeal is there. It just manifests itself differently. And it's it's less rhetorical. It's less, you know, this full on public display. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=589.8s)]
*  But it is in the works. When you think about the charities you give to the people you support the programs that you advocate for putting your children in Catholic school. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=600.8s)]

*  it would be an水k lot for me, but you do the works that we're [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=645.8s)]
*  asked to do which start with loving your neighbor as [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=651.0999999999999s)]
*  yourself. do unto others as you would have them do unto you. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=654.06s)]
*  and and providing for the the Samaritan that you meet in your [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=659.0s)]
*  journey and you know what bothers me a lot with today's [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=665.9s)]
*  or Christo-fascism or Christian nationalism, [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=671.8s)]
*  is that if he gets that the man they purportedly follow, [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=675.68s)]
*  Jesus Christ, was himself a refugee, [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=682.3599999999999s)]
*  was a self, a migrant, [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=686.64s)]
*  who fled the oppression of a government [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=691.24s)]
*  that wanted to kill him, [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=693.8399999999999s)]
*  and went to a little place called Bethlehem, [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=696.38s)]
*  where he was born. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=700.3199999999999s)]
*  And if the government of Bethlehem [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=702.3599999999999s)]
*  looked at Mary and Joseph as they entered the gates [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=706.56s)]
*  and said, who the hell are you? [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=709.1999999999999s)]
*  What are you doing here? [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=710.9599999999999s)]
*  Get the hell out. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=713.92s)]
*  I'm pretty sure that Pontius Pilate [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=714.76s)]
*  is the hero of the Easter story. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=716.1999999999999s)]
*  It's been a while since I've been in Catholic school, [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=717.56s)]
*  but I'm pretty sure. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=722.04s)]
*  Just a quick aside on all that, [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=723.8399999999999s)]
*  one of our past sponsors of this podcast [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=725.4799999999999s)]
*  is the Jesuit Refugee Service, [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=728.52s)]
*  which is a great charity to support on this front [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=731.0s)]
*  in the town of the Jesuit Pope, [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=733.24s)]
*  and the Michael Steele spirit of the lessons [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=736.16s)]
*  of the Christmas story and the Easter story, [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=740.16s)]
*  rather than the send them to a hole in El Salvador lesson, [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=742.76s)]
*  which I think I must have missed that week. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=747.04s)]
*  I missed that week too. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=749.92s)]
*  I wanna get back to the immigration stuff in a second, [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=751.44s)]
*  but I was trying to think where, [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=754.92s)]
*  which of all the crazy stuff happened in the administration [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=757.28s)]
*  that I wanna start with, was Michael Steele. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=759.8s)]
*  And I saw a draft of something [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=761.84s)]
*  Sam Stein's working on for today, [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=763.96s)]
*  which is just a list of all the things they've messed up. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=765.3199999999999s)]
*  And I think this is a good place to start, right? [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=768.96s)]
*  Because we have a lot of ideological differences [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=770.56s)]
*  with what's happening with the administration, [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=772.84s)]
*  but even if you wanted mega nationalism, [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=774.16s)]
*  it has just been a shit show of unbelievable proportions. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=778.3199999999999s)]
*  The Albrego Garcia thing they admit was wrong. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=781.04s)]
*  Harvard, the letter they said that was sent by accident, [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=783.6s)]
*  that was in a story over the weekend. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=786.36s)]
*  The signal chat was a mistake. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=787.56s)]
*  The Terra formula had a math mistake. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=789.0s)]
*  According to the economist, they cited the Doge cuts [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=790.72s)]
*  that they made and then pulled back [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=793.84s)]
*  and then made them pull back. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=795.2800000000001s)]
*  And then Elon's in the Oval Office saying, [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=796.24s)]
*  well, you're not gonna get bad a thousand percent. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=797.64s)]
*  They sent out an email accidentally outing the names [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=799.9200000000001s)]
*  of the CIA hires, the new CIA hires. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=802.36s)]
*  I mean, these are just screw ups. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=805.0400000000001s)]
*  Like this is just a comedy of errors [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=807.6800000000001s)]
*  by a bunch of amateurs that are not up for it. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=810.72s)]
*  So I thought maybe that'd be a good place to start. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=813.76s)]
*  I'm letting you go with it where you want it. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=815.96s)]
*  It is a good place to start because [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=817.92s)]
*  I think you just insulted the amateurs out there. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=821.0s)]
*  And the reason I think you did is because even an amateur [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=825.24s)]
*  has a working understanding of what the job is [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=828.24s)]
*  and what the limitations and requirements of the job are. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=832.24s)]
*  Actually, they over perform [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=836.4s)]
*  because they don't want to make the mistake. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=839.36s)]
*  So we've all had that experience as amateurs [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=841.76s)]
*  with something very early in our careers [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=846.04s)]
*  or bringing someone in who's new to the work we're doing. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=848.0s)]
*  These folks generally don't like government. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=854.24s)]
*  They don't like the people who serve in government. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=857.68s)]
*  And what is the big lie, Tim, [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=860.7199999999999s)]
*  is they don't like the people who rely [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=863.8s)]
*  on the service of government [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=866.28s)]
*  because that last part is the sticky part [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=868.1999999999999s)]
*  because what they're now seeing in town halls [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=871.8s)]
*  and red districts in protests across the nation [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=875.16s)]
*  is that the American people, [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=879.4s)]
*  for all of their concerns and maybe even lack of trust [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=881.52s)]
*  with some aspects of government, still rely on it. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=887.52s)]
*  Still need it. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=892.4s)]
*  They understand what social security is there for [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=893.4399999999999s)]
*  because they've paid into it. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=896.76s)]
*  They understand why Medicaid is important [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=898.88s)]
*  because their mother, their father, their grandparent [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=902.1999999999999s)]
*  or themselves otherwise wouldn't get the healthcare [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=906.12s)]
*  that they need. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=907.84s)]
*  They understand what the Department of Education [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=909.24s)]
*  at the federal level is there for. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=912.5600000000001s)]
*  They recognize that the states absolutely control [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=914.24s)]
*  the outcome of educational training and programs, et cetera. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=917.0s)]
*  But they also appreciate the fact [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=920.76s)]
*  that their special ed kid gets a little extra help [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=922.4s)]
*  from the federal government to get to stay a certain pace, [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=924.68s)]
*  to learn and to graduate [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=929.04s)]
*  and to try to become a productive person in our society. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=931.04s)]
*  So they understand these things. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=934.08s)]
*  The problem now with the MAGA folks inside the government [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=935.96s)]
*  who just wants to go in like, you know, [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=941.12s)]
*  Elon Musk with the bus saw [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=945.88s)]
*  just going to start cutting and tearing and then go, [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=948.0s)]
*  oops, didn't mean to hit that. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=950.48s)]
*  Oh, wow, I didn't know that was there. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=952.2800000000001s)]
*  That's important. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=954.6s)]
*  Is they're now hearing from the very people [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=956.5200000000001s)]
*  they thought would be standing out there cheering them [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=960.0400000000001s)]
*  and they're not because they're wrong. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=963.56s)]
*  And what we're seeing now, particularly in this space [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=966.52s)]
*  with Abrego Garcia is I don't care, Tim. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=970.64s)]
*  I don't give a damn if Abrego Garcia is the head of MS-13. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=975.1999999999999s)]
*  I don't give a damn. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=981.04s)]
*  They have some evidence if he was the head, but. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=981.88s)]
*  Thank you, but I'm just right. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=983.84s)]
*  And I don't give a damn if he's Mother Teresa. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=985.24s)]
*  But what I do give a damn about [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=989.8s)]
*  is that if our criminal justice system wants to pull him in [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=991.7199999999999s)]
*  that A, to your point, they have the evidence [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=996.16s)]
*  and B, he's allowed the due process [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=998.8399999999999s)]
*  to confront that evidence [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1001.8s)]
*  and to attest to his innocence or whatever. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1003.8s)]
*  But that process is important [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1007.9599999999999s)]
*  because if you strip that away for Abrego Garcia, [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1010.4399999999999s)]
*  Tim Miller, Michael Steele, Jane Doe, John Doe are next. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1014.4399999999999s)]
*  And we know that's the end game. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1020.4000000000001s)]
*  Why? [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1023.08s)]
*  Go back to the point, the last point I made, [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1023.9200000000001s)]
*  because they fundamentally don't like the people [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1026.0s)]
*  that the government is there to serve. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1030.04s)]
*  And they want to create a space [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1032.96s)]
*  in which the only folks around them and in their orbit [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1035.1200000000001s)]
*  are blind loyalists who at any moment [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1038.8400000000001s)]
*  they can kick to the curb. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1042.76s)]
*  But until that moment occurs, [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1044.6000000000001s)]
*  we'll do whatever they want them to do. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1046.6000000000001s)]
*  And that's not how the country was built. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1050.2s)]
*  It's interesting that you went there, Michael. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1052.1599999999999s)]
*  I was gonna save this for later, [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1053.72s)]
*  but it's just so on the nose [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1054.9199999999998s)]
*  that you kind of understand the threats and the process [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1056.32s)]
*  and the concerns about what is happening [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1058.9199999999998s)]
*  with due process in this country. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1060.8s)]
*  Because yesterday on Fox, [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1062.6399999999999s)]
*  Will Kane is one of the new Fox himbo's. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1065.08s)]
*  He had a Maxwell Frost on. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1068.96s)]
*  Frost was live from San Salvador and good on him [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1070.9199999999998s)]
*  and a couple other Democrats [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1074.04s)]
*  who are continuing to push on this. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1075.12s)]
*  There was a group that went down there. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1077.08s)]
*  But Frost brought up what you just brought up, right? [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1079.8799999999999s)]
*  The fact that Trump has said that the next group [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1082.0s)]
*  he wants to send to El Salvador are US citizens. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1084.3999999999999s)]
*  He wants to send them to Sokote. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1086.4399999999998s)]
*  And after he brought this up, some hilarity ensued. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1088.52s)]
*  So I want to play for people that exchange with Will Kane [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1092.0s)]
*  and then Will Kane's attempt to clean up [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1095.48s)]
*  so it'll be two clubs back to back. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1097.6399999999999s)]
*  Let's listen. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1098.9199999999998s)]
*  Do you have that in front of you? [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1099.76s)]
*  I've not seen that statement. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1100.76s)]
*  Can you please quote where that comes from [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1101.76s)]
*  that he would like to deport American citizens? [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1103.28s)]
*  He said it in the Oval Office. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1106.8s)]
*  He said he wants to go for homegrown snacks. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1108.04s)]
*  People born and raised in the United States. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1110.6s)]
*  Do you have anything besides your word on that? [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1113.32s)]
*  I have not seen that. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1116.04s)]
*  So after years of very fine people among other hoaxes, [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1118.32s)]
*  I'm suspicious of any Democrat quoting President Trump [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1122.1599999999999s)]
*  in full context. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1124.44s)]
*  And I make no apologies, none, [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1125.52s)]
*  on not being able to know or recall that specific clip [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1128.1599999999999s)]
*  because it doesn't reinforce my fever dream [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1130.6s)]
*  handmaid's tale vision of America. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1132.96s)]
*  Where Lily, who reads the bulwark on the Upper West Side [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1135.12s)]
*  is about to be deported right after killer Briego Garcia. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1138.3200000000002s)]
*  Actually is aware of what the President of the United States says. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1140.64s)]
*  Right! [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1142.76s)]
*  Lily, who reads the bulwark, is aware of the news. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1143.6000000000001s)]
*  I know you're supposed to be a news anchor, [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1146.28s)]
*  so there is a gap between you and Lily out there. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1147.96s)]
*  And Lily doesn't think she's going next. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1151.5600000000002s)]
*  She thinks that the American citizens who Trump thinks [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1154.16s)]
*  are accusers of being a criminal are going next. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1159.1200000000001s)]
*  And that is the fucking risk here, right, Chairman? [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1162.0800000000002s)]
*  That's exactly the risk, and we're all at risk. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1165.32s)]
*  Look, the thing that's in the way, [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1169.48s)]
*  the thing that is in the way of everything Donald Trump wants to do, [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1174.08s)]
*  or more to the point that people around him want to do, [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1179.2s)]
*  the Steve Millers, et cetera, is the Constitution. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1182.56s)]
*  It's not the regulations on fluoride. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1187.08s)]
*  It's not whether or not you fund USAID. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1190.84s)]
*  It's not whether or not this department or that department [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1196.12s)]
*  is large or small, has one person or a thousand people. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1199.8799999999999s)]
*  It is the Constitution. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1203.4399999999998s)]
*  Because if you did not have that, the rest of this doesn't matter. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1205.9599999999998s)]
*  It doesn't matter. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1211.8799999999999s)]
*  If we did not have that, Michael Steele and Tim Miller [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1212.9599999999998s)]
*  would not be on this mic right now. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1215.9199999999998s)]
*  Because there would have been jackbooted thugs [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1218.76s)]
*  coming to his location in mind to shut it down. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1221.16s)]
*  That's what this is about, and it's not hyperbole. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1225.16s)]
*  And Fox can level up stupid to sit behind a desk in front of a camera [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1227.96s)]
*  and sit there and go, oh, well, you know, I'm not going to make any excuse [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1232.68s)]
*  or apologize for not knowing stuff. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1236.84s)]
*  Then shut the hell up. Why are you there? [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1238.56s)]
*  You're pushing out the same level of stupid [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1241.04s)]
*  that has infected the political process. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1246.52s)]
*  But you know what? That's OK. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1249.48s)]
*  Why? Because the Constitution allows you to do it. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1252.08s)]
*  And if it wasn't there, guess what? [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1256.48s)]
*  There would be someone to come take you off the air. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1259.6s)]
*  So that's what this boils down to. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1263.32s)]
*  And I just wish people and, you know, to a certain extent, [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1266.2s)]
*  from going back to my rant about two months ago, [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1270.44s)]
*  where I kind of lost my shit and just kind of said, [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1273.04s)]
*  Simone asked me, she said, well, what do you want people to do? [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1276.2s)]
*  I just said I want them to give a damn. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1278.72s)]
*  I want them to show they care about what's happening to the country, [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1280.8400000000001s)]
*  that these people don't like them, don't want them, [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1284.6000000000001s)]
*  and is doing everything they can to make their lives miserable, [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1287.8s)]
*  miserable deliberately. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1291.56s)]
*  And it's nice to see now people taking to the streets more, [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1293.76s)]
*  expressing more directly their concerns, showing up at town halls, [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1297.92s)]
*  even creating town halls, they know their members not going to come to. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1301.6000000000001s)]
*  So the next step, folks, is to unelect those who are not in service [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1304.92s)]
*  to the American people, who are not in service to the concerns that you have. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1310.68s)]
*  We are no longer in the land of $7 cartons of egg. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1316.24s)]
*  We're beyond that. In fact, it was never really about that. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1320.44s)]
*  If you're honest people, come on, just be honest. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1323.0800000000002s)]
*  You know what? It really was about the $7 egg. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1325.0800000000002s)]
*  You know why? Because you took a vacation that summer [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1327.7600000000002s)]
*  and you could have saved up the money for the eggs in the fall. Right? [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1330.0800000000002s)]
*  We know what 2024 was like for most people. It was OK. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1333.76s)]
*  But there were other things that were going on that really pissed you off. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1338.4s)]
*  And that's respectable. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1341.28s)]
*  And that should have been addressed by the Democrats. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1342.88s)]
*  And it wasn't. OK. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1344.92s)]
*  So now you have the power to address those things more directly [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1347.2s)]
*  with your elected officials. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1350.6000000000001s)]
*  And the fact that if you held a town hall and they don't show up, [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1352.56s)]
*  if they come and stand in front of you with arrogance and disdain [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1355.88s)]
*  for the fact that you are concerned about Abrego Garcia [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1359.52s)]
*  because you know he represents you and your rights. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1363.96s)]
*  If you're concerned about that and that congressman isn't, [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1367.56s)]
*  that congressman no longer should have a job. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1371.32s)]
*  That's what the power of our Constitution allows. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1374.04s)]
*  That's why we, the people, Tim, are the most important words [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1376.88s)]
*  in our founding documents, because these men, it's, you know, flawed [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1380.76s)]
*  and at times failing as they were, wrote something [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1386.68s)]
*  unlike anything written politically, except the Magna Carta, [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1391.5600000000002s)]
*  which first established the rights of the common man. Right. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1396.16s)]
*  Allows you, allows you to be the government, [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1401.24s)]
*  not the institutions and certainly not Donald Trump. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1407.2s)]
*  That's Donald Trump is a modern day King George. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1412.44s)]
*  And we know how that story ended. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1415.6s)]
*  And as we come up on our 250th, we need to remember that. Yeah. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1417.92s)]
*  Yeah. No, it's the this is why the importance, just put a finer point [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1422.56s)]
*  on what you're saying of like of acting now to stall or slow this [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1426.36s)]
*  to speak out against it now, because they are going to push as far as they can. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1430.1599999999999s)]
*  But like, this is like the element of all this, right? [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1433.96s)]
*  That it's like, it's not about the details of Abrego Garcia, [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1435.96s)]
*  because it's like, OK, well, had they just gotten away [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1439.08s)]
*  with sending three planes to El Salvador and, you know, [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1442.28s)]
*  the New York Times wrote one article about it and a couple of immigration [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1446.76s)]
*  lawyers filed some complaints and I yelled about it on the Bullock podcast. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1449.64s)]
*  And then nobody cared. And they moved on the next day. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1453.8s)]
*  Then then there would have been another plane. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1456.52s)]
*  And another plane wouldn't have been shout out, Lilly, from the Upper West Side. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1458.76s)]
*  It wouldn't have been Lily, but it would have been, you know, [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1461.6000000000001s)]
*  criminals or people accused of criminals. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1463.44s)]
*  But we're not too far away from getting to Chris Krebs, you know, [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1465.32s)]
*  and you don't want to. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1468.72s)]
*  And you can't tell me that Chris Krebs, [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1469.92s)]
*  American citizen that is a political opponent of Donald Trump, isn't on that list. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1473.16s)]
*  Maybe not for El Salvador, but for for being targeted [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1477.2s)]
*  for criminal actions by this government, because they're already doing that. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1480.88s)]
*  They're already trying to do that. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1484.3200000000002s)]
*  They said the president signed an executive order [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1486.1200000000001s)]
*  specifically targeting a political foe. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1488.5600000000002s)]
*  So like you have to gum up the works right now to to slow this [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1490.5600000000002s)]
*  because we can't stop this process. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1496.0s)]
*  You know, because you got elected. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1498.24s)]
*  But you can slow it now. You can fight. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1499.56s)]
*  You can fight back against it. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1501.6s)]
*  And then you get to the midterms, right? [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1502.76s)]
*  Like that's there is a lot of steps in this process. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1503.76s)]
*  And there are a lot of steps in the process. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1506.32s)]
*  And you put your finger on [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1508.24s)]
*  an essential feature of that. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1511.72s)]
*  And that is understanding what the process is, because you know [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1513.72s)]
*  that in the moment, your voice is the most important asset we have. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1518.96s)]
*  And that's why the protest matters. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1523.2s)]
*  That's why when you're looking at, you know, [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1525.4s)]
*  the number of people coming out and engaging, [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1529.0400000000002s)]
*  it does rattle this White House. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1532.8000000000002s)]
*  It certainly rattles the members of Congress. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1535.0400000000002s)]
*  And then they're now caught between loyalty to their base. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1537.1200000000001s)]
*  All right. That elected them in their primary [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1540.88s)]
*  and thereby loyalty to Trump or loyalty to [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1544.8000000000002s)]
*  their service in the people in the community writ large. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1549.4s)]
*  And that by your love, the way you put it, if you just had Tim [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1553.6799999999998s)]
*  on his mic every week, sort of saying, hey, y'all, [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1558.3999999999999s)]
*  they've taken people away, they put them on planes [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1562.8799999999999s)]
*  and a newspaper writing one story. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1566.2s)]
*  And everybody else is kind of gone. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1569.1599999999999s)]
*  There goes those two going at it again. Right. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1571.52s)]
*  When we wake up with the knock at the door, [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1575.9199999999998s)]
*  we're going to be wondering, well, how the hell did we get here? [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1579.4399999999998s)]
*  Well, Tim was on a mic telling you about for the last year [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1581.6399999999999s)]
*  this was coming. But that's not where we are. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1585.8799999999999s)]
*  What's happened is there are a lot of Tim Miller's out there. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1588.7199999999998s)]
*  There are a lot of Michael Steele's out there. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1592.0s)]
*  There are a lot of Miles Taylor's and Krebs out there. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1594.12s)]
*  People who are finding ways to resist either [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1597.28s)]
*  after being fired from their job by Elon Musk [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1601.76s)]
*  now coming back and suing them, holding them accountable for their action [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1605.6399999999999s)]
*  or running for office. In some of those cases, we did an article on that. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1610.0s)]
*  What about that? [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1612.92s)]
*  A lot of talk about that. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1614.2s)]
*  A lot of federal employees now like, OK, y'all want to play? Let's play. Yeah. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1616.6s)]
*  No, that's great. It's something that I've been people like, what can I do? [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1620.84s)]
*  What can I do when not everybody's going to run for Congress? [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1623.84s)]
*  Right. But encourage some, you know, you got somebody in your life, [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1625.52s)]
*  somebody in your network, somebody you can support. Right. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1628.04s)]
*  That because I do think that I get more people on the field is [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1630.1200000000001s)]
*  important is like a critical part of this right now. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1634.44s)]
*  It is an essential part. [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1637.16s)]
*  You were doing in 2010 that the R&T, right? [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1638.4s)]
*  It's like more you can't win if you're not playing. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1639.92s)]
*  I only only get to the economy in a second. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1642.48s)]
*  But if things keep going the way it looks, you know, there are going to be some areas [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1644.16s)]
*  where where where where where Democrats haven't won in a while [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1647.64s)]
*  that they could have a chance to win if they got somebody on the that is on the field [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1651.48s)]
*  with a story, with a narrative that's talking about how they care. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1655.3200000000002s)]
*  You know, they want to fix things for their fellow, you know, whatever state [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1658.5600000000002s)]
*  you're in, Iowans rather than, you know, being whatever strident ideologues [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1662.0400000000002s)]
*  about voters have to what I said this in 2020, repeated it in 24. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1666.4s)]
*  But in 26, it is going to be enormously more important than those two periods. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1672.3600000000001s)]
*  They have to overwhelm the ballot box with their vote. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1678.3200000000002s)]
*  You know, I've been saying I said this on the weekend [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1682.48s)]
*  a number of weeks now in a row, and I will keep saying this [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1686.52s)]
*  to understand, I think you appreciate this. [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1689.8000000000002s)]
*  I know you appreciate this. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1692.0400000000002s)]
*  What the end game is here. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1694.0400000000002s)]
*  The end game is not 2028. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1695.44s)]
*  The end game is 2026, because in 2026, [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1698.04s)]
*  Republicans know and certainly MAGA Republicans around Trump [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1702.3600000000001s)]
*  know that they could very well lose the House. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1706.3600000000001s)]
*  They don't want to lose the House. [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1709.3200000000002s)]
*  You lose the House. [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1710.92s)]
*  And then all of a sudden, everything else for the next two years [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1711.76s)]
*  becomes that much harder to do. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1714.92s)]
*  Now you'll have a Democratic controlled Congress [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1717.3200000000002s)]
*  that will be hauling people's ass to their committees, [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1720.72s)]
*  demanding information, doing investigations, etc., etc. [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1723.68s)]
*  And they don't want they don't want that. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1727.44s)]
*  They don't need that noise from within side Washington. [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1729.0s)]
*  They don't need that resistance from Capitol Hill. [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1732.36s)]
*  So it's imperative that they keep the House. Right. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1735.8s)]
*  So when the president issues an executive order [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1739.3999999999999s)]
*  reconfiguring our elections, understand, folks, this is not about 2028. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1742.6399999999999s)]
*  This is about 2026. [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1746.76s)]
*  Part two of that, to get to part one is, OK, [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1748.84s)]
*  how do we how do we safeguard? [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1753.32s)]
*  Well, let's see a little thing called the Insurrection Act. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1755.32s)]
*  If you've noticed, there have been stories now popping up here and there, [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1759.2s)]
*  very much as you just described, you know, Tim is on his mic. [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1762.6399999999999s)]
*  The New York Times does one thing and everybody else moves on. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1765.32s)]
*  Well, there are stories now that people need to pay attention to [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1768.12s)]
*  about folks inside the White House because they can't help themselves. [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1771.48s)]
*  They talk too much. [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1774.84s)]
*  Talking about a strategy around the Insurrection Act. [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1776.0s)]
*  That's why I keep warning people when you protest, behave yourselves. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1780.44s)]
*  Don't get caught up in stupid. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1783.3600000000001s)]
*  Right. Don't get drawn into confrontation. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1785.3600000000001s)]
*  Number one. And for organizers to to police your people. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1789.3600000000001s)]
*  In other words, have a better understanding of who's out on the streets with you [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1794.0800000000002s)]
*  because they will they will send people infiltrate. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1798.1200000000001s)]
*  This is they always project, Tim, you know that. [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1801.24s)]
*  Oh, yeah, look, they paid these Democrats to come to the town hall. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1804.0800000000002s)]
*  No, they didn't. Because if that if they paid them, [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1807.84s)]
*  then why then what then what's the problem then? [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1812.08s)]
*  Why don't you why don't you pretend you're a Democrat, [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1815.6399999999999s)]
*  get paid and expose it? [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1820.08s)]
*  Right. I haven't seen any of that because it doesn't exist. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1823.84s)]
*  But when you have a large gathering of protesters, I can put people in there [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1828.6s)]
*  and mix it up and cause a fight. [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1832.6s)]
*  And then guess what? [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1834.76s)]
*  Then Trump said, oh, see, look at all that. [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1836.16s)]
*  Look at the violence. Look at all that violence. [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1838.88s)]
*  And he invokes the Insurrection Act to put down the violence [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1842.1200000000001s)]

*  And so we need to be mindful of what the end game is here. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1850.0s)]
*  And the end game is always the ballot box. Why? [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1854.0400000000002s)]
*  Because it is the essential power of we the people. [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1857.2s)]
*  Somehow, 30 minutes in here, we haven't even talked about our [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1861.3600000000001s)]
*  our blow dried secretary of defense, [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1865.72s)]

*  Who knows? [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1871.52s)]
*  He was on Fox and Friends this morning doing some damage control, [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1872.8799999999999s)]
*  blaming the deep state for coming after him. [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1876.6399999999999s)]
*  It's an interesting deep state, you know, that when the deep state includes [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1878.9599999999998s)]
*  somebody that you hired to run your public public affairs department [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1882.28s)]
*  is a longtime friend of yours and a longtime supporter of Donald Trump's. [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1885.9199999999998s)]
*  And then he writes an article about how you're a complete disaster. [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1889.0s)]
*  And then Trump needs to move on for you to save his presidency. [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1892.08s)]
*  That's an intriguing deep. [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1895.48s)]
*  That's not the kind of deep state that I've heard. [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1896.56s)]
*  Not the kind of you say that I know. [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1898.72s)]
*  But anyway, what what have you made of what's happened with the secretary? [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1900.24s)]
*  It's a joke. [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1903.68s)]
*  He's just proving exactly why there should have been more concerns [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1904.56s)]
*  and alarms about him when his name was proposed. [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1907.72s)]
*  You know, when you're looking, you know, whether it's, you know, [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1912.76s)]
*  oh, everybody focused on Matt Gaetz and I knew this was going to happen. [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1916.32s)]
*  Everybody focused on Matt Gaetz. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1919.92s)]
*  And so everyone that seems less offensive than Matt Gaetz. [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1921.68s)]
*  And so, well, Lisa's not Matt Gaetz. [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1926.72s)]
*  Yeah, but it's actually worse. [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1929.44s)]
*  All right. And it was obvious at the time. [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1931.5600000000002s)]
*  It's just obvious at the time, whether it's secretary of defense, [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1934.3600000000001s)]
*  whether it's the attorney general, Pam Bondi, [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1937.96s)]

*  All of these people are cut out of the same cesspool [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1944.6000000000001s)]
*  of of stupid. [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1948.32s)]
*  And so I'm not surprised. [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1950.32s)]
*  And nor is anybody else surprised. [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1952.8s)]
*  No one in Washington is surprised by this. [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1954.6799999999998s)]
*  They might have been no one took three months. [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1957.48s)]
*  They might have thought he could last a year or three months. [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1960.12s)]
*  Did you really? I didn't. [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1962.96s)]
*  But I mean, you may be some of those Republicans on the Senate [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1964.8799999999999s)]
*  that confirmed him thought they were buying themselves a year. [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1967.6s)]
*  I mean, what are you doing if you're John Cornyn or Mike Rounds or Roger Wicker? [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1970.1599999999999s)]
*  Like, you know, confirming a complete ass clown [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1975.8799999999999s)]
*  to run the U.S. military. [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1980.8s)]
*  And it just boggled the mind that they. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1982.44s)]
*  And so I do think they must have convinced themselves that, [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1985.0s)]
*  I don't know, he'd have good who the fuck knows what they convinced themselves. [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1988.12s)]
*  But did they really think that April 22 that it would be one fiscal quarter [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1990.8s)]
*  before people before he would have totally, you know, imploded? [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1995.0s)]
*  He is a complete incompetent. [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=1999.24s)]
*  He is a weekend talk show host. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=2002.08s)]
*  And as a weekend talk show host, [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=2005.52s)]
*  I can at least say I ran a government. [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=2008.4s)]
*  I ran a national party as a co-host. [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=2010.8s)]
*  I ran a national party. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=2014.0s)]
*  I did some stuff before I got to that job. Right. [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=2016.28s)]
*  You're a monastery. [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=2020.0s)]
*  You weren't, you know, you weren't [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=2021.4s)]

*  You know, you're in a monastery. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=2031.04s)]
*  So like, that's too much work. [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=2032.24s)]
*  That's way too much work. [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=2033.68s)]

*  Look, I know I that's way too much work, [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=2040.3200000000002s)]
*  but it wasn't too much work for him. [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=2043.4s)]
*  And what sad to him, it was too much work for the United States [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=2046.28s)]
*  Senate Republicans to tell the president, send us somebody else. [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=2049.76s)]
*  Give me somebody better than this, because our defense of our nation is paramount. [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=2054.56s)]

*  Well, what are they doing? [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=2079.48s)]
*  They're speaking about stuff you did. [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=2080.76s)]

*  But I don't know if regular folks have the doubt. [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=2397.64s)]
*  This is the Wall Street Journal. [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=2400.64s)]
*  This is not some woke, woke, liberal, lefty economist here. [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=2402.3599999999997s)]
*  The Wall Street Journal yesterday, the Dow Jones shed almost a thousand points [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=2405.92s)]
*  on Monday and is headed for its worst April performance since the Great Depression. [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=2409.56s)]

*  for any president up to this point in data going back to 1928. [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=2417.2s)]
*  I and it's all self-inflicted. [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=2422.0s)]
*  None of this was had anything to do with economic conditions or a pandemic [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=2424.92s)]
*  or whatever, you know, a bubble popped that was, you know, you know, the housing market. [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=2430.6s)]
*  I like this is all completely self-inflicted because we have a total imbecile [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=2434.52s)]
*  running the government, just hammering himself in the deck over and over again. [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=2440.16s)]
*  And my question for you, Michael, is I've had we've had economy experts on to talk [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=2444.2799999999997s)]
*  about that. So what I want to get your take on what you're an expert on is [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=2448.44s)]
*  where is where are the business advocacy groups shouting about this? [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=2451.8399999999997s)]
*  You we don't you dealt with this back in 2008. [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=2457.4s)]
*  Obama, there are things I didn't like about Obamacare, but like Obama tries to pass [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=2460.2s)]
*  Obamacare to get health care to more people. [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=2464.0s)]
*  And all these advocacy groups, the Chamber of Commerce and Pharma, and all these guys [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=2465.7999999999997s)]
*  are out there screaming bloody murder. [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=2469.3199999999997s)]
*  This is socialism. This is communism. [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=2471.44s)]
*  I mean, while Obama oversaw kind of a stagnant, but slightly growing economy [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=2474.3199999999997s)]
*  that was like basically directionally fine, could have been better, could have been worse. [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=2479.56s)]
*  Trump is is single handedly our country's economic status globally. [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=2483.3199999999997s)]
*  And all these guys are just quiet. [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=2489.36s)]
*  They're still sucking up to them. [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=2492.64s)]
*  I mean, what is explain that to me? [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=2494.0s)]
*  It's it is one of the more depressing and [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=2496.16s)]
*  just frustrating aspects of this. [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=2502.08s)]
*  A lot of it stems from the fact that they feel they don't they don't want to be a target. [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=2506.64s)]
*  They what Trump has done to law firms, what he's done [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=2511.56s)]
*  to other groups and individuals, how he's clearly identified his his little [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=2516.0s)]
*  Billionaire's Boys Club of favorites. [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=2520.92s)]
*  They want to be a part of that. [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=2524.1200000000003s)]
*  They don't want to be on the outside of Donald Trump's favor. [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=2525.92s)]
*  I don't get it. [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=2529.96s)]
*  I have yet to understand what what the magnetism is. [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=2531.1200000000003s)]
*  And I don't even understand what the threat is, because the strength is in their numbers. [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=2535.76s)]
*  These are the men and women who are part of the infrastructure of our economy. [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=2542.96s)]
*  They are the ones who are at the center of wealth creation, job creation, [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=2547.76s)]
*  the movement of the markets. [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=2552.88s)]
*  They and we how do we know that? [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=2554.96s)]
*  Because we've seen when they decide to act in unison, for example, [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=2557.36s)]
*  the bond market responds, right, which is a combination of both domestic and [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=2562.16s)]
*  international engagement in that space. [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=2568.08s)]
*  Trump will correct his course. [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=2571.68s)]
*  So I don't know what they want out of this other than to become wealthier than they are. [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=2575.68s)]
*  They want the tax cuts be kept in place. [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=2581.08s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=2584.08s)]
*  Some of these guys have lost like 25, 30 percent of their stock wealth. [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=2585.2799999999997s)]
*  I mean, I didn't go to business school, but I can do basic math. [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=2590.2799999999997s)]
*  The 2 percent tax cuts are going to be in the next year. [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=2593.48s)]
*  The 2 percent tax cut on the corporate tax rate does not make up for losing 20 percent [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=2596.68s)]
*  of the value of your company. [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=2604.08s)]
*  Like what are you doing? [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=2606.08s)]

*  But here's the rub on this. [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=2609.8799999999997s)]
*  It is not the billionaire boys or the millionaire mamas that are going to that [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=2612.2799999999997s)]
*  are driving this part of the are going to drive this part of the conversation. [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=2620.2799999999997s)]
*  It is the little shop owner who's had her corner in her community for 10, 15 years, [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=2624.96s)]
*  who can no longer afford to buy the inventory to her for her company because [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=2632.44s)]
*  it's gone up 150 percent. [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=2641.44s)]
*  It's gone up 25 percent. [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=2644.48s)]
*  There's a point where they cannot pass that cost on to the consumer and they close. [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=2647.36s)]
*  They go out of business. [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=2654.16s)]
*  That's part one. [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=2655.64s)]
*  Part two, to the extent that they can and do pass that cost on to the consumer. [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=2656.92s)]
*  And I'm just telling everybody, you don't have to listen to me and Tim. [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=2663.0s)]
*  You don't have to believe a damn word we're saying. [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=2666.48s)]

*  screw in a little screw on the back of the remote control. [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=2709.16s)]
*  There's a lot of demand out there for those jobs in America. [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=2712.08s)]
*  And so that's that is that's our economy. [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=2715.12s)]
*  We are a consumer a consumer based economy. [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=2720.0s)]
*  We we have yes, we want manufacturing in this country, but they're not going to [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=2723.6s)]
*  manufacture this remote control here in this country because there's not a U.S. [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=2728.64s)]
*  company that's going to stand up the cost to do that. [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=2733.44s)]
*  It's just it's just businesses have looked and moved globally and that [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=2737.56s)]
*  integration is important. Why? [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=2743.48s)]
*  Because we are at the leading edge of it. [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=2745.32s)]
*  Everybody wants to be like us. [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=2747.56s)]
*  They want to sell us products. [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=2749.32s)]
*  They want us to sell them stuff to the extent that we do. [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=2751.4s)]
*  But what Trump has done is created this this lie that somehow all of manufacturing, [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=2755.52s)]
*  everything that we have is manufactured here. [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=2763.0s)]
*  That's just not going to happen, folks. [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=2766.7599999999998s)]
*  It just isn't. [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=2769.44s)]
*  And if it does, this stapler that I spent eight dollars and ninety nine cents for [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=2770.4s)]
*  is going to cost me twenty eight dollars or thirty or forty dollars. [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=2777.12s)]
*  Because that's the cost of having it done here. [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=2782.88s)]
*  We forget the labor costs. [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=2786.88s)]
*  We forget the the production costs, the cost of materials, all these things. [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=2789.08s)]
*  So if it's a manufacturer, if I can go to Tim, who is in in France, [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=2794.7999999999997s)]
*  who who who who is the one who creates the screws to go into my into my [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=2801.72s)]
*  equipment, guess where and he's the cheaper than than I can get down the street [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=2808.12s)]
*  somewhere else, guess what I'm going to do? [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=2813.16s)]
*  I'm going to go to Tim. [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=2815.7599999999998s)]
*  I'm going to go to where the product is. [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=2817.4399999999996s)]
*  The cost is cheaper to me because it stays cheaper for you. [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=2819.24s)]
*  So when you break that, which is what Trump is trying to do. [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=2823.2s)]
*  The downward impact is not on the millionaire boy on the millionaire [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=2827.72s)]
*  mamas and the billionaire boys, it's on the mom and pop operation [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=2832.7599999999998s)]
*  in your neighborhood who has to close now will not be hiring your kid this summer, [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=2837.64s)]
*  will will will raise its prices. [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=2841.7599999999998s)]
*  So now everything you're buying in that community is going to cost you more. [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=2844.36s)]
*  And who's going to be held accountable for that? [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=2848.7599999999998s)]
*  You're going to blame Joe Biden for that? [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=2850.7599999999998s)]
*  Because that's what Donald Trump wants you to do. [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=2853.2799999999997s)]
*  He wants you to blame Joe Biden. [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=2855.36s)]
*  Joe Biden gave us the worst economy in the history of the world. [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=2856.96s)]
*  No, he didn't. [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=2859.92s)]
*  No, he didn't. [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=2861.08s)]
*  You're giving us the worst economy in the history of the world. [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=2862.12s)]
*  How do we know that? [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=2864.92s)]
*  Because the world markets are telling us that that's why the bond market did what [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=2865.96s)]
*  is did what is did what is done. [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=2870.7999999999997s)]
*  That's why the Dow is doing what it's doing. [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=2873.08s)]
*  And for those of you who are in the market, go look at that 401k. [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=2875.88s)]
*  How much did you lose? [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=2879.64s)]
*  Don't or don't you know, I'll just trust me. [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=2880.64s)]
*  It doesn't look pretty. [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=2883.36s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, this is why this is why the business guys and the small business. [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=2884.64s)]
*  This is why they speak up to it. [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=2887.96s)]
*  Can't just be activists. [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=2889.0s)]
*  Right. Like to back to your point from earlier, man, it's like you have power. [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=2890.24s)]
*  Everybody can't be cowering in this. [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=2894.2s)]
*  Right. [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=2896.16s)]
*  I get as easy for Trump to point at the whatever Gaza protesters on campus and be [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=2896.68s)]
*  like, those liberals are bad people or the Black Lives Matter protests or those, [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=2902.4s)]
*  you know, black folks are coming for you. [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=2905.92s)]
*  Like if if if the if people who are in charge of capital, charge of human capital [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=2907.72s)]
*  or money are speaking up and being like, this guy is a disaster, he's ruining [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=2914.12s)]
*  everything, he's going to hear that. [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=2917.7599999999998s)]
*  And it's a lot harder for him to demonize that person and say it's like a woke lefty. [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=2919.3199999999997s)]
*  So anyway, we I would like to hear more [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=2923.7599999999998s)]
*  from our friends in the business world who are losing a lot of money. [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=2926.36s)]
*  I would, too. I would, too. [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=2929.52s)]
*  I would be nice to have them actually stand on the side of the American consumer [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=2931.2799999999997s)]
*  to stand on the side of the American small business owner. [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=2937.0s)]
*  We can all create a space in which markets work that are that lead to fair trade. [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=2941.2400000000002s)]
*  So, yes. And look, bottom line, we know China is a piece of shit when it comes to [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=2949.2400000000002s)]
*  this space, no one's defending China, no one's excusing China and they need to pay [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=2954.0800000000004s)]
*  a price, but we we that's not what Trump is doing. [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=2958.4s)]
*  He's going after our adversary, after our friend. [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=2961.48s)]
*  And and Russia doesn't get here's the thing, you know, you he puts a tariff on [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=2965.3199999999997s)]
*  an island of penguins. [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=2971.92s)]
*  OK, yeah, you heard me. [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=2974.8799999999997s)]
*  You heard what I said. [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=2976.64s)]
*  I ain't making this up just for you Fox folks out there and I'm making it up. [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=2977.52s)]
*  It's true. You put a tariff on an island of penguins, [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=2981.3599999999997s)]
*  but he can't put a tariff on on Russia. [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=2984.56s)]
*  And so don't give me this. [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=2987.72s)]
*  Oh, well, they they have sanctions and that's no, we still do about three [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=2989.16s)]
*  billion dollars plus of trade with Russia. [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=2994.36s)]
*  Right. So but they were not on that list. [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=2998.28s)]
*  The reality of it is there is the only plan here is to disrupt the market and to try [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=3001.56s)]
*  to grab control of the Fed. [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=3008.6400000000003s)]
*  Are you concerned about his control of the Fed, Tim? [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=3009.96s)]
*  Because I know I am extremely. [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=3012.44s)]
*  And if you talk to the smart people on the finance folks, you know, not the business [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=3014.2400000000002s)]
*  guys who have been who have been silent and who just wanted to be able to say the [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=3018.6800000000003s)]
*  R word again or whatever, but like, you know, the smart analysts, [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=3021.84s)]
*  that's like the top worry right now. [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=3025.28s)]
*  If that happens, I'll just put it, you know, put it straight up. [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=3027.6400000000003s)]
*  If that happens, the collapse that we've seen so far in the market will be a it [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=3030.48s)]
*  will be like a picnic. It will be. [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=3035.8s)]
*  You can't even begin to imagine the bottom falling out the way it would if if [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=3039.7200000000003s)]
*  Donald Trump fires the Fed chair, Jerome Powell, if he somehow keeps him in place, [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=3044.92s)]
*  but then wrestles control of of the Fed in some other way, you just don't. [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=3053.0s)]
*  You really need to appreciate what that means and why an independent Fed, [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=3058.36s)]
*  which has been the bane of both Republicans and Democratic presidents in the past. [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=3064.36s)]
*  Right. This is nothing new. [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=3068.2400000000002s)]
*  But they are that through line in our economy [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=3070.7200000000003s)]
*  because they represent an essential ingredient in our economy, which is the [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=3074.72s)]
*  bond market, which is the value of the dollar, which is collapsing, etc. [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=3079.52s)]
*  So be mindful. [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=3083.32s)]
*  While we're down here in the darkness, I got one more dark story. [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=3086.24s)]
*  I haven't I haven't really I've mentioned this in passing, but I haven't really [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=3088.6s)]
*  covered it. And I just before I lose, I just I feel like we're talking about [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=3091.48s)]
*  because NBC did a big, big story on this. [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=3094.4s)]
*  I want to just read a little bit from it. [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=3097.0s)]
*  A groundbreaking microscope at Harvard [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=3099.32s)]
*  Medical School could lead to breakthroughs in cancer detection and research. [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=3102.64s)]
*  That seems pretty important. [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=3107.12s)]
*  The scientists that developed the computer scripts to read the images [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=3108.88s)]
*  on this on this microscope has been in an immigration detention center for two [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=3113.68s)]
*  months, putting these crucial scientific advancements at risk. [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=3117.92s)]
*  The scientists, the 30 year old Russian born [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=3121.3199999999997s)]
*  came at Petrova, worked at Harvard's renowned Kirchner lab until she was [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=3123.88s)]
*  arrested at Boston Airport in mid February. [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=3128.24s)]
*  She had some frog embryos, I guess, that she did not declare on her form. [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=3130.7999999999997s)]
*  She's now being held down here in Monroe, [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=3137.04s)]
*  Louisiana, at an ICE detention center and is fighting deportation back to Russia, [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=3139.0s)]
*  even though she's spoken out about the war in Ukraine. [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=3143.2799999999997s)]
*  I you know, I don't I'm not a foreigner who comes in. [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=3147.52s)]
*  It was a scientist who has embryos. [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=3150.56s)]
*  I was curious, like, what is the usual punishment for something like this? [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=3152.36s)]
*  And and here's what it is. [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=3156.36s)]

*  So, you know, the government would get the frog embryos and then you get a five [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=3164.2s)]
*  hundred dollar fine. That's how things were up until three months ago. [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=3167.64s)]

*  This is this is the future if we don't stop it. [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=3187.64s)]
*  This is the tip of the iceberg. [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=3193.44s)]
*  We've already begun to see the impact by the Doge idiots going in [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=3195.88s)]
*  the national research centers, certainly now the assault on universities, [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=3204.6800000000003s)]
*  the brain drain that's going to happen, Tim, is going to be staggering [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=3211.44s)]
*  where once we were the place that the the elite thinkers, researchers wanted to come [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=3218.0800000000004s)]
*  to because we have the facilities unfettered, right, access the freedom to do [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=3226.96s)]
*  and pursue that research. [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=3234.92s)]

*  Exactly, exactly. [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=3239.48s)]
*  And we're now stripping that bear and stripping it away. [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=3242.36s)]
*  So where do they go? They won't come here. [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=3245.92s)]
*  When you have someone like this young woman, yeah, made a mistake, had frog [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=3248.6800000000003s)]
*  embryos, you just describe what would usually happen. [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=3254.28s)]
*  They would take the frog embryos, [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=3257.96s)]
*  which are being researched on behalf of the government anyway. [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=3259.96s)]
*  OK, so they just give them back to the government and they find all, you know, [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=3263.44s)]
*  right now, she's not like sneaking in drugs. [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=3268.8399999999997s)]

*  It's frog eggs, frog eggs. [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=3274.2s)]
*  And she's in a detention center because probably because they're trying to figure [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=3276.96s)]
*  out if the Russians want her back and they want to placate the Russians [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=3281.3199999999997s)]
*  and give her so that's what that's all about. [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=3286.04s)]
*  And that's our future [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=3288.8399999999997s)]
*  in terms of the impact at our universities, the impact at our research [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=3293.08s)]
*  centers like MIT and the Naval Research Lab, where I worked for many years [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=3298.08s)]
*  actually with frogs and it just [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=3306.96s)]
*  it's something about frogs. [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=3311.64s)]
*  Everything comes, you just had such a life journey. [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=3312.72s)]
*  You know, you're in the monastery studying frog embryos. [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=3315.56s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=3318.72s)]
*  It was all factory research. [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=3320.16s)]
*  So it was developing equipment that could [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=3322.8s)]
*  protect soldiers in the field from smells that they couldn't smell from from [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=3325.2799999999997s)]
*  dangerous poisons. [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=3330.7999999999997s)]
*  But yeah, dude, I mean, that's what we do. [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=3332.52s)]
*  That's what our government is supports. [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=3335.12s)]
*  That's why, you know, we we have STEM programs. [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=3338.9199999999996s)]
*  What are we doing [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=3343.12s)]
*  now? What we're doing now. [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=3345.8799999999997s)]
*  What do you think is going to happen at our at our university? [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=3347.8399999999997s)]
*  Homegrown towns. [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=3350.68s)]
*  What do we do with STEM programs when we're cutting off that kind of research? [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=3351.56s)]
*  When we were not facilitating or paying for or providing grants and support [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=3355.2799999999997s)]
*  for that research, if you've developed [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=3360.24s)]
*  the tools, whether it's equipment or medicine or whatever, to identify [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=3363.52s)]
*  precancerous cells. [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=3372.12s)]
*  And you're going to lock up the person [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=3375.3199999999997s)]
*  who's doing that research because they had frog eggs at the airport [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=3377.64s)]
*  for two months. [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=3383.96s)]
*  That's why I use the word stupid so much, because this is [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=3386.96s)]
*  fascism, stupid fascism, stupid fascism. [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=3390.6000000000004s)]
*  Like, you know, so a good Nazi, a good Nazi would take this woman and like, [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=3395.2400000000002s)]
*  put her to work, you know, put her to work, you know. [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=3400.6400000000003s)]
*  And so then you could go to the people and say, hey, I solved cancer while you're [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=3404.48s)]
*  sending people, your political enemies to El Salvador. [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=3409.28s)]
*  I don't want to send them good ideas. [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=3412.16s)]
*  But they say when you when when you see things, you know, [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=3414.08s)]
*  with a hammer, everything's a nail and you just want to crush it. [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=3419.96s)]
*  And that's what they want to do. [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=3424.52s)]
*  So, look, our universities are trying some, at least finding a way to stand their [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=3426.12s)]
*  ground. We need more universities aligned with Harvard, [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=3432.52s)]
*  whether you are in the crosshairs now or not, because you will be. [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=3436.3599999999997s)]
*  If you have any level of research at your institution, if you have any [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=3440.68s)]
*  students of foreign origin, they're all subject to this. [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=3445.36s)]
*  Now, even U.S. [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=3450.0s)]
*  students who go abroad. [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=3451.48s)]
*  And then try to come back because of their last name or the university [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=3454.08s)]
*  they're at, I know of stories of people being held up trying to come back into [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=3461.08s)]
*  the country who are U.S. citizens, that's a concern. [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=3465.28s)]
*  So this is not just a one way travel. [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=3468.3999999999996s)]
*  This is both ways. [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=3471.64s)]
*  You know, it's not just the foreign born student or individual who wants to come [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=3473.3599999999997s)]
*  here or is here, but U.S. citizens who are born here, who are engaged [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=3479.6s)]
*  in certain research, in certain types of, you know, [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=3484.64s)]
*  government actions that they don't like. [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=3489.8799999999997s)]
*  They're also subject to this. [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=3494.68s)]
*  So I just think all of these for me are warning signs. [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=3496.12s)]
*  And how we heed them, Tim, is going to be very, very important [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=3499.96s)]
*  because the America that Trump wants [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=3505.08s)]
*  in our two hundred and fifty first year is not the America, I think, that the [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=3509.2799999999997s)]
*  founders tried to create and sustained us for two hundred and fifty. [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=3515.48s)]
*  That would be that would be a beautiful place to end. [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=3520.4s)]
*  But I just have a little dessert for you. [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=3522.52s)]
*  Yes, I like dessert. [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=3524.6s)]
*  Are you familiar with Ulta Beauty, Ulta Beauty Supply Store? [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=3525.72s)]
*  Do you know about Ulta? [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=3528.96s)]
*  No, I'm not. Now that you're in prime time, Michael, [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=3529.96s)]
*  you're going to have to learn about some of this stuff. [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=3532.8399999999997s)]
*  You're going to have to learn about skin care. [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=3534.48s)]
*  All right. In prime time, you might consider the Ulta Beauty Supply. [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=3536.7599999999998s)]
*  So you can just go there, get some new face moisturizers. [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=3540.48s)]
*  We got to sponsor one skin. [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=3543.36s)]
*  I'm giving them free free free air time right now. [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=3545.04s)]
*  But that what you use something in a straight man. [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=3548.52s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know about this. [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=3551.4s)]
*  You know, I got to keep it so don't crack, baby. [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=3553.3199999999997s)]
*  Come on. Exactly. Exactly. [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=3555.3599999999997s)]
*  Well, you got some advantages on that front with the melanin that I don't have. [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=3557.2799999999997s)]
*  So I had to learn a little earlier. [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=3560.48s)]
*  But Nancy Mase, our friend, she was in an Ulta and she sent this tweet yesterday, [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=3562.08s)]
*  whether it's a locker room, a bathroom or the face wash aisle at Ulta. [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=3569.2s)]

*  And let me tell you, Nancy, that fucking face wash aisle at Ulta is my space as [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=3578.2799999999997s)]

*  I'm not. I'm not. [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=3603.76s)]
*  I won by so much. [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=3605.12s)]
*  You're a disgrace to this state. [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=3606.4s)]
*  That's what you are. You're a disgrace. [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=3607.6s)]
*  I asked you a simple question. [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=3609.4s)]
*  He was having none of it. [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=3611.6s)]
*  He was having none of it, but it exposed what [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=3614.28s)]
*  a pathetic, useless servant to the people of her district she is. [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=3617.6800000000003s)]
*  And again, this is why you unelect them, [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=3622.44s)]
*  because you're not going to hold this woman up as an example to your daughter. [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=3625.6800000000003s)]
*  Are you really? [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536cTGy6Kqc&t=3629.84s)]
