Video Description: At the White House, the press office got totally bored with the worshipful questions from MAGA media and invited The Bulwark's Andrew Egger over—so Karoline Leavitt could mix it up with a reporter who'd definitely ask tough questions. Plus, Trump's crypto grift reaches new heights and the toadies are getting whipsawed by the constant tariff adjustments. Andrew Egger joins Tim Miller.

*  Like again, like the it's farcical the like, like from the first administration stuff about [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=3.0s)]
*  how there's a wall between Trump and Don and Eric and like Trump doesn't even know what's [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=8.4s)]
*  happening over there. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=12.9s)]

*  going through that. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=19.7s)]
*  That rigmarole that it's just like Trump's going to meet with the people that are paying [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=21.94s)]
*  him for his worthless shift point. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=24.96s)]
*  There's no conflict of interest because you all know Donald and Donald just does whatever [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=27.68s)]
*  he wants. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=32.199999999999996s)]
*  And we are back. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=40.12s)]
*  He's the White House correspondent at the Bullwork. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=41.48s)]
*  He's the co-author of our Morning Shots newsletter, which is fantastic. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=43.76s)]
*  He has one other title I'll mention at the end. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=47.8s)]
*  It's Andrew Egger. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=49.44s)]
*  What's up, Egger? [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=50.32s)]
*  I'm so excited to get to the big reveal. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=52.04s)]
*  You're tipping your hand there. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=54.44s)]
*  The newsletter's been awesome, by the way. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=58.24s)]
*  I just want to say, I already get into your newsletter from yesterday, but if people aren't [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=60.84s)]

*  It's a nice supplement to the news newsletters, you know, because you give people the news [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=67.6s)]
*  they need to get, but also just a lot of flair. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=71.72s)]
*  And you got Bill Kristol, you know, quoting, quoting, who knows? [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=74.92s)]
*  I mean, it could be Epicurious one day, you know, could be Churchill, could be anybody. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=79.6s)]
*  This morning in our Slack, Bill was giving Sam Stein grief for wanting to put in a Christopher [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=86.12s)]
*  Nolan quote, wanted to put in a quote from The Dark Knight Rises. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=91.28s)]
*  Bill was like, why are you always wanting to do these quotes nobody's ever heard of, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=93.60000000000001s)]
*  man? [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=96.92s)]
*  And meanwhile, it's Samuel Johnson and all kinds of good stuff from Bill. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=97.92s)]
*  So yeah, I get the newsletter, everybody. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=101.48s)]
*  It's a great one. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=103.0s)]
*  I think I just myself just pronounced the Greek philosopher Epicurious, like Epicurious, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=105.44s)]
*  like the app that shows you kind of my level of deep, deep Greek Greek philosophy knowledge. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=114.04s)]
*  OK, you are inside the lions, then you went you were invited to be in the special special, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=118.68s)]
*  very special in a lot of cases on your case, a lot of times like short but special social [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=126.0s)]
*  media chair that it's had where most of the questions to date for our press secretary [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=130.92000000000002s)]
*  have been, you know, about how great of a mother she is, etc. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=137.92000000000002s)]
*  I guess they were looking to try to bring some balance and let's listen together to [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=141.67999999999998s)]
*  your exchange. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=147.72s)]
*  Thank you for having me, Caroline. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=148.72s)]
*  The president posted another ad this week for his Trump meme coin. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=150.07999999999998s)]
*  The group that's running that coin is encouraging people to buy in order to win a dinner this [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=154.0s)]
*  month with the president. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=157.83999999999997s)]
*  Why is the president planning to attend a dinner for the top investors in this point? [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=159.39999999999998s)]
*  Look, the president is abiding by all conflict of interest laws. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=162.56s)]
*  The president has been incredibly transparent with his own personal financial obligation [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=166.35999999999999s)]
*  throughout the years. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=170.44000000000003s)]
*  The president is a successful businessman, and I think, frankly, it's one of the many [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=171.44000000000003s)]
*  reasons that people reelected him back to this office. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=174.28s)]
*  There are at least some people who are buying this coin who seem to view it as an opportunity [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=176.96s)]
*  to influence the president's views. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=180.28s)]
*  There was a logistics company this week that said they would buy 20 million dollars in [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=181.72000000000003s)]
*  the coin in order to advocate for free trade between the U.S. and Mexico. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=185.36s)]
*  If buyers are buying for that reason, are they wasting their money? [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=189.36s)]
*  Look, I can assure you the president acts with only the interests of the American public [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=191.28000000000003s)]
*  in mind, putting our country first and doing what's best for our country. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=195.4s)]
*  Full stop. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=199.20000000000002s)]
*  Intention. And that's what he's focused on. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=200.23999999999998s)]
*  All right. I want to get into the substance of the crypto conversation in a second. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=202.35999999999999s)]
*  But like that was weird. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=205.39999999999998s)]
*  That was pretty weird. Like, what's it like in there? [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=206.67999999999998s)]
*  Did it feel culty? What was that was the vibe like? [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=208.76s)]
*  Yeah, to be honest, I had no idea what to expect when they reached out to me. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=211.95999999999998s)]
*  They were like just kind of called me out of the blue. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=216.2s)]
*  Hey, you know, come be in the new media seat at the White House. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=217.76s)]
*  I was like, are they is this going to be some kind of shaming ritual? [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=220.64s)]
*  Is this like they've been kind of mad that the bulwark's been getting some attention [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=223.6s)]
*  and they're going to they're going to bring me up here and shove me into a van? [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=226.88s)]
*  You know, these are the kind of the paranoid thoughts going through my brain. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=229.64s)]
*  They play it very well. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=232.67999999999998s)]
*  You they're going to bring out a toilet and like swirl you just kind of. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=233.64s)]
*  Exactly. Yeah. Like put video testimonials from like ex-girlfriends [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=237.95999999999998s)]
*  up on the screen in the briefing room. I don't know. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=241.44s)]
*  I don't know. They played they played it extremely straight. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=243.27999999999997s)]
*  They did. They did. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=245.32s)]
*  You know, they they they asked me for a bio. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=246.72s)]
*  They read it. They said nice things about our subscriber numbers, which, you know, [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=248.92s)]
*  thanks to all of you subscribers for giving us nice subscriber numbers to read. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=251.88s)]
*  And and they gave me the they gave me the first two questions at the briefing, [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=255.88s)]
*  which it's been a weird assortment of people. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=259.28000000000003s)]
*  I mean, it's it's one of these initiatives, obviously, [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=261.52s)]
*  that the things that have made headlines have been the just unbelievably [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=263.4s)]
*  mealy mouthed and and sort of worshipful questions [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=269.48s)]
*  that they've gotten from some of the more like influencer types [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=274.08s)]
*  that they've let into that seat. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=277.84000000000003s)]
*  But it's been a weird spread. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=279.44s)]
*  You know, it's been it's been guys like Tim Pool, but it's also been, [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=280.56s)]
*  you know, a number of just sort of newer media companies like Notice and Semaphore [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=284.04s)]
*  that they just asked kind of [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=288.59999999999997s)]
*  probing good questions about the White House. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=290.76s)]
*  And that's what I tried to do as well. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=292.76s)]
*  And and they, you know, they like I said, they played it perfectly straight. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=294.23999999999995s)]
*  They brought me back there. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=297.96s)]
*  They they brought me out there and let me ask my questions. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=298.96s)]
*  And and it was just kind of a sort of is our experience [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=301.32s)]
*  because it's not super clear what the White House gets out of it. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=305.08s)]
*  But I guess that it is basically just this. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=307.08s)]
*  It really is ultimately ultimately a kind of an FU to the White House [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=309.88s)]
*  Correspondence Association and to the Associated Press, which used to get [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=313.88s)]
*  the first questions at the briefings. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=317.04s)]
*  And so, you know, sometimes they're going to give the question [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=318.92s)]
*  that used to be the Associated Press is to to Tim Pool. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=320.68s)]
*  Sometimes I guess they're going to give it to me. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=323.8s)]
*  And ultimately, I guess what matters to them is that they aren't [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=325.24s)]
*  they aren't actually letting the journalists pick. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=328.6s)]
*  They're the ones who are who are making the decision. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=330.52000000000004s)]
*  Did you feel like do you feel any dark spirits walking in there? [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=333.44s)]
*  Was there a children of the corn vibe among the staffers? [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=337.36s)]
*  I mean, I just I don't know. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=340.40000000000003s)]
*  To me, I feel like it would feel very strange just to walk into the Trump [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=341.76s)]
*  White House at all. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=345.04s)]
*  I always find it very strange to be in lower press there, where the where [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=346.72s)]
*  the kind of junior level White House staffers work. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=349.84000000000003s)]
*  I found it weird during Biden. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=353.12s)]
*  I also found it kind of weird during Trump, because like technically [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=354.24s)]
*  you're allowed to be there as a as a credentialed White House reporter. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=356.96000000000004s)]
*  You can go in there and talk to them and ask them questions and stuff. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=359.8s)]
*  But it's just the vibe is very strange. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=361.84000000000003s)]
*  It's completely unlike, you know, Congress, where the staffers [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=363.76000000000005s)]
*  are all in their offices and and the principals walk around [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=366.76000000000005s)]
*  and you can talk to them. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=369.92s)]
*  It's like I've never quite quite gotten my feet underneath me there. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=370.84000000000003s)]
*  So I don't know. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=374.08000000000004s)]
*  It's very quiet in there. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=375.04s)]
*  It's kind of like this is maybe at least I've never been during the Trump times. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=376.44s)]
*  Maybe it's a little bit rowdy or during the Biden era was kind of like a churchy [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=380.44s)]
*  vibe in there. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=384.12s)]
*  Like I felt like I had to whisper at times. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=385.2s)]
*  Yeah, a little bit. I don't know. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=388.32s)]
*  They were they were chatting it up. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=389.32s)]
*  The Fox News is up on TV. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=390.56s)]
*  They were eating some some cupcakes and things that somebody had brought in. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=392.0s)]
*  I don't know. It's a it's a. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=395.8s)]
*  You know, I was more focused on the question whether or not I was about to get [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=398.48s)]
*  sandbagged, you know, did you encounter any mega creatures while you're in there? [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=401.52s)]
*  Junior com staff, junior people, you know, friendly, bright, shiny faces of the [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=405.16s)]
*  the new right wing future. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=409.88s)]
*  Were your palms and sweaty? [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=411.32s)]
*  Were your armpits sweaty when you left the briefing? [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=413.16s)]
*  I wasn't I wasn't taking like like a moisture level tests or anything, [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=417.24s)]
*  but I was I was a little freaked out, man. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=420.6s)]
*  I had no idea. Like like I said, like they called me. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=422.28000000000003s)]
*  I was like, why are they bringing the bulwark into here? [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=424.84000000000003s)]
*  Is there is there some like dark scheme? [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=426.8s)]
*  But it all went fine. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=428.72s)]
*  OK, the question itself, your folks in this crypto scam, which I think is very important. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=429.68s)]
*  The Qatari plane has, I think, potentially overtaken it, [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=434.52s)]
*  especially if it ends up becoming Air Force One or Trump's, you know, personal [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=438.03999999999996s)]
*  library plane as far as the most visible example [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=441.36s)]
*  of just the unbelievable graph to this administration. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=446.08s)]
*  But, you know, I mean, like the the crypto, [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=449.44s)]
*  the the coin bribe story is not going to go anywhere. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=452.76s)]
*  So I think the fact that you laid the groundwork on that was as important. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=456.24s)]
*  We have this new story out of the Times this morning on a redo. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=459.59999999999997s)]
*  A a struggling technology company that has ties to China [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=462.24s)]
*  and relies on Tick Tock made an unusual announcement this week [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=466.96000000000004s)]
*  that it secured funding to buy as much as 300 million of Trump. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=470.8s)]
*  The meme coin marketed by Trump, [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=475.36s)]
*  GD Culture Group is a publicly traded firm with a Chinese subsidiary. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=478.16s)]
*  It has only eight employees and it recorded zero revenue last year [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=482.72s)]
*  from an e-commerce business that operates on Tick Tock. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=487.2s)]
*  So that feels like that's on the up and up that they got 300 mil [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=490.12s)]
*  and just decided to put it straight into the coin. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=493.68s)]
*  A Chinese company with zero revenue. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=495.52s)]
*  Don't think there's much to see there. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=498.40000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, the through line with all of these stories [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=501.04s)]
*  is just how much of a black box it all is. Right. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=503.88s)]
*  I mean, we we know just openly that these are things that Donald Trump profits from. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=506.24s)]
*  He and his associates own 80 percent of the supply of this coin. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=511.4s)]
*  Whenever people put more money into it, it pushes up the price and they make money. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=515.64s)]
*  And beyond that, you know, there's there's all kinds of opacity based on [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=519.6s)]
*  based around, you know, we know this because there's been reporting on this. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=523.76s)]
*  But but but a lot of the reporting only serves to highlight how [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=527.2s)]
*  how completely untraceable and oblique a lot of this is. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=530.6s)]
*  The only reason that we know, for instance, that like the bulk of the [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=533.1600000000001s)]
*  the major purchases of this coin have come from overseas is because Bloomberg [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=536.32s)]
*  did an investigation to the trading platforms that those purchases were made on, [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=540.5200000000001s)]
*  many of which, you know, bar US users from from from trading on them. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=544.6s)]
*  And so based on that, they know that they're not here at least. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=548.56s)]
*  But that's kind of all the further that that we know. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=551.8399999999999s)]
*  You know, these these wallets are largely anonymous. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=553.88s)]
*  So so so yeah, I mean, I your point about the Qatari plane is a good one. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=556.4799999999999s)]
*  I feel like it's a little bit like [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=560.76s)]
*  a little bit like what we just saw happen with the China tariffs, [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=563.4s)]
*  where where the tariffs were at like 10,000 percent for a month. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=567.0799999999999s)]
*  And so now that they've come back down to only 30, we're all kind of like, [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=570.88s)]
*  oh, thank God, you know, now they're only 30. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=573.64s)]
*  But 30 percent tariffs are still kind of alarmingly large and like, yeah, [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=575.92s)]
*  that the Qatari plane does does sort of wash out [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=579.32s)]
*  some of these other financial scandals and some of this other open corruption [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=583.08s)]
*  because a 400 million dollar plane is just one of those kind of eye [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=587.68s)]
*  poppingly large numbers that like, of course, yeah, it's, you know, [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=590.92s)]
*  nothing really holds a candle to that. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=593.96s)]
*  But at the same time, I mean, the the Trumps do stand to make, [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=595.2s)]
*  you know, millions of dollars off of these various crypto grifts. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=598.88s)]
*  They get a cut of all these transactions that are happening. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=602.96s)]
*  And they own massive supplies of these coins themselves, [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=605.48s)]
*  these various coins themselves. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=608.36s)]
*  So it's all very open. It's all very naked. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=609.84s)]
*  And as you heard in that clip, I mean, Carolyn Levitt [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=611.5600000000001s)]
*  essentially doesn't even try to offer any kind of halfway [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=614.4s)]
*  plausible alternate explanation other than the one that we all know [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=619.44s)]
*  is the case, which is that he just wants to make a bunch of money. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=623.76s)]
*  And this is an easy way to do it. He thinks it's a deal. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=626.32s)]
*  He thinks it's a good deal for him. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=628.2s)]
*  And he thinks the conflict of interest stuff is is kind of pointless [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=629.6s)]
*  and for squares and for nerds to follow, follow those rules. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=632.28s)]
*  But but but not only does she I mean, she she says, [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=636.1999999999999s)]
*  obviously, we're abiding by all all conflict of interest rules [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=639.4399999999999s)]
*  and regulations and stuff. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=642.28s)]
*  And I resent the very notion that anybody would suggest any of this is unethical. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=643.28s)]
*  But there's no alternate explanation given for why he would possibly do it. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=647.1999999999999s)]
*  I mean, they're going forward with it. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=651.9599999999999s)]
*  And you're asking about this dinner. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=654.4399999999999s)]
*  Like they're there in this dinner that where the actual funders of the coin, [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=656.52s)]
*  people that are paying Trump, get to go to a dinner and his golf club [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=661.56s)]
*  and then get to come to the White House. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=665.84s)]
*  And so it's like. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=667.84s)]
*  You know, I mean, it's never stopped the Trump administration before [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=670.72s)]
*  from just just like bald place lying about something. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=674.76s)]
*  It's been like there's no. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=677.72s)]
*  But you can't like simultaneously say we have no there's no conflicts [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=678.72s)]
*  of interest here. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=682.52s)]
*  And also, you know, we're going to give a special White House dinner [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=683.68s)]
*  only to the people that put the most money in our pocket. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=687.0s)]
*  I mean, it's a comical bribe. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=689.1999999999999s)]
*  I'm not I'm not totally sure that the White House is involved, right? [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=691.72s)]
*  It's a little the wording is a little opaque on the website. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=694.4399999999999s)]
*  Basically, you get to visit the White House, though. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=697.0799999999999s)]
*  Right. Is that is that in there? [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=699.36s)]
*  My my my my reading of it, maybe maybe we should maybe I should bone up on this. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=701.12s)]
*  I had thought that what was what was on offer was like there's this dinner [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=705.12s)]
*  and there's this reception at at the at the club at the at Trump's golf [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=708.12s)]
*  golf course in D.C. and that Trump would be present for that. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=713.12s)]
*  And then there's this kind of oblique reference to a VIP tour [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=715.72s)]
*  for like the creme de la creme for like the top of the top of the top. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=719.9599999999999s)]
*  But it's not super clear from the wording on the website what the tour is of. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=723.88s)]
*  I don't know whether it's been externally reported that that's the White House [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=728.12s)]
*  or what, but but that's I mean, either way, it's like the point is not like, [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=730.64s)]
*  oh, they get to see the Lincoln bedroom. Right. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=734.4799999999999s)]
*  The point is they get access to Donald Trump. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=736.28s)]
*  The point is that they get they get personal proximity to this guy [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=738.7199999999999s)]
*  who has this big sign around his neck that says, buy me. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=742.4799999999999s)]
*  And they get to pitch him on stuff, presumably. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=745.88s)]
*  I mean, we we we don't know exactly what that dinner is going to look like. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=748.0s)]
*  It could be that he's kind of scamming all of these people [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=751.08s)]
*  and there's not going to be that much access on offer. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=753.4s)]
*  But we do know that that at least some people are are [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=755.76s)]
*  are thinking of it in those terms, are buying the coin with the express [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=759.2s)]
*  hope that they'll be able to influence the president. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=762.0s)]
*  And with good reason, because they're putting money in his pocket. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=764.36s)]
*  Yeah, maybe you're right. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=766.96s)]
*  Maybe I just assumed that the VIP tour was of the White House. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=768.4s)]
*  You know, you know what they say about assuming. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=771.8s)]
*  Regardless, though, to your point, like they pay, [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=774.24s)]
*  and they get access to the president United States. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=777.3199999999999s)]
*  Right. Like again, like the it's farcical. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=779.28s)]
*  The the like like from the first administration stuff about how there's a wall [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=781.4s)]
*  between Trump and Don and Eric and like Trump doesn't even know [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=786.0s)]
*  what's happening over there. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=789.04s)]
*  And it's just the sons that are like it was farcical then. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=790.1999999999999s)]
*  But like they're not really even going through that that rigmarole now. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=794.48s)]
*  It's just like Trump's going to meet with the people that are paying him [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=799.0799999999999s)]
*  for his worthless shift coin. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=801.4399999999999s)]
*  And there's no conflict of interest because you all know [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=803.0799999999999s)]
*  Donald and Donald just does whatever he wants. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=806.64s)]
*  So there there is that's that's the story. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=809.28s)]
*  And like that's the best thing they have essentially. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=813.0s)]
*  Yeah. You're I think the point that you make is is a good and important one, [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=815.72s)]
*  which is that even in the first term, when things were wildly less insane [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=820.0s)]
*  than than they are today, ethics experts still were having conniptions [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=825.36s)]
*  constantly about all of the ways in which Donald Trump was obviously self-dealing [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=829.96s)]
*  because he had not divested from his properties. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=833.76s)]
*  The quote unquote blind trust was just that he had kind of pinky [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=835.52s)]
*  promised not to talk to to Don Jr. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=840.3199999999999s)]
*  and Eric about the internal workings of the Trump organization. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=842.92s)]
*  But meanwhile, things were constantly happening where he didn't need to be [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=846.92s)]
*  in the board meetings to kind of understand how how he could trade on that. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=850.48s)]
*  Foreign leaders were constantly going to his properties and dropping a bunch of money. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=854.76s)]
*  And and, you know, he was he was putting up the Secret Service at his clubs [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=858.68s)]
*  and having the government pay him to do that. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=862.36s)]
*  All sorts of things like that. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=864.6s)]
*  And that was just the first term. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=866.4s)]
*  And now, you know, all that stuff is still happening. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=867.6800000000001s)]
*  You still got the the Trump Organization kind of fake blind trust [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=870.64s)]
*  set up along the same lines as the first term. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=874.2s)]
*  But now he is openly trading on on not just not not just making money [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=876.52s)]
*  in his preexisting ventures and skimming off the top in that way, [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=881.0s)]
*  but but launching all of these new ventures that trade on his brand [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=884.32s)]
*  as the president of the United States, all of these different crypto schemes, [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=887.8000000000001s)]
*  all of these different NFTs and the sneakers and the watches and all of these things [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=891.0799999999999s)]
*  that, again, just put money directly in his pocket, [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=894.88s)]
*  many of which are just sort of skeevy and lame. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=897.5999999999999s)]
*  But these crypto ones, [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=900.24s)]
*  which are particularly kind of alarming and untraceable and corrupt. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=902.4s)]
*  Yeah. Well, I'm happy to get you in there. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=906.36s)]
*  They are monitoring us. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=908.7199999999999s)]
*  Stephen Miller is shitposting me, you know, and and they want to spar [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=909.5999999999999s)]
*  with you over crypto. So we'll we'll well, I guess that's better than being ignored. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=914.76s)]
*  Barely on the margins, the most slightest. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=919.92s)]
*  I do think they're a little bored of the of the glazers. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=923.12s)]
*  I think I think like Tim Pool and and the Gateway Pundit and those people [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=926.28s)]
*  like that's not a good look even for the White House. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=930.36s)]
*  Carolyn, let me just say, Connell podcast guys were brought in there [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=932.4399999999999s)]
*  and they were like, you're so great. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=935.8399999999999s)]
*  And I was like, have some fucking dignity, you know, at least like ask her [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=937.4399999999999s)]
*  about some old school Republican question like tariffs or something, you know. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=941.1999999999999s)]
*  And she is like kind of constrained by the nature of the thing [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=945.24s)]
*  to like dignify their question and be like, wow, I'm so glad you asked me that. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=948.1999999999999s)]
*  The mainstream media would never kind of pat him on the back. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=951.3199999999999s)]
*  And you know that internally, she's like, these fucking guys are like no use to us. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=953.6s)]
*  It's not helpful. It's not like they want to mix it up with the reporters. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=957.52s)]
*  They want to clown on us as the fake news and and beat us up and let [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=960.52s)]
*  let the clips go viral. So like, you know, she can keep bringing the podcasters [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=963.8s)]
*  in as much as she wants to. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=968.1999999999999s)]
*  And I guess they will keep doing that a little bit. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=969.4399999999999s)]
*  But they could also have me back any time they want to. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=971.76s)]
*  I'm you know, our doors open. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=973.8399999999999s)]
*  You're uncountable, Andrew. OK. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=975.16s)]
*  You had the newsletter from yesterday. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=977.8399999999999s)]
*  I want to talk about had a great headline. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=979.6s)]
*  MAGA was has always been at peace with East Asia. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=981.64s)]
*  And it was about like this kind of a sub element of the trade war. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=984.52s)]
*  I got we talked with Justin at the economic part of it yesterday, [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=988.8399999999999s)]
*  which is the most important element, of course, that affects people like the [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=992.48s)]
*  political side of this, like the Republican criminology side of this is interesting [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=995.92s)]
*  because like when the tariffs were at 10,000 percent, [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1000.52s)]
*  you know, two minutes ago, there was a cadre of, [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1005.84s)]
*  let's say, China hawks, as well as like social media influencers [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1010.72s)]
*  who just want to like be mega alpha dogs to overcompensate for their dick size. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1017.08s)]
*  And it's like those two groups together, like we're really pushing about how [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1022.16s)]
*  this trade war showed like Trump was finally the man [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1027.56s)]
*  that would stand up to China, unlike these other weak establishment politicians. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1031.32s)]
*  And then he backs off from 10,000 percent down to 30 percent. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1035.76s)]
*  And like now the message is not that we're not actually at war with China. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1040.3999999999999s)]
*  We're just trying to get a good deal for us. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1046.1599999999999s)]
*  And how they process that has been kind of interesting. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1048.52s)]
*  So what would how do you kind of divine what is what is happening there? [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1052.84s)]
*  Do any of these people actually have any serious policy beliefs? [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1056.48s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, obviously, China hawks exist, right? [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1060.6399999999999s)]
*  I mean, there are there are people out there who have for a long time been [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1063.6s)]
*  been clanging a bell about various unfair trade practices from the People's [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1065.96s)]
*  Republic of China, various national security concerns [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1069.3999999999999s)]
*  that may be implicated with letting them to do a whole lot of our critical [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1072.84s)]
*  manufacturing, things like that. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1076.24s)]
*  Those are not like fake concerns. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1077.6399999999999s)]
*  But the thing the thing that we have seen over the last month [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1080.08s)]
*  is a lot of people kind of putting on those concerns sort of as a skin suit [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1082.6s)]
*  to just just as kind of momentary MAGA messaging at the moment [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1086.9199999999998s)]
*  when Trump very improvisationally in early April [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1090.28s)]
*  decided to narrow his his tariff focus from the whole world to China. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1094.3999999999999s)]
*  Right. Like April 9, April 10. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1098.76s)]
*  He pulls down all of the the quote unquote retaliatory tariffs [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1100.72s)]
*  on most of the world that he had slapped into place a week before. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1104.76s)]
*  And he says, now we're just doing China. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1107.68s)]
*  Now we're going after China. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1109.36s)]
*  135 percent tariffs on China. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1110.24s)]
*  And and again, from a certain kind of subset of the of the MAGA world, [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1112.56s)]
*  the the the response to this is finally at long last. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1117.72s)]
*  We are getting serious about this gaping wound that we've been bleeding out from, [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1122.3999999999999s)]
*  which is that which is our previous trade relationship with China. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1127.28s)]
*  This this this thing where they sell us cheap goods and and and and we, [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1130.76s)]
*  you know, economically prosper in the short term. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1135.36s)]
*  But in the long term, we're we're we're destroying our domestic manufacturing base [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1137.76s)]
*  and we're selling our future overseas and all these sorts of things. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1142.28s)]
*  And finally, finally, someone's willing to do something about that. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1145.4399999999998s)]
*  Kevin O'Leary, Mr. Wonderful from Shark Tank. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1148.48s)]
*  He he had a clip on CNN that went very viral. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1150.9199999999998s)]
*  He was like, I love how you just deadpan that. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1153.84s)]
*  Like, this is the world we're in. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1156.28s)]
*  Just like, you know, Kevin O'Leary, Mr. Wonderful from Shark Tank, [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1157.8799999999999s)]
*  like a key influencer now in our society, you know, like the you're a MAGA reality [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1160.84s)]
*  show star, you really do have quite outsized influence now versus, I don't know, 2014. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1165.76s)]
*  Right, right. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1173.6s)]
*  And people very easily kind of go into and come out of that [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1174.16s)]
*  that kind of pantheon of voices that are worth listening to, [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1178.0s)]
*  because it's just it's anyone who's gassing up Trump at the moment [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1180.48s)]
*  can go momentarily viral over there. Right. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1183.2s)]
*  So like he has this thing where he's like, finally, Trump's doing it. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1185.44s)]
*  I want 400 percent tariffs on China to punish them for all their trade, [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1187.76s)]
*  cheating and stealing. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1190.96s)]
*  And, you know, Donald Trump Jr. is is pushing that and lives of Tiktok is pushing that. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1192.0400000000002s)]
*  And and, you know, you basically have all these people. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1197.16s)]
*  And then as as the economic conditions start to deteriorate [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1199.72s)]
*  and the conversation starts to become a little bit more about the pain, [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1204.48s)]
*  about the cost of all of this, this decoupling from China, [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1207.6000000000001s)]
*  then it's the messaging sort of shifts even in the White House from that kind of thing to [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1210.8400000000001s)]
*  this. Look, this is the play. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1217.0s)]
*  We have to do this and we all have to be willing to kind of suffer [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1218.3200000000002s)]
*  a little bit of pain for the glorious future to solve these problems, to stand up to China. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1220.48s)]
*  And all that lasted for about a month. Right. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1224.96s)]
*  And then this week, the White House just pulled the plug. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1226.76s)]
*  And you might think that all of these people who were so overjoyed [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1229.4399999999998s)]
*  to see the White House finally stand up on all of these things after after, [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1234.6s)]
*  you know, supposedly, according to all these people, the previous status quo [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1239.84s)]
*  was completely untenable and unsustainable and indefensible. Right. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1242.8s)]
*  But now Trump's trying to go back to the status quo. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1246.1999999999998s)]
*  You're not exactly seeing like this outpouring of of rage [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1248.4799999999998s)]
*  and this sense of betrayal from all these people who thought this action a month ago [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1252.04s)]
*  was so necessary. I mean, it's just tariffs go on. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1255.1999999999998s)]
*  We're bringing domestic manufacturing back. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1258.16s)]
*  Tariffs come off. Art of the deal. Tariffs go on. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1259.8400000000001s)]
*  We're doing it. We're bringing it back. Tariffs come off. Art of the deal. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1261.96s)]
*  And I guess we're just going to repeat this ad infinitum for the rest of the administration. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1264.72s)]
*  Yeah, I don't think that it is. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1268.72s)]
*  It does a lot of good to psychoanalyze the Maganob slobbers. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1270.8400000000001s)]
*  I think they're just going to be happy with whatever happens. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1274.24s)]
*  So obviously, the Benny Johnsons of the world will, [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1276.44s)]
*  you know, continue to do their their cruise thing. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1280.68s)]
*  But the what about the Hawks? [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1283.7600000000002s)]
*  What about the actual Hawks? [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1286.84s)]
*  Which supposedly was the former national security advisor who got promoted to the UN. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1288.68s)]
*  Mike Waltz, what about the Tom Cotton's of the world? [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1292.96s)]
*  I've even seen much from those guys. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1295.68s)]
*  I mean, like it is ostensibly there's some genuine China hawks out there. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1297.9199999999998s)]
*  But you're not seeing a lot of that in the public conversation, really. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1304.2s)]
*  I'm not seeing Tom on, you know, Hannity, like really pushing for this or anything. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1309.12s)]
*  Well, I think it's a combination of two things. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1313.9199999999998s)]
*  One is sort of just strategic silence. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1315.68s)]
*  Right. I mean, nobody wants to come out and be the fly in the ointment [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1317.44s)]
*  while the Trump administration is trying to trumpet this deal. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1319.8s)]
*  And the Trump administration kind of has these people in a little bit of a bind [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1322.44s)]
*  because, you know, the the previous [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1325.3200000000002s)]
*  situation where we were both kind of doing this ad hoc trade embargo with China [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1329.1200000000001s)]
*  while also antagonizing the rest of the world [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1333.52s)]
*  on trade was completely antithetical to what these hawks want, [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1337.0800000000002s)]
*  which is to to sort of isolate China on the world stage, right, [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1340.1200000000001s)]
*  to kind of create this grand coalition of freedom loving peoples [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1343.28s)]
*  who will all trade with one another. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1347.56s)]
*  And none of us will will do the kind of business with China that we've done before. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1349.08s)]
*  And there was there was an interesting quote in semaphore, [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1353.12s)]
*  because you bring up Tom Cotton, I don't know if this was Tom Cotton, [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1356.16s)]
*  but it was plainly a person from the from that kind of Tom Cotton China hawk [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1358.48s)]
*  wing just this morning where he was basically just complaining anonymously [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1363.3999999999999s)]
*  to semaphore about the about the way this had all been been done in such a clownish [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1367.8799999999999s)]
*  manner so as to to not successfully isolate China and not successfully [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1371.96s)]
*  be able to put any pressure on them to decouple from from the whole world [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1376.52s)]
*  because of the reasons that I just mentioned. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1380.3600000000001s)]
*  And so I think that I think that it's difficult for them because, again, [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1381.8400000000001s)]
*  they don't they don't really want to cut the administration loose [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1385.68s)]
*  or bring down the wrath of God on themselves. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1388.8s)]
*  But but but at no point were the real China hawks [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1391.88s)]
*  really pleased with with either the former [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1396.16s)]
*  tariffs or this this kind of back off of them now. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1399.68s)]
*  Bold anonymous senator in semaphore. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1404.28s)]
*  I they're welcome. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1405.96s)]
*  I we keep asking Republican senators going to the pod. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1407.16s)]
*  None of them want to. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1409.84s)]
*  But I'm thinking like, I wonder if I could do a cop style [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1411.0s)]
*  where we like kind of anonymize their voice, you know. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1414.52s)]
*  And I put them they sit in the shadow and we get to talk about [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1418.28s)]
*  Donald Trump's trade war and they can feel that they can be candid [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1422.56s)]
*  about their their thoughts. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1425.56s)]
*  Yeah, you wouldn't necessarily have to even put them in the shadow. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1427.6s)]
*  A lot of them look very similar to one another. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1430.48s)]
*  You know what I mean? Yeah. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1433.8799999999999s)]
*  It's kind of like that kind of thin old white guy kind of thing. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1435.04s)]
*  A similar haircut. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1438.84s)]
*  I guess I guess maybe more in the House of Representatives than [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1440.1999999999998s)]
*  I'm trying to find this. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1444.52s)]
*  I'm literally scrolling this semaphore piece and trying to. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1445.4399999999998s)]
*  OK, can I just read this to you? [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1448.1599999999999s)]
*  This is from semaphore in private. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1449.84s)]
*  Some Republicans are still smarting over what they see as Trump's [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1451.3999999999999s)]
*  self-inflicted economic wound. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1454.0s)]
*  So here's the quote. It's been disastrous. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1455.4399999999998s)]
*  The objective, I thought, and most of my constituents think, [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1457.48s)]
*  is to keep the rest of the world, but China in particular, from ripping us off. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1460.04s)]
*  So where do we end up? [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1463.6s)]
*  We end up with slightly higher tariffs on China, [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1464.44s)]
*  but we've alienated the rest of the world, one Republican senator told Semaphore. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1466.48s)]
*  If they can't choreograph a better ending to this, you have to ask, [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1470.16s)]
*  has this all been worth it? [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1472.8s)]
*  What are we accomplishing? This GOP senator added. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1473.76s)]
*  So that's kind of the view from from that wing of the party that you're talking. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1475.96s)]
*  I can feel that. That was all I feel. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1479.76s)]
*  This is what what are we accomplishing? Nothing. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1481.4s)]
*  What were the what were the what were his rhetorical questions? [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1484.24s)]
*  I can feel them for him. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1486.64s)]
*  Where do we end up? [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1487.92s)]
*  What are we accomplishing? Has this all been worth it? [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1489.8400000000001s)]
*  No. Yeah. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1492.0400000000002s)]
*  We're accomplishing nothing. Has this all been worth it? No. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1492.88s)]
*  And I don't also just a doubt that I don't think that your constituents [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1495.3600000000001s)]
*  do actually care about the world, rest of the world, isolating China. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1498.2s)]
*  But it's nice that there's still like a couple of Manhattan Institute [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1501.72s)]
*  senators still in there thinking that the world is going to come back around to them. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1505.8000000000002s)]
*  Feel free to just free yourself, unshackle yourself, [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1510.2s)]
*  Republican senator, you know, life is short. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1513.2s)]
*  Come come share your thoughts with me. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1515.48s)]
*  Final topic. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1517.8s)]
*  In addition to being White House correspondent and author of Morning [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1519.72s)]
*  Shots newsletter, you're also our porn correspondent. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1521.8s)]
*  So we had to bring you on today because Mike Lee, senator from Utah, [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1524.0s)]
*  who I don't think was that blind senator, is now the bill that would [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1527.48s)]
*  basically criminalize interstate porn exchange, [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1531.92s)]
*  which which would essentially ban Pornhub. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1536.72s)]
*  And I think create a lot of legal questions for people [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1539.76s)]
*  sending naked selfies to a friend or lover that is in a different state. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1542.9199999999998s)]
*  And, you know, you as a Hillsdale grad have expressed in the past [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1548.8799999999999s)]
*  some sympathy to this. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1554.72s)]
*  So I'd like to see what you think about the Mike Lee bill [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1556.04s)]
*  before we discuss the politics of it. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1559.56s)]
*  Yeah, you're you're bringing this up to me blind because I had not actually seen this bill. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1562.08s)]
*  I do wonder you say you say like, you know, images you're sending to [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1565.56s)]
*  like your your significant other within the or in a different state. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1569.48s)]
*  But I is it even is it even clear just from your description of that? [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1573.6799999999998s)]
*  Maybe you'd even run into trouble in the same state, you know, [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1577.28s)]
*  if the data itself is somehow bouncing to a data center out of state [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1579.56s)]
*  or something like that, not a tech policy, tech law reporters. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1582.6799999999998s)]
*  So I don't know how any of that would work. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1586.3999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know. I should say the prosecution of this obscene [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1588.4399999999998s)]
*  content disseminated across state lines or from foreign countries. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1591.8s)]
*  Anyway, well, we'll continue. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1596.6799999999998s)]
*  Let me let me say one thing on that, which is that I I do [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1598.8s)]
*  I am pretty much of the opinion that that the whole notion that like porn [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1601.76s)]
*  is too ubiquitous and and sort of universally accessible [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1607.24s)]
*  to to do anything about from like a regulatory standpoint. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1611.8400000000001s)]
*  I find that kind of defeatist and lame and not very persuasive. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1616.3600000000001s)]
*  Like smoking used to be totally ubiquitous, [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1620.32s)]
*  and we've found ways to curb that socially. [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1623.16s)]
*  And I think it's pretty bad for people on the whole [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1626.36s)]
*  to just take a modest stance on it. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1629.56s)]
*  A lot of people who are in is pretty bad. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1632.64s)]
*  The consumers are not great, not great for America to have everybody [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1634.4s)]
*  constantly looking at Internet pornography. [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1637.76s)]
*  That's my that's my modest opinion. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1640.28s)]
*  But I couldn't I couldn't. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1642.92s)]
*  I'm born on this particular bill. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1643.84s)]
*  A lot of porn on X. They could start with the house. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1646.0s)]
*  They could start by kind of doing some regulation inside the inside the house. [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1648.72s)]
*  The whole Internet is just is just breaking down, you know, [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1652.92s)]
*  like the barriers between things just just don't really exist. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1656.04s)]
*  And bots are taking over everything. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1659.8s)]
*  And not just pornography, we should we should. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1661.64s)]
*  We're going to have to do something about this worldwide web. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1664.56s)]
*  I feel like Tim. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1666.6000000000001s)]
*  What would you like to do? We make all our money. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1668.52s)]
*  What would you like to do about the worldwide web? [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1670.0s)]
*  I don't know. I don't know. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1672.72s)]
*  It seems bad for people, but it is where we make all of our money. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1674.0800000000002s)]
*  So it's you know, it's you know, the phones are the phones are big. [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1676.48s)]
*  The phones are a big problem. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1679.76s)]
*  So it seems like you're kind of you're sort of backing off your porn band stance. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1681.08s)]
*  You're you're now just hoping for like some social stigma around porn. [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1684.68s)]
*  Maybe I mean, I guess I'm trying to think the smoking bans. [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1689.36s)]
*  How did it work? We banned it in restaurants. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1692.24s)]
*  That really helped, you know, so people weren't getting into restaurants. [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1693.68s)]
*  But it's not really an equivalent of that. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1697.04s)]
*  And I guess it's like you couldn't, you know, it's not like a very common situation. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1699.1599999999999s)]
*  And some gay bars, I guess you're seeing porn inside the bar. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1703.52s)]
*  But those people that are going in there pretty much, you know, [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1706.52s)]
*  getting what they're signing up for, I think, you know, [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1708.92s)]
*  it's not like Chili's has porn that you could be banning, you know. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1711.1200000000001s)]
*  Right. Right. Right. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1714.2s)]
*  No, I think I think the best analog to like the banning, [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1715.1200000000001s)]
*  smoking and restaurants things for this is is the thing we've seen kind of [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1718.1200000000001s)]
*  at the state level, which is these sort of ID verification laws that that are aimed at, [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1721.16s)]
*  you know, making it harder for kids to access online porn, [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1727.44s)]
*  which I think is a worthy goal in the first place and also has the useful knock on [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1730.6000000000001s)]
*  effect of just making it sort of more irritating and kind of tricky for other people to access as well. [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1736.04s)]
*  Like Virginia passed a porn ban or a porn verification law for, you know, to keep minors off of it. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1742.44s)]
*  And, you know, a few other states have done it as well. [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1749.8s)]
*  And like Pornhub, for instance, no longer is accessible in those states. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1753.84s)]
*  You know, obviously all this stuff, it's the Internet. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1758.76s)]
*  People can find ways around all of this stuff. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1761.84s)]
*  But the idea is, you know, you make it a little bit more stigmatized. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1763.9199999999998s)]
*  Before your time, not some barriers. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1766.3999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, not me, because, you know, I'm not that into porn. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1768.48s)]
*  I have a lot of other devices, but I was a closet homosexual. [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1771.24s)]
*  But some of my friends, you know, you go to the you go to the gas station [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1773.8799999999999s)]
*  and like get somebody else to buy it for you. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1779.0s)]
*  You know, there are always ways to get around around these prohibitions. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1780.72s)]
*  But creating a little bit of barrier to entry is what you're saying. [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1784.28s)]
*  A little bit of barrier, a little bit of friction. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1787.76s)]
*  Exactly. And those those laws have had some success, I think, already. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1789.84s)]
*  And not just from the MAGA side. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1793.12s)]
*  I mean, there's been kind of a crosspartisan coalition for some of those things. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1795.04s)]
*  OK, you could probably win me over on the merits of this. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1797.8799999999999s)]
*  Always happy to meet in the middle, creating some friction. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1800.32s)]
*  I will say as a political matter, [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1803.1599999999999s)]
*  I don't know it should be in the Democratic Party platform, [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1805.9199999999998s)]
*  but I do think it would benefit a couple of Dems to just kind of, [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1808.9199999999998s)]
*  you know, take a take a more liberal liberalitarian view on this. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1813.6399999999999s)]
*  Liberalitarians had a moment back in the mid 2010s that sort of faded away. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1817.6s)]
*  Just, you know, to kind of get it and inject it into the Manosphere. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1822.0400000000002s)]
*  I don't know that there's a lot of awareness that the Pornhub bands [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1825.5600000000002s)]
*  or the Republicans fault, the Manosphere having this [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1829.52s)]
*  Mike Lee ban on porn seems to be something that a lot of these morons [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1832.52s)]
*  would probably not like. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1837.68s)]
*  I got a past podcast. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1839.52s)]
*  I mentioned this gentleman, Andrew Schultz, a comedian. [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1840.72s)]
*  He had Pete Buttigieg on recently. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1844.16s)]
*  And during a recent podcast, he said [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1846.0800000000002s)]
*  he was explaining his evolution from being a Democrat, [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1849.12s)]
*  from being a Democrat to now supporting Trump. [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1853.08s)]
*  And he goes, I don't think I've changed. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1855.32s)]
*  I just like the dudes that get pussy and say whatever they want. [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1857.3999999999999s)]
*  Referencing the fact that Bill Clinton got a blowjob in the White House [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1862.52s)]
*  and now Donald Trump also used to get a lot of, you know, [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1865.56s)]
*  a lot of sex avoiding sexually transmitted diseases. [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1870.12s)]
*  Apparently, it was his Vietnam. [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1872.6799999999998s)]
*  And so, you know, that was like the main issue for him. [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1873.9599999999998s)]
*  I think it is a sign that you're pretty fucking stupid [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1876.8s)]
*  if you're determining who wants to be the president of the United States [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1879.6799999999998s)]
*  between, you know, based on who seems to be the biggest pussy hound. [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1881.9199999999998s)]
*  But it might be nice for Democrats to like, just let Andrew Schultz know [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1884.9199999999998s)]
*  that the people that don't want them to say and view whatever they want [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1889.76s)]
*  and, you know, want to make it harder to access naked women online [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1894.04s)]
*  are actually, you know, the Republicans and Mike Lee on the shortlist [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1898.6s)]
*  for attorney general if Pam Bondi ever gets on the wrong side of Trump. [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1902.08s)]
*  So, I don't know, maybe some political opportunity there. [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1905.48s)]
*  No, I just don't like that. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1908.0s)]
*  I just love this future. [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1910.16s)]
*  I just love this future that we're lurching into where, you know, [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1911.64s)]
*  the the median American voter, this kind of swing guy [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1914.52s)]
*  that both sides need to court is this exact guy, this sort of barstool [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1918.08s)]
*  Republican guy, just the dumbest, kind of grossest, most empty headed, [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1922.0s)]
*  smooth brain, like like thinking with his dick guy in all of America. [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1926.76s)]
*  And both parties need to court him from now on. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1932.08s)]
*  And wherever he goes, they win. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1934.16s)]
*  And that's just the future of America. [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1935.88s)]
*  That's what I say. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1937.52s)]
*  USA. All right. [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1938.96s)]
*  Thank you, Andrew. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1941.2s)]
*  Agra eggs. He's been great. [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1942.24s)]
*  Sign up for his newsletter and we'll be back here tomorrow [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1943.48s)]
*  for another edition of the Bulldog podcast. [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1946.64s)]
*  We'll see you all then. Peace. [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxuinFrOLqg&t=1948.16s)]
