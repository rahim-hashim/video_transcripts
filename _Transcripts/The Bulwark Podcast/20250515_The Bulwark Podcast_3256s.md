Video Description: American taxpayers may have flown Donald Trump to the Middle East, but he's not there to negotiate on behalf of our strategic or national interests—he's on the prowl for goodies from the people who get what makes him tick. Like, the new Syrian president offering a Trump Tower in Damascus: Zap, sanctions on Syria are over. Or the jumbo jet-giving, Hamas-sponsoring Qataris requesting that Trump go 'easy' on Iran: 'Not a problem, no siree.' Sorry to all the hawkish Trump voters out there who thought he'd deliver a maximum pressure campaign on Tehran. Plus, Russia's potemkin peace talks with Ukraine, and another installment from ICE's cold-blooded deportation campaign. Michael Weiss joins Tim Miller.

*  haven't had a chance to get to this David from plug this I didn't realize this that that plane's [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sdZt7T5EEc&t=663.28s)]
*  actually been for sale since 2020 and nobody would buy it so it was also a nice easy bribe [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sdZt7T5EEc&t=667.28s)]
*  and the other thing I didn't realize is that the royal family also offloaded a jet to Turkey to [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sdZt7T5EEc&t=672.72s)]
*  Erdogan in 2018 and that jet was even fancier so we're having sloppy seconds when it comes to the [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sdZt7T5EEc&t=677.76s)]
*  bribes um the like the Winnie the Pooh and the tuxedo MAGA guys have looked at this Trump trip [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sdZt7T5EEc&t=683.4399999999999s)]
*  and they've tried to like fashion onto it a much more sophisticated explanation for what's happening [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sdZt7T5EEc&t=690.0s)]
*  than what you just laid out that he's it's that he's easy to bribe and that is that you know the [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sdZt7T5EEc&t=696.24s)]
*  neo-con neoliberal like world order is over where we care about values and we try to impute these [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sdZt7T5EEc&t=701.84s)]
*  values onto these you know kind of sand dictators that will never do that and instead what we have [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sdZt7T5EEc&t=708.8s)]
*  is a new order that is based just totally on our interests where we just horse trade with these guys [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sdZt7T5EEc&t=715.28s)]
*  and and we do good because we're America and we understand capitalism we do good deals and that's [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sdZt7T5EEc&t=723.28s)]
*  actually a much more sophisticated thing to do than the naive um previous regime where they cared [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sdZt7T5EEc&t=728.24s)]
*  about these things like democracy and women's rights and the lives of journalists and etc what [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sdZt7T5EEc&t=735.12s)]
*  what do you make of that that this is that there is a sophisticated foreign policy turn here rather [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sdZt7T5EEc&t=740.24s)]
*  than just Donald Trump liking to get free gaudy stuff well first of all there's no stability or [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sdZt7T5EEc&t=747.6800000000001s)]
*  reliability to anything this guy does um so tomorrow he can decide well actually I made a mistake [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sdZt7T5EEc&t=754.0s)]
*  I'm going to reimpose sanctions on Syria right um let's let's talk about the the neo-con world order [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sdZt7T5EEc&t=760.0s)]
*  who's the biggest loser of this trip to the gulf Benjamin Netanyahu right Donald Trump's bestie [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sdZt7T5EEc&t=766.16s)]
*  Israeli prime minister a man who made no mystery of the fact that he was I mean actively campaigning [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sdZt7T5EEc&t=772.64s)]
*  for Trump's reelection and then waiting for Trump's inauguration to do all kinds of deals um finish the [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sdZt7T5EEc&t=777.52s)]
*  war in Gaza per Netanyahu which is I mean I thought as soon as the war started I thought the Israelis [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sdZt7T5EEc&t=783.28s)]
*  are never going to leave there's not going to be a withdrawal they're not going to slot in the [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sdZt7T5EEc&t=790.72s)]
*  Palestinian authority there this is going to be full-on permanent occupation and it certainly [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sdZt7T5EEc&t=794.08s)]
*  looks like that's the way it's tending but also let's get the Americans to now take out Iran's [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sdZt7T5EEc&t=798.72s)]
*  nuclear program by force which is what's something the Israelis have been begging [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sdZt7T5EEc&t=805.0400000000001s)]
*  every administration since George W. Bush to do right now it looks like both those things are not [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sdZt7T5EEc&t=809.5200000000001s)]
*  well the the permanent occupation of Gaza I think Trump just said again today let's make it a free [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sdZt7T5EEc&t=815.36s)]
*  zone an American run free zone you know beachfront property for all etc etc we'll [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sdZt7T5EEc&t=819.68s)]
*  we'll see where that goes but it certainly looks to me and to middle east watchers like [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sdZt7T5EEc&t=825.52s)]
*  where things are headed with respect to Iran's nuclear file is JCPOA 2.0 so you know whether [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sdZt7T5EEc&t=830.4s)]
*  APAC yeah I mean you know I can only imagine like the group therapy bills being sustained by APAC [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sdZt7T5EEc&t=838.16s)]
*  and the foundation for defense of democracies and the guys have been like angling for yeah I've got [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sdZt7T5EEc&t=847.52s)]
*  some impression this morning before you go down this route because I've been I've been wondering [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sdZt7T5EEc&t=851.68s)]
*  when we're going to hear from Tom Cotton on this because he's got to be really upset I'm sure we'll [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sdZt7T5EEc&t=855.28s)]
*  be hearing from him any minute here's what Trump said talk about Qatar nobody's going to break that [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sdZt7T5EEc&t=859.04s)]
*  relationship with Iran Iran is lucky to have the emir of Qatar because he's actually fighting for [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sdZt7T5EEc&t=863.76s)]
*  them he doesn't want us to do a vicious blow to Iran he says you can make a deal Iran should say [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sdZt7T5EEc&t=869.84s)]
*  a big thank you to Qatar so that's just Trump basically saying that like because the emir gave [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sdZt7T5EEc&t=876.32s)]
*  me this plane and because we're doing these deals like I'm just going to chill yeah and the Iranians [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sdZt7T5EEc&t=880.96s)]
*  are off are dangling you know multi hundreds of billions of dollars if not trillions of dollars of [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sdZt7T5EEc&t=885.5200000000001s)]
*  trade deals that that could commence with the lifting of Iran sanctions which they're hoping [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sdZt7T5EEc&t=890.5600000000001s)]
*  that will happen if they they cut a deal so okay I could see how optically people would say this [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sdZt7T5EEc&t=894.72s)]
*  was the end of the neocon world order but let's look at the other side of the ledger it was Obama [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sdZt7T5EEc&t=899.0400000000001s)]
*  and the progressive realists who said well actually you know taking out Bashar al-Assad would be a [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sdZt7T5EEc&t=905.68s)]
*  major own goal we don't have any strategic interest in Syria we want to recalibrate with Iran in other [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sdZt7T5EEc&t=913.1999999999999s)]
*  words create a kind of equilibrium between you know the the the Shia hegemon in the region and [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sdZt7T5EEc&t=920.64s)]
*  the Sunni-led Gulf Arab states principally Saudi Arabia I mean Obama was on record with Jeffrey [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sdZt7T5EEc&t=927.12s)]
*  Goldberg and others saying pretty much that a strategic realignment of America's priorities in [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sdZt7T5EEc&t=932.32s)]
*  the region but Syria was always kind of the obstacle to this right like we kind of supported [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sdZt7T5EEc&t=937.84s)]
*  a Syrian insurgency but didn't give them enough weapons and certainly didn't support them to [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sdZt7T5EEc&t=945.36s)]
*  overthrow the regime we wanted to apply a sufficient amount of pressure to get Bashar al-Assad to [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sdZt7T5EEc&t=949.7600000000001s)]
*  negotiate his removal but really the the fundamentals of his Ba'athist regime would stay in place and [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sdZt7T5EEc&t=953.6s)]
*  up until the end of the Biden administration I mean Brett McGurk was the biggest most vocal proponent [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sdZt7T5EEc&t=960.64s)]
*  of keeping Assad in place lifting sanctions on Assad's regime that was something he wanted to [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sdZt7T5EEc&t=966.96s)]
*  do because the Emiratis were pushing him and other Gulf Arab states it looked like Assad was coming [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sdZt7T5EEc&t=972.96s)]
*  in from the cold there was going to be full rapprochement and what happened well we've [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sdZt7T5EEc&t=978.0s)]
*  discussed this on a previous program the Turks said we cannot do a deal with this man particularly [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sdZt7T5EEc&t=982.0s)]
*  about the Kurdish issue which is the principle overriding Turkish national security concern [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sdZt7T5EEc&t=986.96s)]
*  and HDS which has been in this sort of garrison enclave in Idlib for eight years building its own [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sdZt7T5EEc&t=993.2s)]
*  statelet at with Turkish largesse and under a Turkish garrison rule has been championing at the [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sdZt7T5EEc&t=1000.32s)]
*  bit to do an offensive they let him out and the offensive was a catastrophic success blew everybody's [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sdZt7T5EEc&t=1006.96s)]
*  mind not least of all the Turks they didn't expect it to lead to regime change but that's what happened [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sdZt7T5EEc&t=1014.8s)]
*  so you know the mantra of the anti-neocons and the sort of realist forever was there is no military [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sdZt7T5EEc&t=1019.3599999999999s)]
*  solution to Syria only a diplomatic one well no it turns out there was a military solution to Syria [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sdZt7T5EEc&t=1025.12s)]
*  and although the Turks didn't intervene directly they certainly intervened indirectly as Donald [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sdZt7T5EEc&t=1030.3999999999999s)]
*  Trump himself was joking when he was sat next to Netanyahu in the Oval Office several weeks ago [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sdZt7T5EEc&t=1034.32s)]
*  so you you you kind of have the America the United States now certifying what looks to be a pretty [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sdZt7T5EEc&t=1039.28s)]
*  hawkish interventionist policy in one country in the Middle East by recognizing al-shara lifting [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sdZt7T5EEc&t=1046.0s)]
*  sanctions so I'm I'm I'm a little bit confused how people seem to come up with a coherent or sensible [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sdZt7T5EEc&t=1051.84s)]
*  worldview here I mean there's a little from column a a little from column b but again we come back to [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sdZt7T5EEc&t=1058.8s)]
*  the core issue which is this is a man who is incredibly impressionable somebody has a line [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sdZt7T5EEc&t=1062.96s)]
*  that I quite like he's like a seat cushion he bears the impression of the last ass to sit on [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sdZt7T5EEc&t=1069.92s)]
*  right incredibly impressionable and and just eminently bribeable you know it's not what's [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sdZt7T5EEc&t=1074.0s)]
*  in it for my country it's what's in it for me oh you want to give me a plane awesome you know [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sdZt7T5EEc&t=1079.52s)]

*  in your country's amazing that's how he does business and I think you know I don't fault [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sdZt7T5EEc&t=1089.68s)]
*  these gulf kleptocracies and autocracies from just figuring this out I mean they have their [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sdZt7T5EEc&t=1095.44s)]
*  own interests to to to pursue and to prosecute and and you know good on them I suppose but yeah [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sdZt7T5EEc&t=1102.24s)]
*  it's a terrible state to be in in this country when I mean you know all of the crimes all the [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sdZt7T5EEc&t=1108.24s)]
*  corruption is it's not hidden it's not the kind of thing that the Washington Post has to spend [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sdZt7T5EEc&t=1114.24s)]
*  two years investigating it's happening you know under the cleaguelites it's happening on on 24 [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sdZt7T5EEc&t=1117.84s)]
*  hour cable news networks in plain sight and we're all kind of like oh okay I guess yes yeah [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sdZt7T5EEc&t=1123.6799999999998s)]

*  that out but the out in the openness of this is I mean like it's the stated like they say it they're [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sdZt7T5EEc&t=1133.9199999999998s)]
*  like look this isn't it's not it's not a crime it's not corruption we're just doing it right and [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sdZt7T5EEc&t=1140.08s)]
*  I think that that you know is part of uh the thing they use as a shield I I just look at it [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sdZt7T5EEc&t=1144.48s)]
*  and think it's like kind of isn't it kind of humiliating I mean Trump is is was touting White [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sdZt7T5EEc&t=1150.4s)]

*  or at least a Netflix limited series right I mean that is the most hilarious thing in the world the [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sdZt7T5EEc&t=1186.48s)]
*  Wall Street Journal uh everybody's writing pieces now about you know Qatari influence peddling and [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sdZt7T5EEc&t=1190.3200000000002s)]

*  mega was this braggadocio we're gonna make America great again America is this world leader we don't [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sdZt7T5EEc&t=1212.32s)]

*  taken advantage of there's a little bit of a humiliating element to this that we that Trump [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sdZt7T5EEc&t=1221.6s)]
*  just has to he's lavishly just kind of tossing the nbs's salad yesterday and we're like getting [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sdZt7T5EEc&t=1226.6399999999999s)]

*  just a little kind of bow for like that maybe this bar wasn't even really a bow and [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sdZt7T5EEc&t=1244.48s)]
*  Fox was wall to wall on that I mean Trump is fully prostate on the ground he is and I mean yeah it's [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sdZt7T5EEc&t=1249.04s)]
*  not a particularly original insight to say that this is a guy with a real penchant for strongmen [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sdZt7T5EEc&t=1256.32s)]
*  and you know one of my favorite anecdotes from sort of the cold war Soviet period and the reason [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sdZt7T5EEc&t=1263.1200000000001s)]
*  why so many western intellectuals supported Stalin Malcolm I think I've mentioned this on the show [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sdZt7T5EEc&t=1268.96s)]
*  before Malcolm Muggeridge was talking about his friends Sydney and Butrus Webb because he had [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sdZt7T5EEc&t=1273.8400000000001s)]
*  just got back from Moscow in the 1930s and the scales fell from his eyes he saw what Stalinism [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sdZt7T5EEc&t=1277.84s)]
*  really was and he couldn't understand why are all his left-wing intellectual friends still supportive [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sdZt7T5EEc&t=1283.12s)]
*  of this sort of wretched regime and he said oh it's because you know Stalin is doing to intellectuals [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sdZt7T5EEc&t=1287.84s)]
*  over there what the webs would like to be doing to intellectuals in London right so don't discount [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sdZt7T5EEc&t=1293.52s)]
*  the fact that what Donald Trump sees in these dictators and these these autocrats and these [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sdZt7T5EEc&t=1299.52s)]

*  danger here is you know zelensky has has a real a proper team in place he's got his foreign minister [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sdZt7T5EEc&t=1994.32s)]
*  there he's got significant you know got high level government officials not least of all himself [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sdZt7T5EEc&t=2000.32s)]
*  but what the the russians are trying to do is do this sort of patemkin theater and then say well we [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sdZt7T5EEc&t=2006.32s)]
*  had our direct talks the ukrainians are intransigent they will not come to the table they will not make [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sdZt7T5EEc&t=2013.9199999999998s)]
*  concessions and then basically cajole donald trump into applying even more pressure on the ukrainians [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sdZt7T5EEc&t=2019.4399999999998s)]
*  which he's very you know susceptible of doing right he does not extract anything from the russians [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sdZt7T5EEc&t=2025.36s)]
*  you know he signed off on this european led initiative which said you have until this past [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sdZt7T5EEc&t=2030.4799999999998s)]
*  monday to do a 30-day ceasefire if you don't we will impose crippling new sanctions well it's now [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sdZt7T5EEc&t=2036.3999999999999s)]
*  thursday where are the sanctions right and so the europeans unfortunately look a bit weak and [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sdZt7T5EEc&t=2043.04s)]
*  humiliated by not sticking to their own guns on this they wrote the americans they wrote trump [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sdZt7T5EEc&t=2049.44s)]
*  into this and then just with a bright shiny new object that booton threw out there trump said [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sdZt7T5EEc&t=2055.04s)]
*  amazing you know the potential for peace in our time and and completely um through his own [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sdZt7T5EEc&t=2059.44s)]
*  plan or a plan that to which he was a party to under the bus in favor of a russian active measure [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sdZt7T5EEc&t=2066.0s)]
*  so i don't there's not going to be a breakthrough here the question is where does trump come out on [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sdZt7T5EEc&t=2072.32s)]
*  all of this and if history is our guide he's going to say well it's the ukrainians now that are being [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sdZt7T5EEc&t=2078.24s)]
*  obnoxious and they they should really they need to look reality in the face here and they're not [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sdZt7T5EEc&t=2083.12s)]
*  going to get back all of their territory we're not sending our troops they're not going to be in nato [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sdZt7T5EEc&t=2087.6s)]
*  they need to bend the knee we'll see um other people are suggesting that well actually he's [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sdZt7T5EEc&t=2092.3199999999997s)]
*  become more exasperated and angry at the russians because he sees them as the spoiler so the u.s [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sdZt7T5EEc&t=2097.04s)]
*  ambassador to nato was suggesting as much recently i mean look i will say this um as i you know i [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sdZt7T5EEc&t=2102.72s)]
*  played devil's advocate with myself right there are certain things trump has not done yet that [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sdZt7T5EEc&t=2109.6s)]
*  he could have done on day one he could have ended all security assistance and all intelligence [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sdZt7T5EEc&t=2115.2s)]
*  sharing and i don't mean that temporary moratorium that he did as a way to punish the ukrainians [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sdZt7T5EEc&t=2119.92s)]
*  needlessly he could have ended all that he hasn't he could not he could have not agreed to do direct [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sdZt7T5EEc&t=2125.52s)]
*  arms sales to ukraine he has he could have tried to scupper an f-16 spare parts deal with the [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sdZt7T5EEc&t=2130.96s)]
*  ukrainians he hasn't done that either most important because this is what ukraine needs [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sdZt7T5EEc&t=2137.12s)]
*  the most right now the germans are providing the ukrainians as of last week 100 patriot missiles [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sdZt7T5EEc&t=2142.0s)]
*  125 um rockets for rocket artillery gimlers and probably also attack them so the only way the [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sdZt7T5EEc&t=2149.2s)]
*  germans are able to do that is with america's authorization because of the end user agreement [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sdZt7T5EEc&t=2156.0s)]
*  on weapons systems right so my argument is this let's say you know trump continues to say well i [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sdZt7T5EEc&t=2160.8s)]
*  got to wash my hands of this now these two you know rascally combatants don't like each other [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sdZt7T5EEc&t=2167.52s)]
*  i i'm done i'm i'm tired i got my jet from cutter i'm i'm now in the middle east baby you know i'm [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sdZt7T5EEc&t=2173.6800000000003s)]
*  through with europe well okay if that's what you do but then the status quo is maintained especially [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sdZt7T5EEc&t=2178.5600000000004s)]
*  if you allow the europeans to donate weapons that they buy from the united states to ukraine [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sdZt7T5EEc&t=2185.12s)]
*  then we're not in such a terrible state the worst case scenario is he says i'm going [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sdZt7T5EEc&t=2192.16s)]
*  all after the ukrainians i am tearing up everything intel sharing i will not allow [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sdZt7T5EEc&t=2197.2799999999997s)]
*  lackey and raytheon kit that we sell to germany and france and the uk to be donated to ukraine [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sdZt7T5EEc&t=2202.16s)]
*  that would be a real escalation in favor of the russia and if he does that though tim in the absence [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sdZt7T5EEc&t=2208.56s)]
*  of any grand bargain there's going to be resistance not just from the europeans and not just from you [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sdZt7T5EEc&t=2214.08s)]
*  know ourselves and people who support ukraine in the united states but you notice there are sort of [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sdZt7T5EEc&t=2220.3199999999997s)]
*  cracks in the gop magga coalition here ben shapiro goes to keve sort of has taken with zelinski does [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sdZt7T5EEc&t=2224.3199999999997s)]
*  his podcast and says actually you know there's all pressure on the ukrainians not on the russians [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sdZt7T5EEc&t=2232.24s)]
*  the new york post their entire team uh editorially is very pro ukraine they will push against this [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sdZt7T5EEc&t=2236.72s)]
*  fox news hits every once in a while jack keen and others will get on air and say this is ridiculous [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sdZt7T5EEc&t=2244.08s)]
*  you know we're just gifting the russians everything in in exchange for nothing it's going to be a [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sdZt7T5EEc&t=2249.92s)]
*  little problematic that's not to say he won't do it because he's a sociopathic narcissist and he [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sdZt7T5EEc&t=2254.96s)]
*  just does whatever the hell he wants but there are institutional things in place that are going to [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sdZt7T5EEc&t=2260.08s)]
*  make it a little more complicated for him to do that so that's the best case scenario i can [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sdZt7T5EEc&t=2264.0s)]
*  for ukraine that we continue to arm either directly or indirectly and it sort of becomes a [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sdZt7T5EEc&t=2268.7999999999997s)]
*  you know a back of the new york times story which is would benefit all it's off the front page right [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sdZt7T5EEc&t=2275.6s)]
*  yeah well and i mean i think that there is a potential petulant trump element to this to like [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sdZt7T5EEc&t=2281.7599999999998s)]
*  he's annoyed that putin didn't give him what he wants because i can imagine that they were [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sdZt7T5EEc&t=2287.3599999999997s)]
*  friends and like expected that putin was going to give well exactly right what is the actual [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sdZt7T5EEc&t=2290.9599999999996s)]
*  what's the status of the war just like militarily i mean it's largely since we last time no it's not [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sdZt7T5EEc&t=2296.08s)]
*  i mean it's very static you know i was just meeting with valeri ziluzhny the former commander in [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sdZt7T5EEc&t=2304.32s)]
*  chief he's now the ukrainian ambassador to the uk i was meeting with one of his advisors and i [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sdZt7T5EEc&t=2311.44s)]

*  along the contact line which is just it's a no man's land of drones on both sides it makes it [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sdZt7T5EEc&t=2323.84s)]
*  impossible for either side to have a major breakthrough i mean what the russians are doing [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sdZt7T5EEc&t=2330.32s)]
*  is they're actually they're not using heavy armor um they're not i mean they're they're they're [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sdZt7T5EEc&t=2334.96s)]
*  putting soldiers on motorbikes and kind of raiding ukrainian positions across the line and that that [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sdZt7T5EEc&t=2340.8s)]
*  can be kind of tactically a little bit dangerous for the ukrainians but by and large things have [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sdZt7T5EEc&t=2345.76s)]
*  remained the same i mean the russians are are struggling to move forward now there's all this [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sdZt7T5EEc&t=2349.84s)]
*  scuttlebutt including from the ukrainian side about a potentially massive russian offensive that could [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sdZt7T5EEc&t=2354.4s)]
*  be waged in the summer using fresh meat from you know the recruits that are being i think the [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sdZt7T5EEc&t=2359.92s)]
*  number is something like 30 to 40 000 a month they're being called up by the russians and paid [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sdZt7T5EEc&t=2367.36s)]
*  fairly well uh we'll see i mean i've seen this this story play out before you know the russians [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sdZt7T5EEc&t=2372.32s)]
*  are they're really gearing up to do something massive and then the time comes and it's it's a [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sdZt7T5EEc&t=2378.8s)]
*  it's rather anticlimactic but you know i have to be honest it's not that bad for the ukrainians [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sdZt7T5EEc&t=2384.6400000000003s)]
*  right now you know it's not great but it's not catastrophic and it could be a lot better for them [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sdZt7T5EEc&t=2389.04s)]
*  if we sort of you know saw the facts as they are and saw the weak position that russia is in [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sdZt7T5EEc&t=2394.7200000000003s)]
