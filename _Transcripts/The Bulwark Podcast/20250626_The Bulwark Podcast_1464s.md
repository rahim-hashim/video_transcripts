# GOP’s Trillion-Dollar Cuts to Healthcare Will Hurt Millions (w/ Jonathan Cohn)
**The Bulwark Podcast:** [June 26, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc)
*  There's like a really simple way to think about what this bill would do. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=0.0s)]
*  It's going to take a trillion dollars out of government health care programs. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=2.56s)]
*  So a trillion dollars out of Medicaid and out of the Affordable Care Act. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=6.640000000000001s)]
*  Obamacare is going to take a trillion dollars. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=10.4s)]
*  That's a lot of money. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=12.08s)]
*  And because they do that, a lot of people are going to lose health care. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=13.280000000000001s)]
*  All right. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=23.68s)]
*  He writes the breakdown newsletter for the bulwark. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=24.16s)]
*  It's new. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=26.72s)]
*  You better be getting it. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=27.2s)]
*  It is extremely valuable. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=28.64s)]
*  It makes me smarter. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=30.16s)]
*  He also has books which include the 10 year war, Obamacare, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=31.04s)]
*  and the unfinished crusade for universal coverage. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=34.4s)]
*  It's my newish colleague, Jonathan Cohen. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=37.52s)]
*  How you doing, man? [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=39.68s)]
*  Hey, I'm just trying to keep up with everything and decide if I have to republish the book on [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=40.96s)]
*  the 10 year war as like the 18 year war, the 20 year war. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=46.0s)]
*  I guess we'll see. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=49.6s)]
*  It shows the limits of creating names such as this. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=51.120000000000005s)]
*  The president has decided the Israel-Iran war is the 12 day war. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=55.599999999999994s)]
*  We were just talking about that. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=59.44s)]
*  It might turn out to be a little longer than 12 days. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=61.36s)]
*  We'll see how it goes. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=63.36s)]
*  And you and Trump have very little in common. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=64.16s)]
*  But in this case, maybe you might be learning a lesson together. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=66.96s)]
*  Yeah, not that much in common. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=70.72s)]
*  But hey, I'll take a lesson wherever I can get it. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=72.08s)]
*  So there you go. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=74.56s)]
*  Do you have one of my favorite quiz questions to ask my MAGA family members [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=75.6s)]
*  is our friends or whoever people I encounter is what is a trait that Donald Trump has that [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=81.12s)]
*  you would want your child to emulate? [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=86.32000000000001s)]
*  You have two children. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=88.24000000000001s)]
*  Do you can you answer that? [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=89.2s)]
*  Do you have anything? [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=90.4s)]
*  Do you have a single trait of Donald Trump's you wish your child would emulate? [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=91.28s)]
*  Oh, boy. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=97.84s)]
*  A trait Donald Trump that I it's this is hard. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=99.60000000000001s)]
*  I will say this. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=104.72s)]
*  I think something he does well as a politician, which is probably a good thing in life, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=106.08000000000001s)]
*  which is if he thinks he if he's intent on doing something, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=109.92s)]
*  he doesn't let people dissuade him that easily. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=115.68s)]
*  I mean, I think in the reality that we live in, I prefer people dissuade him from most of the [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=118.16s)]
*  things he wants to do. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=123.44s)]
*  But that ability to kind of block out the noise and believe that you're doing the right thing [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=125.04s)]
*  and pursue it, I think is a valuable quality. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=129.52s)]
*  And I frankly wish more leaders who I do like and agree with had that call. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=131.68s)]
*  Self-confidence. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=136.0s)]
*  So there you go. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=136.56s)]
*  There you go. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=137.6s)]
*  You can put up a little something in the bathroom, in the guest bathroom. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=138.4s)]
*  That's that's like a little affirmation about Donald Trump that your children can admire. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=142.23999999999998s)]
*  I'm sure they'll be very excited to hear this clip. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=147.6s)]
*  You have a newsletter out this morning called The Big Beautiful Rush Job about the BBB. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=150.79999999999998s)]
*  You write that the goal is to start the voting process this weekend and get a bill on Trump's [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=158.32s)]
*  desk by July 4th. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=162.32s)]
*  That's eight days from now. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=163.84s)]
*  Not nearly enough time for Republican lawmakers. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=165.92s)]
*  To figure out exactly what's in the bill. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=168.4s)]
*  Feels like we've been here before. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=170.23999999999998s)]
*  And that was complicated kind of as you were publishing by this rule from the parliamentarian [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=172.64s)]
*  that says that some of these Medicaid cuts don't fit within the rules. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=177.76s)]
*  I guess just talk about the difference between Obamacare and this because Obamacare kind of [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=182.4s)]
*  had a reputation for getting rushed. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=186.72s)]
*  You know, we got to pass the bill to see what's in it or whatever the famous Kupelosi quote [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=188.56s)]
*  was. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=192.07999999999998s)]
*  Talk about like the comparison between that and the degree with which this is trying that [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=192.64s)]
*  they're trying to jam this through. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=197.12s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, there's a famous Pelosi quote that always comes up in these discussions. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=198.96s)]
*  And people are like, look, they secretly passed Obamacare. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=203.12s)]
*  They crafted it behind closed doors. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=205.92000000000002s)]
*  Nobody knew who was in it, which could not be farther from the truth. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=208.32s)]
*  They spent a year debating that bill. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=214.08s)]
*  There were long committee hearings in five congressional committees, hundreds of hours [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=217.04000000000002s)]
*  of testimony. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=221.84s)]
*  You know, days and days of floor debate in multiple stages. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=223.84s)]
*  It was all sort of, you know, on the front pages debated for months. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=228.56s)]
*  And for better or worse, a lot of the stuff that was said about the bill was wrong or [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=232.56s)]
*  was exaggerated. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=237.12s)]
*  But there was a lot of discussion. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=237.92s)]
*  Does the death panels ever come? [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=240.48s)]
*  Well, no, although we may get some now. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=242.96s)]
*  So, you know, stay tuned from this bill, this Republican bill. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=245.12s)]
*  But it was, you know, for better or worse, the process took a long time. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=249.35999999999999s)]
*  To the frustration, by the way, of the Obama White House. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=253.35999999999999s)]
*  I mean, Rahm Emanuel was like tearing his hair out because it was taking so long to [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=258.0s)]
*  get this bill through. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=263.2s)]
*  And there was like these long negotiations, the finance committee. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=264.08s)]
*  So the quote that Pelosi gave that everyone used was basically she was saying, look, [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=267.52s)]
*  there's been so much controversy, so much misinformation. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=272.24s)]
*  When you're finally done with this bill, people will see that what we're actually doing [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=275.28s)]
*  doesn't match up. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=278.64s)]
*  There are no death panels, to take that example. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=279.28s)]
*  So that was, you know, a year. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=282.24s)]
*  And what are we doing here? [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=283.91999999999996s)]
*  So it was, go back to Memorial Day weekend, the week before Memorial Day, when the House [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=285.03999999999996s)]
*  passed their version, they literally got language out. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=290.08s)]
*  They put the language of the final language of the book. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=294.64s)]
*  They were negotiating quietly what they were going to do and they put it on a Sunday [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=296.47999999999996s)]
*  night. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=299.68s)]
*  And then I can't remember if it was Thursday or Friday they finally voted. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=300.4s)]
*  But five days, five days, you know, for a massive tax cut. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=303.2s)]
*  Huge cuts to health care, cuts to food assistance. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=308.4s)]
*  By the way, you know, ripping out a sort of generational investment in clean energy along [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=311.67999999999995s)]
*  the way just for kicks. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=317.2s)]
*  And now we're over in the Senate and they're doing the same thing. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=319.35999999999996s)]
*  We don't have final language yet. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=322.96s)]
*  Forget the Congressional Budget Office trying to do an assessment of it. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=325.12s)]
*  And they're talking about they want to have a vote over the weekend. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=329.28s)]
*  I mean, that is just bonkers. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=332.23999999999995s)]
*  And of course, if you go that quickly, of course, the public's not going to understand [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=333.92s)]
*  what's in this bill. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=338.8s)]
*  Of course, people aren't going to have time to analyze it. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=339.76s)]
*  And, you know, honestly, I'd be shocked if most of the senators and representatives [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=342.56s)]
*  voting on this really know in a kind of deep way what's in this bill. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=349.12s)]
*  So let's zoom out and then talk about like what is in the bill and then we can kind of [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=354.08000000000004s)]
*  get into the parliamentarian and the wrangling. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=357.12s)]
*  So I so look, it's like super complicated bill by design. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=359.84000000000003s)]
*  What they've done is on the certain terms, you know, this in terms of what they're doing [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=363.44s)]
*  to health care, they've packaged all these, you know, provisions, these targeted things [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=367.03999999999996s)]
*  that sound super complicated over appeal, the Medicaid eligibility rule and, you know, [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=372.32s)]
*  change. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=378.47999999999996s)]
*  You don't need to know anything about that. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=379.59999999999997s)]
*  There's like a really simple way to think about what this bill would do, which is it's [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=380.71999999999997s)]
*  going to take a trillion dollars out of government health care programs. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=384.56s)]
*  So a trillion dollars out of Medicaid and out of the Affordable Care Act, Obamacare, [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=388.4s)]
*  it's going to take a trillion dollars. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=393.2s)]
*  That's a lot of money. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=394.32s)]
*  You know, people, you don't know your budget figures. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=395.12s)]
*  Trust me, that's a big, big chunk of money in the federal budget. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=396.64s)]
*  And because they do that, a lot of people are going to lose health care. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=400.56s)]
*  You know, there's an estimate from the Congressional Budget Office, 11 million people [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=404.15999999999997s)]
*  lose health insurance. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=408.56s)]
*  On top of that, we have millions more who are going to have to pay more for health [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=410.79999999999995s)]
*  care because they're going to have to pay higher premiums in Obamacare. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=414.4s)]
*  They'll have higher cost sharing. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=417.6s)]
*  And this is going to hurt people. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=419.76000000000005s)]
*  We can argue about any of the individual changes here. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=422.56s)]
*  This is a good one. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=424.88s)]
*  This is a bad one. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=425.68s)]
*  This one won't be so bad. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=426.48s)]
*  You know, there's room for debate on all this stuff. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=428.0s)]
*  But when you take that much health care away from that many people, they're going to [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=430.0s)]
*  suffer. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=434.40000000000003s)]
*  They're going to have higher bills. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=434.72s)]
*  People that we're talking about, a lot of low income people, working class people, [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=436.16s)]
*  some middle class people, they're going to have trouble paying their rent. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=439.76000000000005s)]
*  They're going to have trouble paying their grocery bills. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=442.48s)]
*  And they're not going to be able to go to the doctor. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=446.08s)]
*  And some of them are going to just go into deeper financial distress. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=447.68s)]
*  And some are going to get sick and die. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=451.44s)]
*  You know, I was, you know, like a lot of reporters, I've been spending a lot of time [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=453.35999999999996s)]
*  interviewing people about this. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=456.96s)]
*  Just this week, I was interviewing a woman from Pennsylvania. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=458.24s)]
*  She's a home care worker, right? [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=462.47999999999996s)]
*  You know, she cares for an elderly woman who can't get around. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=463.84s)]
*  She cooks. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=469.84s)]
*  She moves around. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=470.88s)]
*  She moves around the bed. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=472.32s)]
*  She lifts her into a wheelchair. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=474.15999999999997s)]
*  She makes $14 an hour. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=476.32s)]
*  $14 an hour. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=478.64s)]
*  She can't afford health insurance, so she relies on Medicaid. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=479.76s)]
*  She also relies on food assistance. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=482.4s)]
*  And by the way, Medicaid pays the agency for the care for the elderly that then pays [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=484.24s)]
*  her salary. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=489.68s)]
*  You cut Medicaid and it affects her. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=490.96s)]
*  She's going to feel it. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=494.32s)]
*  You know, she's in her 50s. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=495.44s)]
*  She's got a shoulder thing from all the lifting, right? [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=496.64s)]
*  She's got some cardiac problems. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=499.68s)]
*  And you know, maybe she gets to find a free clinic. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=501.91999999999996s)]
*  She can get the basic care. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=504.47999999999996s)]
*  She can't get to the cardiologist. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=505.36s)]
*  She can't get to the orthopedist. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=506.72s)]
*  Best case scenario, she's in a lot more physical pain at her work. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=508.72s)]
*  Worst case scenario, she can't work. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=512.5600000000001s)]
*  Worst worst case scenario, you know, she gets a heart attack, something awful, and she dies. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=514.0s)]
*  And that kind of thing is going to happen. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=518.24s)]
*  I mean, that is what we're talking about with this bill. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=520.0s)]
*  We were talking about this last night at the next level. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=521.92s)]
*  I don't really understand why they're doing it. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=524.64s)]
*  I just don't. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=526.96s)]
*  Can you make heads or tails of this? [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=531.12s)]
*  You've just been like, I guess let's put it this way. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=533.2s)]
*  There are people on the Hill, the congressional guys will have their own self-identity. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=536.1600000000001s)]
*  Maybe they just think government should be smaller, so they're for any cuts. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=544.24s)]
*  Or maybe they feel guilty about how bad this is going to bust the debt. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=547.12s)]
*  So they feel like they got to do something to save face. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=551.9200000000001s)]
*  That's all kind of psychological analysis. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=554.64s)]
*  Like the analysts, you read the conservative analysts. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=557.28s)]
*  I can't even find a compelling defense of doing it the way they're doing it. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=565.52s)]
*  Have you seen anything? [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=571.36s)]
*  Yeah, there is. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=572.9599999999999s)]
*  There is. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=573.52s)]
*  So I want to acknowledge there is a principled conservative argument. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=573.76s)]
*  I respect people come out and make these arguments. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=580.72s)]
*  I think it's important to argue these things in American politics. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=582.72s)]
*  And they would say, put in these money, these programs in general aren't that efficient. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=585.9200000000001s)]
*  We could spend our money better. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=589.9200000000001s)]
*  We should have a smaller government. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=591.52s)]
*  We need lower taxes. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=592.88s)]
*  It's better for the economy. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=593.9200000000001s)]
*  And they think maybe there are tradeoffs. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=595.2s)]
*  Maybe some people lose health care. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=597.12s)]
*  It's worth it in the end. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=598.4000000000001s)]
*  And I don't believe that, but that's an argument we can have and we should have. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=599.2800000000001s)]
*  And that's why we have two parties to make these arguments. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=603.52s)]
*  In addition to that, there is a more detailed analytic argument that has been put forward. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=606.88s)]
*  There are some think tanks out there that have been making these arguments that basically say, [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=614.48s)]
*  look, there's a lot of fraud. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=618.8000000000001s)]
*  There's a lot of people on these programs who don't deserve to be on these programs. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=621.04s)]
*  They don't really satisfy the eligibility. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=624.72s)]
*  And there's waste and abuse. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=627.9200000000001s)]
*  And that these changes in this bill are going to cut down on it. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=630.24s)]
*  They're going to get rid of their people. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=632.72s)]
*  It will get rid of the people on Medicaid or on Obamacare who don't really qualify [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=635.12s)]
*  but are getting in because they've managed to deceive somebody. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=639.12s)]
*  And then there's a separate argument about the work requirements is a second set of arguments, [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=642.96s)]
*  which is that we think we should condition health benefits on work and the work requirements will [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=647.9200000000001s)]
*  do that. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=654.24s)]
*  And those are the two big arguments. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=654.72s)]
*  There's others, but I'd say those are the two big ones. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=656.72s)]
*  Pete Slauson Go back to, I'm trying to think of another [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=658.5600000000001s)]
*  unpopular thing that I was for on the conservative side, the Social Security Privatization Plan. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=660.32s)]
*  How about this? [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=664.4000000000001s)]
*  The Social Security Privatization Plan had a lot of, you know, very serious think tank folks [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=665.36s)]
*  who were excited about it and like made the case about why this would be better for the [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=672.4s)]
*  budget long term and why it'd be better for people. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=679.04s)]
*  There are a lot of people on the Hill. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=680.88s)]
*  That is not really the case here. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=683.76s)]
*  You really have to kind of dig through for people. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=686.32s)]
*  Do you feel that way or am I just missing it? [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=689.76s)]
*  Is it somewhere outside of my bubble? [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=691.9200000000001s)]
*  I don't see anybody that's like super excited about this. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=693.92s)]
*  There are people that are really excited about the fantasy that it's only waste, [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=696.24s)]
*  fraud and abuse. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=700.3199999999999s)]
*  Like that's what I keep seeing, like is the defense of it. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=701.36s)]
*  It's like, oh, we're just getting rid of the waste, fraud and abuse. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=703.52s)]
*  But like that's not true. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=705.28s)]
*  So, like what about like a defense on the merits of the actual program? [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=707.2s)]
*  Jared Sussman Yeah. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=712.24s)]
*  Well, you're picking on, I think you're mostly right in picking up on something real here, [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=712.88s)]
*  which I think speaks to the way this debate has evolved, which is you kind of go back 20 [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=720.0s)]
*  years, 25 years in the healthcare debate, Republicans versus Democrats. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=723.68s)]
*  It's a lot of really heavy hitter kind of economists analyze people places like American [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=728.4s)]
*  Enterprise Institute, who they would advise like John McCain when he ran for president, [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=733.12s)]
*  for example, very formidable conservative healthcare economists on that side of the aisle. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=738.64s)]
*  Thing was those conservative economists, a lot of them, you know, I think one woman in particular [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=747.8399999999999s)]
*  name was Gail Walensky. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=752.48s)]
*  She just passed away like a year ago. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=753.36s)]
*  Really brilliant woman. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=755.6s)]
*  She actually ran Medicare and Medicaid under the under Bush wants under Bush. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=756.5600000000001s)]
*  Wait, I get my numbers. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=761.28s)]
*  That 41. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=762.16s)]
*  It was 41. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=762.8000000000001s)]
*  It was 41. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=763.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=764.4s)]
*  Okay. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=764.5600000000001s)]
*  So Bush 41. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=764.72s)]
*  And you know, really formidable. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=765.9200000000001s)]
*  The thing was like she didn't hate like she wasn't like totally against government [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=768.48s)]
*  healthcare and she was, you know, government playing a role in healthcare. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=772.4s)]
*  She didn't want to screw the uninsured, right? [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=774.64s)]
*  I mean, she thought we should do something to cover people. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=776.88s)]
*  She has had a kind of conservative, more conservative spin on it. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=779.12s)]
*  And I remember when they got to the affordable care act debate, I mean, she, [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=782.4s)]
*  I remember interviewing her at the time. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=785.28s)]
*  She's like, yeah, you know, I don't, I don't like, I think it's too much government [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=786.48s)]
*  regulation spending, but okay, you know, put me in a room with a liberal economist. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=788.8s)]
*  I bet we could figure something out. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=792.64s)]
*  Well, that no space for that in the Republican party of Donald Trump and MAGA. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=794.0s)]
*  They just want nothing to do with this stuff. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=799.12s)]
*  And so most of the, most of the really sort of serious who would have been serious [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=801.28s)]
*  conservative intellectuals on this 10, 20 years ago, they're not in the Republican party [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=807.4399999999999s)]
*  anymore. They're not welcome in the Republican party. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=812.24s)]
*  They're either on an island by themselves or a lot of them have started advising Democrats. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=813.84s)]
*  Now there are, I know this all sounds vaguely familiar, but there is a, there are exceptions. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=818.8s)]
*  There is a, like there's this one think tank called Paragon Institute, which is run by a guy who was [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=825.6s)]
*  in a top healthcare advisor to the first, in the first Trump White House, Brian Blaze, very serious [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=830.4s)]
*  guy, knows what he's talking about. As much as any person or think tank, you know, they've been [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=836.48s)]
*  sort of responsible for putting up the material on this. So there is, he's there. There's a handful [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=842.16s)]
*  of other people you can find in some of these groups, but for the most part, the really serious [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=847.04s)]
*  people aren't part of the Republican universe. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=851.8399999999999s)]
*  All right. Congrats, Brian Blaze PhD. I'm just checking him out. Nice haircut. So just unlike [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=853.6s)]
*  the primary and secondary effects, and you mentioned the anecdote of the woman, like what are, [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=858.3199999999999s)]
*  what exactly are the programs and, and the impacts, you know, that are, that people are going to feel? [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=862.4s)]
*  Yeah. So, I mean, the biggest cuts in this bill are, are to Medicaid and, and, and the Affordable [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=868.8000000000001s)]
*  Care Act, Obamacare, and there's sort of two kind of sets of really big. So one is a kind of [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=875.12s)]
*  whole, you know, there's a lot of new rules for what you, and new procedures for what you need [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=880.24s)]
*  to do to sort of qualify and stay eligible for these programs. Right. So, [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=884.96s)]
*  More paperwork, which is more paper, which is very conservative. Yeah. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=889.44s)]
*  Yeah. It, it, right. Right. I mean, anti-abundance. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=893.44s)]
*  It really is. I mean, but that's sort of the point here is that, you know, the, the, the sort of the [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=898.32s)]
*  theory of the, oh, we have all this waste, we have all this fraud, we need to really carefully [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=903.12s)]
*  screen every single person and make them file their income every month. And look, there are, I mean, [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=906.48s)]
*  any large program, there's people who aren't eligible for various reasons. And, and, and, [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=912.08s)]
*  and, you know, certainly there's a, there's a good smart way to avoid that. But what they've done [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=916.08s)]
*  here is basically say, we're just going to, yeah, you know, throw up a lot more paperwork. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=922.72s)]
*  And we know what happens because we've tried this before. And, and it's, it's, it's obvious. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=926.72s)]
*  If you've ever had to deal with a government agency, you know how this works. It's just so [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=930.48s)]
*  easy for errors to come up. There are agencies are underfunded, so they can't deal with problems as [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=934.4s)]
*  they come up and think of who you're dealing with here. Right. You're dealing with a sort of [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=939.52s)]
*  population. It's probably a lot of people, seasonal workers, they have trouble getting [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=942.72s)]
*  documentation to show that they're working. You have a lot of people, maybe they don't have great [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=946.4s)]
*  access to technology. They don't know how to use technology, especially to get to older cohorts. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=951.52s)]
*  The polite word in the policy world is friction. We make, we put friction in the process of getting [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=956.56s)]
*  on these programs. It's really what we want. We want to make it as hard as possible for people [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=961.52s)]
*  to get healthcare. That's great. More friction in the process. Yeah. Got it. Literally that's what [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=964.64s)]
*  we're doing here. And then there's like straight up cuts. I mean, this doesn't get enough attention [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=970.16s)]
*  to me because we've all been, you know, to the extent that people are paying attention, we talk [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=973.28s)]
*  about the work requirements or whatever. They're actually like just straight up cuts, especially [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=975.92s)]
*  when you get, you see a really in the affordable care act part where they're sort of changing the [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=980.2399999999999s)]
*  way that the sort of the standards for what insurance has to cover or how much assistance [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=985.36s)]
*  you can get through a tax credit. The formulas tweaked. Again, it's one of these things that [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=991.76s)]
*  if you look at it, you have no idea, but you know what I mean? It's going to mean if you're, you know, [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=995.52s)]
*  mate, you're a kind of working class, you know, you buy coverage through healthcare.gov and, [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=999.2s)]
*  you know, right now with your tax credit, you're spending $200 a month or something on your [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=1006.0s)]
*  insurance. Well, now you're going to go ahead and to get that same insurance, you'd have to pay more [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=1010.8000000000001s)]
*  or you can keep paying the $200, but something you're going to discover that like your co-pay [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=1015.04s)]
*  at the pharmacies like double what it was, you know, you sort of pay that. So that's kind of [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=1018.8000000000001s)]
*  the primary effect. And also the other thing you said, the way the formulas work out, there are [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=1023.76s)]
*  also changes formulas for the states in a big way. And that is like why you see a lot of like the [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=1028.56s)]
*  rural hospitals like freaking out. It's like that is another, I think, real like tangible impact [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=1033.68s)]
*  potentially that folks are going to feel because if there's different formula going to these like [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=1040.48s)]
*  states and the states are getting less money, well, you know, that's going to come out of something. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=1045.84s)]
*  Yeah. And the rural hospital pieces, I mean, there's a reason we keep hearing about it in the news. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=1051.1200000000001s)]
*  It's, you know, rural hospitals, just the finances of rural hospitals. It's really tough. It's tough [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=1055.28s)]
*  to make money as a rural hospital. They've really become dependent on Medicaid, you know, depending [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=1059.3600000000001s)]
*  on how these cuts go through. A lot of them are going to struggle. We've already had rural [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=1064.48s)]
*  hospitals closing. You're going to see more of rural hospitals closing. And I think this is so [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=1068.16s)]
*  important because it shows how, even if you're not on Medicaid, even if you have like good employer [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=1071.76s)]
*  insurance, how this can affect you. So imagine you live in, you know, you live in rural Nebraska or [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=1077.44s)]
*  Louisiana or Michigan where I live, right? So your upper peninsula, Michigan will do my state. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=1082.0s)]
*  Your upper peninsula is the winter and, you know, you're pregnant three weeks early, you're in labor [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=1086.72s)]
*  and it's the snowstorm. And now the hospital that was there isn't there anymore. They don't do [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=1093.6s)]
*  maternity services, let's say, or whatever. So you can have the best insurance. You can be very well [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=1099.28s)]
*  off. You can never touch Medicaid or Obamacare. Doesn't matter. You still got to drive in a [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=1105.2s)]
*  blinding snowstorm, 60, 70, 80 miles, which, you know, is probably not what you want to be doing [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=1110.24s)]
*  when you're in labor or especially if, you know, hopefully not, but, you know, [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=1117.6s)]
*  you're in some kind of distress. So this affects everybody, even people who aren't dependent on [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=1121.6s)]
*  this program. Like the different, where our minds go to these totally opposite places. You're in the [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=1127.76s)]
*  upper peninsula. It's a snowstorm. I'm thinking that like you're down in the bayou. And it's like, [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=1131.6799999999998s)]
*  you got to get up to whom, to Homa. You know, you're down there in Meadow. Anyway, yeah, it's, [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=1139.76s)]
*  that's ugly. All right. So the news this morning was essentially, how do I explain this in a way [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=1146.56s)]
*  that takes up as much jargon as possible? Like in order to pass this thing with only 50 votes, [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=1153.36s)]
*  because there are only 53 Republican senators, you can't have the 60, you can't overcome the [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=1158.56s)]
*  filibuster. You can do that through this system called reconciliation. Most of the big budget [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=1161.76s)]
*  and tax bills have been passed, like in my adult life have come through reconciliation. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=1166.32s)]
*  And, and reconciliation comes with certain rules about like what can be included in it and what [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=1170.48s)]
*  can't. And, you know, there are also some rules on, on how much can add to the deficit though. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=1176.72s)]
*  Those are a little bit more, this is a little bit easier to get around. So there's a parliamentarian [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=1183.9199999999998s)]
*  in the Senate that kind of looks at it and is like, well, this can fit in reconciliation. This can't. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=1189.12s)]
*  There's some news this morning, the parliamentarian essentially said that a big part of these Medicaid [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=1192.72s)]
*  changes cannot be included in the bill, which means that the Republicans are either going to [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=1197.1999999999998s)]
*  have to say, fuck you parliamentarian and vote to over, overrule them. Or some of these cuts won't [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=1202.7199999999998s)]
*  be included in the bill, which, you know, maybe creates political problems. Is that a good [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=1210.1599999999999s)]
*  assessment? That was a really good explanation. Better than probably what I would have come up [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=1215.28s)]
*  with. But yeah, I mean, basically. So what are the parts that are, that are then now going to be [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=1219.6s)]
*  debated over? Like, yeah, as far as you can tell. So there was a piece last night, a big piece that [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=1226.08s)]
*  got cut out, which was, I'm not even going to try to explain this one. This one revolved like this [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=1231.84s)]
*  is the, I literally, when I wrote about this, I had to put it, I just finally gave up and I put it [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=1236.3999999999999s)]
*  in a footnote because it was so complicated. And the footnote was like, I think broke the record [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=1241.12s)]
*  for longest footnote in the history of bulwark footnotes. All the good stuff is in the footnotes [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=1244.96s)]
*  on the bulwark. Just a little read the footnotes. Yeah. You know, but they're called, I'll just say [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=1250.3999999999999s)]
*  it has something to do with something called cost sharing reductions. And if you really care about [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=1254.4s)]
*  it, just Google it and parliamentarian, you can read all about it, but they've knocked out about 150. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=1259.1200000000001s)]
*  Well, I don't know the exact number because they don't, as always these things, you know, they don't [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=1263.8400000000001s)]
*  say this thing is out and this is how many dollars you lose. Cause it's not always clear. It's one to [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=1268.24s)]
*  one, but you know, it could be like a hundred billion dollars, maybe more. And then this morning [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=1272.16s)]
*  there was a whole list of pieces they knocked out. The single biggest one of which was a change to [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=1278.4s)]
*  something called provider taxes, which is the thing you were referring to a little while ago, [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=1282.88s)]
*  which has to do with how states get money from the federal government and that sort of budget [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=1286.72s)]
*  gimmick they've traditionally used to get a little more. You put those two together, at least, [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=1290.72s)]
*  I spoke to some budget analysts this morning as this was breaking. And their feeling was you've [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=1297.44s)]
*  kind of put those two together. You're looking at somewhere between 250 to $400 billion in cuts that [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=1304.4s)]
*  just got taken off the table. Now, again, you know, what do they do? Do they just overrule the [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=1310.8s)]
*  parliamentarian? I think Trump just like five minutes ago on, uh, we're really, you know, five [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=1317.36s)]
*  minutes before I got on, I think said like, can you believe the parliamentarian? You know, it's the [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=1322.32s)]
*  deep state, whatever. I think Thune, who's the, you know, majority leader in the Senate has already [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=1326.08s)]
*  said we don't want to overrule the parliamentarian. Although they did it once already for something [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4N-LgNbuBc&t=1331.28s)]
