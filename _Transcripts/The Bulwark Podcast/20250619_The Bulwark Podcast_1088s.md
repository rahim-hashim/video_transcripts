# Former US Ambassador on Iranâ€™s Nuclear Threat
**The Bulwark Podcast:** [June 19, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ypGbbe2znE)
*  If we don't act and they're left with that capability, as I said, you know, they're much [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ypGbbe2znE&t=0.0s)]
*  closer to the ability when they decide to build that nuclear weapon and then, you know, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ypGbbe2znE&t=4.8s)]
*  one missile with that warhead, we're talking about a different world. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ypGbbe2znE&t=8.8s)]
*  All right, we are back. He was U.S. ambassador to Israel under President Barack Obama, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ypGbbe2znE&t=20.080000000000002s)]
*  and subsequently President Joe Biden appointed him as special liaison to Israel on the issue [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ypGbbe2znE&t=24.96s)]
*  of Iran. He was also advisor on Middle East issues to the Department of Defense. It's Dan Shapiro. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ypGbbe2znE&t=30.240000000000002s)]
*  How are you doing? Thanks, Sam. Good to be with you. Happy Juneteenth. Happy Juneteenth to you as [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ypGbbe2znE&t=34.96s)]
*  well. I got a DM from you this morning and I was in the market for somebody to fit this bill and so [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ypGbbe2znE&t=39.36s)]
*  it was just fortuitous and you wrote that you have a different take from your friend Ben Rhodes on the [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ypGbbe2znE&t=45.92s)]
*  Iran nuclear negotiations and the pros and cons of military action. And as I said earlier this week, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ypGbbe2znE&t=52.48s)]
*  I'm like, I'm deeply torn about the whole thing and so I was interested to hear your point of view. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ypGbbe2znE&t=58.08s)]
*  So why don't you just take it away? Sure. Thanks. Well, I listened to you and Ben yesterday and Ben's [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ypGbbe2znE&t=63.599999999999994s)]
*  a friend and we've worked together for a long time and we've disagreed on things and when we [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ypGbbe2znE&t=68.08s)]
*  disagree, we argue as friends. But I'd want to just come and share a perspective. Yeah, we were [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ypGbbe2znE&t=72.16s)]
*  both, of course, in the Obama administration when the JCPOA was signed and I was ambassador to Israel [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ypGbbe2znE&t=77.84s)]
*  and you can imagine there was a lot of unhappiness and skepticism in Israel about that agreement. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ypGbbe2znE&t=82.72s)]
*  And I was the ambassador called upon to defend it and I did. And I explained to my Israeli friends, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ypGbbe2znE&t=87.60000000000001s)]
*  you know, it wasn't a perfect deal. It didn't solve everything, but it did buy time. It did extend [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ypGbbe2znE&t=94.80000000000001s)]
*  out Iran's ability to ever achieve a nuclear weapon, keep them at least a year distance from [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ypGbbe2znE&t=99.92s)]
*  that and keep them there for over a decade. And then when Trump withdrew from the agreement in [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ypGbbe2znE&t=105.04s)]
*  2018, I criticized that. I thought that was a mistake. It gave back some of that time. It [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ypGbbe2znE&t=109.28s)]
*  sort of gave a chance for Iran to shorten the distance sooner and it has, and that's kind of [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ypGbbe2znE&t=113.28s)]
*  brought us to this moment. But I do feel like we're sometimes caught in that historical debate, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ypGbbe2znE&t=117.44000000000001s)]
*  the two tribes, you know, pro and con on JCPOA. And I'm just not sure it's as relevant to the [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ypGbbe2znE&t=122.72s)]
*  situation we face now and it's distracting us to some degree from focusing on the outcome that we [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ypGbbe2znE&t=128.0s)]
*  need. And that was the outcome that the president sort of finally took a little time, but landed on [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ypGbbe2znE&t=132.88s)]
*  in the negotiations he was conducting with Iran was that there should be no enrichment. There should [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ypGbbe2znE&t=139.51999999999998s)]
*  be no ability for Iran independently to achieve the president. No, no, I mean, President Trump in [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ypGbbe2znE&t=143.6s)]
*  the negotiations he was conducting, you know, in the last two, three months. So that was what he [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ypGbbe2znE&t=150.88s)]
*  landed on no enrichment. And, you know, the course Iranians hadn't agreed to that. And I don't think [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ypGbbe2znE&t=156.0s)]
*  they were likely to agree to that. And we're probably going to face some crisis point in those [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ypGbbe2znE&t=162.72s)]
*  negotiations maybe a bit later in the year. And the only chance of them coming around to that position [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ypGbbe2znE&t=166.08s)]
*  is if you have diplomacy backed by the credible threat of force. But that I think is the right [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ypGbbe2znE&t=171.76s)]
*  position. And I think, you know, three things have changed since those negotiations a decade ago on [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ypGbbe2znE&t=177.2s)]
*  the JCPOA. And that's one is that just because, and this is partly because of Trump's withdrawal [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ypGbbe2znE&t=183.36s)]
*  from the agreement, the program has advanced. There's just no two ways about it. Everyone [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ypGbbe2znE&t=188.16s)]
*  acknowledges and the International Atomic Energy Agency has confirmed they have about 10 bombs [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ypGbbe2znE&t=191.84s)]
*  worth of 60% enriched uranium, which they could in a very short time, days or weeks turn into weapons [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ypGbbe2znE&t=197.68s)]
*  grade uranium. They've shortened the distance. There's some dispute about exactly in what means, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ypGbbe2znE&t=203.04s)]
*  but it's clearly done research on weaponization, the separate process of building the bomb. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ypGbbe2znE&t=208.08s)]
*  And so the program has advanced and just the time that it would take them to do that as much less. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ypGbbe2znE&t=212.56s)]
*  The second thing is what happened last year. This is when I was serving in the Pentagon. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ypGbbe2znE&t=218.0s)]
*  Twice Iran conducted these overt state to state attacks with barrages of missiles and rockets [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ypGbbe2znE&t=222.48s)]
*  and drones against Israel. You know, in the past, that sort of campaign was conducted through [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ypGbbe2znE&t=230.32s)]
*  proxies and it was sort of deniable what they used to call the shadow war. But now we're talking [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ypGbbe2znE&t=234.48s)]
*  about this open state on state active war of raining really unprecedented numbers of rockets [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ypGbbe2znE&t=239.28s)]
*  and missiles and drones down on Israel. And you just imagine if any one of those had been tipped [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ypGbbe2znE&t=245.44s)]
*  with a nuclear warhead, you know, how risky that is. The third thing I think is just what's changed [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ypGbbe2znE&t=250.72s)]
*  in the psychology in Israel after October 7th. That is that the mindset has shifted and this is [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ypGbbe2znE&t=255.04s)]
*  really across the society. It's not really just about BB, that you can't allow threats that could [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ypGbbe2znE&t=261.52s)]
*  be, you know, to Israel's maybe very distance to mature and come up to the last possible minute [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ypGbbe2znE&t=267.28s)]
*  before you address them. There were huge failures and errors that led, of course, to their vulnerability [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ypGbbe2znE&t=274.32s)]
*  on October 7th. They weren't as prepared as they should have been. And so the position they now [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ypGbbe2znE&t=279.92s)]
*  adopt is that we can't sort of, you know, we've no margin for error. We can't just wait till the last [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ypGbbe2znE&t=286.88s)]
*  minute to address a threat, especially when we're talking about something with as existential [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ypGbbe2znE&t=291.36s)]
*  implications as an Iranian nuclear weapon. And of course, they also see an opening because, [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ypGbbe2znE&t=297.6s)]
*  and I think Ben discussed this yesterday, last October after the second of those Iranian attacks, [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ypGbbe2znE&t=301.84s)]
*  Israelis did go in and they did eliminate the best Iranian air defenses, the S-300s that the Russians [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ypGbbe2znE&t=306.56s)]
*  had provided. So when they saw that vulnerability and they see the maturing of that threat and they [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ypGbbe2znE&t=312.64s)]
*  see the risk that is associated with them carrying out a state-on-state act of war, as they've already [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ypGbbe2znE&t=317.59999999999997s)]
*  done twice, just not going to have that margin of error. And so, you know, that brings us to this [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ypGbbe2znE&t=322.71999999999997s)]
*  point when the negotiations, I wish they had given them a little more time to try to see if they were [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ypGbbe2znE&t=327.67999999999995s)]
*  going to work. I don't really think the Iranians were going to agree to the terms without a threat [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ypGbbe2znE&t=331.68s)]
*  of force, but that's where we are now. Now Israelis have acted, Trump could have given them a red light, [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ypGbbe2znE&t=336.96s)]
*  did not, but now we have some decisions facing us. All right. I want to push on a couple of those [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ypGbbe2znE&t=341.84000000000003s)]
*  different areas. First on the intelligence about the nuclear program. I think you can probably [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ypGbbe2znE&t=346.8s)]
*  understand folks who are not as versed in all this as you, having some boy who cries wolf skepticism [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ypGbbe2znE&t=352.8s)]
*  going towards what happened with the Iraq war and telling us to do that, of course, but also, [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ypGbbe2znE&t=360.96s)]
*  you know, Iran's been on the brink of a weapon for eight, 20 years now. The director of national [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ypGbbe2znE&t=365.36s)]
*  intelligence, who I've no love for, was just three months ago saying that they weren't that close. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ypGbbe2znE&t=371.68s)]
*  And now, just less than three months ago, really. And now just a little bit later, they're saying, [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ypGbbe2znE&t=376.56s)]
*  oh no, like we have to do this right now. How do you respond to that? I think legitimate skepticism. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ypGbbe2znE&t=382.4s)]
*  You'd hear from folks on that this is like an imminent threat. Yeah. Look, I mean, the Iranian [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ypGbbe2znE&t=390.0s)]
*  strategy for years has been to inch forward with this program, not to rush to a breakout. And so [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ypGbbe2znE&t=396.48s)]
*  partly their strategy has been to stay within range so that at the time of their choosing, [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ypGbbe2znE&t=401.28s)]
*  they could break out. And so that means if you're ever warning that they're some distance away, [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ypGbbe2znE&t=405.84s)]
*  but they're making the decision to proceed slowly, but still give themselves that opportunity, [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ypGbbe2znE&t=410.8s)]
*  then, you know, a year passes, two years past, five years pass, and that hasn't happened, [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ypGbbe2znE&t=415.52s)]
*  because, oh, well, see, you were crying wolf. The other thing that's happened, of course, [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ypGbbe2znE&t=418.96s)]
*  over a number of years has been a range of US and Israeli actions that have put time on the clock, [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ypGbbe2znE&t=422.56s)]
*  everything from negotiations to, and the JCPOA is part of that, and sanctions and sabotage and [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ypGbbe2znE&t=429.52s)]
*  covert actions. So there are various ways that we've been able to extend the timeline that have [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ypGbbe2znE&t=436.79999999999995s)]
*  kept them from, you know, the actual moment of truth. I mean, right, some of what I say is drawn [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ypGbbe2znE&t=442.08s)]
*  from information I have access to when I was in government. I, of course, left in January, [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ypGbbe2znE&t=448.0s)]
*  so I don't know the most recent intelligence. But even then, it was pretty clear that there's [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ypGbbe2znE&t=452.16s)]
*  research going on that without a formal decision to build a weapon is bringing them closer to the [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ypGbbe2znE&t=457.76s)]
*  moment, bringing them closer to be able to do that faster, if and when they get that decision from [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ypGbbe2znE&t=464.64s)]
*  the Supreme Leader. That's on the weaponization side. And then on the enrichment side, there's [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ypGbbe2znE&t=469.2s)]
*  no dispute. This is all public and documented by the International Atomic Energy Agency. They've [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ypGbbe2znE&t=474.16s)]
*  accelerated their enrichment of 60% uranium. This was, again, partly a reaction to Trump's withdrawal [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ypGbbe2znE&t=479.84000000000003s)]
*  from the agreement in 2018, but this is where we are. And they now have 10 bombs worth of 60%, [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ypGbbe2znE&t=485.44s)]
*  which within days, they could produce at least one bomb's worth of 90%. That's weapons gray. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ypGbbe2znE&t=492.16s)]
*  And, you know, within a few weeks, multiple bombs worth. So again, to say that there's a decision, [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ypGbbe2znE&t=496.64000000000004s)]
*  no, one can't say they've made that decision, but one can say they've significantly shortened [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ypGbbe2znE&t=503.68s)]
*  the time that it would take them to do it if they make the decision. And that's where this [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ypGbbe2znE&t=507.68s)]
*  do you have the margin of error question comes in. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ypGbbe2znE&t=511.04s)]
*  Pete Okay. So, the other thing I think has people worried or concerned is the chatter around this [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ypGbbe2znE&t=513.52s)]
*  offensive action from Israel, in part because of the success of it, which is, which I've mentioned [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ypGbbe2znE&t=523.12s)]
*  several times, it's really kind of astonishing how successful Mossad and Israel IDF has been [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ypGbbe2znE&t=529.12s)]
*  both with Hezbollah and this action. But the result of that success has been there's a lot [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ypGbbe2znE&t=533.68s)]
*  of chatter of like, ooh, like, maybe we can get rid of the molas altogether, right? Like, you know, [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ypGbbe2znE&t=538.4799999999999s)]
*  and there's been, I think it seems like a notion that this is not just like an effort to bomb the [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ypGbbe2znE&t=544.8s)]
*  nuclear facilities, but maybe an effort towards regime change altogether. And that gets people [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ypGbbe2znE&t=552.9599999999999s)]
*  leery, given our recent experience. What would you say to that? [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ypGbbe2znE&t=559.92s)]
*  Mark Svoboda Sure, look, so far, at least, the Israelis have not declared [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ypGbbe2znE&t=563.2s)]
*  regime change to be the goal of the operation. They said it's to prevent the nuclear breakout [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ypGbbe2znE&t=566.72s)]
*  possibility and also the ballistic missiles, which of course Iran is using to attack Israel [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ypGbbe2znE&t=571.6s)]
*  every night. In fact, I think there was a very tough blow against the hospital in southern Israel [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ypGbbe2znE&t=577.12s)]
*  today from one of those ballistic missiles. They've killed about 24 people, you know, [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ypGbbe2znE&t=582.08s)]
*  injured hundreds and the like. So, that's what Israel says their objective is. I don't think [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ypGbbe2znE&t=585.6800000000001s)]
*  regime change should be the objective of this operation, whether it remains purely Israeli or [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ypGbbe2znE&t=592.0s)]
*  whether the United States gets involved. And certainly, you know, I'm not talking to anything [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ypGbbe2znE&t=597.04s)]
*  like what happened in Iraq and Afghanistan 20 years ago, we're not putting boots on the ground, [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ypGbbe2znE&t=601.52s)]
*  we're not marching into Tehran. That's not the case. We should keep the focus and keep on the [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ypGbbe2znE&t=605.44s)]
*  outcome we need, which is to ensure they don't have that ability to create a nuclear weapon. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ypGbbe2znE&t=612.24s)]
*  Now, of course, I'll say, obviously, the regime is a terrible regime, mostly to its own people. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ypGbbe2znE&t=616.08s)]
*  It's brutal, it's corrupt, it's mismanaged the economy and the electricity and water and [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ypGbbe2znE&t=622.0s)]
*  in every other way, they have squandered the resources of the Iranian people, not on making [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ypGbbe2znE&t=627.92s)]
*  their lives better and more prosperous, but on pursuing these ideological crusades around the [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ypGbbe2znE&t=632.48s)]
*  region, mostly against Israel, against us. There's a lot of Iranian, Israeli, Arab, European blood on [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ypGbbe2znE&t=636.8s)]
*  the hands of this regime. And so, no one will shed any tears or should when it leaves. But that's a [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ypGbbe2znE&t=644.0s)]
*  decision for the Iranian people and they'll have to make that decision. Now, there may be a [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ypGbbe2znE&t=648.96s)]
*  tipping point when the regime looks weak. Certain institutions have been rendered less capable or [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ypGbbe2znE&t=653.36s)]
*  wobbled because of some of this operation. And again, that might trigger some internal processes, [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ypGbbe2znE&t=659.9200000000001s)]
*  but nobody knows. Nobody knows when that regime, those regime fissures will appear if there's some [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ypGbbe2znE&t=665.6s)]
*  organized opposition. So that's not really the goal. It shouldn't be the goal. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ypGbbe2znE&t=670.96s)]
*  Yeah, I have no love for the regime either, but on the BB side of this, I think there's good [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ypGbbe2znE&t=675.0400000000001s)]
*  reason to not maybe believe that the goal of this operation is just the nuclear regime. I mean, he [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ypGbbe2znE&t=679.76s)]
*  was on Fox the other day saying that this operation could certainly result in a regime as the government [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ypGbbe2znE&t=685.0400000000001s)]
*  around is very weak. They shoot women because their hair is uncovered. They shoot students. They suck [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ypGbbe2znE&t=690.8000000000001s)]
*  the oxygen out from these brave and gifted people, the Iranian people. The decision to act to rise up [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ypGbbe2znE&t=695.44s)]
*  this time is the decision of the Iranian people. And I agree with every word of that. But coming [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ypGbbe2znE&t=700.0s)]
*  from the person that is executing a bombing campaign, to me, that means that seems to me [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ypGbbe2znE&t=708.0s)]
*  that he is saying that he wants to make that happen militarily, or at least is open to that [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ypGbbe2znE&t=714.08s)]
*  being the end game of this. And I don't know. I think that gives an aspirational notion. I [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ypGbbe2znE&t=720.16s)]
*  agree with it. But then we get into a kind of a debate if it's really what the real mission is of [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ypGbbe2znE&t=725.68s)]
*  the campaign. Yeah, look, I've got no illusions about BB. I've worked with him and we've had our [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ypGbbe2znE&t=731.3599999999999s)]
*  many differences over the years. I think he is speaking aspirationally there. That is, again, [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ypGbbe2znE&t=737.04s)]
*  something, an aspiration I share. Sounds like you do too. An awful lot of Iranian people feel that [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ypGbbe2znE&t=743.52s)]
*  way as well. He's not necessarily the best spokesperson for that, not somebody who I think [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ypGbbe2znE&t=749.1999999999999s)]
*  is going to be the one to draw Iranians out into the street. So if I were advising him, I'd say, [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ypGbbe2znE&t=753.12s)]
*  tone it down, chill it out. But I still don't see it as the military objective of the campaign. I [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ypGbbe2znE&t=756.96s)]
*  still see that focused on the nuclear and the missile threats. The other thing that I talked [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ypGbbe2znE&t=762.16s)]
*  about, I'm just interested in your take on is I just, part of like in these discussions, [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ypGbbe2znE&t=766.24s)]
*  I'm just filled with a deep uncertainty. And it makes me nervous that I feel like [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ypGbbe2znE&t=772.64s)]
*  there are a lot of people that in government and then who are advocates on both sides of this, [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ypGbbe2znE&t=778.88s)]
*  who have like utter certainty, like utter certainty that Iran must be taken out to protect Israel or [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ypGbbe2znE&t=784.72s)]
*  utter certainty that Israel must not do anything, you know, because it will lead to catastrophe. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ypGbbe2znE&t=790.48s)]
*  And I think that that is blinding, right? Like when you have that, we are talking about this [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ypGbbe2znE&t=795.92s)]
*  with McKinnon in the first segment, there's like Iraq looked really great for six weeks. And that [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ypGbbe2znE&t=799.6s)]
*  led to a hubris, I think about like what was achievable. And I worry about that here. I worry [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ypGbbe2znE&t=805.4399999999999s)]
*  about the fact that like, like it's the one issue where my inbox is most filled with people are 100% [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ypGbbe2znE&t=811.04s)]
*  damn certain on one way or the other that we should do this. And like that worries when you have BB [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ypGbbe2znE&t=816.56s)]
*  and Trump and folks who could be a little reckless, right? That things can spiral out of control. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ypGbbe2znE&t=821.5999999999999s)]
*  Does that not, I mean, because who the hell knows, right? I don't know. Like actions like this might, [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ypGbbe2znE&t=827.1999999999999s)]
*  like actions like this might, might yield freedom for the Iranian people. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ypGbbe2znE&t=831.84s)]
*  It might yield a backlash that's hard to predict. What do you, what do you say to that? [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ypGbbe2znE&t=837.6s)]
*  Scott Gottlieb Oh, first of all, I'd say you're right that nobody who projects [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ypGbbe2znE&t=842.4s)]
*  certainty about how any of this is going to unfold should be believed that they know. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ypGbbe2znE&t=846.96s)]
*  And that's part of this kind of frustration I have with the sort of tribal debate about the pros and [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ypGbbe2znE&t=851.2800000000001s)]
*  cons of the JCPOA. I just think we should focus really carefully on what the objectives should be [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ypGbbe2znE&t=854.96s)]
*  from here. And, and you're right. The uncertainty goes both ways, right? If we don't act and they're [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ypGbbe2znE&t=860.64s)]
*  left with that capability, as I said, you know, they're much closer to the ability when they [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ypGbbe2znE&t=866.64s)]
*  decide to build that nuclear weapon. And then, you know, one missile with a, with that warhead, [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ypGbbe2znE&t=870.56s)]
*  we're talking about a different world. If we do act, yes, there's always risk when you take military [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ypGbbe2znE&t=875.1999999999999s)]
*  action. And so this has to be done thoughtfully and carefully. And yes, Donald Trump is not the [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ypGbbe2znE&t=880.56s)]
*  commander in chief, I would have chosen for judiciousness and care and wisdom and how he [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ypGbbe2znE&t=884.4s)]
*  approaches this. And I don't, I can't stand the kind of reckless tweets and, you know, [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ypGbbe2znE&t=890.16s)]
*  sort of thinking out loud and all of his impulses. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ypGbbe2znE&t=896.0s)]
*  Pete Slauson You don't think that the threats to assassinate the Ayatollah, [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ypGbbe2znE&t=898.24s)]
*  the threats to assassinate the Ayatollah in social media? [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ypGbbe2znE&t=901.6s)]
*  David Sinclair Elective Tehran, assassinate the Ayatollah, [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ypGbbe2znE&t=904.0s)]
*  you know, all of those, unconditional surrender in all caps, right? This is not helpful. So, [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ypGbbe2znE&t=905.68s)]
*  you know, I'm hoping, of course, that judicial decisions are ultimately made. I know the military [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ypGbbe2znE&t=912.88s)]
*  who are advising him, the CENTCOM commander, General Eric Carillo and the team, and they're [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ypGbbe2znE&t=917.2s)]
*  very, very smart and careful and thoughtful and they mitigate risk. So, I just think we should be [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ypGbbe2znE&t=921.84s)]
*  thoughtful about it. And actually, there's still an opening for diplomacy here. And it should be [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ypGbbe2znE&t=926.8000000000001s)]
*  cohorts of diplomacy, right? It's clear the president is considering this strike. He's [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ypGbbe2znE&t=931.44s)]
*  putting in place the forces that would be necessary. He's moved a second carrier into [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ypGbbe2znE&t=935.9200000000001s)]
*  the region and tankers and fighters, and then the bombers that would come in at the end would [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ypGbbe2znE&t=939.44s)]
*  actually execute it. But then you have the rest necessary for defense on any blowback. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ypGbbe2znE&t=943.76s)]
*  And there's risk. And you have to message carefully to the Iranians that if they were [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ypGbbe2znE&t=948.56s)]
*  to respond, especially against U.S. forces, they would pay a very dear price for that and try to [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ypGbbe2znE&t=952.8s)]
*  use that as deterrence. There's risk of escalation. There's also the ability sometimes to use that [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ypGbbe2znE&t=957.28s)]
*  risk of escalation to actually find a de-escalatory path. But that's what's all on the table now. And [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ypGbbe2znE&t=962.64s)]
*  that's an opening actually for the Iranians to come to the table. In fact, the foreign minister [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ypGbbe2znE&t=970.4s)]
*  of Iran is meeting with the European foreign ministers, the British and French and German [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ypGbbe2znE&t=974.72s)]
*  tomorrow in Geneva. That may be an opening for him to give the concession they wouldn't give in the [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ypGbbe2znE&t=979.04s)]
*  talks before, which is, all right, we're going to give up this enrichment program. And that would [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ypGbbe2znE&t=984.3199999999999s)]
*  spare everybody having to go through this. That would be the best outcome. But if they don't, [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ypGbbe2znE&t=988.88s)]
*  then there's the question of who can actually deal with this militarily. The Israelis, by the way, [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ypGbbe2znE&t=994.64s)]
*  may have solutions to Fordow, the underground facility that we don't fully know about. They've [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ypGbbe2znE&t=998.8s)]
*  shown a lot of ingenuity and creativity with pagers against Hezbollah and commandos and smuggling [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ypGbbe2znE&t=1004.3199999999999s)]
*  drones in. We know what they're capable of, so they may have surprises up their sleeve. But if [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ypGbbe2znE&t=1010.64s)]
*  it requires a U.S. action with our unique capabilities to get that underground site, to make [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ypGbbe2znE&t=1014.64s)]
*  sure that they don't have that enrichment capability, it has to be on the table. And so the [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ypGbbe2znE&t=1020.0s)]
*  president's given himself that option. I just don't think he's made the decision yet. All right. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ypGbbe2znE&t=1024.24s)]
*  Anything I didn't ask you, you wanted to mention? Listen, this is tough and nobody, as you said, [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ypGbbe2znE&t=1027.52s)]
*  should feel that this was a good situation or confident about outcomes. But I do want to get [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ypGbbe2znE&t=1035.36s)]
*  the outcome right. The outcome is Iran with no ability to have a nuclear weapon. So that's the [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ypGbbe2znE&t=1041.2s)]
*  moment we're in. All right. Ambassador Dan Shapiro, man, thank you so much for reaching out and for [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ypGbbe2znE&t=1047.12s)]
*  listening to the show. And let's stay in touch as this stuff develops. All right. Thanks, Tim. Love [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ypGbbe2znE&t=1052.08s)]
*  to take care. All right. Everybody else. We'll see you back tomorrow. We got a good one coming, [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ypGbbe2znE&t=1055.52s)]
*  so make sure to tune in. Peace. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ypGbbe2znE&t=1059.6s)]
