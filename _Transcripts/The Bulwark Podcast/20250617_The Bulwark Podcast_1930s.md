# Hegseth’s DOD Is a VEEP-Style Cluster-F! (w/ Kerry Howley)
**The Bulwark Podcast:** [June 17, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0)
*  These aren't people who know what to do. They don't know how to run the building. They don't know, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=0.0s)]
*  you know, even where to search for answers. And so you just have people kind of making it up along [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=7.2s)]
*  the way. Hey, y'all, a few scheduling notes. And I want to talk a little bit about what we are seeing [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=14.72s)]
*  in the Middle East right now. So for this podcast, we've got Carrie Howley, who did an awesome, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=28.48s)]
*  fucking depressing, scary, funny profile on what is happening in the Department of Defense. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=35.84s)]
*  We taped an interview last night. And so the, I guess the issues that she raised became a little [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=42.08s)]
*  more acute. Now that the US might be involved in a military action in Iran. And so do stick around [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=48.88s)]
*  for that. But, you know, I didn't ask her about Iran, because we taped it kind of before the [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=57.2s)]
*  latest upheaval, or the latest moves from the White House that we saw last night. And so I do want [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=65.2s)]
*  to talk about that a little bit since I didn't really get into it with either guest. For folks, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=72.4s)]
*  you know, folks haven't thought of closely the quick timeline rundown is Trump essentially sends [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=77.28s)]
*  a bleat saying that the people of Tehran should flee the city. Implying that a attack on the city [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=82.96s)]
*  was coming. He did that. And then he left the G7 early. He's at the G7. There's some debate about [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=94.08s)]
*  whether he left the G7 early because Mark Carney cucked him during the press conference or because [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=101.91999999999999s)]
*  was related to the potential military action in Iran. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=107.12s)]
*  There were reports of the National Security Council was gathering. There's a lot of scuttlebutt [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=111.68s)]
*  last night that kind of made it seem like maybe an attack on Iran from America from us was imminent. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=115.12s)]
*  That did not come to pass. This morning, Trump did a gaggle where, you know, he basically kind of [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=121.60000000000001s)]
*  indicated he doesn't want to ceasefire. He wants an end to the situation. He kind of left that vague. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=129.76s)]
*  He also said that he's not too much in a mood to negotiate now. That's great. The Donald Trump's [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=135.68s)]
*  moods and whims are going to impact the future of the Middle East and impact our foreign policy. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=142.72s)]
*  So he also said he's not calling Tim Walz during that gaggle because he's a fucking child. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=150.8s)]
*  Following obviously the assassination in Minnesota. So that's kind of where we're at. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=156.96s)]
*  I want to just, in the spirit of the podcast and of my desire to be radically candid with you guys, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=163.12s)]
*  always, this doesn't really make good podcast, what I'm about to say, but it is honest. And that is, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=171.44s)]
*  I got no fucking idea what I think about what is happening with what goes to Israel and Iran [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=177.6s)]
*  and our potential involvement. I guess there's one thing I do know. I wish that a genocidal maniac [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=185.04s)]
*  was not leading Iran and that a corrupt, just kind of indiscriminate Prime Minister was leading [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=191.04000000000002s)]
*  Israel and that a fucking moron was leading our country. I wish that we had some very stable [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=203.36s)]
*  geniuses, to borrow the phrase, leading the relevant countries here. That would make me [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=210.08s)]
*  feel a lot better. I don't have any really faith or confidence in any of the Prime decision makers [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=214.96s)]
*  involved right now. And so I think that we're in a very precarious and scary moment with some unhinged [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=222.32000000000002s)]
*  people having their fingers on the button, so to speak. So I don't love that. And that obviously [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=229.04000000000002s)]
*  informs my concerns about what might happen. As I mentioned yesterday with Bill and on several [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=239.04s)]
*  podcasts, Israel's actions, both with regards to Hezbollah and Iran, less so in Gaza, have been [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=247.28s)]
*  extremely impressive. And there's something to be said for that. So obviously, the external facing [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=254.23999999999998s)]
*  elements of the Israeli military, you just have to recognize what has happened has been much [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=261.12s)]
*  more effective to date than I think a lot of watchers would have told you a couple months ago. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=268.88s)]
*  So you have all those kind of data points that you're thinking about. And look, as I said to Bill [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=275.68s)]
*  yesterday, I wish for freedom for the Iranian people. I get frustrated sometimes with some of [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=281.12s)]
*  our left friends who simultaneously hold the view that when there are missiles or there's attacks [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=288.79999999999995s)]
*  on Iran, they say, well, you can't hold the Iranian people accountable for their horrible [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=297.12s)]
*  government. I agree with that. I don't want any civilians to die. At the same time, we shouldn't [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=301.36s)]
*  also condemn them to having to live under a horrible government for eternity. So, you know, [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=308.4s)]
*  that's a view that I have long held that hasn't changed. Obviously, our failures to [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=317.04s)]
*  affect positive change in the Middle East over my lifetime informs my views that there's limitations [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=326.72s)]
*  on what we can and should do, of course, and that we should be skeptical of our ability to affect [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=334.24s)]
*  change. That said, we can still hope for change and want change and be curious about whether [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=341.12s)]
*  something, whether this might be a positive inflection point. I don't know. Nobody would [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=349.44s)]
*  have predicted that Assad would fall in three days a couple months ago. I don't think anybody [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=354.24s)]
*  predicted the scale of the Hamas attack on Israel on October 7th. Nobody predicted how [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=359.76s)]
*  brave and successful Ukraine would be in rebuffing the Russian attacks. We're just not as good at [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=368.56s)]
*  predicting these things as we think. A lot of people on this issue in particular have very strong, [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=376.08s)]
*  very strong strident views on one side or the other, which does make for good podcasts, but [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=381.52s)]
*  which I don't think is evidenced by any actual facts or any actual ability to see into the future, [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=387.03999999999996s)]
*  to look into a crystal ball and to do so effectively. I think we've just seen a lot of [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=397.12s)]
*  different strategies and policies employed in place in the Middle East, and all of them have [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=402.08000000000004s)]
*  failed basically in my lifetime. Just to be clear, I'm not at all intrigued by the concept of the U.S. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=407.20000000000005s)]
*  going to war with Iran and getting deeply involved in a regime change war in Iran. I think that [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=416.0s)]
*  does not make a lot of sense for us, and we have a pretty bad track record on that front. But [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=423.12s)]
*  for Israel, to take out the state sponsor of terror that has brought about so much death and [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=433.52000000000004s)]
*  destruction in Israel, across the Middle East, across the world, for them to be able to do this [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=445.76s)]
*  with precision strikes and to have some level of support from us, I do think that is a different [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=453.76s)]
*  kind of picture. How it turns out, I don't think anybody knows. Let me just say one more thing, [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=463.52s)]
*  about not just the people of Iran, but the people of Israel. People of Israel deserve [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=470.56s)]
*  safety and security, and everybody throughout the region. That has not been the case, though, [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=474.64s)]
*  for the people of Israel. They've been under missile attack and terrorist attack from Hezbollah [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=480.4s)]
*  and Hamas and from Iran and from proxies that Iran has funded for a long time. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=484.47999999999996s)]
*  As I look now, 20 years into the future, and you think, okay, well, what could have happened [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=491.84s)]
*  after this inflection point? Might it be the case that this was a moment of change for Iran [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=496.4s)]
*  and the Iranian people? And that this state sponsor of terror that has caused so much [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=502.72s)]
*  fucking death and destruction over the course of the Middle East might crumble? And that we [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=508.08000000000004s)]
*  might look back on it and think, wow, like that was a moment that allowed for a period of peace [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=511.84000000000003s)]
*  that we didn't have before. Do I think that's likely? No. Is that possible? Yeah, sure, [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=519.6s)]
*  that's possible. Good things can happen, believe it or not. It's happened before. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=526.5600000000001s)]
*  Is it possible that you look back at this moment and Bibi's actions and America's actions, [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=530.48s)]
*  who the fuck knows what Donald Trump does in the next 48 hours or further? And thank God, [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=540.16s)]
*  the next fucking bin Laden emerged out of this moment, and they figured out an AI nuke to go [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=546.48s)]
*  after Tel Aviv with. Like, yeah, I don't, I literally anything could happen as it is a very [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=554.88s)]
*  unstable situation. A lot of unstable leaders with deep hatreds, deep resentments. And the reality [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=559.68s)]
*  is, I think that there are a lot of potential ways that it can go. And I think that there are [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=568.56s)]
*  a lot of things happening domestically in America where I'm very clear eyed on it. And I think the [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=572.4s)]
*  picture in this case is pretty murky. So the way I wanted to handle that with regards to this podcast [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=577.12s)]
*  is I'm gonna have people on that have a variety of different views, probably opposite views [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=583.12s)]
*  on this. Particularly if the war escalates, maybe cooler heads will prevail. I don't know. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=586.64s)]
*  We will see. But if it does, we'll be monitoring it and talking about it and getting different [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=593.04s)]
*  views. We will be continue to be clear eyed about the fucking lunacy and the lunatic in charge of [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=601.28s)]
*  our government and be skeptical of essentially anything that is coming out of this White House. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=611.2s)]
*  And we'll see how it all shakes up. So I hope you stick around with me on that ride. We've got [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=621.36s)]
*  Kerry Howley with the Veep style clusterfuck that is our Pentagon. And wow, what a great time to [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=628.72s)]
*  have a Veep style clusterfuck at the Pentagon. Hello and welcome to the Bollard podcast. I'm [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=640.16s)]
*  your host Tim Miller. Delighted to welcome a features writer at New York Magazine. Her latest [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=649.36s)]
*  deeply reported Darkly comic, I think, take out is titled Pete Hegseth is playing secretary. She's [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=654.64s)]
*  also the author of a book about reality winner bottoms up and the devil laughs a journey through [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=660.7199999999999s)]
*  the deep state. It's Kerry Howley. How you doing girl? I'm great. How are you? [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=664.9599999999999s)]
*  Pete Hegseth I'm doing pretty well, all things considered. I mean, I was I just [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=668.32s)]
*  devoured the Pete Hegseth story, which what which had I mean, how many sources do you have? And [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=674.4000000000001s)]
*  you're talking to all the fired people and a bunch of other folks. And so [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=680.4000000000001s)]
*  Kerry Howley Over a dozen is what we're saying. So yeah, I'm very surprised by the response. As [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=684.1600000000001s)]
*  I was reading it, I thought there are so many white men in the story. There's no way anyone is [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=691.7600000000001s)]
*  going to be able to keep track of them. This was exactly what I wanted to start. So I'm glad that [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=697.92s)]
*  you mentioned that because I almost had to create a cheat sheet for myself. So let's just do it here [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=702.64s)]
*  for everybody. We've got Joe Casper. We're just gonna do a character breakdown at the start. Joe [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=707.8399999999999s)]
*  Casper is the was the man that was the chief of staff at the start. He's the former chief of staff. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=713.5999999999999s)]
*  Pete Hegseth chief of staff. Yeah, but he was most notable for this sentence in the story. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=719.76s)]
*  Um, you know who else is hard to follow? Elon Musk, but you but would you say he doesn't have [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=724.0s)]
*  creative elements of opportunity to incite and excite you? Yeah, Joe Casper. He had been press [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=730.88s)]
*  liaison for Duncan Hunter Jr. disgraced congressperson who a big vape enthusiast, [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=737.52s)]
*  sentenced to 11 months in jail, but then pardoned by Trump. Anyway, this is a guy [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=744.08s)]
*  um, who has some experience in politics, um, is an extreme extrovert and someone who Hegseth really [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=747.92s)]
*  connects with. Okay, so that's Joe Casper. Then we had the three fired people, Dan Caldwell, [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=756.56s)]
*  Darren Selnick, and Colin Carroll. And these are all former senior advisors. Okay, and then we had, [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=762.0799999999999s)]
*  this is he isn't really in your story, but I might mention there's a guy named John Olyott, [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=769.28s)]
*  who is a press advisor to Hegseth and then wrote that political article about how he's a disaster [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=773.12s)]
*  and Trump should replace him even though they're old friends. Oh yes, it was called the month from [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=778.56s)]
*  hell. Okay, and then there's a mysterious man with a cane. Did we ever identify him? We don't identify [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=782.56s)]
*  the man from the cane. We just know that he requires a cane because he injured his leg, [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=788.56s)]
*  pulling people to safety on 9-11 from the Pentagon. We appreciate his service. Okay, [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=793.4399999999999s)]
*  so there we go. So I just wanted to set the table there. Joe Casper did not get fired, [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=798.8s)]
*  but he left. Caldwell, Selnick, and Carroll were the fired. And essentially the story [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=803.12s)]
*  like takes us through like the most insane workplace that you could possibly imagine. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=809.52s)]
*  There's paranoia, there's elements of the office in it, and it's kind of how Pete Hegseth ended up [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=816.8s)]
*  getting rid of a bunch of his close advisors because he thought that they were leaking [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=823.8399999999999s)]
*  against him, I guess. Is that the best way to summarize it? Yeah, I mean, I think it's a [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=827.52s)]
*  workplace in which everyone straight up all the way to the top is constantly feeling paranoid [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=830.88s)]
*  about the possibility of being dismissed, of being fired. And this story centers on these three top [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=837.12s)]
*  advisors, two of whom were very close friends of Pete Hegseth. I mean, decade-long friends, [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=845.52s)]
*  professional friendships, personal friendships who were targeted in a kind of botched leak [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=849.76s)]
*  investigation and ended up being unceremoniously escorted out of the Pentagon and then badmouthed [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=854.8s)]
*  by Pete Hegseth on, I think it was Fox and Friends, and also at the Easter egg roll. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=861.92s)]
*  It's tough to catch strays at the Easter egg roll. And so they were escorted out by the man [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=868.7199999999999s)]
*  with the cane. And the interesting thing about all this is to your point, Pete is in over his head, [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=874.0799999999999s)]
*  which is kind of, I guess, the premise of all of this. He goes in there and you would think that [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=880.56s)]
*  if you had a weekend talk show co-host becoming the leader of the military, they would want to [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=886.0799999999999s)]
*  bring in reliable advisors and people who know their way around. And so he does this and he [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=891.76s)]
*  brings at least loyal advisors, longtime friends, and then immediately cans them like an imaginary [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=899.1999999999999s)]
*  leak investigation, I guess. I think the hope of a lot of people [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=906.32s)]
*  is that Pete Hegseth would kind of acknowledge the limits of his capacities and surround himself [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=911.2s)]
*  with people who had deeper knowledge bases or, as one source put it, the patience to learn the [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=917.84s)]
*  details. He did that initially at to some level, but he seemed to believe a rumor he heard that [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=923.6800000000001s)]
*  there was evidence that in particular, Dan Caldwell had leaked information about military [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=934.48s)]
*  plans in Panama. There's no indication that this evidence exists, but he took that to be true and [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=943.76s)]
*  then basically implied that on national television. And it led to these three men being ejected from [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=951.6800000000001s)]
*  the building. In the case of Carroll, he took a phone call from a reporter? [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=960.56s)]
*  So yeah, Colin Carroll had taken a phone call from Daniel Lippman at Politico. This phone call was [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=964.9599999999999s)]
*  about the possibility that there was an inspector general report into Joe Casper. And Colin Carroll, [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=972.9599999999999s)]
*  he just told the press liaison, Sean Parnell, he said to email and said, hey, I got this call. I [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=979.8399999999999s)]
*  said no comment. And then in a conversation with Dropsite, which is Ryan Grim's website, [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=986.16s)]
*  Joe Casper indicated that he found this suspicious. Why does Politico have Colin Carroll's phone [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=993.28s)]
*  number? But it was actually easily explained. They had his phone number because they'd written a [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=999.52s)]
*  piece on him a week previously or something like that. Yeah. Why does Dropsite have Joe Casper's [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=1003.1999999999999s)]
*  phone number? That'd be another interesting... Yeah, there's layers upon layers here. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=1009.28s)]
*  When you're reading the whole thing, it truly feels like the military is being run by somebody [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=1016.16s)]
*  that is not just unprepared and unqualified for the job. And it's not just a total disaster in [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=1021.8399999999999s)]
*  his personal life. But also, the paranoia is an extreme. It is at a level that it feels like is [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=1028.3999999999999s)]
*  unmanageable and prevents him from being able to manage the department. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=1035.68s)]
*  I mean, it's interesting because it's clearly his instinct when faced with any kind of conflict [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=1039.52s)]
*  to cast the media as the enemy. The media is against me. Russian hoaxsters, hoaxsters, [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=1046.16s)]
*  hoaxsters, like Russia hoax. And to his detriment, because he doesn't have good crisis management, [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=1051.28s)]
*  he's constantly just throwing it back on the media. And yet so many people in his office, [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=1059.28s)]
*  close advisors seem to have a very different relationship to the media because there are a [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=1065.1200000000001s)]
*  ton of leaks coming out of that office. And it creates the situation where many people [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=1069.68s)]
*  say he's just spending an inordinate amount of his time with this paranoia about leaks. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=1075.84s)]
*  And he's so worried about it that he's also not sharing information with people who need [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=1081.1999999999998s)]
*  information. And he's making his circle smaller. And it's a strange circle, right? It involves [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=1085.4399999999998s)]
*  his wife, his brother, his personal lawyer. Whether this troubles you depends on whether you want [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=1091.6s)]
*  an effective DOD under Donald Trump, right? It's not necessarily the worst outcome. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=1098.56s)]
*  You might have a clown show DOD that throws a $45 million military parade that looks less [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=1110.8s)]
*  professional than what the North Koreans do, for example. That would be one thing. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=1117.28s)]
*  So just one other thing on the link, because this was going around, there were two little anecdotes [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=1122.72s)]
*  where he was threatening with polygraphs. He was threatening to polygraph his own staff in one case. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=1126.56s)]
*  And also maybe there was some discussion that there was a wiretap that they had been tapping [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=1134.48s)]
*  the staff. What did you kind of find out on either of those points? [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=1140.32s)]
*  I mean, at first the story, they kick Dan Caldwell out of the Pentagon as the man with the cane who [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=1144.3999999999999s)]
*  leads him out. It's a slow walk. And then there are press reports that there's evidence on his [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=1151.12s)]
*  personal phone that there's photographic evidence that he leaked the Panama stuff. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=1158.32s)]
*  And so now there's a new rumor that there was a wiretap on his phone. Some people [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=1166.8s)]
*  allege that Tim Parlator, Pete Hegseth's personal lawyer, cooked up this story and told it to a [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=1171.36s)]
*  bunch of people in the DOD. And so the White House is like, wait, his phone's being wiretapped? [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=1178.16s)]
*  That's like an incredibly big deal. That's extremely illegal. That's a much bigger deal [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=1184.3200000000002s)]
*  than the leak that you're talking about. And then people stop telling that story. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=1188.88s)]
*  Like it disappears. As I'm writing this, I'm wondering, what is an investigation? [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=1192.8000000000002s)]
*  Right? Like what are the bounds of that word? Because it seems like we're dealing with many [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=1198.0s)]
*  rumors of an investigation and somewhere else there is a real leak investigation happening. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=1202.0s)]
*  But this isn't it. This is interpersonal warfare in the front office of the DOD. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=1207.68s)]
*  Right. We're trying to scare people essentially. We're trying to threaten them by saying, [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=1215.1200000000001s)]
*  you're going to get polygraphed. We might tap your phones. But like when the reality is they [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=1218.3200000000002s)]
*  can't tie their shoes, like they don't know how to polygraph people or tap people's phones. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=1223.6000000000001s)]
*  Right. I mean, Colin Carroll, one of the ousted men, has a quote in the piece that's like, [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=1228.48s)]
*  these aren't people who know what to do. They don't know how to run the building and they don't [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=1234.32s)]
*  know even where to search for answers. And so you just have people kind of [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=1242.32s)]
*  making it up along the way. And this happened in a very public way with this quote unquote [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=1249.44s)]
*  leak investigation. So you talked to these three guys that were ousted, [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=1254.4s)]
*  who I assume, despite the fact that they're smeared by the Secretary of Defense, have some [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=1260.8000000000002s)]
*  sympathies still with either Pete himself or at least MAGA or Trump. Is there any version of [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=1265.92s)]
*  events that they offer that tells a story that might make you think that people know what they're [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=1272.4s)]
*  doing? I mean, most of the sources to whom I spoke are in sympathy with what they call the [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=1278.4s)]
*  president's agenda. Right. And one source used the word heartbreaking to describe [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=1286.48s)]
*  watching Hegseth kind of tie himself in knots on Fox and Friends. I mean, the defensiveness, [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=1292.72s)]
*  the sense of panic you can feel behind his words, that nervous energy. I mean, I think these are [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=1300.6399999999999s)]
*  people who wanted Hegseth to succeed, but increasingly see that that is impossible. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=1306.08s)]
*  Are there any people around him that seem qualified to be top of the [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=1313.44s)]
*  ranks? Like, do there remain any people around him or qualified? And or are there any women [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=1320.56s)]
*  in the building? Or is it besides his wife? He's fired a number of women. You know, I haven't done [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=1325.6s)]
*  a deep dive into everyone in the front office, but I think what we can see from this episode [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=1335.04s)]
*  is that he really has trouble sifting good information from bad, knowing who to trust. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=1340.8799999999999s)]
*  And so that problem doesn't go away, even if there are some good people there. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=1346.56s)]
*  Yeah. The other thing that you wrote about was that kind of after Hegseth gate or after Signal [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=1350.6399999999999s)]
*  gate, rather, like he started to act different. Yeah. Talk about that a little bit. So this is [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=1356.72s)]
*  something that many sources want us to talk about that after Signal gate, there was a market change, [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=1362.96s)]
*  more paranoid, less likely to be clean shaven in the morning, like more slamming of doors, [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=1372.64s)]
*  just a kind of a fearfulness had set in. And remember, remember many of these people [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=1378.56s)]
*  came into the building, hoping for big changes. They were like, this is a completely different [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=1384.0s)]
*  administration and things are going to run differently now. And so there's a disappointment, [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=1390.56s)]
*  I think, that instead of seeing those big changes, what they're seeing is Hegseth just waiting for [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=1396.0s)]
*  executive orders. Like he's so frightened of displeasing Trump. One source said the building [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=1401.6799999999998s)]
*  had ceased to be creative. Like it's just a mechanism for, you know, whatever Trump tweets [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=1408.72s)]
*  or whatever that day for making that happen. Right. And so what does Hegseth feel comfortable [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=1415.52s)]
*  doing under these circumstances? He feels very comfortable talking about how the DOD used to be [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=1422.16s)]
*  so woke, but that's changing. Right. So there's a lot of talk about expunging trans service members. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=1428.72s)]
*  Yeah. We're getting Harvey Milk's name off the belt. That's the same thing to do. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=1436.72s)]
*  Right. And so I think this is frustrating to people who are interested in the day-to-day [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=1438.96s)]
*  business of the DOD. They're like, we already did that. That was an executive order. We took care of [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=1448.24s)]
*  it. Why are we still talking about it? But you have, you know, obviously Hegseth is media trained [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=1454.08s)]
*  and he knows that that hits. He knows he gets a good response from that. And so this is for him [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=1460.32s)]
*  a comfortable place to retreat to, but he's not making any of those big changes that other people [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=1465.28s)]
*  were hoping for. This gets a little bit outside the scope of your story, but like, it's just worth [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=1470.32s)]
*  talking through it because Trump probably likes that, right? Like the, for a secretary of defense, [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=1474.48s)]
*  then to get to a place where he's so scared and so paranoid and worried that he only is going to do [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=1480.8s)]
*  whatever Trump wants. You know, I, when you get to situations like, Oh, we want Marines in the streets [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=1485.28s)]
*  of LA, or we want to have a birthday parade. You know, we know that you're going to have somebody [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=1491.04s)]
*  there that, that is willing to do it. Right. So when you get to the question of like, why is Pete [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=1495.84s)]
*  still there, even though there are MAGA folks who don't want him to be there, that seems like the [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=1500.56s)]
*  best answer to the question to me. Yeah. I mean, I don't know what Trump wants. At one point he said, [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=1505.04s)]
*  I think, I think Hegseth is going to get it together, which is like, honestly, not something [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=1512.48s)]
*  you want your boss to say about you. But someone did describe, they were describing the two [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=1517.04s)]
*  factions in the office and they described it as, as loyalists versus people who believe in the [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=1524.96s)]
*  mission. And so there's kind of the stated thing that they all said they're going to do, which is [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=1530.56s)]
*  say, I don't know, make, make procurement more efficient or something. And so there are people [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=1534.24s)]
*  who really care about that. And that's a different mission than like pleasing Donald Trump. And, [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=1541.44s)]
*  and it seems like those two factions are kind of at odds. Yeah. I have to ask this question [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=1546.72s)]
*  because you know, that's what the commenters are going to want to hear. And because you did mention [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=1554.32s)]
*  that he's not clean shaven in the morning. Any sources of any thoughts on Pete's drinking or, [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=1558.24s)]
*  or lack thereof? What people told me is that after Signalgate, he ceased to be as frequently clean [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=1564.8s)]
*  shaven in the morning. So that's the reporting I have. Okay. It just, it did feel like a note. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=1572.72s)]
*  You do a lot of profiles and you don't necessarily need to mention people's [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=1580.0s)]
*  shaving regimen. I'm not shaving at the moment. You may or may not mention that. It felt notable, [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=1583.68s)]
*  I guess is all I'm saying. There was a change. I mean, and I was surprised because it seemed like [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=1588.64s)]
*  such a subjective thing to say. Like I was surprised at the number of people who jumped [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=1593.6000000000001s)]
*  to affirm that. Yeah. And then just one of the specific questions of the story you did mention, [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=1599.84s)]
*  like some Mrs. Kim Jong-un style photos of his wife. Is that right? What's happening there? [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=1604.9599999999998s)]
*  There are these poster sized pictures in the secretary's office and I have never been in [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=1614.08s)]
*  the secretary's office, but apparently typically these are pictures of like tanks and military [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=1622.24s)]
*  stuff and generals doing stuff. And they have been replaced with pictures of Jennifer Hegseth, [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=1628.08s)]
*  mostly in the same pink dress with bows down the front that she wore to the aforementioned [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=1637.1999999999998s)]
*  Easter egg roll. So like they're like six posters of his wife in the office, six or seven, six or [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=1644.48s)]
*  seven. I love my spouse, but that's unusual, I would think. I'm trying hard to think about an [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=1652.3999999999999s)]
*  office I've been into that had that many photos of a wife. My understanding is that's unusual. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=1661.12s)]
*  That's your understanding? Yeah. Huh. Okay. Well, when you write a story like this, [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=1667.28s)]
*  sometimes afterwards you get pushback, people you'll get some phone calls, people will be like, [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=1672.48s)]
*  you got snowed, that guy Caldwell has a bone to pick for Pete and like actually things are [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=1677.76s)]
*  really under control. Any of that, anything in that nature? I've been surprised at [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=1682.6399999999999s)]
*  the uniformity of the response. No one believes in this investigation. I can't find a single person [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=1694.0s)]
*  who will now defend the idea that there's credible information that these men leaked. [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=1702.0s)]
*  So the response you might get would be like, you're at the Pentagon, we're focused on the [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=1710.72s)]
*  mission, right? There's an attempt to deflect, but yeah, I think a lot of people [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=1715.52s)]
*  feel done with Hexeth, but understand that Trump might not be done with Hexeth. [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=1724.48s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, if they were serious about the leak investigation, again, like at this level, [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=1731.28s)]
*  leaking sensitive materials, as you would know, but anybody having written about the Reality [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=1736.8799999999999s)]
*  Winter case, leaking sensitive war plans about Panama is a crime. And if they really thought [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=1740.8799999999999s)]
*  that was the case, they would continue to be pursuing these guys and there's no evidence of [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=1748.48s)]
*  that, right? Right. That's something we should have talked about. So like what would a normal [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=1752.4s)]
*  leak investigation look like? It would look like very possibly their house getting raided as [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=1755.2800000000002s)]
*  happened to Daniel Hale or they might be arrested as happened to Reality Winter. Instead, it's just [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=1761.1200000000001s)]
*  been them at home kind of refreshing, like finding out new information about themselves [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=1768.0800000000002s)]
*  that's been leaking from the Pentagon to the press. It's bizarre. It's a bizarre situation. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=1775.0400000000002s)]
*  I do kind of wonder, like, so if you do a follow-up story, I do kind of wonder, like, [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=1781.76s)]
*  who's on the call about our assistance in the Iranian strikes? Like it does feel like there [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=1785.92s)]
*  are some missing links in the chain of command, I guess. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=1796.72s)]
*  Mm hmm. Yeah. I mean, a persistent concern is that there's just not enough people, like [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=1800.8s)]
*  it's understaffed. They can't hire people because there's a New York Times report about this [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=1809.36s)]
*  recently. People don't want to work under Hegseth. Experienced people don't want to work under Hegseth. [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=1814.8s)]
*  And so jobs are going unfilled. Often one person will be doing two jobs. Many people are quitting [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=1819.04s)]
*  because there's a sense that like, well, maybe I wrote something four years ago that someone might [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=1827.28s)]
*  dig up and so I should just get out of here. Like there's this unprecedented level of opposition [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=1832.9599999999998s)]
*  research into career civil servants that makes people very nervous. [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=1838.08s)]
*  Got it. So after having reported through the story, I have a producer, Katie, she was reading [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=1842.72s)]
*  and she said she's scared. Are you reporting it? Do you feel scared or kind of just bemused [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=1847.1999999999998s)]
*  about the weekend talk show co-host that's kind of in charge of protecting the homeland? [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=1856.24s)]
*  I mean, I think like the nature of chaos is that there's too much for the mind to keep track of [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=1862.08s)]
*  such that you can't make predictions. Do I think a paranoid kind of smaller, [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=1868.6399999999999s)]
*  hindered DOD, there's a fear that they might lash out and panic, right? Sure. Yeah. I don't know how [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=1876.24s)]
*  to weigh that against the danger of a hyper competent DOD. That's fair. Okay. Well, [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=1883.2s)]
*  let people sit with that. That's nice. Carrie Halle, thank you so much. It's quite the read. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=1891.2s)]
*  I encourage everybody to do it. We'll put the link in the show notes and keep in touch. Look [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=1895.6000000000001s)]
*  forward to whatever you're working on next. Thank you so much for having me. [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=1900.16s)]
*  you [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Adki0UzgE0&t=1921.2s)]
