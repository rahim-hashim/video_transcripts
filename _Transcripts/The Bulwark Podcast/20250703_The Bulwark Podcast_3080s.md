Video Description: Republicans are creating, and celebrating, an immigration police state financed by their megabill. Our cities will be militarized, we'll have prison camps, more masked agents, and more dehumanization—like their sicko alligator hats. And the motivation all seems to be so Trump has a win and the Dems don't. But this is Stephen Miller's administration now. Expect net zero migration, less tourism, less international business, and a lower GDP. As we head into Independence Day, it's hard to see the Jeffersonian aspirational promise of America right now. Plus, the administration's freeze on some air defense weapons to Ukraine, how a younger Sam used to think about Bill Kristol, and Candace Owens's potential influence on geopolitical affairs. Sam Stein joins Tim Miller for the holiday weekend pod.

# Spineless GOP DON'T CARE What’s In The Big Fugly Bill
**The Bulwark Podcast:** [July 03, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8)
*  These people are spineless, obviously, and they don't really have any principles other than [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=0.0s)]
*  we need to get something done for Trump. I actually thought the most interesting [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=4.24s)]
*  tweet about this came from the Trump Rapid Response account. I don't have it in front of me, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=7.28s)]
*  but the tweeter was like, let's go Republicans, beat the crooked Democrats. And it's like that [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=10.72s)]
*  sort of encapsulated everything for me, which is like, nothing about the bill was like worth [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=16.48s)]
*  pitching in that moment for them. It wasn't like, hey, let's like extend the tax cuts or [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=22.240000000000002s)]
*  let's fund ICE. It's like, we need to shove it in the face of crooked Democrats who have [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=26.0s)]
*  nothing to do with this at all. Hello, and welcome to the Bullwark podcast. I'm your host, Tim Miller. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=31.36s)]
*  By the time you all hear this, I will be flying over the Atlantic with a wine and a novel. So [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=44.32s)]
*  if you need one more hour with my dulcet tones in your ears before a one week reprieve, head on over [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=49.120000000000005s)]
*  to the next level feed on your podcast. Have a choice because yesterday's show was like, was an [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=54.8s)]
*  absolute banger. I do have to say, so make sure you're catching the next level every Wednesday. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=59.76s)]
*  One of the programming notes that's very sweet. I received a very grateful message from the folks [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=65.92s)]
*  at Manna, which is a food relief organization. Nick Kristof recommended our listeners donate to [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=71.92s)]
*  on last Friday's episode. Apparently there was an outpouring of financial support following the show. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=77.28s)]
*  So thanks so much to all of you. I really appreciate this community and we'll re-up. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=84.39999999999999s)]
*  There are a couple of other organizations. Nick shouted out as well, and we'll put those in the [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=90.0s)]
*  show notes of this podcast. You know what else we're going to put the show notes of this podcast? [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=94.56s)]
*  A couple of playlists for you for the week. The Bullwark podcast playlist of all the outro songs [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=100.88s)]
*  that I play. It's like coming up on 10,000 followers, which is kind of crazy. And I also, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=105.36s)]
*  speaking of bangers, my 4th of July playlist is really the best thing out there. So we'll give [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=112.56s)]
*  you those two things for you as well. As for this show, it's my favorite guest. He had some [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=117.44s)]
*  summer vacation tech difficulties. So it's Sam Stein as an emergency substitute. What a treat. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=123.60000000000001s)]
*  Managing editor of this year Bullwark. How you doing Sam Stein? [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=130.8s)]
*  Sam Stein I'm actually regretting doing this. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=133.36s)]
*  Nick Kristof It sounds like you are podcasting while also editing the Morning Shots newsletter [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=135.52s)]
*  by Bill Kristol. And you said something interesting to me the other day about how younger Sam would [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=141.36s)]
*  have thought about being Bill Kristol's newsletter editor. And I just kind of wanted to explore that [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=145.92000000000002s)]
*  a little bit more. How are you processing that these days? How's that experience for you? [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=151.76000000000002s)]
*  Sam Stein Well, I didn't realize I was going on the couch at 730 AM. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=156.24s)]
*  Nick Kristof Oh yeah, you are. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=160.72000000000003s)]
*  Sam Stein It's interesting. Do you want the honest assessment? [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=161.28000000000003s)]
*  Nick Kristof I want just full... The ethos of this podcast is radical candor. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=164.64000000000001s)]
*  Sam Stein It's been kind of out of body at times. I literally, I do remember like 2006, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=169.28s)]
*  2007 HuffPost saying Bill Kristol is the devil. Bill Kristol is the devil. I cannot believe he [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=177.52s)]
*  did this to our country and got us into Iraq. And so things change obviously. Obviously, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=186.88s)]
*  we're... There's some overriding principles that have brought us together. And also, it is, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=193.44s)]
*  I will say this, God, I don't want to get in trouble for this, but he's a lovely man. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=199.2s)]
*  Nick Kristof Who would you get in trouble for with that? [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=203.2s)]
*  Sam Stein The lefties online who still hold grudges. Bill is a great guy. And also, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=205.6s)]
*  the truth about this stuff is also, and I kind of discovered this a long time ago, but ever more [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=212.48s)]
*  so now. So much of what we do nowadays in communications, just online and bomb throwing, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=217.12s)]
*  and you never actually talk to the person. And when you do actually talk to the person and get [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=223.20000000000002s)]
*  to know the person, realize they're a human being, it radically changes your perceptions of them [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=227.52s)]
*  for obvious reasons. And I used to do this thing, and I'll shut up after this, but I used to do this [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=233.44s)]
*  thing, I don't do it anymore, where someone on Twitter would be harassing me and saying horrible, [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=237.12s)]
*  nasty things. And I would try to find their actual, these are like, not like total bots, [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=242.88s)]
*  but like, not like John Podhore, but like actual people. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=248.07999999999998s)]
*  Nick Kristof Yeah, putting John aside, I would find their phone number, and I would call them [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=250.79999999999998s)]
*  up. And I would say, Hey, I just want to talk about like, why you think I'm the scum of the [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=255.76s)]
*  earth? Like, can we can we can we like, oh, yeah, I would do it once a month. And I would just be [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=259.44s)]
*  like, you know, on this, in this tweet, I saw of yours, you like call me like the dumbest human [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=263.84s)]
*  being since you know, whatever. Like, can you explain why you feel that way? I just like do that. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=269.04s)]
*  And like, almost every single time with except few exceptions, person be like, Oh, shit, man, [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=274.08000000000004s)]
*  I didn't mean that. I didn't realize you would see that. And like, let me take that down. And I bet [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=279.6s)]
*  no, no, keep it up. It's important. Like, just keep it up. But like, let's talk about it. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=285.04s)]
*  Dave Korsun Did anybody say fuck you k word? [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=288.72s)]
*  Nick Kristof Oh, yeah, I got well, I would try to avoid the anti semitic ones, because those people [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=291.52000000000004s)]
*  are lost. But I would definitely have some people who'd be like, how the fuck did you get my number? [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=295.76s)]
*  Like, don't ever call me again. But more and more often than not, it was people who realize that [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=299.76s)]
*  you're a human. Yeah. And Bill's kind of more than human, though. He's kind of superhuman. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=303.92s)]
*  Dave Korsun Oh, Bill's amazing. Bill's Bill's the best. And, you know, would I like him to stick on [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=308.48s)]
*  topic for the newsletter every now and then? Yeah, of course. But [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=313.52s)]
*  Dave Korsun You don't like his newsletters where he does imaginary voice of Donald Trump. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=316.32s)]
*  And he digress that screenplay. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=320.48s)]
*  While I may not while I may not appreciate the artistry of them, our subscribers do. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=322.56s)]
*  Nick Kristof Do you see the same trajectory for you with like JD Vance? Do you think you'll be [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=329.04s)]
*  editing his newsletter in eight years? Do you think there's kind of a red line on this principle? [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=333.20000000000005s)]
*  Dave Korsun I'm happy to edit JD Vance if he wants this in a [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=337.36s)]
*  beautiful work. Interesting thought experience. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=341.92s)]

*  about him in a second. In the end, they did the same thing they always do. All of them ended up [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=413.52s)]
*  folding and the the bill that that vote was like to pass it so they could vote on it. And so the [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=417.91999999999996s)]

*  point. So talk about, you know, what you make about that whole of the whole story. What's your [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=429.6s)]

*  a one year moratorium. It's like, it's like, that's really where you're going to hold the line on this [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=464.0s)]
*  bill. It seems like it seems like you should just shut up and just vote for it. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=470.23999999999995s)]

*  for a trillion. The one that killed me was I was David Valadeo in California. Like three days a [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=492.08s)]
*  tough one for me because he was one of the impeachers. I know and maybe is there only two [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=498.96000000000004s)]
*  left. I know. Well, I mean, sorry, but like you can't put out a statement three days ago being [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=504.32s)]
*  like I will never vote for the Senate version. I'm a no. And then like three days later, be like, [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=511.52s)]
*  All right, I'm ready to rise. Yeah, it's like, I guess if I had a piece of advice, I would tell [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=516.64s)]
*  them or whoever is doing comms from like, don't don't don't do red lines. Like you're gonna cross [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=523.36s)]
*  them. Like you should know this by now. I was waiting for Victoria. My favorite is Victoria [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=529.6s)]
*  Sparks. Like she's just Ukrainian immigrant Congresswoman. Yeah, but she's her voice is [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=533.68s)]
*  interesting. If you don't know her. Put it you're always going into the superficial and I want to [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=538.4s)]
*  stay elevated. I've I she's she always has like the most hilarious twists. And, and last night, [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=543.12s)]
*  it was like, I will not vote for the rule, but I will vote for final passage, which made no sense [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=551.4399999999999s)]
*  whatsoever. And then of course, she ended up voting for the rule. These people are spineless, [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=555.4399999999999s)]
*  obviously, and they don't really have any principles other than we need. We need to like, [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=559.76s)]
*  get something done for Trump. I actually thought the most interesting tweet about this came from [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=565.36s)]
*  the rap the Trump rapid response account when right before they were voting. And they were like trying [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=569.6800000000001s)]
*  to get everyone ginned up about it. And I think that I don't have in front of me, but the Twitter [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=575.04s)]
*  can was like, let's go Republicans beat the like crooked Democrats. And it's like that sort of [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=578.32s)]
*  encapsulated everything for me, which is like, nothing about the bill was like worth pitching in [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=584.0s)]
*  that moment for them. It wasn't like, hey, let's like extend the tax cuts or let's fund ice. It's [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=589.76s)]
*  like, we need to shove it in the face of crooked Democrats who have nothing to do with this at all. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=594.24s)]
*  Like they're not involved that you don't need their votes like, but it's all about scoring [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=599.6800000000001s)]
*  victories and making Democrats look bad. And it's a horrible way to legislate. We can get into the [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=604.48s)]
*  sort of more substantive matters because I was intrigued by this idea, like JD van stuff about [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=608.72s)]
*  minutiae and the fact that he seems to be not being on all on board all the bill but loves the [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=613.52s)]
*  immigration stuff. And then of course, Elon Musk stuff where he hates the bill. It's like, [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=618.32s)]
*  I'm stealing chate here, but like that is really interesting that the two sort of tent poles of the [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=623.44s)]
*  new Republican ideology don't like what's in this bill. I do want to get into substance too, but it [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=629.84s)]
*  was why we have people on the couch for a second. The insight in that Trump ever sons tweet is was [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=635.12s)]
*  right. The other exchange on social media that I thought was very telling was a little TIF was [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=641.84s)]
*  being more of a one way TIF because I don't know if Don cares, but between retiring Republican [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=649.36s)]
*  Congressman Don Bacon and fellow podcast host John Favreau over the Medicaid situation. Don, [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=653.92s)]
*  I miss this. Yeah. Okay. So Don is like, well also Brian Tower Cohen, BTC of YouTube fame is also [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=661.36s)]
*  involved in this. BTC sends an initial tweet that basically just says, Hey, this is Don Bacon. If [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=668.32s)]
*  he votes for the bill, X number of his constituents will lose access to healthcare. And then it's a [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=675.44s)]
*  picture of Don Bacon looking smug. So kind of an aggressive, not so bad. I mean, it was substantive. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=679.04s)]
*  Don replies, some liberals hate work. What? And then it kind of goes on. Some liberals don't value [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=686.8s)]
*  work. He's like, this bill is going to create work requirements for healthy adults. And like, [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=697.36s)]
*  Favreau kind of replies with some actual substance here about how well like that's about 3% of the [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=702.7199999999999s)]
*  people that are on Medicaid that who can work, but aren't, you know, this bill results in healthcare [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=708.88s)]
*  being lost for people that are not able bodied, childless adults, which is who Don was trying to [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=714.24s)]
*  focus on. And less interesting than the kind of boring back and forth on the details for me was [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=720.48s)]
*  just like Don is a retiring Congressman. He could do it every once. And you could imagine him being [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=727.92s)]
*  mad at the Senate for jamming him when he said he had a red line. Like you could imagine me, [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=735.36s)]
*  right? Like he said, he had the red light. He could be mad at his Senate colleagues. You could [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=740.72s)]
*  imagine him, you know, being mad at Trump, that he has to retire because of how stupid politics [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=744.24s)]
*  has gotten. You could imagine him like being mad at himself. And like instead he's going to lash out [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=749.92s)]
*  at liberals on Twitter. It's like, so you're suggesting it's self-soothing, right? Like, [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=756.0s)]
*  yeah, he needs to find a way to tell himself that what he did was right when he knows what he did [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=761.2800000000001s)]
*  was wrong. And yeah, I think that's the case for a lot of these people. But I also think like, [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=767.0400000000001s)]
*  I don't know, is our politics attracting these people who just don't give a shit about [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=774.48s)]
*  the actual principles of the legislation? And maybe I think that's a problem. And I just found [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=781.12s)]
*  this whole process to be dumbfounding. I mean, it's so arbitrary. Like, what are we doing? [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=787.12s)]
*  Why did we have to do this by July 4th? The thing that really tickled me- [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=792.48s)]
*  Pete Slauson Yeah, they keep saying we have to do it because taxes are going to go up on people. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=796.5600000000001s)]
*  Like, not until next year. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=800.24s)]
*  Jared Slauson It's crazy. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=802.08s)]
*  Pete Slauson We haven't had the air to figure something out. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=803.28s)]
*  Jared Slauson If there was a deadline, it was about the debt ceiling, but that's in August, [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=805.36s)]
*  maybe September. They could have figured it out. And they just decided, well, no, we have to do [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=809.44s)]
*  this. And I don't think if you put like truth serum in them, I don't think that they would say [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=814.72s)]
*  this bill is good. I don't even think they would say this bill is better than the status quo. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=819.36s)]
*  I think a lot of them would say this bill like kind of screws things up in a way that [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=824.48s)]
*  is really obviously problematic. I mean, the best policy anecdote about how stupid this whole bill [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=829.52s)]
*  is, is what they did to snap. So, the food relief program, they created this insane incentive, [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=835.0400000000001s)]
*  just to win over McCasky's vote. They created this insane incentive where if you're a state [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=841.68s)]
*  who has a horrible error rate in administering this program, you actually get financial relief. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=845.04s)]
*  You get the feds to cover the full snap benefits. And so, states are now going to say, okay, we're [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=850.64s)]
*  kind of at the cusp. Should we make our administration more efficient or should we just [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=856.8s)]
*  worsen and hand out benefits to more people erroneously? And they're incentivized to do the [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=861.6s)]
*  wrong thing. I just find that like, in what world would you want legislation passed that way? [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=866.64s)]
*  But it goes back to your point, which is they need to self-soothe and they need to say, well, [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=873.1999999999999s)]
*  it's great for Trump, it's great for Republicans. And I think mainly it's bad for Democrats that we [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=878.0s)]
*  get a win. Like literally the only substantive, like I said, Dan Crenshaw, make this point, [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=883.4399999999999s)]
*  others like argument about the merits of the building better than status quo is that the [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=887.4399999999999s)]
*  Trump tax cuts will expire. There'll be a massive tax increase. Again, like that is not like, [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=892.16s)]
*  so that's true. So in their view, that's better than the status quo, but you could have just done [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=896.8s)]
*  that. You could have just stopped. Right. There are plenty of other options. There was one [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=900.8s)]
*  Republican, I mentioned this earlier, that did oppose this and did something that I've been [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=906.24s)]
*  asking Republicans to do for a while. So I want to at least mention it. It's Brian Fitzpatrick out [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=911.92s)]
*  of Pennsylvania. He wrote a letter earlier in the day that said he wanted to express his concerns [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=917.28s)]
*  the letters to Trump with reporting that the US is withholding defense material already pledged [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=924.64s)]
*  to Ukraine. Among those materials was the pack three Patriots that is protecting Ukraine from [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=929.6800000000001s)]
*  the missiles that they're getting bombarded with right now. And essentially says, we need to resolve [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=937.84s)]
*  this if I'm going to vote for this bill. And being billed and asking for this for a while, it's just [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=944.72s)]
*  like, like there are a lot of Republicans that wear the Ukraine pin, but it's like, okay, well, [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=949.6800000000001s)]
*  why don't you, why don't you hold, why don't you use this for leverage the way that conservatives [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=952.96s)]
*  do for spending or whatever. Brian Fitzpatrick actually does it and then he runs away and they [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=957.2s)]
*  can't find him. He does like a video of him running through the basement, the running through the [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=963.0400000000001s)]
*  tunnels of Congress. So I don't know, I would, I would have walked out with my chest puffed after [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=967.6800000000001s)]
*  doing that if I was Brian Fitzpatrick, but that's okay. That's more of a smile. I like it. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=971.6800000000001s)]
*  Come find me, bitch. I'm in the coat closet. Turned in my phone on silent. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=976.64s)]
*  DND. So anyway, that's good. But, you know, I'm, it's just, again, it's one guy and he only had two [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=982.48s)]
*  other guys to do it. They would have, they could have killed it. It's crazy because there's so many [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=989.28s)]
*  things that these guys claim they want to like, you know, effectuate and that they need leverage [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=994.16s)]
*  for. And this is the one opportunity really that they have. I don't really know what else they're [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=999.6s)]
*  going to do legislatively. And like they could have done, you know, who used leverage pretty well, [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=1003.68s)]
*  Lisa Murkowski. She did. And like, it's hilarious to me that, I mean, I didn't like how she did it. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=1008.8s)]
*  And I thought it was kind of ridiculous the end sum, but like, I'm, it's kind of surprising that [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=1016.4s)]
*  more people weren't like, you know what, let's band together. What five Ukraine supporters could [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=1021.28s)]
*  have banded together and been like, we will not vote for this bill unless you put like those [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=1026.0s)]
*  weapons back. And Brian Fitzpatrick was the, was the only one on, you know, plenty of people with [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=1029.92s)]
*  universities who are getting like stiffed by the federal government of research funds could have [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=1034.88s)]
*  been like, we are not going to vote for this bill unless you, you know, turn the spigots back on. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=1039.1200000000001s)]
*  And they just basically handed all their leverage to Trump because what they were, [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=1044.96s)]
*  they're fearful of a primary or something. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=1049.92s)]
*  Yeah. And I don't even know. I guess you probably risked a primary on this bill. If you were like [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=1052.64s)]
*  the one person, right. It's a collective action problem, right? But like David Valadeo in a top [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=1058.3200000000002s)]
*  who you mentioned earlier, the guy who was amazing California. So it's a jungle primary. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=1064.56s)]
*  It's a top two. He's been, he's, they've tried to primary for the right ever since the MP Evo to [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=1068.6399999999999s)]
*  impeach Trump. He could have survived voting against this bill. There are other people that [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=1074.0s)]
*  could have survived. Well, he might still, as we record this, it's eight o'clock. We haven't really [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=1079.12s)]
*  seen the final vote. He voted for the rule. You're generous. You're generous. I'm sorry. Once you [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=1083.44s)]
*  voted for the rule, it's over for me. You can't, you can't sell me on, well, I voted for the rule, [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=1088.24s)]
*  but I voted against final passage, John Kerry. Okay. Whatever. We're not going to do that. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=1093.92s)]

*  just riveting on a little bit more since he's like doubled, tripled down on it. He sends his [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=1196.16s)]
*  tweet where it's like everything else in this bill is immaterial. I think he said manutia. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=1200.0s)]
*  Did he say manutia or immaterial? Immaterial was one of the words. It might've been immaterial, [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=1205.04s)]
*  manutia. I don't have it in front of me. Immaterial, except for the ICE funds. And the [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=1209.6s)]
*  interesting thing here is he continued doubling, digging in on that. And the guy got into a Twitter [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=1216.48s)]
*  war with Matt Iglesias on this topic. And this number comes out here from Ian Bremmer today, [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=1222.08s)]
*  when you just kind of put in context how much the immigration funding is. Once this bill passes, [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=1227.76s)]
*  the funding for ICE, our domestic police force now, immigration police force, is greater than [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=1237.04s)]
*  the amount of funding for all but like the top 10 militaries in the world. The ICE funding, the ICE [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=1246.24s)]
*  budget at $37.5 billion is greater than Israel's defense budget at $30.5 billion. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=1252.4s)]
*  Really? That's what's needed. And we did this on the next level a little bit as far as there's no [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=1261.92s)]
*  judges. We're not funding any judges, immigration judges. So we're just going to fund these massive [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=1269.2s)]
*  detention centers and more contractors to wear masks and hassle people. That's what we're doing. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=1275.0400000000002s)]
*  Yes, that's what we're doing. I mean, it's very obvious. It's very obvious that this is the [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=1282.4s)]
*  country that they want. I mean, I think in addition to JD Vance's tweet and TIF with Iglesias, [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=1288.24s)]
*  which is just like, I don't know, maybe if I were vice president, I probably would not spend my time [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=1296.8000000000002s)]
*  that way. But I thought the other thing was like Trump deciding like, you know what, all the shit's [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=1302.5600000000002s)]
*  going down with this bill. I'm going to just hop on a plane and go to alligator Alcatraz and like [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=1307.2s)]
*  check out this Everglades prison that we set up. And there's like, you know, they were like taking [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=1312.64s)]
*  photo shoots and they brought along Benny Johnson for some, you know, sizzle reel footage. And it [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=1317.68s)]
*  was just like the celebration of the creation of a immigration police state is really remarkable. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=1323.44s)]
*  They get they get off on this stuff. They really do. And we're going to have militarized [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=1333.84s)]
*  huge portions of our, you know, cities, I suspect we're going to have people in cages, we're going [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=1341.52s)]
*  to have mass deportation ramped up to from even where it is right now. And I take JD Vance very [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=1347.92s)]
*  seriously, literally, not just figuratively or whatever the fuck the phrases, when he says that [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=1354.96s)]
*  this is the main thing in the bill for him. I think this is like, you know, I really do think [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=1360.48s)]
*  this is Stephen Miller's administration. I think they're totally focused on this stuff. They believe [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=1364.56s)]
*  in it. They think that on they think that throwing immigrants out of the country is going to unlock [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=1369.04s)]
*  jobs, it's going to unlock the welfare state to make sure it's more stable, it's going to [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=1374.48s)]
*  give people more benefits because immigrants are draining our benefits, all this bullshit, [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=1378.0s)]
*  I think they really do believe it. Yeah, it was a wild press conference. I'm not going to punish [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=1382.0s)]
*  people with it. But Trump gave like a rambling three minute long, did you watch this like answer [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=1385.52s)]
*  to how long people are going to stay in these detention centers? And it's like, I mean, a his [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=1390.8799999999999s)]
*  mental acuity doesn't seem quite there. But he's also just like kind of going on about how there's [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=1397.76s)]
*  going to be a connection of camps. And some people were sharing it as like how ominous this is that [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=1402.32s)]
*  he like he wants to be able to stay indefinitely in internment camps. And that's it is ominous. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=1407.36s)]
*  I like interpreted it as as like a like you said, he gets off on this stuff and he is and he wasn't [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=1411.84s)]
*  all there. And he was like losing this train of thought and kept you know, kind of rambling about [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=1417.6s)]
*  it. But so he does that. And then Ron DeSantimonious, his spokesperson, you know, was kind of repot [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=1421.4399999999998s)]
*  responding to the backlash to this I noticed and she was like, essentially, this is misinformation, [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=1426.48s)]
*  we're not going to keep people here indefinitely an alligator out as we're going to be sending them [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=1431.28s)]
*  back to their home country immediately. Right. And I just don't think that people like who are [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=1435.36s)]
*  not deeply involved in the immigration system, I can really process like what that like means [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=1441.68s)]
*  and what that looks like, because they they keep going back to this whole like, well, Obama deported [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=1447.76s)]
*  a lot of people about a lot of people. It is such a misnomer, because those numbers are all people [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=1452.24s)]
*  coming across the border and then going right back around. Right. And so like those people aren't going [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=1456.8s)]
*  a people aren't coming to the border right now. But if they were, they weren't being sent then to [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=1460.8s)]
*  to the Everglades to then be deported, right? Like they're being kept on the border. So the people [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=1465.68s)]
*  that are going to the fucking Everglades camp and all these other prison camps that they're going [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=1470.32s)]
*  to start to build are people from the interior of the US. Yes. And their plan, I guess, is then to [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=1474.32s)]
*  take the like the Cuban guy that died in their custody. And instead of leaving him an alligator [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=1479.6s)]
*  alcatraz, I guess their stated plan is that they're just going to send them without a judge or with [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=1484.8s)]
*  some fake judge, you know, fake, like militarized police, just straight to some country hasn't been [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=1488.72s)]
*  for a half century. That's that is literally their plan. Yeah, 100%. And I think you made a [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=1495.04s)]
*  really important point, which is, yes, deportations into Obama were high. They did it because one, I [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=1501.12s)]
*  think Obama actually did believe in enforcement, one, the people recognize, but also to, they're [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=1509.36s)]
*  trying to get by and for immigration reform from Republicans. And they thought that would get it [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=1514.72s)]
*  to them. But also, to your point, a lot of people cross the border, they're sent back, they turn [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=1518.3999999999999s)]
*  around, they try to cross the border again, they get sent back, that kind of juices the numbers. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=1523.04s)]
*  And that's true. Yeah, that's true right there. Right. It's like repeat offenders. In this case, [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=1526.96s)]
*  this is a lot of this isn't well, almost all of it now, because we have no border crossing [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=1531.68s)]
*  is interior enforcement. I was talking, I forget who I was talking to, maybe is Edgar. But just the [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=1535.52s)]
*  way the Overton wish window has shifted on this stuff. I mean, Trump 1.0 is famous for, you know, [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=1541.36s)]
*  public recoiling at images of kids in cages. Like that was the defining moment of when people [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=1547.36s)]
*  turned on his immigration policy. Trump 2.0 is they're going down with paparazzi, political [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=1554.0s)]
*  paparazzi to show you the cages they've built. And with branded hats, branded hats and fun [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=1560.0s)]
*  alligators and you know, the dehumanization of it all is, is it's sad, honestly, it's we've gotten [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=1566.6399999999999s)]
*  to a really dark place where we treat people like we're treating people now. And I'm sure [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=1573.84s)]
*  Trisha McLaughlin will say, well, they all have these every single one of them has a horrible [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=1580.1599999999999s)]
*  record that we can't see. Yes, I'm sure. I was like the Cuban guy that died. You know, he had [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=1584.48s)]
*  a drug arrest in 1984. Oh, in Miami. Never. I was like, Oh, somebody was doing drugs in Miami in [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=1591.52s)]
*  1984. Oh, really? Breaking news. You should have been deported back then. No, it's crazy. They [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=1597.6s)]
*  come up with you didn't see his social media posts where he threw up a peace sign that looked like [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=1604.56s)]
*  an MS 13 symbols. Speaking of social media posts, I just got a text this morning from one of my [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=1608.7199999999998s)]
*  friends who's who I'm meeting on my holiday. And he said he's already, you know, talking to foreigners [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=1614.48s)]
*  and about like why they aren't coming to America and some and like, I could guess. Yeah, right. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=1619.6s)]
*  But like the social media thing, I don't know if it's really like sunk in with people like the [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=1626.96s)]
*  degree to which like people that are coming in on travel visas now, like they're being asked to look [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=1632.48s)]
*  through their phones. Oh, yeah. Like they're again, it's like, it is it is like you're going [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=1637.4399999999998s)]
*  to an authoritarian state, you know, like when I land in Spain, you know, after the red eye, [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=1642.6399999999999s)]
*  like, they're not going to be like, Hey, Tim, have you said anything mean about the Catalonian [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=1649.9199999999998s)]
*  party? Like, you know, before you come in, like, are you a Basque separatist? Is there any memes [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=1655.52s)]
*  about that? Like where you make Basque separatist leaders look like they have a fat face? [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=1661.84s)]
*  It's like, no, that's not what's happening. But that, like that is having, you know, like, it just, [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=1666.08s)]
*  it's a it's a small thing. Like when you combine it with the interior enforcement, and with the fear, [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=1672.64s)]
*  like it paints a picture that I just think things are going to look worse than, than a lot of people [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=1680.0s)]
*  realize. Yeah, also, I don't think it's that small thing. I think we'll see. We'll see what the [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=1685.52s)]
*  numbers end up showing. But just think about like the downstream ripple effects, even economically [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=1691.28s)]
*  from this less tourism, less international business. And Adrian had a piece for us about like the Latino [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=1696.96s)]
*  music industry. The concert venues are just getting absolutely shredded because no one wants [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=1705.28s)]
*  to no one wants to show up at a Latino music festival because they think ICE will come down [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=1710.48s)]
*  and raid them like legit. They don't want to do it. Artists aren't coming here because they can't [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=1714.72s)]
*  get their visas satisfied. I mean, and you might say, well, is that like, profoundly impactful? [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=1719.44s)]
*  And I would say, yeah, yeah, that is profoundly we are coming up, I'm going to end with some, [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=1725.84s)]
*  you know, patriotic pains to, to the American spirit to the American declaration. You'd like, [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=1731.6s)]
*  even if it's not that big of a deal to you practically, whether or not you're going to [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=1738.24s)]
*  have a big bad bunny concert here in the country, right, it like is extremely impactful about what [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=1743.12s)]
*  the spirit of the country and what the country is supposed to be about, and whether you want to be [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=1749.04s)]
*  able to live in a free country, if there are people that decide they can't, they can't sing [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=1752.24s)]
*  their songs here because their race. Yeah. And then you think about like, well, [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=1756.16s)]
*  every music venue has vendors who need customers, the you know, they have, you know, [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=1761.44s)]
*  surrounding restaurants and shops that need clientele. I mean, just the ripple effects of [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=1766.64s)]
*  it all. And then you get to like, well, the farming industry, the hotel industry, I know, [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=1771.44s)]
*  he's trying to create cars out for carve outs for them, but they're not showing up. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=1775.3600000000001s)]
*  They might not believe there's carve outs yet. And, and that's just like, the steps, [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=1778.8000000000002s)]
*  just like the surface level stuff. I mean, think about it under the surface. And then [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=1783.44s)]
*  you get into a place where the country is closed off, the economy kind of slows down. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=1787.3600000000001s)]
*  And culturally, we're so homogenous that we become less and less recognizable. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=1793.68s)]
*  I was talking about the econ stuff, because you mentioned it, our man friend of the pod, [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=1801.52s)]
*  Stan Voiger, over at AEI was posting that related to all this, the US will fall to net zero in [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=1805.04s)]
*  immigration or below this year as a result of everything we're talking about. And so what that [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=1813.36s)]
*  means practically is that the country only needs to create 10 to 40,000 jobs per month to keep [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=1818.32s)]
*  unemployment at 4.2%. So in one level, you're like, okay, well, unemployment won't be spiking [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=1823.6s)]
*  like it was in the Great Recession. That's good. On the other hand, this is a picture of a country [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=1828.3999999999999s)]
*  that is stagnant. You know, you're, you're slashing public sector jobs across the board, [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=1832.56s)]
*  and we're not bringing any new people into the country. And that and the great stagnation. I [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=1837.68s)]
*  thought that's what Peter Thiel and Marc Andreessen were fighting against. But that's what we're doing. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=1844.3200000000002s)]
*  When you get to a place where you just don't have people coming to the country to do more work, [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=1848.48s)]
*  to pay into our social insurance programs, to pay taxes, even if they're not citizens, [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=1856.24s)]
*  and they do this, they don't get the benefits they pay into it. But also to be customers to buy [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=1862.8s)]
*  things to generate economic growth. Sure, we can have you know, our unemployment rates going to be [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=1868.56s)]
*  fine, because we're going to have a lot of open jobs and very few people or fewer people, I should [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=1874.48s)]
*  say, able to fill them. So yeah, we'll have a fairly low unemployment rate. But you know, Joe [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=1879.12s)]
*  Biden had a fairly low unemployment rate, right? And inflation really sucked. And, you know, I'm [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=1885.36s)]
*  not saying we're going to inflation here. But my point is, unemployment rate does not always mean, [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=1890.72s)]
*  you know, good economic vibes. And I think we're going to be in a place where, you know, [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=1895.44s)]
*  economic growth seems like it's going to be real close to stagnant. We'll see maybe these tax [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=1901.28s)]
*  extending the tax cuts will help us. Hey, it is true they're doing the tax cuts. I got a text [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=1906.08s)]
*  yesterday from somebody who's on Medicaid. They're like, how screwed am I? And it's like, well, these [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=1913.92s)]
*  fuckers are extending the tax cuts and funding the private prisons immediately. Right. And they're [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=1918.56s)]
*  cutting health care in a year and a half. So you know, it takes time for all this stuff to sort of [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=1926.6399999999999s)]
*  seep through the entire economy. Yeah, I wish I had the data in front of me. I think Cohen told me [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=1933.76s)]
*  some stuff is going to get triggered earlier than that. But I think mostly the pain is coming on the [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=1939.2s)]
*  down the pike past the midterms. The 2027 side of things. Yeah. And that's the Josh Hawley argument [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=1944.96s)]
*  that that was one of our yeah, they're gonna fix it. We'll fix it before 2027. We'll just give you [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=1951.6000000000001s)]
*  your tax cuts, which I'm sure Ron Johnson is very excited about. We come with the Ukraine weapons [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=1957.76s)]
*  thing. I just have one other thing on the story is kind of weird. I have you I know you've been [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=1964.32s)]
*  kind of deep in the world, but have you been following this? Yeah. So what happened? The cold, [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=1969.28s)]
*  what's his name? Bridge Colby. Bridge Colby. What a name. Yeah, who is the, you know, kind of JD [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=1974.8s)]
*  Van Hant stand in, if you will, in the Pentagon, you know, kind of more of the nationalist America [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=1980.96s)]
*  first doesn't want to do stuff. Anyway, go ahead. Well, so I guess my theory of the case is like, [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=1985.6s)]
*  was Rubio not like looped in on this? That's kind of what I want to know about. Because [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=1991.44s)]
*  I don't really understand how they could just, it seems like it just came out of nowhere. And the [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=1995.76s)]
*  second thing is, if you're Zelensky, right, like, you just cut this minerals deal with Trump, [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=2000.3999999999999s)]
*  you've you've literally conspicuously said thank you. Every single time you meet with him, you [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=2006.8s)]
*  tweet thank you every time because you know that that's what they demand. You had a fairly smashing [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=2012.6399999999999s)]
*  success with the drones, but the Russians are still pounding you. There's not much more you can do to [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=2018.32s)]
*  win over the favor of the administration. And for, you know, a bureaucrat at the Pentagon to then [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=2023.12s)]
*  suddenly decide, you know what, we're going to hold these weapons. That's gotta be incredibly [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=2027.76s)]
*  deflating. Obviously it's frightening too for the country. But that's, you know, I don't know. It's [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=2032.1599999999999s)]
*  like the, it just seems like Trump just doesn't care for Ukraine. He just wants to get the Russians [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=2039.04s)]
*  to a point of yes, so that he can end the war. Yeah. So Keith Kellogg, this guy, the, yeah, [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=2045.12s)]
*  he is, you know, at the NSC in the first, he's Pence's old guy, right? Yeah. There's an advisor [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=2052.72s)]
*  and he, so he currently serves as Trump's envoy for Ukraine. And he is like pretty maga as far [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=2058.56s)]
*  as the generals are concerned, but like on the right side, from my perspective of the, well, [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=2067.52s)]
*  I'm from just the accurate perspective, from the moral perspective, you know, since they were [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=2072.3999999999996s)]
*  invaded, but he's been good on the Ukraine issue. So he's Trump's special envoy to Ukraine. [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=2079.76s)]
*  And like, so the story is out there, like you were mentioning about how the weapons aren't going [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=2084.6400000000003s)]
*  there. People are saying, bridge Colby, you know, put a stop on these weapons being sent there. [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=2089.1200000000003s)]
*  Kellogg's daughter, Megan Mobs, who is at this, you know, one of these foundations is like tweeting [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=2094.7200000000003s)]
*  about how like, this isn't true. This is fake news. Like this is people leaking stuff to try [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=2104.16s)]
*  to advance an agenda. And, and, and there are other people out there saying that Trump didn't [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=2110.3999999999996s)]
*  even know about this. Yeah. Like, it's, that's what I was getting at. Like, did they not, [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=2114.7999999999997s)]
*  did Rubio not know about this? Trump not know about this? Are they just like allowing this dude to just [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=2119.2s)]
*  decide on a whim? Hey, we're not going to do this anymore. Like, is there not a process here? [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=2123.6s)]
*  Also, it is true. It's been confirmed by about 15 outlets. Yeah. It kind of seems like no is the [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=2128.48s)]
*  answer. And they're happy to have the, you know, fog of war element out there because I don't know, [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=2133.68s)]
*  Trump seems totally gets a phrenic on this. I know the popular thing on the resistance YouTube [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=2140.64s)]
*  is to be like, Trump is Krasnoff and he was a reason a Russian asset since 1983, where the time [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=2145.12s)]
*  when a Russian hooker peed on his face. And I don't know. Yes. I would say there's not a zero [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=2152.56s)]
*  chance of that. Maybe 1%. That's possible. But to me, first of all, it's like Trump is just like, [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=2158.24s)]
*  Trump likes Putin because Putin sucks up to him. Tootin helped him win. Putin's been on his side, [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=2164.48s)]
*  but then he gets annoyed with Putin sometimes because he doesn't do exactly what he wants. [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=2168.8799999999997s)]
*  And you know what I mean? He's like, he's a little bit like he is. He has a instinctive tendency [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=2172.56s)]
*  towards the strong man. He's been kind of schizophrenic on it. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=2177.92s)]
*  The rumor was that the hooker peed on the bed, not on his face. Let's not exaggerate. Okay. [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=2183.28s)]
*  I thought the rumor was the hooker peed on the other hooker that has two hookers. They're peeing [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=2188.56s)]
*  on each other. He was watching. I think they just peed on the bed this week. Why would they just be [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=2192.16s)]
*  on the bed? Clearly you've never been to a freak off Sam. What would be the, what would be the [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=2198.8s)]
*  sexual interest there? Like she just pee on the bed. Like it was a toilet, like just pop a squad [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=2203.6s)]
*  on top of the pillow. I've been to my share of ditty parties. Do not question my credentials on [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=2209.76s)]
*  this. Okay. No, I think we're going to have to go back to the top CA and fact check this one. [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=2214.48s)]
*  I'm pretty sure it would be one hooker peeing on another hooker. That would be the turn on, [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=2219.6800000000003s)]
*  I would think. See, this is why you should have had From on because he could have. [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=2224.7200000000003s)]
*  I don't think From would have gone down this path. What were we talking about? Oh, Trump. Is he [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=2231.2000000000003s)]
*  Russian asset? I don't know. He's not. I don't think so. But I think he does. I think he does. [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=2237.6s)]
*  I think he does like, I think he's partial to Putin though. I mean, is that, isn't that very [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=2241.8399999999997s)]
*  evident that he kind of, yeah, it's of course, I guess my point is like this part of the reason, [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=2246.48s)]
*  I guess I'm trying to say that like, he doesn't want to make the final decision that I'm [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=2251.12s)]
*  abandoning Ukraine. He wants it to have, he doesn't want to make any tough decisions. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=2256.7999999999997s)]
*  Yeah. He wants it to be like, you know, all of these little cuts and like slowly but surely the [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=2260.4s)]
*  Ukrainians lose access to our weapons. But then he can like kind of say to people, [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=2265.92s)]
*  but what's the end? Like, oh, he was the first one to do it. I don't like, I think he hoped [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=2270.2400000000002s)]
*  the Ukrainians just give Russia some land and we get our minerals and he gets the Nobel Peace Prize. [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=2275.6s)]
*  I think that's, I think that's, I think I don't doubt that he's obsessed with the Nobel Peace Prize. [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=2279.44s)]
*  Like, he's totally obsessed. I thought he doesn't like the elites. Well, no, he's the most obvious. [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=2284.2400000000002s)]
*  He so wants to be considered among the elites. I mean, it's such a driver of him. He just feels [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=2289.04s)]
*  like totally disrespected by that class that he needs to join it. [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=2297.2000000000003s)]
*  Speaking of Russian assets, I've got one piece of audio I do want to play for you. [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=2301.36s)]
*  Okay. [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=2305.44s)]
*  An interesting story. Candice Ellwins, one of my competitors in the podcast space. [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=2305.92s)]
*  She, we've talked about this, have you and I talked about this, her obsession with the [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=2312.4s)]
*  fact that Brigitte Macron is a man? Oh my God. You haven't. Yes. I'm upset. Yes. I'm obsessed [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=2317.2s)]
*  with this, but you're also going to be stepping on Will Summer, who's got original reporting [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=2322.3199999999997s)]

*  I don't want to give away too much Candice for listeners who are not, [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=2331.2799999999997s)]

*  like Candice, that one's isn't obsessed like with the question of Brigitte Macron being a man. [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=2338.64s)]
*  Um, I get the level of like me being obsessed with the nuggets or something. Like she has done a full [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=2344.8799999999997s)]
*  documentary on it. Like if you go to the YouTube page, it's like about as likely that it's about [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=2350.56s)]
*  this as any other issue. I mean, she has just totally embraced it as, as her cause celeb. [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=2356.16s)]
*  And so, um, she got, according to her, got a phone call from the president about this. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=2362.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=2366.9599999999996s)]
*  And I want to play the audio. [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=2367.4399999999996s)]
*  Okay. [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=2368.48s)]
*  President Donald J. Trump, he is calling me. He tells me that Emmanuel Macron is requesting [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=2369.04s)]
*  to his face. I stopped speaking about his wife. I said to him, you know, respectfully, [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=2374.72s)]
*  Mr. President, it's not my fault that he married someone with a penis. [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=2380.32s)]
*  Could that be real? I think it's real. I think it's real. I think Donald Trump called Candice [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=2389.2s)]
*  Owens and was like, I need you to do me a solid with Emmanuel Macron and stop talking about [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=2394.72s)]
*  whether his wife is secretly trans. [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=2400.56s)]
*  Again, I don't want to get ahead of our colleague. [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=2403.92s)]
*  How can you not get out of the reporting? It's our show. When is it going to come out? When's [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=2407.6s)]
*  the newsletters supposed to come out today? Great. This podcast comes out at three o'clock. [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=2411.92s)]
*  You're keeping a secret. [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=2417.12s)]
*  No, no, no, no, no, no, no. [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=2418.16s)]
*  Subscribe to the Bulwark people. [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=2419.12s)]
*  This is where you get the truth. [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=2420.56s)]
*  So Will has a newsletter today. That's not the Candice Owens thing. He has a [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=2422.16s)]
*  newsletter today that is so ridiculous. And this one I'm fine teasing because it will be out, [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=2426.88s)]
*  I think, by the time this podcast is out. Because newsletter today is about this report that Cash [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=2432.88s)]
*  Patel sent to Chuck Grassley about Chinese election interference in 2020. It's supposed [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=2437.04s)]
*  to be this groundbreaking report. And it turns out that the source of the stuff that the FBI was [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=2443.52s)]
*  investigating back in 2020 also may have pushed the rumor that the Chinese had built a bunch of [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=2450.6400000000003s)]
*  underground tunnels in America to spread the COVID virus. And that the issue of passing around [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=2456.8s)]
*  fake IDs was also an internet hoax that this person found. So clearly not the bombshell, [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=2463.6000000000004s)]
*  but Chuck Grassley ran with it anyway. That's his newsletter today. In addition to that has a story [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=2468.0s)]
*  come out of this Candice Owens stuff. I will say this. I think based on what Will has told me, [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=2473.1200000000003s)]
*  that it is likely true. That Trump called it. I think it's like the truth. I also think that... [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=2478.88s)]
*  Do you think Trump thinks it's true? I feel like yes. [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=2486.24s)]
*  I don't think Trump... I don't know what Trump thinks about her allegations. I do know that [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=2490.9599999999996s)]
*  McCrone, according to Will, McCrone has publicly talked about this, where it's like this woman, [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=2496.64s)]
*  this commenter needs to stop. And it's just so ridiculous. If ever there was a symbol of [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=2502.9599999999996s)]
*  how far we've fallen. The fact that Candice Owens is fucking around with geopolitical affairs and [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=2510.88s)]
*  has the president, two presidents, two heads of state, needing to respond to her absurd, [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=2516.8s)]
*  anti-trans commentary is... I don't know, man. We're in trouble. [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=2524.1600000000003s)]
*  Talk for me to also disentangle. So maybe this is what we'll look forward to in Will [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=2527.36s)]
*  Summer's newsletter, which I won't read till July 14th, because I'm going on the lookout. [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=2530.96s)]
*  You're going on that? Yeah, wow. [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=2535.28s)]
*  Her claim is that the peace in Ukraine was hinging on this in some way. And that [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=2536.56s)]
*  McCrone needed her to stop as part of, I don't know, maybe a negotiation with Putin. [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=2547.7599999999998s)]
*  I like that you try to make some sense. That's what you're here for. Yeah. [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=2553.68s)]
*  It's strange. The white nationalist affinity for Candice is another thing that, I don't know, [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=2558.7999999999997s)]
*  it's hard for me to wrap my head around. That one's easy to wrap around for me. [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=2563.92s)]
*  Oh yeah. But I won't get into it. [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=2567.36s)]
*  The husband? No, I think that she's black. [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=2568.8s)]
*  They like the fact that she kind of echoes what they say. [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=2573.04s)]
*  Interesting. A friend once asked me if I would rather my daughter grow up to be Candice Owens [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=2577.76s)]
*  or a stripper. Oh my God. [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=2584.0s)]
*  What would you, how would you feel about that one? [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=2586.08s)]
*  What the fuck? It's such a weird... [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=2588.4s)]
*  Would you rather your child grow up to be a conspiracy theorist, [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=2589.92s)]
*  MAGA commentator or a stripper? I don't even want to... [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=2593.6800000000003s)]
*  I can't believe if someone asked you this. How drunk were you guys for Raston? [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=2598.48s)]
*  I don't know, probably both. Yeah. [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=2604.7200000000003s)]
*  What are we supposed to chat about? It's a fucking tough world out there. [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=2607.6800000000003s)]
*  Which one would you go with? Oh man. [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=2611.04s)]
*  I'm a very serious one. What are the options here? [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=2614.16s)]
*  It's a stripper or a white nationalist podcast? [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=2616.16s)]
*  It's either going to grow up to be a white nationalist podcaster or a stripper, [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=2618.8s)]
*  like a Chippendales person. Yeah, because I have boys. [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=2625.44s)]
*  Chippendales. I'm definitely a Chippendales, [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=2628.6400000000003s)]
*  obviously. Yeah, not even a close call. [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=2630.2400000000002s)]
*  That's easy. This person was outraged at me, [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=2632.0s)]
*  actually, when they met and I made that suggestion. It didn't even take me as long as you. I was like, [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=2633.92s)]
*  are you fucking kidding me? A stripper. Amazing. Great. Great life. Whatever. [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=2637.92s)]
*  Yeah, own your body. Have you seen Anora? She seems awesome. [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=2641.76s)]
*  They'd rather be an Oran mom than Candace. Yeah, she really struck gold there. [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=2646.4s)]
*  Anora went through some issues, but I don't want to spoil it for people. Great movie. [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=2652.72s)]
*  Okay. We're going to close with some seriousness. Are you ready? This would [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=2658.7999999999997s)]
*  have been better with David from, but we're going to do it with you. [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=2661.7599999999998s)]
*  The whole pod would have been better, really, but that's okay. [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=2664.48s)]
*  You pod with the guest that you have. It is the fourth union. [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=2669.2s)]
*  Oh, wow. Okay. This is the fourth of July podcast. I have as a former Republican. [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=2672.7200000000003s)]
*  I guess, let me ask you this first. Does the patriotism of the bulwark make you uncomfortable [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=2680.88s)]
*  as part of your transition here? You know, the jingoism. [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=2685.36s)]
*  The jingoism. We're not jingoistic. No, we're patriotic. I don't know. No, of course not. [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=2691.76s)]
*  I love this country. Okay. I do too. So unfortunately, during campaigns, I would [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=2698.72s)]
*  read to the staffers from the letter from Thomas Jefferson to Roger Waitman on the 50th anniversary [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=2703.7599999999998s)]
*  of the declaration. You familiar with that letter? Fucking loser. No, it's fucking. It's really [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=2709.3599999999997s)]
*  something. It's truly a banger. If you want. I mean, obviously when you read it, you start to [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=2713.9199999999996s)]
*  think about the elements in which Thomas Jefferson did not live up to the message of the letter. [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=2720.3199999999997s)]
*  Even still, it says a lot about what we're trying to be. So I'm going to read a part to you right [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=2727.28s)]
*  now. And I would like to get your reaction. Do I need to get some tissues ready? If you want to, [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=2732.7200000000003s)]
*  it's up to you. I mean, I've made several people cry on this podcast recently. So it could happen [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=2737.28s)]
*  to you. He's talking about what the fourth of July should mean. I think he dies the next fourth of [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=2744.7200000000003s)]
*  July. He says to Waitman, may it be to the world what I believe it will be to some part sooner to [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=2751.04s)]
*  others later, but finally to all the signal of arousing men to burst the chains under which [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=2757.7599999999998s)]
*  monkish ignorance and superstition had persuaded them to bind themselves and to assume the [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=2764.64s)]
*  blessings and security of self-government. The mass of mankind has not been born with saddles [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=2769.92s)]
*  on their backs, nor a favored few booted and spurred ready to ride them legitimately. [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=2774.88s)]
*  These are the grounds of hope for others. For ourselves, let the annual return of this day [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=2779.36s)]
*  forever refresh our recollection of these rights and an undiminished devotion to them. Do you feel [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=2784.88s)]
*  like this fourth of July, we are going to forever refresh our recollection of the rights of the [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=2790.96s)]
*  declaration? Do you see that spirit in the country right now? No, I don't. It's difficult time to be [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=2797.52s)]
*  in here. I don't want to be too negative about things, but I think you have to be realistic [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=2803.52s)]
*  that we're in a bad spot. I guess the thing that really gets me is what we're doing to [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=2809.12s)]
*  migrant communities. I just find that to be not in the spirit of what that Jefferson letter [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=2818.16s)]
*  represented. Also, I guess, and I don't want to be too, I don't know what the word is, but [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=2826.72s)]
*  I find the discourse in the way that we're conducting the political conversations that [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=2837.6800000000003s)]
*  we're having with each other to be really depressing too. I don't know if that's historically [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=2843.36s)]
*  different than any other time. I'm sure we're not beating each other with canes. I know that's [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=2850.88s)]
*  always the thing that they say, but I do find people are just nasty to each other in a way that [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=2854.7200000000003s)]
*  I find really unfortunate. I think we basically have forgotten how to learn to talk to each other. [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=2861.76s)]
*  It's pretty bad. Yeah, I just looked at this and I did a separate thing. People should go check out [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=2869.0400000000004s)]
*  the blog, Takes Feed if you want to really cry. I did a separate thing on the Kilmara-Brega-Garcia [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=2874.0800000000004s)]
*  lawsuit where he makes a lot of allegations about what happened in Sokote to him. Who knows exactly [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=2878.48s)]
*  what the truth is of it that he paints an extremely bleak picture. To me, when I think about the [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=2885.04s)]
*  letter and the most distressing thing to me about all of it is no matter, there was something to be [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=2892.56s)]
*  said for the fact that we were flawed, we fucked up, we did Abu Ghraib, we didn't let Jews in after [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=2899.6s)]
*  World War II, we didn't, Thomas Jefferson fathered a slave's kid. It was not that we were a perfect [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=2906.4s)]
*  country. There was an aspiration that was like we are going to try to do this, not just for us, [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=2912.32s)]
*  but for people who want to come here and Jefferson's telling for people around the world [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=2920.32s)]
*  that these are grounds for hope for others, that they can also be blessed with these rights. [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=2924.7200000000003s)]
*  And now, the thing to me that is the most disheartening with Trump, they have dispensed [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=2931.6000000000004s)]
*  even with the notion that we should aim for this. That it's like actually who gives a fuck if others [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=2938.64s)]
*  have saddles on their back. It's a virtue to go after those people with Trump. [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=2948.4s)]
*  Yeah, and it's a virtue and you're mocked actually. In his speech in the Middle East, you're mocked [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=2953.6s)]
*  if you say that we want these rights for others. Not just like, oh, we don't want regime chain wars [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=2959.7599999999998s)]

*  have the rights and the blessings of the declaration is now something that is derided. And to me, [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=2973.2s)]
*  that is the sad part. That's a really interesting point. It's a really interesting point. [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=2980.0s)]
*  To even think that way makes you either unrealistic or naive. Yeah. And it kind of saps you of any [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=2984.88s)]
*  sense of idealism and it just reduces you to their level of cynicism. And that is actually [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=2994.56s)]
*  pretty sad. I won't be reduced. I will be half a world away though on this one. [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=3001.68s)]
*  Congrats. Thank you so much. You guys survived the week without me. Do you think you can do it? [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=3006.08s)]
*  Do you think you'll be okay? I think I'll live. Will I be replaced when I come back, do you think? [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=3011.2799999999997s)]
*  You'll live? I'll be fine. Will your life be better or worse without me next week, do you think, Sam? [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=3014.96s)]
*  I'll probably have to do more takes, but I think that's going to be okay. I'll be all right. I'm [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=3018.88s)]
*  going to make it. Do you have any vacations planned? No. August. God, I got to get out of town. [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=3024.1600000000003s)]
*  You got to do it. All right. And I owe your wife one. So we'll cover for you. Thank you for coming [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=3031.28s)]
*  in this morning for an early call. I appreciate you very much. Everybody else. We'll be back here [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHs6fFGXhE8&t=3036.48s)]
