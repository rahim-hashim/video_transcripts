# The GOP Tried to Silence Him. Now Heâ€™s Fighting Back! (w/ Justin Jones)
**The Bulwark Podcast:** [May 30, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ)
*  When I was expelled, my message, they said, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=0.0s)]
*  what is your message to your Republican colleagues? [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=1.8s)]
*  And my message to them is a message [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=3.88s)]
*  I want to share with you. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=5.08s)]
*  I've just been kicked out of my job [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=6.32s)]
*  in this unprecedented expulsion. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=8.16s)]
*  I said, I want my Republican colleagues to know [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=9.52s)]
*  that I'm fighting for their children and grandchildren too. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=12.72s)]
*  And each time we walk into that building, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=15.24s)]
*  that's what makes us different from them. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=16.8s)]
*  Is that we're not, we are not this tribalist [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=18.12s)]
*  and we want to destroy you, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=20.04s)]
*  that we want you to be oblivious. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=21.080000000000002s)]
*  We want your children to have quality public education. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=22.56s)]
*  We want them to have clean water and access to health care. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=25.04s)]
*  We want your children to be free [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=26.92s)]
*  from the terror of school shootings. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=28.080000000000002s)]
*  We're fighting for your children and grandchildren too. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=29.56s)]
*  And that's what makes us different than them. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=31.36s)]
*  Okay. How many people actually live in Davidson County? [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=33.160000000000004s)]
*  All right. Okay. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=44.16s)]
*  Now who lives in Justin's district? [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=46.760000000000005s)]
*  All right. All right. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=50.32s)]
*  We've got some constituents in the room. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=51.88s)]
*  Okay. Well, thanks everyone for being here. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=53.519999999999996s)]
*  Thank you for being here. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=56.24s)]
*  I want to start off with just what's been going [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=58.160000000000004s)]
*  on in the state over the past few weeks. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=61.760000000000005s)]
*  The ICE raids. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=64.88000000000001s)]
*  I'm sure most of you in the room have heard about those. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=66.16s)]
*  Talk to me about what happened in your district a few weeks ago [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=69.24000000000001s)]
*  and what your initial reaction was when you got [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=72.88000000000001s)]
*  that first phone call that there was these ICE raids going on. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=75.28s)]
*  About 500 people get pulled over, 200 arrested. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=78.0s)]
*  What was your reaction? [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=80.80000000000001s)]
*  Well, first of all, I just want to say thank you all for being here [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=82.52000000000001s)]
*  from the bulwark, recognize the importance of the South, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=85.52000000000001s)]
*  particularly in this moment. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=87.8s)]
*  Thank you all for showing up. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=89.12s)]
*  We'll get to that too. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=90.44s)]
*  We will get to that. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=91.72s)]
*  But as we know here in Nashville, we've had terror in our community. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=93.04s)]
*  196 of our neighbors were taken mostly in the dark of night [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=97.36s)]
*  by officers who never identified themselves in coordination [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=102.24000000000001s)]
*  with the Tennessee Highway Patrol [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=105.04s)]
*  and the predominantly immigrant part of our community, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=106.60000000000001s)]
*  which is the district I represent from East Nashville to Anyok. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=108.52000000000001s)]
*  District 52, the District of Resistance is what we call it. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=111.08000000000001s)]
*  And we were told of five names. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=114.36s)]
*  But what about the other 191 people who were like church members [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=117.28s)]
*  on Owensville Road, a volunteer man who was arrested on his birthday, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=122.16s)]
*  an elder, a mother who was a cook in a kitchen, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=125.48s)]
*  a man who had worked an overtime shift at Walmart, taken, stolen? [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=128.0s)]
*  Over 100 of them were told that they had committed no crime ever. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=132.04s)]
*  And yet we have these criminals named Kristi Noem and Andy Ogles [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=135.88s)]
*  and Gino Busso and Jack Johnson telling us that they are criminals [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=143.32s)]
*  because five people, they said, were committed to crime. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=147.0s)]
*  If that was the case, then the Republican Party would be called a criminal party [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=149.32s)]
*  because we have Glen Casta charged with over a dozen felonies. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=152.56s)]
*  We have Brian Kelsey convicted and charged of felonies. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=157.32s)]
*  We have Scotty Campbell, who resigned, the vice chairman of the Republican [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=160.56s)]
*  caucus for committing sexual harassment. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=164.64s)]
*  We have Jeremy Durham, who resigned because dozens of cases [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=166.56s)]
*  of sexual harassment and now just charged with DUI. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=169.24s)]
*  If they want to talk about criminality, they don't need a press conference. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=171.84s)]
*  The Republicans in Tennessee need a mirror. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=174.44s)]
*  That's what they need. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=176.6s)]
*  You mentioned Andy Ogles. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=177.36s)]
*  And the other Justin Boyle mentioned his press conference [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=180.2s)]
*  that he had over the holiday weekend. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=183.6s)]
*  And I want to read this tweet that he posted. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=184.72s)]
*  He tweeted and this is at our mayor, Freddie O'Connell, who, of course, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=187.64000000000001s)]
*  he's now saying he wants a congressional investigation [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=191.12s)]
*  into how the mayor handled these ICE raids. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=194.44s)]
*  He tweeted, if you're helping violent gangs destroy Tennessee [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=197.2s)]
*  by obstructing ICE, you belong behind bars. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=200.36s)]
*  What can local officials do in this situation to help the immigrant [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=203.96s)]
*  community when you have someone like Ogles tweeting that at our mayor? [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=208.92000000000002s)]
*  Yeah. First of all, Andy should be very familiar with the need for law and order [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=213.76000000000002s)]
*  because he was somebody who was being investigated by the FBI that coincidentally [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=217.60000000000002s)]
*  it went away when Trump came to office. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=221.0s)]
*  But he's very familiar with criminal behavior. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=223.32000000000002s)]
*  Someone who stole money from a children's charity and lied about his resume [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=224.96s)]
*  and committed campaign fraud. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=228.32000000000002s)]
*  So he knows about criminality. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=229.44s)]
*  But what we want to say is that I have a very different position because I think [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=231.24s)]
*  one thing that the expulsions taught me in twenty twenty three, those of you know, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=236.28s)]
*  we were expelled from the Tennessee House for doing our job, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=238.88s)]
*  for standing up to this Republican supermajority. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=241.76s)]
*  And my advice to Mayor Freddie O'Connell would be that you face a crossroads, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=244.16s)]
*  either capitulate to authoritarianism or choose courage. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=248.64s)]
*  And I want to tell my brother, Freddie O'Connell, that [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=253.64s)]
*  cowardice asks the question, is it safe? [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=259.0s)]
*  Expediency asks the question, is it political? [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=263.15999999999997s)]
*  Vanity asks the question, is it popular? [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=266.52s)]
*  But conscience asks the question, is it right? [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=268.24s)]
*  And so when the mayor is saying, oh, you know, I don't want to. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=271.24s)]
*  I don't want to do anything that they find unlawful. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=275.64s)]
*  Let us be clear that their actions are unlawful. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=278.12s)]
*  Violating the 14th Amendment is unlawful. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=280.03999999999996s)]
*  Violating equal protection of the law and due process is unlawful. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=282.08s)]
*  What the ICE and our Tennessee Highway Patrol are doing to our immigrant [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=285.03999999999996s)]
*  neighbors is unlawful. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=287.88s)]
*  And so I say to the mayor, do not back down, do not apologize. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=288.8s)]
*  Because when we got expelled, I'll tell you a secret, something that's not really [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=292.12s)]
*  a secret, but something that wasn't really publicized, is that one of the [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=294.71999999999997s)]
*  heartbreaking things is when we stood in the well of the house after they [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=297.52s)]
*  cut off our microphone on the half house floor after three nine-year-olds and [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=303.52s)]
*  three adults were killed at the Cumnet School, we went to the house floor with a [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=306.52s)]
*  megaphone because we wanted to amplify the voices of those young people who are [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=309.64s)]
*  saying, do something, do something. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=313.24s)]
*  And the sad part is it was members of our own caucus, our Democratic caucus [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=315.56s)]
*  leadership who said, you should apologize to the Republican leadership and say, [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=319.56s)]
*  you didn't know better, you were young. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=323.12s)]
*  And I said, Cameron Sexton should apologize. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=326.03999999999996s)]
*  And, and you know, title, this title of being a representative is nice. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=330.56s)]
*  The title of being a mayor is nice, but your purpose is better and you must be [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=333.4s)]
*  willing to risk your title for your purpose. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=336.32s)]
*  And that's my message to the mayor. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=338.2s)]
*  You mentioned that, um, Democratic power in the South. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=341.35999999999996s)]
*  We're sitting in the South right now. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=344.52s)]
*  And I think everyone in this room probably knows something very interesting has been [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=345.92s)]
*  going on in the South over the past few years. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=349.16s)]
*  There are a lot of people moving to the region. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=351.4s)]
*  I'm a transplant. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=354.16s)]
*  You are a transplant. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=354.96s)]
*  We love a good transplant in Nashville. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=356.0s)]
*  Um, but that's going to have political ramifications for the country. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=358.44s)]
*  In the coming years, the whole South is going to probably gain a [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=362.15999999999997s)]
*  few congressional seats. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=365.72s)]
*  And that means that if Democrats ever want to control the house again, if a [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=367.56s)]
*  Democratic president ever wants to get elected after the 2030 census, they're [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=371.16s)]
*  going to have to make some real serious inroads in the South. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=375.36s)]
*  So I guess my question for you is how screwed are Democrats? [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=380.12s)]
*  First of all, I'm physically new to the South, but my lineage is from the South. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=387.56s)]
*  And my, I just want to say the name of my grandmother, cause I would not be who I [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=391.44000000000005s)]
*  am without my grandmother, Harriet. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=393.96000000000004s)]
*  And my family fled the South during Jim Crow moved to Chicago from Tennessee and [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=395.16s)]
*  then moved to California. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=399.04s)]
*  And so I say, my ancestors call me back here because even though Jim Crow's over, [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=399.96s)]
*  now we face Jim Crow son named James Crow esquire, which is more sophisticated and [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=404.23999999999995s)]
*  subtle, but it's just as dangerous as Jim Crow. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=408.56s)]
*  And what I would say is that it's important. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=411.68s)]
*  You know, I've been traveling the country a lot. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=415.2s)]
*  I was just in Buffalo speaking at the university for their graduation. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=416.44s)]
*  I've been, I was just in Colorado. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=418.91999999999996s)]
*  And so often I hear people say, Oh, just let the South succeed right off the South. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=420.52s)]
*  And I always tell them, um, number one, as somebody who represents a very diverse [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=423.88s)]
*  district, I know that the majority of black people in this nation live in the South. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=427.44s)]
*  I know that if you want to change this nation, you must change the South. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=430.96s)]
*  If we study the abolition of slavery and reconstruction to the civil rights [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=433.28s)]
*  movement, this has been the frontline of our democracy. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=436.76s)]
*  And the reason, um, why there is so much repression in the South is because they [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=439.15999999999997s)]
*  know that if we come together as black and white, indigenous Latino, that we can [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=443.59999999999997s)]
*  build a new South. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=447.15999999999997s)]
*  And I always tell people, you hear that saying from George Wallace and all these [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=448.52s)]
*  Southern governors, they said, the South's going to rise again. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=451.64s)]
*  The South's going to rise again. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=453.44s)]
*  I say, no, we, we reject that. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=454.47999999999996s)]
*  And we say that the South's going to rise anew, a South that is multiracial, [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=456.40000000000003s)]
*  multi-faith, multi-generational, pro-justice, anti-poverty, pro-queer. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=459.16s)]
*  That's the South that we can build. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=463.28000000000003s)]
*  And so, and so my message to the national Democrats as they look, it's come South [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=465.68s)]
*  because if we can change the South, we can change this nation. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=471.36s)]
*  This has been the blueprint. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=473.44000000000005s)]
*  That's why, um, they came up with a Southern strategy to try and divide and conquer us. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=474.28000000000003s)]
*  But we've only been a Republican super majority since 2010 in Tennessee. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=477.88s)]
*  This is still relatively new. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=480.92s)]
*  We can go back, the pendulum can shift. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=482.76000000000005s)]
*  And let's tell one more truth is that Tennessee is not a red state, but it's a [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=485.04s)]
*  state that, that ranks 15 voter turnout where one in five black people cannot [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=488.40000000000003s)]
*  vote because of voter suppression that has been gerrymandered to oblivion. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=492.36s)]
*  And that's the only reason they keep power. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=496.24s)]
*  They're not a powerful majority. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=497.44s)]
*  They are a very fragile party that's cheated their way into power. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=499.0s)]
*  And I think that's the truth that needs to be said. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=502.36s)]
*  I want to dig into that a bit more because in case you all weren't aware, [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=504.32s)]
*  Donald Trump won this state by 900,000 votes. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=509.68s)]
*  You could literally drop another Memphis or Nashville in the state and he would still win. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=513.64s)]
*  So what is the state's party and what do you think Democrats in the state should [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=518.92s)]
*  be doing to broaden the base statewide? [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=522.4s)]
*  Cause there are a lot of rural voters here. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=524.92s)]
*  There are a lot of conservative voters here. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=526.68s)]
*  There are a lot of independent voters here. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=528.04s)]
*  And I think the reality is that if Democrats want to compete statewide, they're [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=529.92s)]
*  going to have to get some of those voters to come into their camp. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=532.9599999999999s)]
*  That's exactly it. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=536.0799999999999s)]
*  And one of the greatest blessings that Cameron Sexton gave me was that, um, after [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=537.0799999999999s)]
*  the expulsion, he, um, he decided to punish me and took me off education committee, [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=542.28s)]
*  took me off government operations committee and put me on agriculture committee. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=545.64s)]
*  And the agriculture committee was supposed to be a punishment because I knew [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=549.48s)]
*  absolutely nothing about agriculture. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=551.9599999999999s)]
*  I live in an urban district, but it's been the most powerful place to organize [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=553.1999999999999s)]
*  rural and urban coalitions that can transform the state. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=556.92s)]
*  What we as Democrats have to do is that we have to go to territory that is not [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=562.76s)]
*  always comfortable, that was not always familiar to us. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=567.1999999999999s)]
*  When I was put on this committee, one of the first places I went was to [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=569.3199999999999s)]
*  Columbia, Tennessee, the only member of our committee to stand with the folks [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=571.2s)]
*  in Columbia when they're trying to pollute the duck river, the most [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=573.88s)]
*  biodiverse river in North America. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=576.1600000000001s)]
*  And it, it, it, a river that they were trying to build a landfill on a [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=577.6800000000001s)]
*  former Monsanto site, met with cattle farmers. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=580.44s)]
*  I remember walking in to homes of some cattle farmers on the duck river where [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=582.6s)]
*  they had Fox News on some of them. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=586.2800000000001s)]
*  Some folks had Confederate flags there. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=587.8000000000001s)]
*  I said, let me get out of here before it gets dark, but you know, I'm here now. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=589.48s)]
*  Um, but, but what I learned is that they had, they had a stereotypes about me. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=592.72s)]
*  I had stereotypes about them. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=597.0400000000001s)]
*  And I went to that committee. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=598.72s)]
*  I mean, I went to that community as a member of the agriculture committee and [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=600.1600000000001s)]
*  the members of the committee were terrified. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=603.6s)]
*  They're like, you don't represent that district. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=604.76s)]
*  Why are you going down there? [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=606.84s)]
*  You're building relationship. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=607.72s)]
*  You know, I had a, they took me in a gator across all these farms, introduced me [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=609.08s)]
*  to these cattle farmers saying, you're the only one who showed up to fight for us. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=611.6s)]
*  That's what we have to do. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=614.6800000000001s)]
*  Just this year we were able, we were able to defeat. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=615.72s)]
*  This is some good news. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=620.0s)]
*  This year we were able to defeat one of the worst bills this session. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=620.84s)]
*  It was a bill to give, um, immunity to Bayer who was now owns Monsanto. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=623.0400000000001s)]
*  When they, when our farmers get cancer and Parkinson's and sick from their pesticides [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=628.0s)]
*  and rusty girls try to push this bill through. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=633.4s)]
*  We worked with Republicans in those communities, farmers who, who said, we [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=635.44s)]
*  thought you were just as extremist. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=639.4s)]
*  They told us that you just want to burn the capital down. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=640.8000000000001s)]
*  We didn't know, you know, we didn't know you. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=642.9200000000001s)]
*  And I said, you know, this is, this is how we can win is by going and, and [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=645.36s)]
*  lifting up these, these ideas of what I call agrarian populism. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=648.4s)]
*  That's how we're going to transform this state. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=651.88s)]
*  And I have hope, um, because once I got back from these counties, every time I [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=653.6800000000001s)]
*  get back from Pulaski Columbia, we had a rally down in, um, Bradley County, [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=657.72s)]
*  when the Reddes counties, um, one of the Republicans tweeted, I didn't know [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=662.1600000000001s)]
*  there's this many Democrats in our County. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=665.96s)]
*  You know, we have to go and play offense and show up. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=668.08s)]
*  And, and, and I'll tell you the truth. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=670.8000000000001s)]
*  It will, it will terrify them. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=672.6s)]
*  Once we get outside of Davidson County, once we get outside of Shelby County [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=674.0400000000001s)]
*  and go to their districts and say, did you know that rusty grills [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=676.72s)]
*  voted to poison farmers? [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=680.0400000000001s)]
*  Did you know that clay dog had voted to privatize our education [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=681.2s)]
*  and steal from our public schools? [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=684.44s)]
*  We have to go there and let them know that we're fighting for them. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=685.44s)]
*  And the last thing I'll say is that when I was expelled, my message, they said, [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=687.96s)]
*  what is your message to your Republican colleagues? [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=690.5200000000001s)]
*  And my message to them is the message I want to share with you. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=692.6s)]
*  I had just been kicked out of my job. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=695.08s)]
*  Um, and this unprecedented expulsion, I said, I want my Republican colleagues to [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=696.72s)]
*  know that I'm fighting for their children and grandchildren too. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=699.96s)]
*  And each time we walk into that building, that's what makes us different from them. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=704.0s)]
*  It's that we're not, we are not this tribalist and we want to destroy you that [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=706.84s)]
*  we want you to be oblivious. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=709.96s)]
*  We want your children to have quality public education. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=711.2800000000001s)]
*  We want them to have clean water and access to health care. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=713.8s)]
*  We want your children to be free from the terror of school shootings. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=715.68s)]
*  We're fighting for your children and grandchildren too. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=718.24s)]

*  In the meantime, before, before Democrats went back to Tennessee at some point, in [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=723.9599999999999s)]
*  the meantime, the reality is that Republicans control pretty much everything [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=730.88s)]
*  in the state. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=734.8s)]
*  You have to work with Republicans if you want to get anything done. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=735.1999999999999s)]
*  How do you approach your relationships with the state Republicans that you have [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=738.0799999999999s)]
*  to see when you're, when you're in session and how do you think about [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=743.08s)]
*  reaching across the aisle when that's the really the only option to get any [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=746.6s)]
*  bills passed right now? [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=750.64s)]
*  See, I have a different mindset. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=752.8000000000001s)]
*  Um, they like to, as soon as you walk into the Capitol, you'll see minority caucus. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=754.36s)]
*  We're the mine. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=758.48s)]
*  They call us the minority caucus. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=758.9200000000001s)]
*  And, and, and I said, you know, I like what they say in England better in [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=760.6800000000001s)]
*  England, they say we are the opposition party. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=763.88s)]
*  Our role is to be a check on your power, to be a speed bump as you try and drive [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=766.1600000000001s)]
*  this train of our state over the cliff. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=769.9200000000001s)]
*  And so, you know, Jack Johnson, I'll never forget my first week in the legislature. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=771.48s)]
*  He taught me a very important lesson. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=775.08s)]
*  He's a horrible person, but even our enemies can teach us, can [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=776.24s)]
*  teach us something. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=778.72s)]
*  Um, I was on the elevator. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=779.84s)]
*  I think I had my white suit on. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=780.7600000000001s)]
*  I was going to my first committee meeting. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=781.8000000000001s)]
*  I was excited, a little nervous and he was on the elevator and, um, his welcome [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=783.36s)]
*  to me was saying, Jones, I want you to know that you're worthless and you're [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=788.88s)]
*  not supposed to be here. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=793.08s)]
*  And that was his welcome to me. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=795.24s)]
*  My first week in the legislature, but I actually appreciate. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=796.72s)]
*  Senator Johnson now, cause at that point I didn't know what to say. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=799.9599999999999s)]
*  I went to glorious office. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=802.0s)]
*  I was like, you know, this just happened. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=803.04s)]
*  I mean, overt racism, ages, all the, all the isms. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=804.7199999999999s)]
*  And I didn't know what, how to respond, but I actually appreciate him because he [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=808.4s)]
*  taught me a very important lesson in that legislature that I'm not there to make [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=811.4s)]
*  friends, I'm there to make change for my district and I'm willing to work with [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=814.28s)]
*  Republicans in the community. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=818.24s)]
*  But I know that that party in there is a party that is drunk with power. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=819.16s)]
*  And there is, there is no, there is no way that we can, can work with people who, [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=821.8399999999999s)]
*  who are so arrogant, who have so much hubris that even when their own [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=825.76s)]
*  Republicans vote against vouchers, they kick them out of their committees and [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=828.44s)]
*  kick them out of their office space. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=832.0400000000001s)]
*  When their own Republicans speak out, they're punished. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=833.0400000000001s)]
*  People like Todd Warner from Chapel Hill, who has been ostracized because he [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=835.4000000000001s)]
*  daresay that vouchers are going to destroy his rural school district. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=838.8000000000001s)]
*  I mean, this is a party that is, that's not willing to work with us. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=841.44s)]
*  That sees us as subjects that sees us as people. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=844.12s)]
*  Um, another thing in the legislature, you come in committee rooms, all the [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=846.32s)]
*  Republicans are set out to die above us and we're supposed to sit below them. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=850.0s)]
*  As this unspoken rule, I sit next to them because I want to know that we are [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=853.6800000000001s)]
*  colleagues, that we are equals and that we are not below them, that we got here [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=856.44s)]
*  the same way we represent the same amount of people and that we have an obligation [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=859.48s)]
*  to stand up for our constituents. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=863.84s)]
*  Article two, Article two, section 27 of the Tennessee constitution says that [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=866.84s)]
*  every lawmaker has a right to dissent from and protest against legislation that [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=871.7600000000001s)]
*  is injurious to the people and to have their dissent marked in the journal of [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=874.96s)]
*  the house. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=877.8800000000001s)]
*  And so every time we speak up, every opportunity we have, I speak up for my [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=878.24s)]
*  district because I know that we may not win this vote, but I know that when [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=881.8800000000001s)]
*  history sees us at this moment, my children and grandchildren know that we [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=885.12s)]
*  stood up for them and that we, that they were, that not all of us were insane in [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=887.6s)]
*  this time. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=891.4s)]
*  And I hope, and what I know too is that we're winning over some of their [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=892.08s)]
*  children. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=894.96s)]
*  Um, Senator, I'll just say names. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=895.48s)]
*  I'm just honest. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=897.52s)]
*  Senator Gartenhire stopped me. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=898.12s)]
*  I was in the governor's office for Christmas. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=899.04s)]
*  He said, um, can I take a picture with you? [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=900.4s)]
*  Cause I try to convince my son to not like you, but he supports you. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=902.28s)]
*  So I want to show him, I want to show him that we know each other. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=905.0s)]
*  And so we're winning their children. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=907.76s)]
*  Why do you think they're banning books? [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=909.48s)]
*  Why do you think they're trying to restrict curriculum? [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=911.04s)]
*  Cause we're winning their children. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=912.64s)]
*  They know that they, their time is limited, that the clock is ticking, that [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=913.68s)]
*  people like Paul Scherl who says we need to bring back lynching, those days are [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=916.92s)]
*  over, that their time is running out. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=919.8399999999999s)]
*  And so they have to cheat their way and voters are pressed, but these are not [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=922.5999999999999s)]
*  powerful people. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=924.76s)]
*  Cause if you're a powerful, you will not have to shut off microphones when you [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=925.3599999999999s)]
*  somebody disagrees with you. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=927.64s)]
*  So given that, is there actually any path forward to getting something like [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=929.76s)]
*  gun legislation passed, or is that just kind of not going to happen right now? [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=935.16s)]
*  I think we judge our victories by the bad bills. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=939.5999999999999s)]
*  We stop. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=941.5999999999999s)]
*  I think that is what we are now. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=942.12s)]
*  There's 24 members of our caucus, 23 when Johnny Shaw forgets he's a Democrat. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=943.6s)]
*  And so, and so, and so I think we, we have to be honest about where we are. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=947.8000000000001s)]
*  And what we have to do is like what we're trying to do when I add committees, [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=952.72s)]
*  build coalitions with their people in their district. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=955.48s)]
*  That's, you know, that's how advocates we want to shout on uplift. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=957.5600000000001s)]
*  We're able to defeat that horrible asinine bill that was going to stop [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=961.32s)]
*  undocumented kids from going to school. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=964.08s)]
*  That was the feet of this session. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=965.32s)]
*  What a powerful victory that the Monsanto Monsanto cancer, you know, act, [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=966.5600000000001s)]
*  whatever they want to call it. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=971.68s)]
*  That was the feet of this year. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=973.1999999999999s)]
*  You know, there were bad bills stop and we have to judge our victories, [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=974.48s)]
*  not just based off of what we passed. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=976.96s)]
*  Cause some of my colleagues do see that you win by based off of what you pass. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=978.6s)]
*  And so they'll pass a bill that says we're going to put a marker here, [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=981.88s)]
*  a historical marker, which is beautiful, but I want to see the material [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=985.92s)]
*  conditions change for my constituents. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=988.76s)]
*  And so I'm not willing to silence myself in order to pass a symbolic resolution. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=990.16s)]
*  And so I think we have to realize too, that our victories can be judged based [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=993.8s)]
*  off of the coalitions we're building. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=996.76s)]
*  How many people are we bringing with us? [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=998.08s)]
*  Who are the new people were engaging in this process to come testify as so many [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=1000.0799999999999s)]
*  people I've traveled the state. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=1004.12s)]
*  Um, I remember I was in a tele Homa. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=1006.0799999999999s)]
*  I think Ms. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=1008.68s)]
*  Janice and she was with me and this man came out this restaurant, this meeting [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=1009.1999999999999s)]
*  three, and he looked like he was from Doug dynasty. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=1011.88s)]
*  And I said, Oh Lord, he's like, he's like coming up to our table. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=1014.16s)]
*  I was like, Oh Lord, just, he's going to say something. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=1017.0s)]
*  He said, keep up the good trouble in tele Homa. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=1019.04s)]
*  See that the South will always surprise you. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=1022.7199999999999s)]
*  That's a victory. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=1025.44s)]
*  When we win over their people, when we play offense, when we let them know that [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=1027.44s)]
*  we are building a coalition that can defeat this coalition of hate and fear [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=1031.04s)]
*  and division by building a coalition based off of solidarity and showing up [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=1034.96s)]
*  for each other, I think that's how we judge our victories. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=1038.0s)]
*  And I think that the tide is going to shift because they're getting so [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=1040.28s)]
*  arrogant with power that even their own voters are, are Republicans are saying, [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=1042.8s)]
*  you know, defecting and saying, this is getting too extreme for me. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=1046.64s)]
*  And I think this voucher bill is going to help us. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=1049.2s)]
*  I think, you know, this, this was happening at the federal level, 25% [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=1050.8s)]
*  increase price on fertilizer because of these tariff wars. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=1054.56s)]
*  So many of our farmers had these grants with USAID that have been cut. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=1057.48s)]
*  Now they're struggling with their soybeans. Where are they going to send these? [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=1060.48s)]
*  I mean, they're hurting too. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=1062.56s)]
*  And so I think this is the opportunity not to say we were right. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=1063.52s)]
*  We told you so, but to say, welcome, welcome to this movement. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=1065.84s)]
*  You're always welcome here. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=1068.76s)]
*  I've got one more question for you and then we'll invite our friends back up. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=1073.12s)]
*  But when you got kicked out, that was obviously a moment for you to, [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=1075.68s)]
*  you had this huge national profile. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=1080.56s)]
*  You have this ability to raise money on the national level. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=1082.32s)]
*  How have you thought about leveraging that new national profile and using that [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=1085.44s)]
*  to really build up the Tennessee state party to support other candidates locally? [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=1090.12s)]
*  How do you view your role now in the state party? [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=1093.36s)]
*  I think my loyalty is to the movement. And so just this past election, [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=1097.76s)]
*  we, some people who recruited to run who won are my dear sister, [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=1102.6399999999999s)]
*  Shondell Brooks, who lost her son in the Waffle House mass shooting. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=1106.16s)]
*  The first woman of color to represent her district, [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=1109.0s)]
*  a powerful advocate for common sense gun laws. We were able to recruit it. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=1111.3999999999999s)]
*  Even Democrats said someone like that could not win that district. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=1114.1999999999998s)]
*  I said, we have to change the face of who is in power, who are in these halls. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=1116.32s)]
*  And so she won. We had our dear sister, [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=1119.6799999999998s)]
*  Gabby Salinas, the first Latino member of the Democratic caucus to be elected. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=1121.8799999999999s)]
*  So we're changing the face of the party, [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=1125.36s)]
*  bringing in people who are closer to the pain should be more proximate to the [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=1127.08s)]
*  power and changing the tradition of what it means to be a lawmaker. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=1130.08s)]
*  And so that's what we're doing. I think that that is where my loyalty is too, [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=1133.8799999999999s)]
*  is because I want to see people who are not doing it just for a title, [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=1136.3999999999999s)]
*  who are doing it, who have the heart and who are willing to risk something. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=1139.76s)]
*  Because that's what is required at this time. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=1142.72s)]
*  It's not to do something that's comfortable that our democracy requires [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=1144.32s)]
*  disruption. People are disruptive, even with their mere presence, [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=1147.4s)]
*  even with their mere story to say that, hold on, we dissent. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=1150.6000000000001s)]
*  We did. We offer an alternative narrative to your dominant narrative of fear [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=1153.64s)]
*  and oppression. And I think that's what we have to do. And so. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=1156.88s)]
*  And, you know, the other thing too, is, you know, we've been able to raise money [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=1162.08s)]
*  because we're not accepting these corporate PAC dollars. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=1165.16s)]
*  The majority of people spend their time calling all these corporate PACs on the [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=1167.52s)]
*  Hill. They have these big fundraisers with people who are against the interests [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=1170.0s)]
*  of our constituents. I've rejected all that and just taking money from teachers [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=1173.6399999999999s)]
*  and nurses and workers and everyday people. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=1176.68s)]
*  And so that's who I answer to. And I think that's that's what people want to [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=1179.84s)]
*  see, that they want to see us not, you know, compromise our values, [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=1182.24s)]
*  but to say that we stand ten toes down for them and that we're going to be [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=1186.72s)]
*  consistent. And even I've had Republicans say, we disagree with you, but we [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=1189.68s)]
*  know that when you say you're going to do something, you're going to be [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=1192.8799999999999s)]
*  consistent, that you're going to be honest. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=1194.28s)]
*  And I think people want to see more authenticity in our politics. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=1195.88s)]
*  They want courage. They want conviction. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=1199.0400000000002s)]
*  And they don't want this both sides. And they don't want this, you know, we're [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=1200.8000000000002s)]
*  facing a very dangerous time. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=1204.44s)]
*  And I think we won't be apologetic for for how bold we are in response, [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=1206.24s)]
*  but we will be apologetic to future generations by how timid we are when our [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=1212.0s)]
*  democracy is on fire, when the House is on fire, when things are collapsing all [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=1215.0s)]
*  around us, we'll be apologetic for what we didn't do as opposed to what we did [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=1219.0s)]
*  do. And so when I took a megaphone out my pocket, it wasn't in decorum. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=1222.2s)]
*  Was it a violation of House rules? [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=1225.12s)]
*  They say it was. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=1226.6399999999999s)]
*  But I knew that it was required in that time because those children were saying, [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=1228.56s)]
*  please do something, hear us, see us. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=1231.8799999999999s)]
*  And so when they expelled us, I also want to just end by saying it was not about [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=1233.76s)]
*  us. It was about it was about the people who showed up, mostly young people who [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=1237.1999999999998s)]
*  showed up in the largest numbers since the civil rights movement demanding [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=1241.56s)]
*  better of our government, children who and young people who can never unsee [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=1244.3999999999999s)]
*  what they saw that day, who really transformed that place to a point where [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=1247.6799999999998s)]
*  the Republicans ended session early because they were terrified of these [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=1251.32s)]
*  young people. And they've now surrounded the Capitol and troopers. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=1253.48s)]
*  You have to have tickets to sit in the gallery. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=1256.6s)]
*  They you know, all these processes to keep the people at the people's house. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=1258.32s)]
*  And the reason they're doing that is because that that year those young people [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=1261.72s)]
*  were effective. They were powerful. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=1264.4s)]
*  And power only responds when it's threatened. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=1266.8s)]
*  And so they knew that was effective. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=1269.48s)]
*  They knew that they're on the losing side of history. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=1270.88s)]
*  They've lost a generation. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=1272.3600000000001s)]
*  And so now they're trying to hold on to power. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=1273.68s)]
*  And as we say in the South, a dying mule kicks the hardest. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=1275.52s)]
*  This mule of white supremacist patriarchy and of terror, of plantation politics is [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=1277.68s)]
*  dying. So they're trying to kick with everything they have to hold on to power. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=1282.8s)]
*  But we know that we're going to build a circle larger than they can even keep us [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=1285.2s)]
*  out and that we're going to bring some of their folks in. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=1288.48s)]
*  And I really have hope in this season as I've traveled that there's something is [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=1290.36s)]
*  happening right now. People are being awakened. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=1293.56s)]
*  There's a reckoning happening. And I'm hopeful for twenty twenty eight. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=1295.08s)]
*  I'm hopeful for twenty thirty. I know that Tennessee is going to shock the nation. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=1297.6s)]
*  I know that together when I see a room like this, I know that as we show up, [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=1300.44s)]
*  continually build community, I know that we can transform Tennessee and if we can [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=1304.16s)]
*  transform Tennessee, we can transform this nation. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=1307.84s)]
*  Hey, guys, it's Tim and Sarah. We're here with my friend of me, John, [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=1313.76s)]
*  love it from love it or leave it. June is Pride Month and we're going to be live in [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=1316.6s)]
*  D.C. on June 6th for World Pride for a very special live show fundraiser [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=1320.6s)]
*  featuring the three of us, plus some gay special guests. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=1325.56s)]
*  Crooked and the bulwark will be donating the proceeds from this fundraiser to the [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=1329.12s)]
*  Immigrant Defenders Law Center to support Andre Romero, the makeup artist who the [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwa_C3kf0zQ&t=1332.96s)]
