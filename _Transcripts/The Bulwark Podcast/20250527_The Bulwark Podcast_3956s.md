Video Description: Democrats need vastly more imagination to confront the enormous challenges the country faces politically, economically, and on climate. The party can't just focus on stopping what is happening in Washington. Meanwhile, Trump can't stop insulting the intelligence of the American people, every part of the political spectrum has something to hate about the reconciliation bill, and libertarians need to speak up about a president disappearing people to a foreign black site. Plus, cracking the manosphere, what Biden could've done differently on Covid, and the era of politicians sticking to their talking points is over.
Pete Buttigieg joins Tim Miller.

# Pete Buttigieg Gets BRUTALLY Honest | The Bulwark Podcast
**The Bulwark Podcast:** [May 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA)
*  I could ask a long wind up question, but I might as well just let you cook on the big, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=0.0s)]
*  beautiful bill and what you make of it. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=3.44s)]
*  It has something for every part of the American political spectrum to hate. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=6.8s)]
*  Hello and welcome to the Bullwork Podcast. I'm your host, Tim Miller, delighted to welcome back [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=20.88s)]
*  former mayor of South Bend, transportation secretary in the Biden administration. He ran [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=24.64s)]
*  for president in 2020, tied the Iowa caucus. It's Tinker, mayor, soldier, secretary, Pete [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=28.64s)]
*  Buttigieg. What's up, man? I'm doing well. Good to see you. You got a lot of titles now. I don't [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=33.04s)]
*  know what to call you anymore. Yeah, let's just stick with Pete. I feel a little easier. Pete [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=37.44s)]
*  sounds good. I want to start with news, then we'll get into, you know, whether the Democrats, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=41.760000000000005s)]
*  whether democracy and all that. I guess those things are related. Over the weekend, Trump, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=47.760000000000005s)]
*  both in a bleat on truth social and in a kind of gaggle outside of an airplane, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=55.12s)]
*  talked about how Putin's gone crazy and he's not the same man he once knew. And meanwhile, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=61.839999999999996s)]
*  we got the Wall Street Journal reporting this morning that the US is working on reinforcing [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=68.64s)]
*  Europe's northern front and preparing for an escalating war with Russia as Russia's taking [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=73.36s)]
*  more territory in Ukraine over the weekend. I'm just wondering what you make of all that. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=78.0s)]
*  I think no one should be surprised to see Putin continuing to play the president. And it's really [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=82.32000000000001s)]
*  tough to watch. It's, again, unsurprising, but still upsetting to see this unravel the way it is. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=88.64s)]
*  I'm pretty sure I remember Trump saying that he would solve the war on day one. Like most of what [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=96.48s)]
*  he says, I think even his supporters assume that was an exaggeration, but for it to start getting [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=101.92000000000002s)]
*  worse beginning on day one and now be getting much worse as we go into day 150 or whatever this is [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=107.12s)]
*  of his presidency shows what happens when you have someone who doesn't know what he's doing and is [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=113.52000000000001s)]
*  incapable of standing up to Putin. Yeah, there's actually in some circumstances, there's an [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=118.24000000000001s)]
*  important distinction between bluster and misjudgment, right? Like a lot of the Trump's [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=123.2s)]
*  defenders will argue that like a lot of what he says is just bluster and negotiation and positioning [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=127.12s)]
*  because he's really going to be tough on the back end, right? This doesn't really feel like [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=133.2s)]
*  that situation. It feels like he genuinely got fooled somehow or whatever, or convinced himself [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=136.79999999999998s)]
*  that he and Putin were buddies because they went through the Russia collusion hoax together. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=143.04s)]
*  I can't quite- That's right. I remember him saying something about how tough that was on Putin and [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=148.07999999999998s)]
*  how that really bonded them. I mean, look, one thing we know about Putin is he takes advantage [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=151.6s)]
*  of every situation that he can. He's extremely strategic. He's extremely cold and calculating, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=158.56s)]
*  and he continues to see an advantage in being able to run circles around this president. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=164.32s)]
*  There's already obviously just the weirdness of Donald Trump and Russia, but alongside that [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=171.6s)]
*  weirdness is a kind of weakness in figuring out how to manage this and even create the impression [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=177.36s)]
*  that he's making any progress. Because yeah, I don't think even his supporters believed him when [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=183.52s)]
*  he said, I'd solve this on day one. But whenever he says, I'm going to fix it on day one, I'm going [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=187.36s)]
*  to solve the war on day one. I'm going to get prices back down on day one. I think that's [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=192.56s)]
*  supposed to be a proxy for you're going to see quick results. And we're not seeing quick results. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=196.48000000000002s)]
*  We're seeing it get worse, whether we're talking about prices here at home or whether we're talking [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=201.60000000000002s)]
*  about the situation in Eastern Europe. Is there anything that I guess that can be done? [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=205.52s)]
*  I mean, he won the election, has Congress, has the Senate. I do think that there's a contingent of [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=210.48000000000002s)]
*  Republicans in the Senate that if there's a secret ballot vote, would vote to be doing more [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=216.72s)]
*  to help Ukraine right now. Can Democrats on the Hill shame them, pressure them? Or [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=221.92s)]
*  do you feel like Ukraine is sort of on their own and it's up to Europe to kind of fill the void here? [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=229.2s)]
*  I mean, look, I think Europe is doing its best to step into the American leadership [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=233.36s)]
*  vacuum that President Trump has created. But I agree. I mean, I saw how much bipartisan support [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=237.84s)]
*  there was for Ukraine having been in the administration when the war, when the full [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=243.6s)]
*  scale invasion broke out, seen in the Senate and the House, a lot of Republicans who know [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=248.4s)]
*  what the right thing to do is. But look, they know what the right thing to do is on a lot of [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=253.6s)]
*  these issues. It doesn't mean they're going to step up and do it. We'll kind of just pop [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=258.32s)]
*  around the world a little bit. I want to talk about the El Salvador situation with you. This [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=264.71999999999997s)]
*  has been something that's been very upsetting to me. We've been talking about a lot. I've been [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=270.4s)]
*  working through like, what, similar to that Ukraine question, what if anything can be done? [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=274.0s)]
*  And one thing that a couple people have mentioned to me is that maybe Democrats and our Western [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=279.2s)]
*  allies, Western Europe, Canada should start signaling to El Salvador that Trump's not going [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=284.88s)]
*  to be around forever. And if they want to become a prison state where they just put people in a hole [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=291.35999999999996s)]
*  with no access to lawyers, no access to due process, then they're going to get treated [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=297.44s)]
*  like North Korea and Venezuela when it comes to trade, travel, et cetera, going forward. What do [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=302.64s)]
*  you make of that? Like being more aggressive with El Salvador? I think it's appealing, but only if [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=306.96s)]
*  it's credible. I mean, in a way, it reminds me of all of the blowback directed at the Saudi [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=311.2s)]
*  leadership after the killing of Khashoggi. And look, they actually did, they cared about that. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=317.36s)]
*  Not enough that they completely changed their ways, but you could tell that the Saudi leadership [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=323.6s)]
*  was taken aback when they realized the extent to which the American public and the world were [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=328.08000000000004s)]
*  horrified by those actions. So I do think there's something to signaling to El Salvador that their [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=333.76000000000005s)]
*  leadership could be isolated in the long run, not only in terms of a lot of other countries, [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=339.04s)]
*  but eventually in terms of the United States. If the number one thing people here know about [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=345.28000000000003s)]
*  El Salvador is that they did some of the dirtiest of this administration's dirty work. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=350.48s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, like just direct, should maybe Democrats in the Senate, like introduce a [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=356.40000000000003s)]
*  direct sanctions bill? I hear what you're saying about us, Saudi, but it didn't, you know, [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=361.68s)]
*  Saudi didn't start acting like I wish that they would act. But you're right. They did start acting [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=366.72s)]
*  differently. I mean, they haven't killed any other journalists anytime recently. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=370.88s)]
*  That we know of. I mean, look, this is all relative. But, you know, sometimes those things [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=374.24s)]
*  matter more than you might guess that they would, especially because the Salvadoran president [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=379.84s)]
*  emerged on the international scene as kind of a golden boy. I mean, he was being celebrated [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=384.64s)]
*  all around the world before he took a pretty dark turn. And I just can't imagine that you would want [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=389.2s)]
*  to be known in the long run. And remember, this is also a very young leader. I don't think you want [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=394.79999999999995s)]
*  to be known in the long run for this kind of thing. You have any other thoughts on what can be done in [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=399.52s)]
*  this situation? I mean, it's pretty, and it's quite unprecedented. I've looked back at the [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=404.08s)]
*  Bush administration. You think about some of the, you know, Abu Ghraib or, you know, [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=409.2s)]
*  what's happening in Guantanamo. I mean, there were black sites, like there are things that [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=413.68s)]
*  happened in the Bush administration that folks that didn't weren't like privy to, but like, [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=419.44s)]
*  eventually, like we knew who was in Guantanamo, right? Like, I mean, what is done here is a step [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=423.44s)]
*  beyond that when it comes to human rights, when it comes to like not lack of transparency. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=429.92s)]
*  Yeah, not to mention rule of law and not some like, you know, abstract international human rights [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=434.96000000000004s)]
*  law, American law that says that you can't do this. Then we put somebody in that situation. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=440.16s)]
*  You got to bring back the due process matters. And the tough reality right now is that as long [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=445.76s)]
*  as you have an acquiescent Congress, as well as a rogue administration, [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=453.36s)]
*  that third branch of government, the judiciary can only do so much. Yeah. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=459.04s)]
*  I do think we're gonna get into your, your visit into the Manosphere in a minute, but I think it [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=463.68s)]
*  was notable that like Rogan pushed back on this. Yeah. Right. I think this is an area where you [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=467.6s)]
*  can talk about it. Like some Democrats are kind of scared to talk about it because immigration is [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=472.32s)]
*  for a good reason, but like, this is unique, I think. Yeah. No, I think it is telling that [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=475.36s)]
*  this is where Rogan has parted ways with the president. And at the same time, I think it [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=479.76s)]
*  makes total sense. Look, something that conservatives and liberals and libertarians in particular, [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=484.0s)]
*  all ought to be able to agree on is that we're horrified by the idea that our government can, [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=490.71999999999997s)]
*  without due process and potentially illegally, just pack somebody off to a foreign prison. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=496.71999999999997s)]
*  No matter what they're accused of doing, it is extremely disturbing that they could just decide [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=502.64s)]
*  that the president just doesn't like your stupid face. And one day he ships you to a foreign black [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=508.56s)]
*  site. Right. And I think that the coalition that such as it is that stands behind Trump [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=513.84s)]
*  sees the problem with this. But a bigger question I continue to have is libertarians of the world, [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=520.32s)]
*  like American libertarians, where the hell are you? Like if you're not ready to stand up after [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=525.84s)]
*  years of saying that, you know, rules on water pollution are government overreach, where are you [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=530.56s)]
*  now that the president is trying to withdraw the broadcast license of a TV station that airs [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=536.8s)]
*  coverage that criticizes him or stuff people into a van and ship them off? Ron Paul, Pete's putting [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=543.5999999999999s)]
*  up the Ron Paul bat signal. Where are you Ron Paul? Do you still exist out there? All right. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=549.4399999999999s)]
*  I want to talk about what's happening on the Hill. I guess I could ask a long windup question, [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=556.16s)]
*  but I might as well just let you cook on the big, beautiful bill and what you make of it. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=561.12s)]
*  It has something for every part of the American political spectrum to hate. So for conservatives, [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=566.4000000000001s)]
*  there's the fact that it explodes the deficit and the debt even more. You know, one thing that I [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=576.0s)]
*  take seriously from the conservative perspective is the idea that we have to be more responsible [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=581.84s)]
*  about the debt, especially as it's, you know, once you cross that hundred percent debt to GDP ratio, [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=588.48s)]
*  and you add and add to it, especially because part of why we've been able to get away with that much [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=595.04s)]
*  debt is the rock solid reputation for political and economic stability that the U.S. has enjoyed. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=599.28s)]
*  Obviously, that's got some holes in it. So not a great time to be adding trillions to the debt. So [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=606.8s)]
*  I think conservatives can see how disturbing that is. Meanwhile, most Americans and definitely most [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=611.2s)]
*  liberals don't love the tax cuts for the rich that are in there, which is part of why there is such a [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=617.84s)]
*  big debt and deficit. And then you got something that is especially disturbing the liberals. But [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=622.48s)]
*  again, I think the whole country gets, at least most of the country gets, which is that [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=627.44s)]
*  kicking eight million Americans off of health insurance on purpose is a bad idea. It's wrong [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=633.2s)]
*  and it's going to make America less healthy. And it doesn't make any sense, especially when we know [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=640.8000000000001s)]
*  the reason that they're doing it is partly to fund these tax cuts for the wealthiest. So, you know, [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=646.0s)]
*  this is not incredibly complicated, even though a budget bill can fundamentally be [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=651.92s)]
*  very complicated. The facts here are simple. The fact is, cutting taxes for the wealthy, [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=658.88s)]
*  destroying health insurance for millions of Americans, and adding to the debt while you're [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=664.96s)]
*  at it is bad policy. And I think it's bad politics, but it's up to those of us who stand in opposition [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=668.4s)]
*  to make sure there's actually a political penalty for getting on board with this sort of thing. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=674.24s)]
*  Yeah, I kind of think it's insane policy in politics. I truly don't, like, I kind of don't [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=678.0s)]
*  understand it. I was talking to John Chait on Friday, and he was like, Tim, you just were [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=684.56s)]
*  blinded by the fact that your whole life, like tax cuts for the rich is a religion among the [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=689.6s)]
*  Republicans, and they don't need to rationalize it in any way. And so maybe that's true. Why do [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=694.56s)]
*  you think that they have put forth, like, this is the only thing they're going to pass this year, [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=700.24s)]
*  and it goes in direct conflict to what we're about to talk about with regards to the politics [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=704.72s)]
*  of this country, about how they are purportedly pivoting to being a more working class oriented [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=709.44s)]
*  party. It just doesn't make any sense. Yeah, it's terrible for working class Americans on [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=714.64s)]
*  every level, whether we talk about, because take the debt, which sounds like very abstract, right? [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=718.88s)]
*  But working Americans who are hoping to buy their first home are among those who are most going to [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=723.28s)]
*  be paying the bill for the tax cuts for the rich, not just because the tax burden moves, [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=727.84s)]
*  but because you're going to be seeing that likely in the form of interest rates, right? [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=731.92s)]
*  To say nothing of Medicaid, one really important thing to point out about Medicaid, [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=735.92s)]
*  we're talking about a lot of people who any given month might fall out of the work requirements, [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=739.8399999999999s)]
*  not because they did anything wrong, not because they stopped working, but because they don't get [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=745.4399999999999s)]
*  enough hours that week or that month. And working class Americans in particular understand that [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=749.1999999999999s)]
*  vulnerability that you don't get to set your own schedule and you don't always get the hours. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=755.52s)]
*  To have that not only mean you're losing wages, but also that you're threatened to be kicked off [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=759.84s)]
*  of your healthcare. Frankly, it goes to the almost caricature version of the worst of old [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=765.12s)]
*  school Republicans versus the thing I most respect about old school Republicans, which is the extent [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=771.52s)]
*  to which they talked and cared about liberty. Yeah, let's, I was saving this. I had a, Tim used [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=776.32s)]
*  to be a Republican policy section at the end of the podcast. We'll just do it right now. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=782.0s)]
*  Yeah. Are we going to finally negatively polarize Democrats into really talking about the debt and [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=785.76s)]
*  deficit a lot? It has been an issue that I'm sure that I'll just preempt your answer for me, [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=792.64s)]
*  just that Bill Clinton handled this better than any Republicans did. But the debt went up significantly [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=800.0s)]
*  under Biden. We're paying a huge amount now in interest on the debt. That's going to balloon [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=805.68s)]
*  significantly more after this bill, especially if interest rates stay high. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=812.08s)]
*  And that's going to mean that the government can't fund things that are progressive priorities. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=815.52s)]
*  And yet, Democrats sometimes will talk about it if they get asked about it on a new show, [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=820.32s)]
*  but it doesn't feel like it's been really an animating issue for Democrats for a while. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=824.08s)]
*  Do you think that might change? Look, Democrats, I think allergy to talking about the debt mostly [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=827.44s)]
*  comes from it having been used as an excuse to not make investments that we believe in. But yeah, [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=832.64s)]
*  now we've made enormous investments in the last few years in roads, highways, bridges, research, [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=837.92s)]
*  chips, all kinds of infrastructure, some of that being at risk of being rolled back. But we've made [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=842.88s)]
*  massive investments. Those are the kinds of deficit spending that economists would say makes sense in [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=848.7199999999999s)]
*  the same way that it makes sense to take out a loan to build your business. But what we're talking [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=853.76s)]
*  about now is watching the mounting debt grow and adding to it with a massive tax cut for the rich. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=857.1999999999999s)]
*  To your point, one reason I think it makes sense right now for Democrats to get more comfortable [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=864.32s)]
*  talking about deficits and the debt is that as a rule, we've been better at handling it. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=870.72s)]
*  Don't get me wrong. I mean, both parties have added to the national debt in spectacular fashion. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=875.04s)]
*  We're grading on a curve. You made it to Harvard, Pete. We're not. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=879.6s)]
*  But look, if you look at who's shown the best results of getting the deficit under control, [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=884.4s)]
*  or even at certain points running a surplus, it ain't Republicans. So Democrats should own that. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=889.44s)]
*  On to the Harvard of it all. I'm going to steel man the other side of the argument for this, [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=895.84s)]
*  because I went to a safety school. You went to Harvard. Maybe you can speak to its value [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=899.44s)]
*  a little bit more. And it's, you know, should Harvard be getting all this money from the [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=903.2s)]
*  federal government anyway? And shouldn't Harvard be paying taxes? And they have a huge, like, what, [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=908.6400000000001s)]
*  is the line that Scott Galloway uses? It's a hedge fund that has a college put on top of it. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=915.36s)]
*  Like, shouldn't the government be underwriting Harvard anymore? Do the magas have a point on this? [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=922.16s)]
*  So a couple of things. First of all, when we're talking about this research funding, this isn't [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=928.32s)]
*  paying Harvard money that they get to just sit on. This is, in effect, hiring Harvard to solve [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=933.36s)]
*  problems. So when we've got funding, especially funding that goes to things like cancer research [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=940.72s)]
*  or preventing veteran suicide, which I believe was in the scope of one of the contracts that [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=946.8s)]
*  was put on the chopping block. I think that one was Harvard. We're talking about using the [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=952.96s)]
*  resources and the brainpower of that university or any of the other universities that compete for [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=959.36s)]
*  federal funding to address problems that make the American people better off. It's not about, [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=964.16s)]
*  what can the federal government do for the university? It's about what value can the [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=969.52s)]
*  university bring the taxpayer? Because it turns out not just anybody can do some of the incredibly [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=974.48s)]
*  complex research, whether we're talking about what goes on at the medical school or physics or a [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=980.88s)]
*  whole lot of other things. So that's the first thing. The second thing that I think is really [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=987.04s)]
*  important is we're not talking about some clear-eyed analytical assessment of the value we're getting [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=991.68s)]
*  for contracts. I would be on board with that, right? If you're saying like, look, we're funding [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=999.36s)]
*  all this research, but we need to be more rigorous about how much of that research is actually [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=1003.44s)]
*  getting results. I think that makes total sense. But of course, this isn't happening because of [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=1006.96s)]
*  anything related to benefiting the American taxpayer. This is happening because of politics. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=1011.6s)]
*  And if we become the kind of country where a university is dismantled because it doesn't [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=1016.08s)]
*  line up with the politics of the man who happens to be in charge of the government, [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=1022.48s)]
*  we cannot possibly be the world's leading nation. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=1027.76s)]
*  All right. Our smug vice president has a counterpoint to you on this. So I'm going to [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=1032.8s)]
*  read you his tweet. He says that there's an extraordinary reproducibility crisis in the [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=1035.9199999999998s)]
*  sciences where most published papers fail to replicate. Universities have massive bureaucracies. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=1041.9199999999998s)]
*  The voting patterns of university professors resemble North Korea. Many universities explicitly [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=1047.36s)]
*  engage in racial discrimination against whites and also Asians. Our universities could see the [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=1052.16s)]
*  policies of the Trump administration as a necessary corrective or they could yell fascism. What do you [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=1057.28s)]
*  say to the vice president? It's just ideological gibberish. I'm sorry, but like, what does that [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=1061.44s)]
*  even mean to vote like North Korea? Do they even vote in North Korea? Like, what is he talking [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=1067.52s)]
*  about? This is ideological gibberish meant to justify an ideological war on American universities. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=1072.96s)]
*  Is there frustration with the academy? Sure. I mean, I feel that. I would love as somebody who [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=1080.0800000000002s)]
*  believes in the relationship between big ideas and policies and politics, I actually believe that [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=1085.52s)]
*  academia and American universities could be doing much better when it comes to developing ideas that [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=1093.68s)]
*  benefit people. I actually think this is worse on the left. And what I mean by that is the right, [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=1100.8s)]
*  because they felt that there was a powerful liberal bias in universities, built this [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=1106.72s)]
*  extraordinarily rich constellation of think tanks over the last 50 years that aren't just [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=1113.68s)]
*  worrying about things like the optimal healthcare subsidy from a conservative perspective. They're [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=1121.68s)]
*  worried about things like what is the nature of liberty? And meanwhile, also totally random stuff, [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=1127.68s)]
*  like whether we're producing enough sperm in our young men. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=1133.52s)]
*  Yeah, obviously, their priorities are not exactly my priorities. But my point is, [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=1138.24s)]
*  they're thinking about everything from the biggest of the big questions to very specific policy [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=1143.76s)]
*  things. And that's how you get stuff like Project 2025, a very thoroughly thought through plan, [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=1148.56s)]
*  which I hate, but which is connecting their first principles as they see them to their [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=1157.12s)]
*  political agenda. Meanwhile, on the left, whether we're talking about the think tank world, [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=1163.36s)]
*  or whether we're talking about universities, there's think tanks that I think are tending [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=1168.0s)]
*  to focus on things that are much more narrow, specific and rather technical policy questions. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=1173.36s)]
*  Now, there's universities that are doing a lot of theories about theories that can get [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=1178.0s)]
*  you know, frustratingly abstract. So I get all of that. That doesn't mean that it's okay for the [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=1183.04s)]
*  government to go to war with the university because they don't like their politics, or for the [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=1189.9199999999998s)]
*  government to be watching the vote. Why is the vice president of the United States commenting on [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=1195.04s)]
*  the voting habits of anybody, any student or faculty member in the context of whether federal [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=1200.32s)]
*  funding should be going to help prevent veteran suicide in a research project at the medical [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=1207.28s)]
*  school there? Why is that his problem? We're about to get to the Democrats next, [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=1212.1599999999999s)]
*  but we've gone through the fact that we're disappearing people to a El Salvador gulag [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=1216.8799999999999s)]
*  that we're going after universities because of their politics, banning foreign students for [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=1221.4399999999998s)]
*  coming to universities for reasons, just a terrific tax and spending bill that makes no sense. Like [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=1225.4399999999998s)]
*  what and and and you know, I've listened to all your podcasts recently, and you give compelling [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=1231.9199999999998s)]
*  reactions to all those things on the merits. Like what has pissed you off the most? Like what has [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=1236.72s)]
*  gotten Pete's blood pressure up the most out of the last four months? Where do we begin? I mean, [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=1241.76s)]
*  I think the part of what is most insuriating is the the extent of the insult to the American people. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=1247.68s)]
*  It's not just policies that are going to hurt people. It's insulting people's intelligence. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=1259.2s)]
*  It's insulting the working voter who knows damn well that if you make these changes to Medicaid, [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=1264.4s)]
*  millions of deserving people are going to lose their health care coverage. It's the insult to [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=1271.76s)]
*  the American taxpayer with the idea that we're all supposed to pay hundreds or tens of millions of [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=1277.84s)]
*  dollars to upgrade a jumbo jet handed over by a foreign government for the president to use that [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=1284.8s)]
*  probably won't even be ready until his last year and then would immediately go to his presidential [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=1292.08s)]
*  library. There's a brazenness to this that is insulting and some of it's insulting by design, [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=1295.84s)]
*  to get us just so whipped up that we're kind of losing our minds and we can't be clear-headed [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=1301.6000000000001s)]
*  about a strategy to defeat it. But something about just how little he must think of the American [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=1306.4s)]
*  people and in particular the supporters who he goes to for money and for votes all the time. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=1314.0800000000002s)]
*  He just doesn't deserve them. He doesn't deserve the loyalty of any of the people who trusted him [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=1322.4s)]
*  with their vote. I think that's the most hurtful thing. Yeah, policies are bad, [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=1329.52s)]
*  conduct is bad, but it's that bad faith that is the worst thing of all. I think that's one of [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=1333.76s)]
*  the reasons why so many people who are conservatives are as disturbed by him as the rest of us. It's [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=1338.56s)]
*  just that those of them who are in Congress can't seem to bring themselves to say anything because [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=1343.92s)]
*  they're afraid. Why do you think those people are stuck with them? We're going to get esoteric now [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=1348.4s)]
*  because I was listening to, in one of your interviews recently you said these movements [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=1352.8799999999999s)]
*  you're talking about, MAGA doesn't come up in a country where things are going fine. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=1356.0s)]
*  That sounds nice. That sounds right that maybe the folks that have turned to him because they [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=1361.04s)]
*  went through real struggles and they're just grasping around for any solution, even somebody [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=1368.16s)]
*  that doesn't give a fuck about them. But then the more I think about it, I'm like, is that actually [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=1373.76s)]
*  true? Because over the last half century we've done better than Western Europe. They don't have [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=1378.8s)]
*  a Trump. Really, who has had the hardest in this country? Have we, though? Growth-wise we have, [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=1383.28s)]
*  but look at the inequality. Anytime you see this level of inequality, usually that's the beginning [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=1390.8s)]
*  of the end for a republic if it happens in a democratic country. The truth is, while I would [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=1396.96s)]
*  like to think that my party has better policies to deal with inequality and is more concerned [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=1403.6s)]
*  about it, the reality is it has gotten worse on the watch of republican and democratic administrations [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=1408.48s)]
*  in a way that I think motivates, maybe not justifies, but motivates an attitude that says, [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=1414.64s)]
*  burn the house down. There's this cynicism. Now, there's part of it that I think deserves to be [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=1422.4s)]
*  taken seriously. There's another part of it that is just the way our relationship to reality and [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=1430.8s)]
*  information has changed. The fact that we're not getting information mostly from sources that [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=1435.68s)]
*  consult both sides and talk about what they have to say and subject everything they print or repeat [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=1444.16s)]
*  to editorial standards. We're just not in that world as much. I think that's really made a big [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=1449.28s)]
*  difference. You put those things together and it's a recipe for cynicism. But it's one thing to get [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=1454.96s)]
*  mad and say, all right, let's burn the house down. It's another to actually be around when that [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=1461.36s)]
*  happens. I think what we're seeing is a lot of people getting hurt by it. They'll be hurt by it [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=1465.4399999999998s)]
*  more, although there's been a show of political savvy by the republicans setting some of these [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=1469.76s)]
*  bombs to go off in 2029, which means they know that that policy is going to hurt a lot of people [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=1474.9599999999998s)]
*  and they don't want it politically to happen before the election. This is the kind of thing [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=1479.28s)]
*  that I think translates that general frustration into a terrible consequence. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=1485.92s)]
*  I don't necessarily think that's wrong, but here's what's unsatisfying about it. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=1494.96s)]
*  There's a New York Times story of if you look at the last three elections in a trend, [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=1499.8400000000001s)]
*  only the counties with the smallest proportion of college grants have turned more Democrat. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=1504.72s)]
*  It's mostly suburban counties where I grew up, suburban Denver, suburban Atlanta, [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=1510.4s)]
*  that have moved Democrat each of the last three elections. In two-thirds of the least educated [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=1515.0400000000002s)]
*  counties, it's been the republicans that steadily grew their vote share in each of the last three [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=1519.68s)]
*  elections. If you're saying that the answer is that, well, it's just been this widening [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=1523.1200000000001s)]
*  inequality gap that has turned these folks to Trump, the republicans aren't even really offering [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=1528.72s)]
*  any solution to that. There's got to be something else. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=1535.2s)]
*  This is what they do. It can't just be money. I agree on the cultural part, but just to close [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=1539.2s)]
*  the loop on the money part, one thing they're very good at is taking a problem, seeing it get worse, [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=1544.16s)]
*  and using it. The more inequality there is, the better for somebody like Trump, just like the worst [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=1549.3600000000001s)]
*  things are at the border, the better for somebody like Trump politically. We've seen that pattern [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=1554.16s)]
*  again and again, but I agree on the culture part too. Look, Democrats have created this impression, [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=1558.64s)]
*  I think partly because of the way we feel and talk about Trump, have created this impression [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=1567.2s)]
*  that that translates into the way we feel and talk about people who support him. That's the thing [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=1573.44s)]
*  that I think really is a cultural struggle in our party. There's this sense of condescension. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=1580.0s)]
*  If I hear one more time a well-off liberal doctor or lawyer saying that, quote unquote, [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=1585.9199999999998s)]
*  these folks are voting against their economic interests, I just wonder whether they've ever [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=1598.7199999999998s)]
*  contemplated the fact that somebody could turn around and say, so are you. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=1605.12s)]
*  There's a condescension that is imputed to Democrats that I think we really need to [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=1609.2800000000002s)]
*  deal with. So much of politics is not just how you make people feel, [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=1617.52s)]
*  how you make people feel about themselves. So much of what they think of you comes down to [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=1623.52s)]
*  what they think you think of them. Largely because of our very justified horror at the abuses [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=1630.0800000000002s)]
*  of Donald Trump as a candidate and as a president. We've said and done things that make voters feel [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=1637.2s)]
*  like we're talking about them when we're talking about him. This is a conundrum. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=1642.8s)]
*  It is an easy thing to say that Democrats should not be condescending when talking about [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=1652.24s)]
*  folks that voted for Trump. I get that it's the right thing to do in the sense of if you're in [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=1658.4s)]
*  fourth grade, that's what your teacher would tell you. You have to be nice to your fellow classmates [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=1664.4s)]
*  that made a really dumb decision and we try to teach our kids that. And yet, they've nominated [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=1669.6000000000001s)]
*  the Republicans, one of the stupidest, most cruel, most totally morally indefensible Americans [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=1675.8400000000001s)]
*  for president three straight times, even after he's committed obvious crimes, even after he's [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=1685.0400000000002s)]
*  insulted people. And he's so mean. It's like he's condescending and mean to people the way he talks [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=1690.88s)]
*  about Baltimore or whatever the media. You just name the list of people that he talks about and [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=1696.48s)]
*  he just makes stupid nicknames up about people. So the Democrats have to be nice to the people [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=1700.88s)]
*  that elected like the stupid, cruel biff from back to the future. And they don't have to do the same. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=1706.5600000000002s)]
*  The way I put it is that we need to call out to what's best in people because we already, [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=1713.6000000000001s)]
*  the lane for calling out to what's worst in people is already taken. First of all, it's not for us. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=1718.48s)]
*  And secondly, we're never going to be as good at it as he is. So yeah, he's going to, like even the [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=1722.96s)]
*  insulting and cruelty on his side is done in a way that I think a lot of people feel like, well, [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=1729.44s)]
*  they can sort of get in on it, which is also a dynamic that takes me back to fourth grade or [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=1735.84s)]
*  maybe seventh grade. That one way to not be the object of insults is to side with whoever's [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=1741.2s)]
*  throwing the insults around. This is really classic schoolyard stuff, right? That we're [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=1748.32s)]
*  being thrown back into. But also- What would have been satisfying though for somebody just to punch [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=1753.84s)]
*  the fucking bully in the face in fourth grade? Like, isn't that after a while, after many years, [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=1758.8s)]
*  that's one thing if they're mean on the playground for like one day, but then it's third grade, [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=1763.9199999999998s)]
*  they're mean, fourth grade, they're mean, fifth grade, they're mean, sixth grade, they're mean, [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=1768.56s)]
*  seventh grade, they're mean, eighth grade, they get elected class president. Ninth grade, don't [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=1771.84s)]
*  you want somebody to fucking clock him in the face? So look, bullies are powerful temporarily, [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=1775.28s)]
*  but rarely durable, right? Like, yeah, sooner or later that catches up to them. [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=1782.8s)]
*  And I think we will see that like this relationship that Trump has built with his people is not [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=1789.12s)]
*  the kind of thing that builds a lasting political movement. I think part of another thing my side [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=1797.44s)]
*  needs to be thinking about is when he exits the political scene, which one way or the other is [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=1801.6s)]
*  going to happen, he will not be active in American politics 15 years from now. Like, what would we [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=1806.48s)]
*  want to see? Fingers crossed, baby. Fingers crossed. And then like figure out how to bring that a [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=1811.36s)]
*  little closer into the near future. Barron is going to be the main figure 15 years from now, [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=1815.4399999999998s)]
*  you know? You got to help me. You were 29 when you won one of the mayor's race, right? How old will [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=1821.04s)]
*  Barron be in 15 years? 34? Watch out. All right. I mentioned Biff from Back to the Future. We're [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=1825.92s)]
*  going to play Back to the Future again. Was that a cultural touchstone for you as a child? [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=1832.48s)]
*  As an elderly child? Not really. Back to the Future? Okay. I just missed that one. We won't spend too [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=1836.5600000000002s)]
*  much time on it then. There's a DeLorean in the movie. Michael J. Fox gets a DeLorean. It's a car. [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=1840.88s)]
*  He gets to go back in time. You use the DeLorean to go back in time. So I'm giving you a DeLorean. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=1846.88s)]
*  And we're going to go back to like right after Biden gets the nomination in 2020. So, you know, [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=1852.72s)]
*  you just endorsed him. He hasn't picked Vice President Harris yet. The world is our waster. [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=1861.6s)]
*  We're in the middle of COVID. And you're Pete from today. And you get to talk to Pete from back then, [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=1866.8799999999999s)]
*  or maybe Biden from back then. And you get to give them some advice. Give them some advice [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=1872.8799999999999s)]
*  that would maybe prevent us from having this current president. What do you think you all [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=1877.04s)]
*  should have done differently? One, for the love of God, figure out a way to get the schools open [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=1881.68s)]
*  sooner. We got very knee-jerk about this. And the costs were not just politically, but [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=1889.3600000000001s)]
*  in a profound way, I think for the generation, the costs were profound. And I think anybody who [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=1900.48s)]
*  was involved, who was by the way, obviously doing their best to deal with the crisis that killed [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=1904.88s)]
*  million Americans. But I think most people involved would like to be able to have found a [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=1908.96s)]
*  way to safely get more schools more open more quickly. Obviously, that was a great first answer. [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=1912.88s)]
*  I had no idea. I mean, there's so many ways you could have gone with that. But that is a good [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=1920.48s)]
*  obviously pay more attention to the border. That's real. And that's going to be something [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=1927.92s)]
*  that you can't just take your time to deal with. These are all things, by the way, that is super [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=1934.08s)]
*  policy-wise and politically, we have the benefit of hindsight to reflect a lot of this. [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=1940.0s)]
*  Right. Three, even though you spent your entire political lifetime believing that the economy [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=1943.6799999999998s)]
*  and jobs are the same thing. And if you have lots of jobs, it's a good economy. And if you have [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=1949.6s)]
*  a problem with jobs, it's a bad economy. Remember that prices is just as big a part of the economy. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=1955.52s)]
*  It just hasn't come up much in the last 40 years. Right. Those are some things that'd be [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=1961.52s)]
*  whispering. So what would you have done differently in prices? What could you have done differently? [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=1966.0s)]
*  Look, no country was able to save their economy from COVID without getting into some inflation, [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=1970.4s)]
*  some serious and painful inflation. But I do think that there were a lot of moments where people kind [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=1976.6399999999999s)]
*  of waved it away in the first year or two, even just like the conversation about it, the focus. [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=1983.36s)]
*  It is true that we had no choice but to bring back the economy by any means necessary. I mean, [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=1991.6s)]
*  we forget how grave the threat of a depression was in 2020 or 2021. I mean, when I came in, [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=1997.6s)]
*  you know, I spent a big part of my time as secretary dealing with getting airlines to [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=2003.92s)]
*  treat their passengers better. You could almost forget that the entire first year, [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=2007.6s)]
*  our biggest focus was making sure airlines didn't go out of business. And that's just [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=2011.12s)]
*  to use the airline sector as an example. Right. So again, by definition, you set up this exercise. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=2014.56s)]
*  It's easy to say now, but like, since it is, those are the things I'd be whispering into my [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=2019.76s)]
*  2020 year if I had the chance. So not do less with BBB or inflation or whatever, [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=2024.48s)]
*  what it became of inflation reduction. Look, if you had to choose between doing too little [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=2031.44s)]
*  and doing too much, doing too much was the better answer. And so, yeah, I mean, [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=2035.84s)]
*  I don't think we should have built fewer roads or bridges. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=2042.0s)]
*  Let's do some more maybe controversial political ones. [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=2047.9199999999998s)]
*  Should Biden have been encouraged to pick an attorney general that would have more aggressively [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=2052.4s)]
*  gone after Trump earlier? After the insurrection? It's really hard. I don't know, Stormy Danielson, [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=2057.6s)]
*  that's not the stuff, but specifically about January 6th. Yeah. I mean, it's hard to play [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=2065.8399999999997s)]
*  out the counterfactual, right? It's like one of these Chinese finger traps where the harder [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=2069.2s)]
*  you pull, the more you get stuck. And there was a sense that the more aggressive the administration [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=2073.12s)]
*  was, the more he would seem to be justified in saying that it was all political. Now, you got [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=2079.9199999999996s)]
*  to weigh that against the fact that he was going to say that no matter what. But also, there was an [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=2086.7999999999997s)]
*  important principle at play here, right? Which I think the president really believed in, and which [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=2090.56s)]
*  I believe in, which is that an administration, like a political body like a White House, [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=2095.04s)]
*  should have as little to do as possible with anything to do with prosecutions. [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=2100.88s)]
*  That's the principle that he followed, arguably to a fault. But I get the principle and it still [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=2109.2799999999997s)]
*  matters. Should somebody have primaried President Biden or thrown their body in front of the tracks [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=2115.68s)]
*  of the re-elect? Look, somebody did, and he didn't get very far. Well, Dean Phillips tried to recruit [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=2122.24s)]
*  other people. Dean's defense, I was pretty harsh on Dean. So look, we're all reflecting. And I had [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=2127.2s)]
*  him back on and I said this joke. I was like, I don't know if the way that he ran was really the [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=2133.2s)]
*  right way. And I stole some nitpicks about it. But in his defense, he went and tried to recruit [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=2137.9199999999996s)]
*  other people that were more famous and better suited than Dean Phillips, and none of them wanted [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=2142.64s)]
*  to do it. And in retrospect, maybe should folks have been more interested in those meetings? Or [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=2145.9199999999996s)]
*  should something else have happened? I don't know. Look, again, easy to say with the benefit [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=2150.88s)]
*  of hindsight. And we can run all the different scenarios that could have happened. Well, [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=2155.2000000000003s)]
*  here's the thing, Pete. I hear you. Sure, it's easy to say the benefit of hindsight. But here's, [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=2161.12s)]
*  these are kind of important questions because it's like, how do we avoid this in the future? [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=2166.4s)]
*  And how do you Democrats be more clear-eyed about not losing to populist demagogues in the future? [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=2170.48s)]
*  And I listen to those answers and you go back and you say, well, we get kids in school earlier. That [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=2175.52s)]
*  smart. That would have been better. But on the edges, you do more stuff on immigration and prices. [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=2180.32s)]
*  Biden still runs. Trump is still the president right now. And I just gave you a DeLorean. [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=2186.88s)]
*  You get to go back in time and try to save us from Donald Trump 2.0. [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=2191.6800000000003s)]
*  Yeah, but you said it in 2020, right? [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=2194.8s)]
*  Okay, well, I don't know. Where do you want to go? [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=2196.6400000000003s)]
*  To be clear, in 2020- [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=2198.2400000000002s)]
*  You can put in the dots. You can put in a different date. Where do you go? [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=2199.1200000000003s)]
*  In 2020, I literally did run in a primary against Joe Biden, and he beat me. [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=2201.6800000000003s)]
*  Sure. But okay, so this is inevitable. The course of history is inevitable. [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=2206.3199999999997s)]
*  I'm not so sure that- [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=2212.16s)]
*  There's no contingent thing we could have done to stop it. [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=2213.04s)]
*  I'm not so sure that if COVID had been handled a little differently, and again, [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=2215.2s)]
*  this is easy to say now, and being on the side of vaccines and science was the right thing to do. [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=2219.44s)]
*  But if we'd seen some of those other knock-on effects related to the COVID response [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=2225.2s)]
*  and understood how the border was going to play out, and understood in advance with a crystal ball [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=2231.2799999999997s)]
*  how to talk about and work on prices, I'm not so sure that things would have been the exact same. [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=2236.9599999999996s)]
*  In terms of an election outcome that swung by, at the end of the day, [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=2241.9199999999996s)]
*  relatively small number of votes in a small number of counties. [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=2246.72s)]
*  And this small number is data. [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=2249.2s)]
*  Father's Day gifts are always the same story for me. I don't know about you guys. For me, [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=2254.24s)]
*  it's a biking jersey, a different bike jersey. My dad's a big biker. [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=2257.28s)]
*  And so I try to get fun ones for him. But it gets a little bit boring when it's a bike jersey, [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=2262.2400000000002s)]
*  year after year. So this year, we're turning to Quince. They make buying a thoughtful gift easy. [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=2269.52s)]
*  Quince has all the pieces dads actually want to wear. Polos, European linen beach shorts, [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=2275.36s)]
*  and comfortable pants that work for everything from weekend hangouts to nice dinners. [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=2279.92s)]
*  The best part? Everything with Quince is priced 50 to 80% less than what you'd find [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=2283.36s)]
*  at similar brands. By working with top artisans and cutting out the middle man, [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=2286.96s)]
*  Quince gives you luxury pieces without the crazy markups. And Quince only works with factories that [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=2291.28s)]
*  use safe, ethical, and responsible manufacturing practices and premium fabrics and finishes. [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=2296.8s)]
*  As I mentioned, I mean, I'm a dad, so I can just vouch for the dad perspective. [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=2304.7200000000003s)]
*  I'm loving my Quince gear. And, you know, this isn't part of the Father's Day promo, [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=2311.6s)]
*  but Quince also has some kids stuff. And I'd purchased a loose little Quince shirt [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=2316.72s)]
*  that she was wearing the other day. Tyler didn't even know that I got it for her. [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=2322.0s)]
*  And she was wearing it, looking cute. And she was like, where'd you get this? Who got this? Grandma [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=2325.9199999999996s)]
*  buy this for her? And I was like, no, I bought it. I got it with my Quince coat. And if it gets [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=2329.52s)]
*  Tyler's endorsement, you know, it's pretty hip. So if you've got a seven year old looking for some [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=2335.6s)]
*  summer shirts, Quince might also be an opportunity for you there. So for the dad or kid who [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=2339.04s)]
*  deserves better than basic, Quince has you covered. Go to quince.com slash the bulwark [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=2346.56s)]

*  This takes us to the Andrew Schultz podcast, which I listened to all three hours of. [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=2398.2400000000002s)]
*  I don't get three hours with you. Unfortunately, I'm going to take it up with your team, but maybe [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=2402.7999999999997s)]
*  we'll do one hour a month or something. But it was really interesting. And I'll talk about those [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=2406.0s)]
*  guys in a second. But one of the specific things they were asking you was about like, what's the [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=2411.52s)]
*  Democrats version of build the wall? And I just kind of want to like add onto that, which is [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=2416.24s)]
*  listening to this now, I don't know, like Trump for all of his flaws is not limited by having [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=2420.56s)]
*  ceilings on his imagination. I mean, the dude instigated a riot at the Capitol, got indicted [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=2428.0s)]
*  four times, put a picture of his mugshot on a t-shirt and got elected president twice when his [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=2435.2s)]
*  only experience was a reality show host. So like he dreams big dreams. So you want to know. [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=2439.52s)]
*  I sometimes feel like the Democrats, when I'm like listening to interviews like this, we're like, [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=2445.68s)]
*  what should the Democrats do differently? It's like very incremental dreams, you know, [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=2449.52s)]
*  little things we could have done on the edge, nibbling around the edges. And I don't like, [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=2453.44s)]
*  don't you think is that an issue? Like, don't you think that the Democrats could maybe have [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=2457.36s)]
*  a little bit more imagination about things they could do? Yes. Look, especially at this moment, [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=2462.32s)]
*  we're in and I think we see the big developments mostly in terms of the fear and the downside, [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=2468.2400000000002s)]
*  whether it's talking about the political space and the rise of Trump, or stuff like climate, [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=2475.84s)]
*  which is a massive problem, which we see mostly in terms of the harm, or AI, which we're talking [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=2480.7200000000003s)]
*  about mostly in terms of something to be afraid of. And there's plenty to be afraid of there. [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=2486.32s)]
*  But I think that when we're confronted with that level of challenge, it requires an enormous level [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=2490.96s)]
*  of imagination, the same way that colossal horrific challenges like the Great Depression [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=2497.1200000000003s)]
*  and World War Two led to the set of policies and institutions that were built that we seem to still [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=2502.2400000000002s)]
*  be clinging to, to try to save from destruction when actually they're already almost gone. And [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=2511.6s)]
*  they will pretty much completely be gone by the time this administration is done with it. Right? [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=2517.6s)]
*  So what would we be doing, not just to patch up something that we inherited from three generations [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=2522.4s)]
*  ago, but to start over, knowing that everything is different now in terms of our own political [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=2527.36s)]
*  landscape, in terms of what's happening in the climate, and importantly, potentially, [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=2533.7599999999998s)]
*  in terms of the economy? I mean, you look at AI, and again, lots to be really troubled by. [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=2539.28s)]
*  But we can't just run the same playbook that we ran in, let's say, the 90s to try to deal with [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=2544.4s)]
*  what technology and trade did to manufacturing in places like Northern Indiana, where I come from. [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=2550.0800000000004s)]
*  We could be offering a future where there's a dramatically shorter work week and more money [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=2556.88s)]
*  in your pocket at the same time. That's a thing that could actually happen, if and only if. [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=2564.0s)]
*  We have the right set of policies. And unlike building a wall, that's something we'd actually [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=2568.96s)]
*  get done. So we do need to dream bigger and talk boldly about it. And not just in terms of what [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=2572.32s)]
*  we're trying to stop, which is all Democrats can think about right now because of the horror show [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=2578.32s)]
*  that is Washington, but what we're actually trying to accelerate and deliver and build. [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=2582.7200000000003s)]
*  Yeah. I think there's something here, because this is what I'm interested in your take on this. So [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=2588.16s)]
*  I'm listening to this podcast, these guys, and some of the listeners haven't heard. I can't imagine [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=2591.92s)]
*  all of my listeners listen to all three hours of the flagrant podcast with Andrew Schultz, but [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=2596.24s)]
*  I'll just sum it up. These guys, man, I don't even understand why they voted for Trump at the end, [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=2600.3999999999996s)]
*  really. Over the course of the conversation, they were open to almost all of the policy items that [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=2607.8399999999997s)]
*  you get out. It felt like there was this huge culture. This is back to the cultural gap. There's [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=2615.68s)]
*  some cultural gap, and I just don't know how to bridge it. And you spent all that time with them, [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=2620.08s)]
*  wondering what you think about it. Totally. And it's true, not just for them, but for so many [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=2624.0s)]
*  people, especially young men, that they are kind of a cultural stand-in for. It was true with [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=2628.4s)]
*  a lot of students I've been spending time with. I was at the University of Chicago. I was teaching [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=2633.52s)]
*  there one day a week this spring. I made a point of spending time with college Republicans. [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=2637.12s)]
*  And you would see a lot of people who voted this way, who are actually not your... They're not voting [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=2640.88s)]
*  for Trump because they interned at the Heritage Foundation. They're not even conservative. [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=2649.92s)]
*  They were... For reasons we've talked about a little bit, Trump may have spoken to these guys, [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=2654.32s)]
*  but they are not committed Republican voters. It will be habit-forming if we don't [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=2661.68s)]
*  earn their support back, and it happens two or three times in a row. But when I'm talking to [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=2668.4s)]
*  these guys, they went that way last time. They could totally go a different way next time, [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=2673.2s)]
*  because policy-wise, like most Americans, they agree with us most of the time on most of the big [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=2677.44s)]
*  issues. Yeah. And what was it like off? And you talked to him for three hours. You probably didn't [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=2683.28s)]
*  have much time off podcasts. No, it was the same thing. I mean, it was the same thing. Yeah, [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=2689.0400000000004s)]
*  we were hanging around, I don't know, maybe a half hour before we settled in. It was the same thing [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=2693.92s)]
*  as when the podcast was rolling. It was just bullshitting and talking about stuff and swapping [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=2697.6000000000004s)]
*  stories. And I mean, part of what I really enjoyed about that experience was that it didn't feel like [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=2701.6800000000003s)]
*  being on a show. But part of what's important about it, like legitimately important about [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=2708.16s)]
*  formats like that or Rogan, these three-hour formats is it is literally impossible as a matter of [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=2714.0s)]
*  physical and psychological stamina to stay on talking points for three hours. And so if you're [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=2722.08s)]
*  even trying, that'll show pretty quick, which is probably why not everybody wants to do it. [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=2728.16s)]
*  But I think the kinds of leaders who aren't trapped in talking points and don't mind just saying what [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=2732.8799999999997s)]
*  they think about stuff, even if you say something wrong every now and then, are more the people who [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=2737.76s)]
*  are going to thrive in that environment. For sure. And I should just say as much as I want it, [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=2742.32s)]
*  I would want to hang out with you for three hours, Pete, and bring the kids in and let Chastik come [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=2746.32s)]
*  in and just bullshit about drag race or whatever is happening in your life right now, cleaning up [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=2750.0s)]
*  with the kids. I don't think Jason, I do a daily pod. So Jason can't really turn around three [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=2754.0s)]
*  hours at a time. That's more on me than on you. I don't think there's a ton of editing. I mean, [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=2758.8s)]
*  the other moment that really demonstrated to me how truly different this format is, is when [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=2765.76s)]
*  Andrew Schultz just got up in the middle of the interview to go to the bathroom and we just [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=2770.0s)]
*  continued the conversation. Oh, is that what was happening? Because I was listening, not watching. [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=2773.6s)]
*  I heard some scuttle, but I couldn't tell what was going on. He just left and came back. [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=2777.6800000000003s)]
*  Yeah, he just got up. I think he had to go to the bathroom and then he came back in a couple minutes. [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=2781.92s)]
*  We kept talking the whole time. Nothing could better demonstrate the fact that this is literally [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=2784.7200000000003s)]
*  has more in common with sitting around with friends over a beer than it does with [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=2791.1200000000003s)]
*  going on CNN. Do you feel like there's a puzzle? To me, it's just such a tough nut to crack though, [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=2794.64s)]
*  because I've been spending a lot of time thinking about this. One of my friends is friends with [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=2799.8399999999997s)]
*  Theo Vons. I've got to hang out with him just a little bit. He's a similar one of these shows. [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=2804.56s)]
*  And again, similar to Schultz, it's like this person is not, this is a totally different animal [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=2808.24s)]
*  than Ben Shapiro or something. Some are Charlie Kirk. Somebody with a coherent, [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=2813.44s)]
*  right-wing ideological vision who would be Republican if it was JD Vance or Nikki Haley [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=2818.96s)]
*  or whatever they would contort themselves to. That's not what these guys are. But it's like, [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=2822.56s)]
*  okay, so if the policies are aligned, what is it? Do the Democrats need to just find somebody who is [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=2826.7999999999997s)]
*  more culturally suited to them to go hang out? I don't know. Do you have a theory? How do you crack [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=2834.08s)]
*  the nut? What is it? Yeah, that's a classic dynamic, right? The message and then the messenger. [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=2840.96s)]
*  Turns out the tone and the messenger matter a lot. And even if the message is the exact same [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=2846.56s)]
*  in terms of policy, two different people will take it to very different places and cover a [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=2850.56s)]
*  different distance depending who those two people are. So I think part of it's that. [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=2856.24s)]
*  I do think part of it is how this stuff kind of flows out in the information ecosystem. I'm [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=2861.2799999999997s)]
*  growing obsessed with this question of how much the tension something gets is organic, [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=2865.84s)]
*  by which I mean like you say the right thing in just the right way and it just catches fire. [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=2871.52s)]
*  And how much of it has to do with money being spent to amplify certain clips from certain people [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=2876.4s)]
*  and certain getting to certain viewers, right? Like both of those things are going on, right? So [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=2881.36s)]
*  strategists on my side shouldn't be naive about that part, like the paid part. [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=2886.4s)]
*  Yeah. What did you make about that? That there was that memo going around. It was a 20, [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=2892.32s)]
*  we're sending 20 million bucks on reaching men like they're kind of animals in a zoo. [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=2897.92s)]
*  I can do it for half that. What was up with that? [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=2902.56s)]
*  Look, everybody's scratching around the same problem. They're asking the right questions. [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=2905.92s)]
*  I'm sure some of the answers and projects people come up with will be good. Some of them will be [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=2908.88s)]
*  half-assed. But I think the other important thing to remember is we have a way of always fighting [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=2913.12s)]
*  the last war and dealing, you know, the same way that like in 2017, we were like, oh, we should be [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=2919.52s)]
*  paying more attention to Twitter. I hope we can do a little more though, you know, skating to where [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=2923.3599999999997s)]
*  the puck is going. I want to, I just want to pull it up so I get it exactly right. The prospectus [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=2928.48s)]
*  for a $20 million effort was code named Sam speaking with American men, a strategic plan. [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=2932.64s)]
*  I mean, this is like, this is fucking ridiculous. I mean, what is that? What are we doing? [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=2939.68s)]
*  Well, there's nothing wrong with a strategic plan for speaking to American men, but obviously [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=2944.7999999999997s)]
*  there's some questions about that. Maybe just speaking would be the strategic plan. [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=2950.0s)]
*  My approach has been to like, go there. But look, we, again, we're always fighting the last war. [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=2954.08s)]
*  I think what we really need to figure out is in 26, in 28 and beyond, what are the things that [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=2961.6s)]
*  are really going to shape what it's like to be an American? And some of that is obviously what's [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=2968.0s)]
*  going on in our politics. And a lot of that is what's about to happen with technology. And I think [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=2971.8399999999997s)]
*  even now we are underreacting because this AI stuff, it's not something most people will [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=2976.64s)]
*  experience as a tech issue. It's something they'll experience as a radical change in what it's like [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=2982.4s)]
*  to get or do a job. And a lot of things that I thought would happen in the 2050s are looking [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=2988.64s)]
*  like they might happen before the 2020s are over. And that's got to be factored into all the stuff [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=2993.92s)]
*  we're thinking about that we learned the hard way in 2024. I want to ask about AI next, but [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=2998.72s)]
*  just one more question about the bros. Because I'm just, again, it's a puzzle I'm trying to crack. [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=3003.44s)]
*  Like, I think that they're negative polarized against the progressives in their lives that [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=3007.7599999999998s)]
*  they don't like that annoy them. They're like, wringing their finger at them. And maybe like, [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=3012.16s)]
*  just kind of talking to them about policy actually doesn't, wasn't work. Maybe the right [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=3016.64s)]
*  thing to do is negatively polarize them against Trump and make them realize that the MAGA folks [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=3020.8799999999997s)]
*  don't, aren't actually looking out for the best interests. They want to ban porn. They're like, [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=3025.44s)]
*  too stupid to, you know, address AI. I don't know, whatever. We can think about what the different [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=3029.3599999999997s)]
*  negative polarization efforts are. Isn't that easier though than being positive? [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=3035.2s)]
*  Of course we should be talking about how, yeah, if, you know, Speaker Johnson got his way, [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=3039.68s)]
*  it wouldn't be possible, not just for gay people to get married, but for straight people to get [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=3045.2799999999997s)]
*  divorced, let alone like birth control or how he would want to regulate porn or whatever people, [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=3048.7999999999997s)]
*  most people would have a problem with. But, you know, whether talking about that or cuts to Medicaid [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=3054.72s)]
*  or cuts to veterans or any of the other like wildly unpopular stuff they're doing, no question, [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=3060.16s)]
*  we should be all over it. And I will be. But if you're looking at things we haven't done enough of [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=3065.68s)]
*  as a party or as a movement, negativity with regard to Donald Trump is not one of the areas [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=3071.2s)]
*  I would say is a big deficiency. Not top-lesson deficiency. Oh wait, I lied. I had one more thing [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=3077.04s)]
*  about Andrew Schultz. Bernie also went on the show. He was asked this by Andrew, [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=3082.48s)]
*  could we not also say ostensibly there hasn't been a fair primary for the Democrats since 2008? [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=3085.68s)]
*  Are they not also a threat to democracy? Bernie replied, yes, fair enough. I'm not going to argue [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=3091.52s)]
*  that point and that's why I'm an independent. That's insane. Isn't that crazy that that was [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=3097.12s)]
*  his answer? Bernie being Bernie, right? I mean, he says a lot of things that most Democrats would [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=3104.48s)]
*  agree with, but he's not a Democrat and has a very different way of thinking and talking about. [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=3109.8399999999997s)]
*  But you have had fair primaries since 2008. 2016 was a fair primary, 2020 was a fair primary. [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=3116.24s)]
*  These were free and fair votes, right? I would argue it would have been a little fairer to me [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=3122.3199999999997s)]
*  if they'd gone ahead and counted the Iowa caucus results more quickly and more accurately. But I [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=3126.16s)]
*  don't feel like somebody was nefariously rigging it to prevent me from- Everybody's got a beef [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=3130.56s)]
*  with the DNC. I'm just saying. I'm not going to be somebody who says everything was perfectly [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=3138.96s)]
*  fine with that process. I was a morning Joe the next morning calling you a winner. All right, [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=3144.96s)]
*  Pete. I was looking out for you, but I'm also not a Democrat. So maybe that was some clear-eyed [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=3148.3199999999997s)]
*  ability there. All right, back to the AI thing. She said something interesting. I don't want to [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=3154.96s)]
*  lose the threat. So what I'm worried about is information, people being able to figure out [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=3158.16s)]
*  what's true and what's not. And what I'm also worried about is loneliness and young people [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=3164.56s)]
*  with CHAP GPT becoming their best friend and not actually getting out in the world meeting humans. [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=3169.44s)]
*  And what I'm excited about is some of the stuff you talked about, medical, [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=3173.92s)]
*  research and who knows what potential options are. So talk about what your [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=3178.56s)]
*  worries are and how you react to that. So I share the things you just said in terms of both the [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=3185.36s)]
*  worries and the upsides. But I would say the biggest thing that I think could be ultimately [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=3189.76s)]
*  the most consequential upside or the most consequential harm is what happens when [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=3195.36s)]
*  machines can do so much more, including lots and lots of white collar work. So that all that [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=3202.7200000000003s)]
*  really matters is who owns the machines. And by machines, I really mean it's the intellectual [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=3210.08s)]
*  property as well as the server farms and all of that. Because one of two things will happen. [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=3214.56s)]
*  Either we have even more enormous concentration of wealth and therefore power into an even smaller [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=3219.68s)]
*  set of hands. I mean, if you think social media did a lot to drive wealth into a tiny number of [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=3228.64s)]
*  pockets, think about what happens when a handful of people literally own technology that can do [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=3234.48s)]
*  most things that workers now do. So that's a pretty terrifying scenario where we all, [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=3239.68s)]
*  no matter what's going on with our campaigns and elections, wind up being just like the playthings [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=3246.24s)]
*  of these oligarchs. Or another thing that could also absolutely happen is we figure out a way to [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=3250.3199999999997s)]
*  deal more of the American people into the enormous value that's being created here in a way that means [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=3257.6s)]
*  that for most Americans, this means more economic security. It means less work, more money in your [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=3264.56s)]
*  pocket. And then we work on the other big issue, which is what do you do with your time, which [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=3271.44s)]
*  Americans have really struggled on. Since World War II, we've gotten five times more productive. [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=3275.92s)]
*  Just in pure terms, you could work one day a week now and generate as much economic value as it took [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=3280.0s)]
*  all week then. And yet we don't work fewer hours. We took all of that and used it to have a higher [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=3285.68s)]
*  standard of living and just work more. But what if we actually had more time to do things that [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=3290.08s)]
*  actually conservatives do a good job of talking about, focusing on family and neighborhood and [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=3298.56s)]
*  faith, community, whatever matters in your life, right? We can set ourselves up for that, [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=3304.08s)]
*  or we can screw it up and get into a really dark place. [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=3308.7999999999997s)]
*  I know it's out of the bed, Ahmad, but you're the politician. You have more optimism. Your job is [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=3312.64s)]
*  to have the optimism. I don't know. That was a compelling answer. And I was more [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=3318.48s)]
*  drawn to the former as a likely outcome, unfortunately. [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=3327.84s)]
*  Well, I mean, that's up to us, right? I mean, these are choices that societies make. And [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=3332.0s)]
*  we're technically a democratic society, so the choice is literally up to all of us, [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=3337.44s)]
*  at least in theory. [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=3341.2s)]
*  All right. We're going to do rapid fire on a couple of quick topics, and I'll let you go. [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=3341.6s)]
*  Yeah. This one, there's a narrow corner of the internet in my world, the neoliberal, [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=3344.72s)]
*  never-Trump-er, anti-red tape world that overlaps with something that you oversaw as [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=3352.08s)]
*  Secretary of Transportation. This is the Jones Act. It's a US law that mandates that cargo [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=3357.2799999999997s)]
*  transported between US ports must be shipped on vessels that are US-built, US-owned, US-flagged, [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=3362.0s)]
*  and crewed by a majority of US citizens. Yay, USA! Wave the flag. The problem with that is, [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=3366.64s)]
*  that makes things a lot more expensive for everybody. And it's a 1920s law, and it's [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=3371.92s)]
*  2020. What do you think of the Jones Act? [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=3376.88s)]
*  So the Jones Act exists to support that US industry, that we have more ships crewed by [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=3379.6s)]
*  Americans doing shipping. Otherwise, we probably would have nearly zero US-flagged vessels. So [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=3386.24s)]
*  it's important. Is it a roundabout and complex way to achieve that policy? Yes, it is. Is it worth it? [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=3393.44s)]
*  I think it is. But let me also say that we could be doing so much more to build up American [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=3400.08s)]
*  shipping and shipbuilding. One of the handful of things that I would actually say is the right, [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=3407.68s)]
*  at least the right body language. I don't think I can pull it off, but the right theoretical idea [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=3412.96s)]
*  is what this administration is saying about shipbuilding. We did some of it when I was [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=3417.44s)]
*  at DOT. I was constantly talking to the Secretary of Navy about how we could beef up a US shipping [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=3421.7599999999998s)]
*  industry. We purchased training vessels for the US Department of Transportation that were built in [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=3427.2s)]
*  the Philly shipyard that helped create a lot of work and a lot of shipbuilding capacity in the [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=3431.68s)]
*  Philly shipyard. But it takes too long and costs too much to build ships in the US compared to Asia, [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=3434.96s)]
*  and we've got to get better at that. So look, we should have a much more robust merchant marine [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=3440.3199999999997s)]
*  commercial shipping sector and US-flagged fleet in addition to the military side. [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=3446.72s)]
*  And that is clear and I think inarguable. The Jones Act is a complicated way that we support that, [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=3451.12s)]
*  but we could be doing a lot more. And then we might be watching our ship. [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=3457.2799999999997s)]
*  So let's just build more ships. Let's do a ships act, but a ships act, and then we can get rid of [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=3459.3599999999997s)]
*  the Jones Act. A ships act, and then we can meet us in the middle. This is how things used to work, [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=3463.3599999999997s)]
*  Pete, where two sides would get together, we'd meet in the middle. [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=3467.6s)]
*  Yeah. Where's the smoke-filled room? [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=3471.7599999999998s)]
*  Okay. We're open to it. All right. Do you have a pet policy? I brought up the Jones Act. Do you [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=3473.2s)]
*  have a random little niche pet policy? Yeah, digital ID. [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=3476.64s)]
*  Tell us about it. Well, one of the basic jobs of [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=3481.2799999999997s)]
*  government is to establish that you are who you say you are, authentication, right? We do it in the [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=3484.48s)]
*  most jumbled, screwed up, antiquated, and insecure set of ways. We have papers, birth certificates [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=3489.3599999999997s)]
*  in like drawers in county health offices to establish who we are. And then in our day-to-day, [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=3495.04s)]
*  we use driver's licenses that are different in every state, and you're supposed to have one [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=3500.48s)]
*  whether you drive or not. And then online, the ultimate way, the kind of master password for [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=3504.0s)]
*  everything is your social security number. But that means if somebody knows your social security [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=3511.12s)]
*  number, which is the nearest thing we have to an ID number as a citizen, they can get to just about [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=3514.96s)]
*  everything and you're screwed. This is insane, and nobody would have come up with this on purpose, [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=3520.16s)]
*  on a clean sheet. There are a lot of other countries that do better. Ukraine, actually, [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=3527.36s)]
*  what you can do with a QR code in a secure way with digital ID makes what we have in the US [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=3531.44s)]
*  an embarrassment. A lot of the best countries on this are actually Eastern Europe, Estonia, Latvia, [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=3538.56s)]
*  they've been doing it, but India, they're rolling out stuff. They've got a billion people. Yeah, [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=3542.24s)]
*  the Estonians are like, that's like, I feel like they're visiting us from the future when I talk [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=3545.2799999999997s)]
*  to the Estonian data people. So I know it sounds like a nerdy niche thing. I actually think a lot [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=3550.08s)]
*  of things that have intense political and economic consequence from the ability to access [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=3555.92s)]
*  Medicaid and food benefits in a safe, fraud-free way to voting and election security, [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=3564.48s)]
*  those are all implicated in the need for us to improve our screwed up upside down [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=3571.92s)]
*  system of ID and authentication. I love that one. Okay. That wasn't that rapid though. We're [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=3579.28s)]
*  going real rapid on the gay stuff. Then we're out of here. We have a gay rapid fire section, [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=3583.36s)]
*  then we're out. I received an email this morning from a trans person that's really concerned and [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=3587.1200000000003s)]
*  upset about the all gender transition care that's being cut from Medicaid as part of this new bill. [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=3591.84s)]
*  This stuff is really touchy. I think Democrats are afraid to kind of talk about it now for [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=3598.88s)]
*  good reason, maybe politically, because what you saw happened to come love. I wonder if you [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=3602.0s)]
*  have any thoughts on that part of the Medicaid cuts. Healthcare is healthcare, and you should [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=3605.44s)]
*  be able to get healthcare. If you and your doctor agree that you need a service, then you should be [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=3612.4s)]
*  able to get it. Attacking that as part of this legislation is just one more example of politicians [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=3617.36s)]
*  stepping on somebody's face in order to try to get ahead politically. Pride is pride back. I feel [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=3623.52s)]
*  like we had a moment where we were getting, it was getting a little stale. You had the Lockheed Martin [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=3628.64s)]
*  pride float. Yeah, it was getting a little corporate. Yeah. Yeah, it's a little corporate. [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=3633.44s)]
*  Now that they're going after DEI, and there's a little bit of fear that the Trump administration [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=3636.96s)]
*  will go after you, I kind of feel like pride is going to be back this year. I don't know. [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=3642.08s)]
*  Yeah, maybe we'll have a little more of that political edge to it. I mean, it started out [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=3644.72s)]
*  as a protest, right? So we'll see. The beard, have, I don't know, Chastain, other gays on the [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=3649.2s)]
*  internet. I mean, how have the gays been responding to the beard? Yeah, so it's basically Chastain, [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=3655.68s)]
*  and the internet gays seem to be strongly pro. In our household, the other strong vote, the other [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=3661.92s)]
*  direction is Penelope, who says it's too, our daughter who says it's too scratchy when I kiss [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=3668.4s)]
*  her at bedtime. Our son has yet to weigh in, interestingly, so we have a swing vote here around [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=3672.08s)]
*  the house. And my mother has been very judiciously silent, which makes me think she's on team no beard. [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=3677.6s)]
*  But we'll see. That sounds like my relationship with my mother. All right, so let's just end on [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=3686.56s)]
*  the parenting. I don't know if you've been able to hear, unlike Andrew Schultz, I didn't get up to [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=3690.4s)]
*  pee, but I have the seven-year-old, I think has been playing the drums, like squeezing a loud [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=3694.08s)]
*  chicken. There's been other unidentified noises right out the door. I'm working for home. I assume [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=3699.84s)]
*  you've got, are they running around over there? Yeah, they're at school, but they definitely [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=3705.36s)]
*  contribute sound effects the rest of the time. They're still in school? May 27th, that's nice. [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=3708.64s)]
*  We're out. It's over now. It's summer vacation. Look, we still have the snow tires on around here, [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=3712.56s)]
*  so summer comes a little bit late to northern Michigan. What has been the most just delightful [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=3716.96s)]
*  part of, I guess we're coming up on year four? Yeah, we're coming up on four. They keep talking [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=3722.16s)]
*  about it. Although Gus, for some reason, keeps talking about being five. He's like, [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=3726.8799999999997s)]
*  we have a birthday, and then after birthday, it'll be five. I think the most delightful part is [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=3730.0s)]
*  one thing I'm enjoying is that they're starting to make sense, but not completely. They can tell [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=3737.12s)]
*  stories, but you have to sift through the story to try to figure out what's at the bottom of it. [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=3742.24s)]
*  Gus was talking about leprechauns. He's like, do you know who a leprechaun is? I was like, [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=3748.24s)]
*  yeah. Then he told me what a leprechaun is. It plays a trick, and it takes something, [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=3751.52s)]
*  and then it runs so fast. Then the gingerbread man catches it, and it turns into a zombie. [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=3757.2s)]
*  I'm trying to derive what the backstory was to why that's what- [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giZtjgXXfUA&t=3764.64s)]
