Video Description: On deportations and on foreign policy, the Trump administration is swapping out American values and violating everything the U.S. has stood for in exchange for kleptocracy and transactionalism with the world's worst tyrants. But at the same time, Trump can't even seem to grasp that Putin has been waging war for decades to accomplish his goals and is not interested in cutting a deal to end the bloodshed in Ukraine. Plus, the very dim appointees running our federal agencies, Elon and Marco are now trying to deny they cut food aid, and the unwelcome honorific of being a Trump historian. Susan Glasser joins Tim Miller.

# Tulsi’s Not Even TRYING to Hide Corruption at DNI (w/ Susan Glasser) | Bulwark Podcast
**The Bulwark Podcast:** [May 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q)
*  Spoiler alert, America is not being invaded here, people. Okay? So if your entire legal case rests [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=0.0s)]
*  on the idea that America is being invaded, then you are asking lots of people in the federal [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=6.32s)]
*  government to lie. Hello and welcome to the Bullard Podcast. I'm your host, Tim Miller, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=12.72s)]
*  delighted to have back staff writer at the New Yorker, which writes a weekly column on life in [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=24.64s)]
*  Washington. She's the co-author of The Divider, Trump in the White House, which she co-wrote with [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=29.04s)]
*  her husband, Peter Baker, former Moscow bureau chief for the Washington Post. It's Susan Glasser. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=33.76s)]
*  What's up, Susan? Hey, Tim, great to be with you. Much to discuss. You're back from Estonia? I [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=38.32s)]
*  understand. That is right. Got to go to Tallinn. It's an awesome place. Seriously, I'm actually [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=45.28s)]
*  like a huge Estonia super fan. Jeb was a huge Estonia super fan and Tallinn's been on my list. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=51.28s)]
*  I don't think that's going to happen for me on my vacation this summer, but hopefully next time [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=58.879999999999995s)]
*  you're invited to a panel, maybe you can nominate me as a co-panelist. I understand you're with the [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=64.32s)]
*  presidents of Estonia, Slovenia and Finland. So what was the buzz there? Which one of those [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=69.52s)]
*  presidents do you like the most? Well, it was a kind of an intimidating group, I have to say. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=76.4s)]
*  It was the closing panel and I guess they decided this was the best they could do for American [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=82.56s)]
*  representation. But it's very interesting because Alex Stubbe is the president of Finland and [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=87.6s)]
*  you may not know this, I forgive you, European president trivia, but he was a star golf player [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=95.67999999999999s)]
*  back in the day. And so his fellow Europeans, he's also a super brilliant, actually academic [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=101.91999999999999s)]
*  turned politician. So his fellow Europeans thought it would be a really good idea to make him their [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=109.44s)]
*  designated Trump whisperer. And they sent him to Mar-a-Lago to play golf with the president. He [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=113.76s)]
*  spent seven hours doing that and he has become a big proponent of the Engage Trump Wherever Possible [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=120.32000000000001s)]
*  School of European Diplomacy. So it was very interesting to hear what he had to say. And I [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=127.44s)]
*  think the basic point is they need to be in Trump's ear more because there are a lot of people who are [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=134.4s)]
*  definitely not on the same page when it comes to the war in Ukraine and Europe and lots of other [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=141.36s)]
*  issues. Maybe just move to Palm Beach. Can you run Finland from South Florida? You know, it would [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=146.24s)]
*  definitely be warmer. Definitely be a lot warmer. Definitely be a lot warmer. But he was also then [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=152.96s)]
*  on the phone call the very next day after our panel with European leaders and Trump after Trump's [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=160.8s)]
*  phone call with Vladimir Putin. And I don't think things went quite so well for the Europeans in [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=167.6s)]
*  that call. Is the tone there, you know, I mean, even off panel, like when you're talking to folks, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=172.32s)]
*  just like, we've got to start to plan for no America, or is it more, you know, we can butter [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=177.04s)]
*  this guy up and buy his cryptocurrency and make it work? Or, you know, we'll just, you know, ride [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=184.07999999999998s)]
*  the way bumpy waves? Like, what's the mindset among the Eastern European crowd? Yeah, I mean, look, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=190.07999999999998s)]
*  this is a group of people whose security depends not just on the outcome of the war in Ukraine, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=197.44s)]
*  but on, you know, Trump not completely blowing up NATO on, you know, what happens after the [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=201.76s)]
*  Ukraine war. You can't go to Estonia and not be aware of the vulnerability of the small countries [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=209.12s)]
*  who we accepted into NATO a couple decades ago. And, you know, I think this was a the West is over [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=215.52s)]
*  kind of crowd a sense that it's not just a question of waiting a few more years for the [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=224.24s)]
*  US to snap back. It's really a very post American conversation in many ways now, except I will say [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=229.68s)]
*  this, I still feel that in their heart of hearts, they can't fully accept this. And, you know, so [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=237.84s)]
*  there will continue to be you've seen this phenomenon in the Republican Party. It's not [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=242.8s)]
*  dissimilar to the phenomenon among our European allies and partners, because there's no obvious [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=247.68s)]
*  and easy solutions that don't involve the United States when it comes to how to confront Russia. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=252.96s)]
*  And so, you know, there's a sort of a despair, but they keep, you know, the hope stays alive [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=258.48s)]
*  for these folks, okay, well, maybe he's going to consider the sanctions we they've assured us that [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=265.6s)]
*  he's not going to blow up NATO. They actually did have Trump's NATO ambassador come to this [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=270.32s)]
*  conference, which was interesting, Matt Whitaker that he chose to show up. But the flip side was [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=275.2s)]
*  the hopefulness, you know, it's dash the very next day, right on Monday, oh, all of a sudden, [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=280.56s)]
*  wait a minute, America isn't on board with sanctions, even when Putin doesn't choose to [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=287.36s)]
*  go along with us. And so from my perspective, the rhetoric I'm hearing is tougher than in Trump's [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=292.32s)]
*  first term from the Europeans, right? Like they claim that they're more reality based, but [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=299.12s)]
*  the vibe is still a bit of denial. They can't really believe it. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=305.2s)]
*  **Matt Stauffer** I forgot that middling Iowa football star, Matt Whitaker was our NATO [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=310.15999999999997s)]
*  ambassador. That was a fact I knew and talked about on the podcast, but just, you know, [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=316.15999999999997s)]
*  you only have so much room in your brain for all these characters. And so that's interesting that [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=321.52s)]
*  he was, did you talk to him? **Sara Levy** I did not, but I saw him bustling around importantly, [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=325.91999999999996s)]
*  multiple times. He definitely had the most kind of middle America football vibe of anyone who [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=330.56s)]
*  was attending the security conference in Tallinn. You know, I think, you know, I did talk to a lot of, [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=336.16s)]
*  you know, senior Europeans who feel that, you know, maybe they can avoid being at the center of [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=344.24s)]
*  Trump's attention, because that's usually not a good thing. But that's a kind of a best case [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=352.96s)]
*  scenario for them. And, you know, in some ways there might be some relief if he moves on from [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=358.4s)]
*  his idea that he's going to make a peace deal between Russia and Ukraine, because I think [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=364.47999999999996s)]
*  they're so worried about what the terms of that would be. **Matt Stauffer** Yeah. Well, that's a nice [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=368.64s)]
*  transition to that. So you mentioned that call. So we talked yesterday with David French about the [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=373.2s)]
*  Trump-Putin call, which was two hours apparently, and the readouts of which were quite different, [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=379.67999999999995s)]
*  a very Russian reserved, calculated readout from the Putin side, the Trump, a braggadocious [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=387.12s)]
*  readout from the Trump side. And then as you mentioned, there's then this follow-up call with [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=395.52s)]
*  the European stakeholders. And, you know, reports from the FT are pretty bleak about that call. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=400.0s)]
*  Two people briefed on the call said Trump was clearly pulled the US back from engaging with [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=408.48s)]
*  the conflict and leave Ukraine and Russia to directly negotiate a ceasefire. He made no promise [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=413.36s)]
*  of future US sanctions against Russia. They added a different person familiar with the conversation [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=418.64s)]
*  said Trump was not ready to put greater pressure on Putin. Shocking. So what do you make about kind of [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=425.84000000000003s)]
*  that fallout? **Sara Hickman** Yeah. I mean, I think this is a great example is that where [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=432.48s)]
*  Trumpology, if you will, often fails is because people who have a lot riding on the outcome of [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=438.88s)]
*  Trump will listen to the word of his staff or his enablers rather than, you know, kind of looking [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=448.64s)]
*  at, well, what it wears Trump himself at. And, you know, on the Ukraine, it's just been very clear [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=456.8s)]
*  for a very long time that Trump, you know, is not on the same team as the Europeans. And so that's, [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=462.8s)]
*  I understand diplomacy has to occur no matter what and seek to find space even where it doesn't [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=470.8s)]
*  exist. And so that's why as journalists are probably not well suited to that occupation [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=476.0s)]
*  because it requires to a certain extent the willful suspension of disbelief. But when it comes to [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=482.40000000000003s)]
*  Putin and Trump, you know, we've got eight years of a record here that suggests that Trump is [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=487.6s)]
*  looking to reset U.S. ties with Russia and that that is the goal that stymied, you know, the war [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=493.12s)]
*  in Ukraine that's secondary to that bigger goal of a U.S. Russia reset that I think Trump has been [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=500.24s)]
*  pursuing since he entered political life. And I was really struck. There was a quote [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=506.24s)]
*  at the very bottom of the Washington Post write up of this Putin Trump call that I think really [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=513.2s)]
*  summed it up. And it was from Konstantin Kostyachev, who is the head of the Foreign [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=519.12s)]
*  Affairs Council and the Federation Council, sorry, Committee and the Federation Council in the Russian [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=523.12s)]
*  Parliament. And he basically said, yeah, it's clear from this call, there are two sides in [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=528.4s)]
*  these negotiations. There's a U.S. Russia side and a Ukraine European side. And, you know, first of [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=533.92s)]
*  all, that's a gut punch of a quote. But second of all, it's hard to take issue with that. I think [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=541.2s)]
*  that's accurate at the moment. Yeah, sure. And even to the extent that, you know, that the Trump [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=546.88s)]
*  administration, maybe not Trump himself, are trying to kind of paper over that reality and, you know, [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=554.6400000000001s)]
*  at times talk about how, you know, Russia needs to step up and come to the table and it's time for [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=561.84s)]
*  them to do so. And, you know, it's and leaving the door open, as you mentioned, some staff leaving [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=567.28s)]
*  the door open to sanctions. You know, like the general contours of this have been pretty clear [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=572.0s)]
*  for a while. And I mean, you talked about the Trumpology of it, like the criminology of it is [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=577.8399999999999s)]
*  pretty clear, right? Like Putin's statements are all so qualified, you know, well, like with the [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=582.16s)]
*  beginnings of a deal, we're looking into the outlines of an agreement and there's more [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=588.72s)]
*  negotiation to come. Like, meanwhile, stepping up the bombing. Like, it's like, it's pretty clear [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=593.44s)]
*  that they that that Putin sees this as these guys don't have the stomach for this, even if they were [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=598.8000000000001s)]
*  on the Ukraine Europe side, they're not going to stick around. If I can just keep stalling, [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=606.24s)]
*  and you know, for time, eventually they're going to do what they might be doing imminently, which [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=611.2800000000001s)]
*  is just walking away from this altogether. Yeah, Tim, I agree with your reading of the situation. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=615.7600000000001s)]
*  If anything, I would say it's even more embarrassing for the Trump administration than [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=621.52s)]
*  that because Putin has already succeeded in getting Trump to abandon the goal that he outlined from [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=627.04s)]
*  the beginning. Trump said that he was demanding an immediate ceasefire that would then be followed [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=634.0s)]
*  by longer term peace talks. Okay, that that was the precondition. He's now given that up. He [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=641.6s)]
*  basically handed that to Vladimir Putin, who had to concede nothing in order to get that. So Trump's [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=647.92s)]
*  entire performative, you know, metaphorically beating the crap out of Vladimir Zelensky in the [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=653.4399999999999s)]
*  Oval Office was all designed to get Zelensky to go along with his kind of extortionate [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=659.5999999999999s)]
*  minerals deal, but also with this demand for a 30 day ceasefire on the front end with no other [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=667.28s)]
*  conditions imposed on Russia. Now, Zelensky went along with that and Putin said, yeah, no, [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=673.6s)]
*  I'm not going to do that. And Trump, rather than saying, okay, well, there are costs to you for [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=678.64s)]
*  not agreeing to this, said, okay. So he's abandoned the entire negotiating position that the US was [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=684.64s)]
*  setting up over the last three months. I mean, it's, it's a really interesting example of [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=693.28s)]
*  Donald Trump and his alleged deal making prowess, you know, the people who studied closely, [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=698.56s)]
*  what Trump has done in the diplomatic arena as president in his first term and so far in [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=705.28s)]
*  his second term, you know, it's, he's not, he's not a very good deal maker. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=709.84s)]
*  No, to say the least. So broadening it out from from what's happening in this negotiation to [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=717.2s)]
*  what we saw in the Middle East last week. You know, Trump offers this, you know, what his [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=724.16s)]
*  enablers and like kind of the fancy MAGA foreign policy types around him want to fashion into some [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=732.9599999999999s)]
*  doctrine with his speech in Saudi Arabia that I put the audio yesterday of Marco Rubio talking [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=739.36s)]
*  about how this is the most important foreign policy speech since the Brandenburg gauge or whatever. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=744.7199999999999s)]
*  And you offered this explanation for the Trump doctrine, which I'd like for you to expand on, [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=749.68s)]
*  which I think is basically right. Trump's foreign policy doctrine is not a doctrine at all, but a [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=756.2399999999999s)]
*  way of life defined by extreme transactionalism and self interest. And that's really what it comes [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=760.4s)]
*  down to in both the both the Europe situation and what we saw in the Middle East. And so right. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=767.04s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. And I think that's why actually, Trump going to the Middle East for his first [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=772.16s)]
*  extended foreign policy trip of both his first term and his second term is is really the tell here. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=778.08s)]
*  Donald Trump wants to sort of be in the bizarre and he's kind of value neutral about what's going [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=785.92s)]
*  to happen in the bizarre, except that, you know, good things should happen for him and his interests. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=792.5600000000001s)]
*  And that's largely defined as in a very personal sense. So, you know, Qatar giving me a plane and [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=797.12s)]
*  Qatar giving my son a business deal to build a new real estate development with my name [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=805.44s)]
*  slapped across the top UAE, Saudi Arabia. These are all almost the personalization [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=813.2s)]
*  of American foreign policy. And that's why he's so comfortable. I think in that milieu, by the way, [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=819.5200000000001s)]
*  to the point about Secretary Marco Rubio and the difference between him and Senator Marco Rubio, [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=825.12s)]
*  I saw that quote about Rubio claiming that Trump's speech in Saudi Arabia was, you know, [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=832.08s)]
*  the most important thing, which is a really remarkable thing to say, because it was [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=838.64s)]
*  essentially plagiarized from Trump's own speech in Saudi Arabia eight years ago when he said the [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=843.5200000000001s)]
*  exact same thing to the Saudis. He literally went to Saudi Arabia. And, you know, I have to say even [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=849.2800000000001s)]
*  Trump's critics suffer from a very routine cases of amnesia. And, you know, I recognize we have [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=855.44s)]
*  all a lot of inputs here. It's hard to keep it straight, but a little bit more focused people [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=862.48s)]
*  on the history of what's already occurred with Donald Trump would be very useful in not getting, [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=867.44s)]
*  you know, sort of taken advantage of and spun over and over and over again. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=874.16s)]
*  Donald Trump went to Saudi Arabia eight years ago, and he- [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=878.32s)]
*  The orb. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=882.64s)]
*  gave a speech in which he said, America will no longer lecture to you, and we won't give you [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=883.76s)]
*  annoying rants about human rights and things like that. And we're here to do business. And by the [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=890.24s)]
*  way, I'm going to announce an unprecedented number of business deals, which flash forward, [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=894.8s)]
*  never materialized in the course of his four years in office. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=900.16s)]
*  Well, the golf league came. We got the ride with the golf league. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=903.04s)]
*  That actually, I believe, was after, that was during his, right, he talked about it in his [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=907.36s)]
*  presidency, but I think it only came to be in his post presidency or his interregnum [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=912.24s)]
*  between presidencies. And he went last week. And what did he say? We're not here to lecture you. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=918.32s)]
*  And here's this unprecedented number of business deals that very likely will not fully materialize. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=924.48s)]
*  A very good note, Susan. This is why we're bringing you here for your- [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=932.32s)]
*  It's horrific that we have to be like, you're a Trump historian. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=936.4s)]
*  I knew you were going to say that. You're a Trump historian. And it's, I have to say- [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=942.24s)]
*  I'm usually playing the Trump historian role, but this is an important job for you as well, [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=945.76s)]
*  unfortunately. So here we are. Tim, I remember, literally, you're giving [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=951.12s)]
*  me nightmares because I remember back when Trump first started to run for office and when it was [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=955.12s)]
*  clear that he was very likely going to get the Republican nomination and actually be a serious [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=961.04s)]
*  candidate. And I was the editor of Politico at the time. And I said, well, I was kind of joking [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=967.4399999999999s)]
*  in a way. It started off as a jokey riff about Trumpology and how we're going to need to have it. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=975.52s)]
*  And I was imagining the future department of Trump studies and the universities. And I sort of went [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=980.64s)]
*  off on this riff with my colleagues, my good friend, Blake Hounshall, who was my fellow editor at [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=989.2s)]
*  Politico and Michael Cruz, who's an excellent writer, who's still there. And we decided, okay, [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=995.2s)]
*  we're actually going to convene the leading at that time, Trumpologists, people who'd already [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=1000.1600000000001s)]
*  written biographies of Trump. They'd never met each other, it turned out. And I invited them to [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=1004.88s)]
*  Trump Tower, to that really not very good restaurant in the basement, the Trump Grill, I think. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=1011.0400000000001s)]
*  Did you have a taco bowl? [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=1016.96s)]
*  It was, no, it was like a sort of really like a not so great chicken Caesar salad, I think, [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=1018.32s)]
*  is what I ate. But we had these five biographers of Donald Trump meet each other for the first time [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=1023.28s)]
*  and had this session that we called the Trumpologists. And I thought it was very [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=1032.56s)]
*  insightful, actually. I learned a lot about that. But of course, at the time, I didn't really think [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=1036.32s)]
*  there would be future departments of Trump studies. And I certainly did not think that eight years [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=1041.44s)]
*  later or nine years later, I would be labeled a Trump historian. But I think that's where we are. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=1046.32s)]
*  You'd be the one. We all have to go back to Trump Tower, bring Maggie, Tim O'Brien, [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=1051.68s)]
*  a little coterie. Actually, just really quick on Marco, we've moved on. But it's worth saying, [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=1057.3600000000001s)]
*  in addition to it being repetitive of his Saudi Arabia speech eight years ago, [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=1062.88s)]
*  it also is a direct rebuke of everything Marco Rubio ever stood for and ran for president on. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=1067.1200000000001s)]
*  And it is worth noting, at least, say what you want about JD Vance, I have a lot negative to say, [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=1073.1200000000001s)]
*  but he at least has provided some kind of pro forma rationale for his pivot. He has offered [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=1080.56s)]
*  an explanation. It's not particularly satisfying, but at least some explanation for why he went [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=1090.56s)]
*  from saying Trump could be Hitler to wanting to be his VP. That's never really happened for Marco. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=1096.1599999999999s)]
*  It's a little bit on the domestic stuff. This foreign policy switch from, [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=1102.64s)]
*  I believe in American values throughout the world, I believe we should be welcoming people fleeing [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=1110.0s)]
*  communism, that whole kind of great American century, whatever it was called, that Marco [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=1114.96s)]
*  was pushing in 2016, I don't feel like I've gotten a satisfactory answer for him for why now [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=1120.4s)]
*  he is like, we just want peace and happiness and transactionalism and kleptocracy. And I think [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=1127.36s)]
*  that's the right way for the world to work. Do you feel that? [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=1132.3999999999999s)]
*  Heather Cieslik Well, I take your point, Tim. And I would just venture that perhaps you haven't [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=1135.52s)]
*  gotten this satisfactory answer from Marco Rubio because he doesn't have one. Maybe he doesn't. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=1141.12s)]
*  Tim Cynova Probably right. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=1147.68s)]
*  Heather Cieslik Like, for example, on the Russia thing, he gave a long [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=1148.08s)]
*  testimony yesterday on Capitol Hill, and he was asked about the Russia, the Putin Trump call. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=1153.28s)]
*  And he did that classic, what I think of as the sort of GOP establishment two-step, [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=1161.2s)]
*  that they always think it's, oh, they're being really clever. And he said, well, [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=1169.68s)]
*  the sanctions that the US had on Russia when I woke up this morning are exactly the same as they [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=1173.44s)]
*  were before the phone call. So we haven't backed off anything. And I've been watching that dance [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=1178.24s)]
*  for a long time. It's just that Marco Rubio has parlayed that dance into Secretary of State. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=1186.64s)]
*  Tim Cynova I want to put a finer point on the Trump [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=1193.44s)]
*  Doctrine, just about the shallowness of it. And we have like this, as you described it, [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=1195.6s)]
*  extreme transactionalism. Like, doesn't always work. Putin's not really interested in a golf [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=1204.08s)]
*  resort deal with Trump. He has other historical and ideological and other things that he's [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=1210.96s)]
*  thinking about. Definitely, there's a news item from CNN this morning that says that the US [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=1220.24s)]
*  has obtained new intelligence, suggesting that Israel is making preparations to strike Iranian [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=1225.84s)]
*  nuclear facilities, even as the Trump administration has been pursuing a diplomatic [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=1229.76s)]
*  deal with Tehran, according to multiple US officials familiar with the latest intelligence. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=1233.76s)]
*  We'll see what happens with this. But again, it just betrays the limits of the transactionalism. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=1238.32s)]
*  There are much deeper wounds and ambitions and disagreements with regards to Iran and Israel [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=1244.72s)]
*  or Russia and Ukraine that cannot be salvaged by meeting at a golf course and being like, [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=1254.4s)]
*  hey, we're going to divide up the spoils like we do with the Qatari emir. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=1260.24s)]
*  Geopolitics is more complicated than that. And so I'm just wondering how you think the so-called [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=1270.88s)]
*  Trump doctrine intersects with potentially what we're seeing with Israel and Iran, [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=1277.44s)]
*  or take that any way you wish. Yeah, no, I think it's a great question, [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=1282.3200000000002s)]
*  because in both the case of Netanyahu and Putin, they actually have a view of what their own national [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=1286.4s)]
*  security long term requires that is very different than Donald Trump's definition of himself and the [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=1294.72s)]
*  state as the overriding factor. Now, Netanyahu clearly has at times prioritized his own personal [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=1302.96s)]
*  political survival. You can have any number of people on your show to talk about that and how [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=1308.88s)]
*  Netanyahu has really distorted the politics of Israel and undermined arguably the security of [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=1315.44s)]
*  Israel by prioritizing his own personal political troubles at various points. However, and it's big, [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=1321.2s)]
*  however, Israelis across the political spectrum see the Iran threat in a very existential way [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=1328.72s)]
*  that's very different than how it's viewed in Washington by someone like Donald Trump. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=1336.72s)]
*  And so I think that's important to underscore that same thing with Putin. Trump thinks, well, [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=1341.3600000000001s)]
*  I could just make him just a whole array of concessions and then he'll do what I want, [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=1348.56s)]
*  because in the end, he doesn't really want this war, except his whole theory of the case when it [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=1352.72s)]
*  comes to Russia and the war in Ukraine is completely flawed. The original mistake in it [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=1359.04s)]
*  is thinking that Putin doesn't want the war, but in fact, it's Putin's war. So the idea that that's [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=1367.04s)]
*  the overriding goal for him, Putin's goal is to win the war and not to have war not happen in and [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=1374.1599999999999s)]
*  of itself. And he has accomplished many of the goals of his presidency through the use of war. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=1381.52s)]
*  Putin came to power 25 years ago by waging a war in Chechnya. He doesn't have a long record of [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=1388.08s)]
*  ending wars with peace talks. He has a long record of remilitarizing Russian society in ways that [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=1395.1999999999998s)]
*  aggrandize his own role and the role of the state. He has potential domestic political problems where [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=1401.52s)]
*  he to end the war and then be accountable for all the deaths, especially if he didn't achieve the [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=1408.72s)]
*  stated goals of the war. And he's also defined the war in very existential terms. If you say [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=1413.76s)]
*  that Ukraine doesn't exist as a real state, that it's an illegitimate state, it's very hard [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=1421.6s)]
*  to just go ahead and be like, oh, but actually Donald Trump asked so nicely. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=1426.8799999999999s)]
*  Right. Well, then we also hit on a key point with this really does with the Trumpology, [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=1430.56s)]
*  about Trump not understanding, Trump misunderstanding the Putin rationale for the war. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=1435.2s)]
*  Trump really misunderstands a lot of these players in a lot of this case, because if you go back to [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=1441.68s)]
*  the Trumpology to those authors that you brought back together, what is Trump's framework of the [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=1448.0s)]
*  world? He wants money. He wants fame. He wants riches and women for himself. Trump's a pretty [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=1453.6s)]
*  simple animal, like a pretty simple creature. But he has all of those desires and the extreme, [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=1463.2s)]
*  like the megalomaniacal version of all of that. And so he looks at all these other people and he's [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=1473.92s)]
*  like, well, Putin just wants to be able to make more money and get back into just like me and be [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=1479.2s)]
*  the peacemaker. He got new land and he just wants fame and money. Or the Ayatollah in Iran, [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=1487.6000000000001s)]
*  like, oh, they just want to be able to cut a deal where we can reopen with them and they can get oil [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=1493.44s)]
*  and BB. And then they just want condos in Gaza. And it is impossible for him to process [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=1498.96s)]
*  like the idea that they might have religious ideological concerns for the interests of their [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=1507.92s)]
*  nation, their nation state, because he doesn't relate to any of that. He doesn't have any [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=1518.48s)]
*  religious belief or deep ideological belief. And so I do think that that is like the fundamental [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=1524.96s)]
*  flaw of all this, like eventually gets exposed. And why it's more appealing to him to deal with [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=1530.48s)]
*  MBS is kind of more like him in that sense. Yeah. I think that's a very powerful theory. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=1537.28s)]
*  The case is what you're describing, Tim, is I think the political scientists call it [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=1542.6399999999999s)]
*  mirroring that that's the big problem in foreign policy is that you mirror and you think that what [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=1547.2s)]
*  matters to you is what matters the most to your interlocutor. And Trump, he also, he doesn't know [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=1555.12s)]
*  history. He doesn't know context. He doesn't really care. He does have a long term theory [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=1561.44s)]
*  of the case when it comes to the world. And you can go back. I always recommend to people to read [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=1568.56s)]
*  this 1989 interview that he conducted with Playboy magazine. It's almost a sort of Rosetta Stone of [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=1575.28s)]
*  Donald Trump's international views. And it won't surprise you to know he thinks that America, [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=1583.3600000000001s)]
*  even back then, was getting ripped off by its allies, that everybody was out to get us. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=1588.48s)]
*  That time it was Japan, not China, that he felt had an advantage in the world economic system. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=1595.2s)]
*  He was praising strong leaders and bemoaning weak leaders of other countries. At the time, [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=1602.8s)]
*  he even thought that the Chinese had done exactly the right thing in Tiananmen Square by cracking [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=1609.3600000000001s)]
*  down and killing their own people to end protest. And he contrasted that very favorably with the [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=1614.4s)]
*  weakness of Gorbachev, who was leading to the Soviet Union's breakup. And so in a way, he told [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=1620.64s)]
*  us everything we need to know about him as an international actor back when the Cold War was [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=1628.16s)]
*  still the Cold War. You can see the weaknesses of how all that ended up playing out based on his [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=1634.8000000000002s)]
*  worldview as well. Just one last thing on this is in your article, I forget if you're the last one [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=1639.52s)]
*  of the previous and how you went to visit Mar-a-Lago and he had had the model of his desired Air Force [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=1644.48s)]
*  one on the, what were you on the veranda? It was on an outside table? Where were you? [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=1651.92s)]
*  Nicole Zichal-Pasquale No, it was the inside lobby of Mar-a-Lago in the spring of 2021. And we went there for a book [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=1657.2s)]
*  interview. And it was just vintage Trump, of course, wanting to have an interview in essentially a public [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=1664.16s)]
*  space so that everyone in the club could come through and see that he was there meeting with [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=1672.0800000000002s)]
*  important people. And literally, I didn't put this in the column the other day, but the detail that [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=1677.44s)]
*  always struck me as we walk in there, and this was in late April of 2021, and it's just essentially [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=1682.48s)]
*  Trump sitting on the couch in the lobby. There are a couple of armchairs, there's a coffee table, [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=1689.52s)]
*  the only thing on the coffee table is this model of Air Force One with the navy red and white colors [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=1693.76s)]
*  he wanted to have on it. Right next to this little seating arrangement, there's one of those big [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=1700.64s)]
*  easels and a poster board, and it says, sign up for your Mother's Day brunch now. And we sit there [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=1706.96s)]
*  and Kimberly Guilfoyle is walking through in the middle of this interview. Just amazing. But so we [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=1714.72s)]
*  saw the Air Force One model and that was the very first thing that I mentioned to him in the interview [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=1721.6s)]
*  is, why did he bring that with him? And did he think it would still come to pass even though [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=1728.0s)]
*  he was out of office? What does Mar-a-Lago smell like? I'm never going to get to go to Mar-a-Lago, [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=1733.12s)]
*  so it's fascinating to me a little bit. First of all, never say never. I did not think that [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=1738.7199999999998s)]
*  Donald Trump was going to want me to come to Mar-a-Lago either. And I remember saying to Peter, [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=1743.84s)]
*  my husband and co-author, are you sure that they know that I'm coming to this interview? [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=1749.68s)]
*  Did you feel a chill walking in or that you kind of had crossed into the Netherlands, [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=1756.24s)]
*  the Netherlands parts of the world? [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=1762.0800000000002s)]
*  It was very interesting. Remember that in the spring of 2021, [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=1764.64s)]
*  Donald Trump was still very much in exile. It was not a foregone conclusion that he was going to [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=1768.48s)]
*  come back and be president again. And he was very isolated at that time. He didn't have a big staff. [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=1774.16s)]
*  He didn't have all the fawning kind of Republican members of Congress really around him anymore. [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=1781.28s)]
*  So it was just him and the paying guests. So he was eager to talk to anybody at that particular [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=1786.8000000000002s)]
*  moment in time. I refer to this as his Napoleon and Elba period. [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=1792.88s)]
*  You didn't answer this about the smell though. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=1798.0800000000002s)]
*  It didn't have any particular smell that I recall. Maybe the whiff of money. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=1800.56s)]
*  I think either kind of dank because it's been around for so long. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=1804.32s)]
*  No, it wasn't dank. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=1807.52s)]
*  Kind of dank old hotel smell or like kind of cougar perfume smell is so intense that it overtakes [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=1808.0s)]
*  everything, but neither of those. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=1813.6799999999998s)]
*  I feel like maybe the latter, definitely not the former. It wasn't dank in any way. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=1815.6s)]
*  There were a lot of portraits of Donald Trump, including by the way, in the ladies bathroom. [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=1819.9199999999998s)]
*  Oh, Susan. [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=1826.56s)]
*  Right? I know. Isn't this a terrible thing? We did stay for dinner at his insistence [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=1827.6s)]
*  and watch the scene on the terrace as all the people stood and applaud him as he came up [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=1833.76s)]
*  to dinner. The food was decent. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=1839.1999999999998s)]
*  I can't take any more of this. [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=1841.12s)]
*  The food was decent. [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=1841.4399999999998s)]
*  I apologize for that. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=1842.48s)]
*  I have to say, it was pretty good. [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=1843.12s)]
*  We're cutting that. We're not acknowledging any positive traits about Mar-a-Lago on this podcast. [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=1845.4399999999998s)]
*  I'm being honest. I'm just being honest. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=1851.36s)]
*  I appreciate your candor. That is the spirit of this podcast is radical candor, [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=1852.8s)]
*  even if it means complimenting the food at Mar-a-Lago. [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=1857.28s)]
*  I'm trying to divine the criminology of what's going on in Washington these days. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=1864.3999999999999s)]
*  It's something we're all working on. I got Susan Glasser on the podcast today. [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=1869.04s)]
*  If you're looking for other folks who have their finger on the pulse, [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=1873.44s)]
*  NPR Politics podcast is a place that I go to decode what's happening over on the hill and [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=1878.0s)]
*  what every decision out there might mean for me and you. [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=1883.2s)]

*  You don't always got time for that. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=1904.72s)]

*  Emails documenting how Joe Kent, it's just so absurd that Joe Kent [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=1987.68s)]
*  has such a prime role in intelligence gathering in our government. [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=1991.92s)]
*  I once wrote an article where I monitored him get interviewed [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=1995.76s)]
*  by like an 18 year old white nationalist [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=1999.3600000000001s)]
*  who was doing the interview from his dorm room [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2001.44s)]
*  and Joe Kent was like apologizing to him for saying something [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2003.28s)]
*  that was offensive to Nick Fuentes or whatever. [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2007.44s)]
*  This is, it was a deeply humiliating situation. [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2009.68s)]
*  I don't know if Joe Kent is a white nationalist, [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2013.28s)]
*  but he sure was happy to suck up to a teenage white nationalist [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2016.0800000000002s)]
*  help get elected. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2021.36s)]
*  He lost. [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2022.8799999999999s)]
*  Anyway, he's Tulsi's deputy now. [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2024.08s)]
*  This is the right-hand man. [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2026.3999999999999s)]
*  And I guess he sent an email to the experts of the DNI [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2027.9199999999998s)]
*  that said we need to do some rewriting of this memo [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2031.6799999999998s)]
*  regarding Venezuela's ties to Tundra or Agua. [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2034.8s)]
*  So this document is not used against the DNI or POTUS. [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2039.04s)]
*  As it turns out, there were a couple of honorable people [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2043.12s)]
*  in the intelligence community, Michael Collins, chair of the NIC [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2045.9199999999998s)]
*  and his deputy Maria Lang and Rakoff, who put out an accurate [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2050.24s)]
*  Intel assessment. [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2054.0s)]
*  They were then fired. [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2055.04s)]
*  Pretty alarming stuff. [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2056.9599999999996s)]
*  I don't know what you make of what's happened [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2057.9199999999996s)]
*  with Tulsi and the DNI. [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2059.3599999999997s)]
*  LESLIE KENDRICK Yeah, I mean, the National Intelligence Council [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2060.4799999999996s)]
*  is the main, you know, kind of analytic coordinating body [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2063.2799999999997s)]
*  for the US intelligence community [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2066.3199999999997s)]
*  and its assessments are very important [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2069.12s)]
*  and to be subjected to such a sort of almost embarrassingly [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2071.6s)]
*  transparent form of political manipulation, right? [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2078.4s)]
*  You know, there's a big scandal when they're like, you know, [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2081.12s)]
*  kind of implicit winks and nods and, you know, [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2084.2400000000002s)]
*  can't you just give me the raw intelligence kind of stuff [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2087.44s)]
*  in previous Republican administrations that we all remember. [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2090.1600000000003s)]
*  And yet here they are. [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2094.0s)]
*  These folks don't even bother to hide the corruption, right? [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2095.44s)]
*  And it is corruption. [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2098.96s)]
*  It is actually corrupt to say that we want our intelligence council [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2099.92s)]
*  and I'm going to put it in writing, by the way, [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2104.4s)]
*  that we want our intelligence council to tell us [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2108.08s)]
*  that the United States is under invasion [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2111.12s)]
*  by a Venezuelan gang operating at the behest of the Venezuelan state. [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2115.2s)]
*  No part of that sentence is accurate. [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2119.7599999999998s)]
*  And why do they want that? [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2122.08s)]
*  So that they can justify the deportation of thousands of people [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2123.28s)]
*  under the Alien Enemies Act, an obscure 18th century law [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2129.7599999999998s)]
*  that has never essentially been used for this purpose. [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2134.48s)]
*  Obviously, this is still winding its way through the courts, [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2138.4s)]
*  but the underlying premise here is a fiction. [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2141.6s)]
*  And that's what this controversy underscores, [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2145.36s)]
*  which is that it relies upon the kind of Stephen Miller theory of the case, [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2148.32s)]
*  which is don't believe your own lying eyes. [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2153.76s)]
*  America is under invasion by a bunch of gangsters from Venezuela. [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2155.92s)]
*  You know, spoiler alert, America is not being invaded here, people. [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2161.04s)]
*  Okay. [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2164.64s)]
*  So if your entire legal case rests on the idea that America is being invaded, [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2165.2000000000003s)]
*  then you are asking lots of people in the federal government to lie. [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2170.2400000000002s)]
*  And I think this example really resonated for me [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2175.84s)]
*  because it just shows, you know, kind of that fiction, [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2179.36s)]
*  but it also shows the lengths to which these folks are willing to go. [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2183.6800000000003s)]
*  And also that they're not very bright. [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2187.12s)]
*  Like, yeah, let's go ahead and put in writing that. [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2188.4s)]
*  Yeah, please. [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2190.7200000000003s)]
*  Would you rewrite this to say what I wanted to say? [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2191.6s)]
*  Because this is not helpful to me politically here. [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2194.0s)]
*  I mean, I'd like to dial in just really quick on the not very bright part [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2196.56s)]
*  because on the heels of the signal controversy, [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2200.0s)]
*  where the secretary of defense is putting his wife and his brother on signal, [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2202.48s)]
*  talking about war plans and accidentally putting on Jeffrey Goldberg on signal [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2206.56s)]
*  to discuss war plans, we have this, the key man at the DNI, [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2210.24s)]
*  putting in an email that he wants people to falsify intelligence records. [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2217.92s)]
*  Did this guy not watch The Wire? [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2222.64s)]
*  We're taking notes on a criminal conspiracy. [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2224.72s)]
*  Could he not have picked up the phone? [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2227.2799999999997s)]
*  You know, I mean, I don't want them. [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2229.68s)]
*  I'm happy that they created a trail of their corruption, [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2231.36s)]
*  but it's pretty concerning. [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2236.48s)]
*  You would think that the people at the top of the intelligence agencies [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2237.6s)]
*  would be a little bit more careful. [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2241.84s)]
*  But I mean, it feels like it's a clown show across the board here. [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2243.52s)]
*  I think if Donald Trump wanted somebody at the head of the intelligence agencies [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2248.16s)]
*  who would have been a little bit more careful, [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2251.84s)]
*  then he wouldn't have chosen Tulsi Cabard to be the director of national intelligence. [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2253.76s)]
*  Hard to argue with that. [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2257.92s)]
*  Other related stuff regarding the Alien Enemies Act. [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2260.0s)]
*  Kristi Noem was testifying in front of Congress yesterday. [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2264.2400000000002s)]
*  I'm sure you've seen it already, but we deserve to listen to it one more time. [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2268.6400000000003s)]
*  So, Secretary Noem, what is habeas corpus? [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2272.8s)]
*  Well, habeas corpus is a constitutional right that the president has [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2276.7200000000003s)]
*  to be able to remove people from this country and suspend their right to suspend their rights. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2280.96s)]
*  Let me stop you, ma'am. [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2284.8s)]
*  habeas corpus, excuse me, that's incorrect. [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2286.16s)]
*  President Blinken used it. [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2288.8s)]
*  Excuse me. [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2290.96s)]
*  habeas corpus is the legal principle that requires that the government [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2292.16s)]
*  provide a public reason for detaining and imprisoning people. [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2296.32s)]
*  I love Senator Maggie Hassan there. [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2301.28s)]
*  Excuse me, that's incorrect, actually. [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2302.8s)]
*  Well, I have to say she didn't laugh. [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2305.84s)]
*  I mean, that's not easy to do. [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2307.84s)]
*  That's where you got to like props to the politicians for, you know, [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2310.0s)]
*  putting their game face on. [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2313.12s)]
*  I mean, it's not something I could do. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2314.48s)]
*  You listen to that and you're like, what the hell are you talking about, woman? [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2317.2s)]
*  I was, you know, she's talking about she just doesn't know. [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2324.24s)]
*  I just think what that reveals is that she's been hearing all this discussion about habeas corpus, [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2327.52s)]
*  this word that she's heard. [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2333.2s)]
*  And she heard it in the context of Stephen Miller saying [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2334.96s)]
*  that like we can use this like thing in order to, you know, illegally kidnap more people. [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2338.3999999999996s)]
*  And so like she processed it in her brain as like, oh, that must be like kind of a Latin tool that [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2346.16s)]
*  we can use if we want to go around the law. [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2350.8799999999997s)]
*  That's the only plausible explanation for it. [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2354.08s)]
*  Or else, I don't know, maybe the botulism got kind of leaked in. [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2357.9199999999996s)]
*  That's also possible. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2362.08s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2363.12s)]
*  Any other theories? [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2363.7599999999998s)]
*  It's not we're not at the top of our game here between Joe Ken and Kristi Noem. [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2364.4s)]
*  The serious side of this, the non humorous side, there's the Cato analysis [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2370.4s)]
*  that came out of the Venezuelans. [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2375.36s)]
*  And we've learned that you might remember the CBS put out a list of like, I forget if it was 240 [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2377.92s)]
*  or 260 Venezuelans that we'd sent to Sokote in El Salvador. [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2384.8s)]
*  It turns out that that wasn't a comprehensive list. [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2390.2400000000002s)]
*  There's actually more people that we that have not been named yet. [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2392.32s)]
*  But Cato is going to the list and there's a big group of the people that it's like hard to find [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2396.56s)]
*  what their process was. [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2401.76s)]
*  It's hard to track them down. [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2403.04s)]
*  But they were able to identify some percentage of that 250 some odd Venezuelans. [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2405.6800000000003s)]
*  And they found that 50 of them came here legally, never violated any immigration law, [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2411.6000000000004s)]
*  never violated any law in America. [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2417.92s)]
*  That doesn't mean who knows, like maybe some subset of that 50 were gang members in Venezuela. [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2419.76s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2424.48s)]
*  But they came here legally either through the refugee process where there's vetting [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2424.96s)]
*  or through the CBP one app where they set up a meeting and came to a port of entry at the border [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2429.0400000000004s)]
*  and waited for their judicial review. [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2435.6800000000003s)]
*  So that's like 50 people that did not break any laws that we kidnapped and sent to El Salvador. [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2440.96s)]
*  I mean, it is truly it is a scandal that is like beyond kind of what even like the kind of the [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2447.76s)]
*  worst Bush administration excesses, even though there were some bad ones, of course. [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2455.1200000000003s)]
*  Yeah, I think it's hard for us to wrap our minds around what a gross violation of everything the [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2460.48s)]
*  United States in theory stands for. [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2467.5200000000004s)]
*  This would be and I've been thinking about this because it's not just we tend to focus here and [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2469.76s)]
*  I understand why, but we tend to focus on the lack of due process in the process by which these [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2474.0s)]
*  people end up on a plane and end up being sent to El Salvador. [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2480.48s)]
*  That's one aspect of it that's horrifying. [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2484.08s)]
*  But in a big picture sense, even more horrifying is that they have been sent there in an open ended [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2487.36s)]
*  way to rot in a prison in a foreign country that is not even in their own home with no process, [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2493.84s)]
*  no ability to ever get out as far as we're aware. [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2499.84s)]
*  And they're just what they're going to spend the rest of their life rotting away in prison in El [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2502.88s)]
*  Salvador with no terms like the worst criminals in the world, you know, have not only the right of [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2508.88s)]
*  due process, but the right to a fair and speedy trial to a sentence, whatever that sentence is, [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2516.56s)]
*  at least you would then know it that you've been cast judgment by a legitimate court. [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2523.52s)]
*  None of these things, none of these things have taken place. [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2529.28s)]
*  So those 50 people that you just mentioned in the Cato study, and there are very likely more, [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2532.8s)]
*  what's going to happen to them? [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2539.6000000000004s)]
*  They're going to just spend their entire life in prison in a sort of Orwellian example of being [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2540.6400000000003s)]
*  condemned for life for an offense that they are never told what it is with no process of no [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2546.56s)]
*  possibility of appeal in a foreign land that is not their own. [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2553.6000000000004s)]
*  It's really one of the worst things that I've heard the United States do. [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2557.8399999999997s)]
*  And so contrary to every aspect of our founding. [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2562.88s)]
*  No, it would literally be like a criminal, some, you know, a gang or whatever, [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2567.12s)]
*  speaking of gangs, like we're the gangs in this situation. [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2571.8399999999997s)]
*  It'd be like a gang kidnapping somebody out of a car and then throwing them into a hole, [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2574.16s)]
*  you know, at the bottom of their compound. [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2579.6s)]
*  And then the person has to sit there and rot and wait and hope that cooler heads will prevail. [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2582.16s)]
*  Or something like there's no, as you said, even the worst criminals, you know, they get, [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2587.6s)]
*  you know, they get a phone call, you get a visitation. [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2594.56s)]
*  Their mother knows where they are. [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2597.68s)]
*  That the thing that Cato analysis said was that, you know, I don't have in front of me, [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2598.7999999999997s)]
*  but some percentages of guys obviously have children. [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2603.04s)]
*  You know, it's like they can their children can see them can write them letters. [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2605.7599999999998s)]
*  You know, there's a David Noriega today did a story about a man on his name, right? [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2610.0s)]
*  Widmer Sanguino. [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2614.88s)]
*  I didn't really get to this segment for NBC News people. [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2617.76s)]
*  I'll put a link in the show notes if you want to watch it. [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2620.8s)]
*  And it's like this guy came again legally, like with his family. [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2623.28s)]
*  They had a CBP one app. [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2628.4s)]
*  They had a meeting. [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2630.08s)]
*  He was there with his mother and with a brother. [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2631.92s)]
*  And he is the only one that gets pulled aside because I guess of the tattoos. [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2635.44s)]
*  And then and then he's disappeared and David's interviewing this mother. [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2641.04s)]
*  And it's like. [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2644.32s)]
*  And it's crazy. [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2646.0s)]
*  It's crazy. [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2646.88s)]
*  It's like, you know, they they now are free like living in America, [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2647.6000000000004s)]
*  waiting, going through the process, you know, doing what people do. [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2652.0s)]
*  And it's like her son and this guy's brother is just gone. [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2655.28s)]
*  And it's sickening. [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2659.44s)]
*  Anyway, I don't know what more there is to say about that. [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2661.2000000000003s)]
*  We're also doing there's some new story. [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2663.44s)]
*  I guess we're sending people to Libya and South Sudan now as well. [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2664.8s)]
*  Immigrants. [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2669.84s)]
*  One other thing I wanted to get figure out. [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2671.28s)]
*  And I saw you did a post about an article, a tweet or whatever about that. [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2672.72s)]
*  About PEPFAR back to our friend Marco, who said that I guess he's trying to claim that [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2677.2s)]
*  it's been like 85 percent of PEPFAR has been maintained or whatever. [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2684.3199999999997s)]
*  You know, I know you guys, you've covered a lot of, you know, sort of stuff in this world. [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2689.52s)]
*  Elon is also trying to backtrack on this. [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2693.7599999999998s)]
*  He was at the Qatari Economic Forum trying to claim that it wasn't true that he that like [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2695.9199999999996s)]
*  they cut all the aid. [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2700.24s)]
*  Just wondering if you have any thoughts or reporting or heard anything about what's [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2701.6s)]
*  happening in the kind of foreign aid space? [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2705.7599999999998s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I think that it's one of the biggest own goals in world politics I've ever seen, [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2709.2s)]
*  which is Rubio going along with Elon Musk and others who came in at the beginning of [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2716.0s)]
*  this second Trump administration and basically destroyed in a very short amount of time America's [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2723.52s)]
*  soft power in the world, shutting down our efforts to broadcast truthful independent [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2729.52s)]
*  information to people in Asia, for example, shutting down refugee programs that benefit [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2735.52s)]
*  people, childhood nutrition programs around the world in Africa, as well as in Asia, basically [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2744.4s)]
*  saying we're not going to do anything positive. [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2754.24s)]
*  And so the only thing that's left for America as far as projection of itself and its image in the [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2757.2s)]
*  world are stories like the stories we were just talking about sending people off to rot in prison [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2762.64s)]
*  with no due process. [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2767.9199999999996s)]
*  Well, kleptocracy. [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2769.4399999999996s)]
*  Yeah, well, kleptocracy also taking a free plane from the government of Qatar for our [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2770.7999999999997s)]
*  president's personal use. [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2775.12s)]
*  But I just I think that when the story of this all is written, the shutting down unilaterally [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2778.0s)]
*  with no process of programs approved by Congress, authorized and funded by Congress, [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2783.92s)]
*  by Marco Rubio himself, who not only voted for these programs as a senator, [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2789.76s)]
*  but was a chief proponent of many of them. [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2796.0s)]
*  He was a board member of the International Republican Institute until the minute he was [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2799.52s)]
*  sworn in as the secretary of state. [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2805.12s)]
*  What have we done? [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2807.36s)]
*  We've shut down all of America's election monitoring missions around the world. [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2808.2400000000002s)]
*  And I can tell you those things matter to people who are fighting for freedom and democracy [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2813.12s)]
*  around the world. [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2818.88s)]
*  Those things really matter. [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2820.0s)]
*  And does the theory of the case now that Donald Trump has, and I don't think that most Americans [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2821.8399999999997s)]
*  really understand this, Donald Trump believes it doesn't matter that the United States can [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2828.0s)]
*  partner with the world's worst tyrants, strong men and killers, and that that's just fine. [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2832.08s)]
*  And maybe we're just like them in the end. [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2838.7999999999997s)]
*  And I think that that's a very, very dubious proposition for how this country can go forward [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2841.36s)]
*  in the world. [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2847.76s)]
*  But that's what's happened with all of this. [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2848.2400000000002s)]
*  And to have Rubio then under oath, I noticed that many of his former Democratic colleagues [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2850.7200000000003s)]
*  were very chagrined in this hearing yesterday. [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2856.7200000000003s)]
*  They voted 99 to zero to confirm Marco Rubio, the US Senate did, because many Democrats, [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2858.7200000000003s)]
*  as well as many establishment Republicans, felt that he was the best possible secretary [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2865.92s)]
*  they could get under these circumstances. [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2871.44s)]
*  And I call your attention to a really painful back and forth between Rubio and Chris Van [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2873.28s)]
*  Holland, a Democratic senator from Maryland, who told him to his face, well, I regret my [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2879.12s)]
*  vote for you. [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2884.64s)]
*  You're not who you said you were for all these years. [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2885.36s)]
*  And Rubio kind of quickly retorted back, well, if you regret it, then I guess that means [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2888.0s)]
*  I'm doing it's confirmation. [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2892.88s)]
*  I'm doing a good job. [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2894.16s)]
*  Oh, just because you mentioned it. [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2895.3599999999997s)]
*  There are all these minor corruptions that happen that happen outside of view, because [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2901.12s)]
*  we focus on the big ones. [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2906.3999999999996s)]
*  But IRI, the International Republican Institute, is one of those. [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2907.68s)]
*  This was a pure, the more Republican-oriented internationalist organization that was about [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2910.72s)]
*  spreading democracy abroad, election monitors. [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2917.2799999999997s)]
*  John McCain was a big proponent of it. [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2920.7999999999997s)]
*  And it's another one of those things. [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2924.08s)]
*  I know at least one person who has pushed out of there for their commentary criticizing [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2925.52s)]
*  Trump on all of this, because it's like any other one of these little institutions wants [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2932.48s)]
*  to stay in the good graces of Trump, even though he's anathema to what the whole point [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2937.04s)]
*  of the institution is. [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2940.7999999999997s)]
*  So all right, last thing. [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2941.92s)]
*  Any other Hill thoughts? [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2944.4s)]
*  You mentioned the confirmation hearing. [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2946.0s)]
*  I guess I haven't noted on the pod Jared Kushner's dad. [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2947.2s)]
*  So we're going with Nepo Grampy is the term for Charles Kushner. [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2951.92s)]
*  And he got confirmed for ambassador to France. [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2957.04s)]
*  Cory Booker voted for that, which I thought. [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2961.6s)]
*  I haven't heard a good answer on why that is. [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2963.6s)]
*  But that's happening. [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2968.4s)]
*  Obviously, over in the next level, I'm going to talk about what's happening with the [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2969.76s)]
*  reconciliation bill. [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2973.52s)]
*  But any other thoughts before I lose you on what's been happening over on the Hill? [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2974.56s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I think the bottom line is that Democrats haven't really gotten their act [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2978.88s)]
*  together. [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2985.2000000000003s)]
*  They have not yet figured out a way to use any of their remaining levers of power, which [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2985.6s)]
*  are minimal to affect any kind of constraint on Donald Trump. [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2991.76s)]
*  There's no not even a whimper, it seems to me, of a sign yet that Republicans, even those [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=2996.56s)]
*  who oppose somewhat Trump's doing, are willing to stand up for the institutional prerogatives [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=3002.7200000000003s)]
*  of Congress. [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=3007.6s)]
*  They're basically still, it seems to me, waiting for the courts to do what Congress [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=3008.08s)]
*  itself has refused to do, which is to say, wait, only we have the power under our Constitution [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=3013.12s)]
*  to determine how America's taxpayer dollars are spent. [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=3020.88s)]
*  And until Congress wakes up, we are a government that's out of control, in my view. [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=3025.68s)]
*  We're a government that's not functioning the way our Constitution envisioned it. [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=3033.36s)]
*  But I don't think anybody should be expecting Republicans on Capitol Hill to wake up anytime [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=3037.68s)]
*  soon. [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=3045.2s)]
*  I mean, either another uplifting episode of the Bullock Podcast with Susan Glasser. [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=3045.44s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=3050.08s)]

*  No, hey, it comes with the territory. [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGnd03SRG8Q&t=3059.6s)]
