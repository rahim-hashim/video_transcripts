Video Description: Despite our missteps in some of our more recent wars, we were fighting to bring freedom, democracy, and self-governance to others. Now, Trump's mercantilist agenda is showing us what it looks like to not have an American-led world order. And even after Russia's largest aerial assault on Ukraine since the war began, he still won't threaten Putinâ€”only Zelensky. Meanwhile, just looking at the math alone, the reconciliation bill is alarming. Bill Kristol joins Tim Miller for a Memorial Day pod.

# Is Trump Mad at Vlad? (w/ Bill Kristol) | The Bulwark Podcast
**The Bulwark Podcast:** [May 26, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM)
*  Hello and welcome to the Bollwork Podcast. I'm your host Tim Miller. It is a Memorial Day. We're [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=0.0s)]
*  working. We're gonna have an abbreviated show for you and it's Monday so that means I'm here [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=5.28s)]
*  with Bill Kristol. How you doing Bill? Fine Tim, how are you? Did you get to barbecue or anything? [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=9.6s)]
*  Any grandkids? A little bit there. Well, they're of course too busy to actually see us because [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=14.16s)]
*  they're in extremely complicated baseball and other sports, mostly baseball and softball tournaments, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=18.0s)]
*  which require multiple travel schedules and you know, it's very complicated. Are you in [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=24.080000000000002s)]
*  intense sports grandfather? Like are you shouting at the field? We are diligent and we enjoy it. I [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=29.84s)]
*  don't mean to make it sound like a duty. We go to McLean Little League a lot. We don't go to the [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=37.28s)]
*  two-hour travel games at Cal Griffin Field. And you're not shouting at the arms. We're against [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=43.28s)]
*  the parents shouting at the arms. We don't have, what's that thing that our daughters have? But I [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=49.44s)]
*  noticed some other grandparents have. Do you know about this? It's like, I'm not gonna call it pitch [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=54.56s)]
*  watcher, but it's game watcher. Anyway, you can, someone, some parent puts in the pitch by pitch [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=57.68s)]
*  and you can get it on your little device, well on your own computer, not advice, it's just on your [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=64.0s)]
*  phone. You know, so like if you're at work and you're missing the first two innings of the game, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=67.92s)]
*  you can get the pitch by pitch of how your kid and all the other kids are doing. It's fine for [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=72.4s)]
*  the parents. I can see why they're very interested, but I think for the grandparents, Susan, I think [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=76.88s)]
*  that's a bridge too far, you know. I think that's a sign of mental illness. Even if you're a parent. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=80.56s)]
*  I don't even watch that for Major League Baseball, right? [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=86.8s)]
*  I think it's okay to not know every, the pitch, the result of every swing, you know, every ball [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=90.47999999999999s)]
*  and strike. Anyway, well, we have some very unserious Memorial Day thoughts. I thought it's [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=98.08s)]
*  nice. I will do the honor as well here on the pod, Adam Kuyper and our folks at thebullwork.com, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=103.52s)]
*  you know, to bring a little bit of seriousness to Memorial Day. So it's not just talking about [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=110.64s)]
*  Donald Trump and his speech to the army cadets about trophy wives and Alphonse Capone, you know, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=114.24s)]
*  to talk about what the traditionally the point was of Memorial Day. We've got Oliver Wendell Holmes [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=122.0s)]
*  his 19th century anniversary speech, really about the Civil War veterans where he talked about why [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=128.24s)]
*  Memorial Day is kept up. And he said, it celebrates and solemnly reaffirms from year to year a [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=138.96s)]
*  national act of enthusiasm and faith that embodies in the most impressive form our belief that to act [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=144.88s)]
*  with enthusiasm and faith is the condition of acting greatly to fight out a war. You must believe [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=150.24s)]
*  something and want something with all your heart, with all your might. So you must do to carry [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=155.60000000000002s)]
*  anything else to an end worth reaching. I guess that is kind of the element that makes it challenging, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=162.24s)]
*  you know, to monitor the Donald Trump speeches, right about whether there actually is a greater [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=168.48s)]
*  thing that we are reaching for rather than just, you know, whatever America American muscle porn. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=174.64s)]
*  I don't know if you have any any deep thoughts about that on Memorial Day holiday. I don't have [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=180.56s)]
*  deep thoughts. I like the Oliver Wendell Holmes speech. There's more than great Memorial Day [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=184.79999999999998s)]
*  speeches and poetry, obviously, in fact, and I did, I guess, I think it's don't you think it's [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=188.72s)]
*  more difficult maybe today, because the most recent wars haven't been, you know, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=195.6s)]
*  success, ultimately been successful, not due to any failings on the part of our, [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=200.4s)]
*  our veterans, but due to whatever world circumstances or failures in political [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=207.6s)]
*  leadership, or just maybe they weren't the right words to fight. And that goes back, obviously, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=212.07999999999998s)]
*  to Vietnam. I remember the Vietnam Fats coming back. So yeah, that I think it's made it all given [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=215.92s)]
*  it all a little bit more of a, I don't know what to say, a melancholy feel that Oliver Wendell [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=221.2s)]
*  Holmes pretty soon after the Civil War, maybe before reconstruction really failed, you know, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=226.88s)]
*  was kind of more in the enthusiasm side of it, which is fair enough. I mean, that's obviously [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=232.07999999999998s)]
*  worthwhile, worthwhile sentiment to add a conversation with Michael Wood, our friend, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=238.48s)]
*  young friend from Dallas yesterday, and he reflects on Memorial Day, Will Selber has a good [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=244.0s)]
*  piece on the website, another Afghan vet. And I think that's tough seeing, you know, you fought [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=249.36s)]
*  there and you're you get friends, people under your command and your platoons who died and were [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=253.92000000000002s)]
*  wounded. And you had Afghan friends who now we've Iraq, at least for a while looks semi successful. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=259.36s)]
*  And even now, it's not Sonoma Hussein, right? But Afghanistan, it's not not good. And the way we got [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=265.6s)]
*  out was, of course, pretty bad. So anyway, it's I do feel like maybe it's always had this melancholy [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=272.16s)]
*  aspect. How could it not? You know, you're honoring those who died. But yeah, for sure. I [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=277.68s)]
*  do think, you know, it's probably not the moment to to rehash, you know, all of our complex feelings [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=283.84000000000003s)]
*  about the, you know, neocon American greatness agenda. But there's something to be said for the [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=291.28000000000003s)]
*  fact that like, in contrast with what Donald Trump offered in Saudi Arabia, you know, the idea that [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=296.96000000000004s)]
*  there is something worth fighting for that we're fighting for a goal that is greater than just, [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=304.40000000000003s)]
*  you know, what mercantilistic, like American financial interests. And so even if even in [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=309.20000000000005s)]
*  failure, right, like there's a there's a greater purpose. And I think this ends up getting lost [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=317.12s)]
*  both in Vietnam and Iraq at various points, but like, releases an attempt to create a greater [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=322.0s)]
*  purpose for the people that are serving. Right. And I do feel that on the on the heels of, you know, [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=327.84s)]
*  failed wars, and then now having somebody that's like the Memorial Day video today out from Trump [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=335.35999999999996s)]
*  and Hague South is just like, America, we don't care about climate change or democracy anymore. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=342.0s)]
*  We just care about war fighting. That probably works for some people, but maybe isn't isn't quite [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=349.44s)]
*  in the Memorial Day spirit. No, I totally again, just be clear. I mean, I would say I'm more [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=354.64s)]
*  convinced of the merits, you know, in principle of let's call it the neocon greatness to greatness, [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=359.76s)]
*  freedom, democracy, self government agenda than ever watching watching the Trumpist alternative. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=365.91999999999996s)]
*  It's one thing to have the alternative be just to be more cautious and a little less, you know, [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=371.84s)]
*  be more careful where we get involved. That's a reasonable debate, obviously. We had many of [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=376.15999999999997s)]
*  those debates over the decades. But with the Trump agenda really, for me is maybe more convinced [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=381.6s)]
*  of the correctness of let's call it the freedom agenda as a fundamental principle for this country. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=385.92s)]
*  And also the abandoning it abroad leads to correlates with abandoning it to large measure [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=391.6s)]
*  at home. Having said that, it also makes you maybe the experiences the last decades make one more [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=396.56s)]
*  aware or maybe what always should have been aware of the, you know, that's just the inevitably [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=402.8s)]
*  tragic and limited successes of any agenda, including the freedom agenda. I'm more than ever, [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=407.92s)]
*  honestly, if you have we thought a lot of things as you have, I think in our political lives, [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=414.08000000000004s)]
*  I gotta say that the foreign policy agenda is a matter of prudence and particular choices. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=417.68s)]
*  I've obviously done a fair amount of reflecting me thinking, but as a matter of its basic [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=421.92s)]
*  correctness for this country and for the world, I actually am more that's what I haven't changed [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=426.64000000000004s)]
*  from being a Scoop Jackson Democrats more than 50 years ago to a Reagan and McCain Republican to a [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=431.44s)]
*  pro to Zelensky Democrat, if I can use that term today. Yeah, I got to hatch this out. I texted Ben [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=437.68s)]
*  Rhodes and I was like, it's overdue for you on the Bullock podcast. We can hash this out with him, [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=444.88s)]
*  but in his recent book, I was like, you know, again, some disagreements with the prudence [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=449.20000000000005s)]
*  of what had happened in the recent wars, but the thematics of Ben's book, which is basically that [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=454.64000000000004s)]
*  if you don't like the American world order, be careful about what's coming behind it. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=460.08000000000004s)]
*  He said, it's not pretty. I was like, there's some, there's some Bill Kristolian elements in that. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=464.08000000000004s)]
*  So anyway, I guess we'll let Ben. I'll watch, I'll watch your discussion. I'll watch Ben's face [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=470.24s)]
*  when you tell him, when you put it that way to him, you know, we'll, we'll, we'll, we'll, [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=474.88s)]
*  we'll hatch that out together in the next couple of weeks. Okay. Trump, I didn't know why I couldn't [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=478.40000000000003s)]
*  watch it. I can't. He is at the West Point graduation. I saw some, some, some pictures. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=483.20000000000005s)]
*  He was in a MAGA hat. I saw a clip, as I mentioned earlier, where he was talking about trophy wives. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=488.08s)]
*  I saw that he went golfing right afterwards. I don't know if there's much more to say about that, [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=495.04s)]
*  but I want to just give you an opportunity to share any thoughts you had. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=500.72s)]
*  I mean, the MAGA hat, speaking to cadets on their graduation, it's so unbelievably inappropriate, [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=505.52s)]
*  something they couldn't do and shouldn't do, right? They're, they're, they're warred not to wear [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=512.4s)]
*  anything that's political. You could say, well, making America great, I guess, isn't political. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=516.08s)]
*  It's not like having a Trump 2024 hat, but it's, it is pretty political, obviously. So that was [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=519.6800000000001s)]
*  terrible. Biden in 2022, who's, you know, as we know, a little bit old and frail, stood and shook [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=526.64s)]
*  every cadet, if I'm not mistaken, every graduating cadet's hand. Now you don't have to do that. I [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=534.08s)]
*  don't think every president or vice president or the secretary of defense who's spoken has done [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=538.64s)]
*  that to be fair. So, but Trump just went off to play golf, as you say, after giving this totally [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=542.64s)]
*  inappropriate speech, which in which he litigates various grievances against previous previous [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=547.68s)]
*  administrations. The one line that I, the trophy wise, it's really insane, but he also says, [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=552.0s)]
*  you know, I brought the military back. No one wanted to join the military under Biden. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=557.36s)]
*  He's saying this literally to a thousand plus cadets who volunteered to go to West Point and [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=561.84s)]
*  serve when Joe Biden was president. Right. I mean, it's, it's so, I don't know, what's the word, [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=567.52s)]
*  even, you know, it's grotesque and narcissistic, narcissistic. I mean, to the degree, the staff [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=574.0s)]
*  wrote some of that. Maybe they didn't write those particular lines. They're as bad as he is. Can I [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=579.84s)]
*  make that point? Generally, this is another kind of conversation, but they are horrible. I mean, [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=584.4s)]
*  why is they are just sailing through life being Trump staffers colluding and cooperating and [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=588.48s)]
*  enabling the most grotesque policies and statements and degradation of the American life? [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=594.0s)]
*  And somehow they do not get called out on it enough. I feel like, you know, I've sort of thought [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=603.92s)]
*  about that a little, and I don't even have the heart to go research exactly who's doing what, [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=608.0s)]
*  you know, I don't even, do you know even who Trump's top speech writers or anything? I can't even, [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=611.36s)]
*  it's not like old administrations were one cared a little bit and, you know, thought maybe this [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=615.68s)]
*  one would be a little better than that one or something. I mean, they're, but they are all just [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=619.36s)]
*  going through doing, you know, I don't know, I feel like the enabling and colluding of so many [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=623.84s)]
*  thousands, tens of thousands of people, leaving aside everyone on the outside, all that stuff too, [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=630.64s)]
*  I find that kind of astonishing. I thought a little bit about, you know, the guy who shows up and [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=635.76s)]
*  gives Trump the executive orders to sign, they're really ridiculous. Trump sits there at the desk [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=639.6800000000001s)]
*  with that ridiculous thing and these signs, you know, whatever thing they give him. And I've [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=645.0400000000001s)]
*  often wondered, like, who is, I don't even know, who is that guy? And I'd like to a little, someone [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=650.24s)]
*  should do a time, maybe we'll get someone at the board to give us a little backstory on, is he proud [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=653.84s)]
*  to be giving Trump these, you know, orders that are, you know, destroying our biomedical research [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=657.84s)]
*  and shattering our social fabric? I don't know, maybe he is. He is proud. I did write, I'm blanking [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=664.1600000000001s)]
*  on his name right now, but I have read a little bit about him and he is proud. And it's a self-selected [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=669.0400000000001s)]
*  group this time. And so, yeah, no, there is no really social comeuppance anymore. And so it's [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=672.64s)]
*  enough to really make you wish you believed in hell. So that's something I'm going to work on [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=678.88s)]
*  over the next few weeks. I want to talk about the actual policies. Trump spoke on the tarmac [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=683.6s)]
*  about Putin and how something's really changed with that guy. And then put out this extensive [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=691.1999999999999s)]
*  I guess, before I read it, just for context for folks who have been checked out over the weekend, [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=699.2s)]
*  the most intense drone and missile strikes of the entire war targeting Ukraine happened over the [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=704.4s)]
*  weekend, targeting, you know, civilian targets, obviously, in addition to military targets in [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=713.28s)]
*  cities across Ukraine. So I just very, very ugly stuff. And this is the president's reaction to [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=719.44s)]
*  that. I've always had a very good relationship with Vladimir Putin of Russia, but something has [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=726.96s)]
*  happened to him. He has gone absolutely crazy, all caps. He is needlessly killing a lot of people. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=733.2800000000001s)]
*  And I'm not just talking about soldiers, missiles and drones are being shot into cities in Ukraine [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=739.44s)]
*  for no reason whatsoever. Likewise, President Zelensky is doing his country no favors by talking [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=744.1600000000001s)]
*  the way he does. Everything out of his mouth causes problems. I don't like it. And it better stop. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=750.72s)]
*  This is a war that would never have started. If I were president, this is Zelensky's Putin's and [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=756.8s)]
*  Biden's war, not Trump's. I'm only helping put out the big and ugly fires that have been started. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=762.32s)]
*  So I've got a lot of thoughts on that bleat. But you go you were very interesting. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=770.32s)]
*  A couple of tweets about it. So go ahead and begin. Well, there's several thoughts. So [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=776.5600000000001s)]
*  point one is that he can't help but attack Zelensky and Biden. He can't just simply say [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=781.1999999999999s)]
*  what Vladimir Putin is doing is wrong. And you notice when he says to Zelensky, [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=787.84s)]
*  there's just one time in here where it says and it better stop. He's not saying to Putin, [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=793.84s)]
*  and the bombing of people better stop. He never says that. He says the stuff coming out of [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=799.76s)]
*  Zelensky's mouth better stop. So the one time where he kind of butches himself up to feel tough [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=804.16s)]
*  enough to tell somebody to actually change their behavior. He's talking to Zelensky, not Putin. I [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=809.84s)]
*  think that's important to note. It's also important, I think, to note the contrast between, [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=813.44s)]
*  again, as I mentioned, kind of this, the West Point speech in the video and Hague South where [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=820.08s)]
*  they're talking about how our warfighters are tough, and we're not doing drag shows anymore. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=824.96s)]
*  And we're just like our military is just going to be strong again, versus again, this statement, [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=829.2s)]
*  which is pretty weak, frankly, which is essentially, you know, not threatening [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=835.84s)]
*  Vladimir Putin with any military response at all, just kind of doing a psychoanalysis of him. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=842.48s)]
*  But to me, the most interesting thing about it, and I think that this is genuine, like, he starts [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=850.8000000000001s)]
*  it by saying I always had a very good relationship with Vladimir Putin. And I think there is a [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=857.0400000000001s)]
*  psychoanalysis element of this, where I don't think that's a put on. I think Trump thinks he [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=863.12s)]
*  and Putin had a very good relationship, because I don't think Trump has any real friends. I don't [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=869.84s)]
*  think Trump has any complex relationships with people that, you know, are, you know, have good [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=875.44s)]
*  and bad inside them and where they've gone through struggles together and come out the other side. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=881.76s)]
*  Like, I don't think he has any real friendships. I think his judgment of a good relationship is [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=886.16s)]
*  if somebody's nice to me, we have a good relationship. If somebody's mean to me, [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=891.28s)]
*  we have a bad relationship. It's like a very childlike assessment of human nature. And so [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=895.1999999999999s)]
*  I think it's possible, as insane as it seems, I think it's possible that Trump really [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=903.1999999999999s)]
*  has been surprised by this. Like, thinks he and Putin were friends and thinks that something [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=907.92s)]
*  has changed in Putin and does not recognize that they never really had a relationship at all and [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=914.8s)]
*  that Putin's been using them the whole time. So that's my annotated reaction to his [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=919.76s)]
*  bleach. I don't know what you think. Oh, I think that's very intelligent and interesting. I mean, [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=926.4s)]
*  I also think he's, as you say, he's not doing anything. Putin can find some way to stroke [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=930.08s)]
*  Trump and Trump will be back on board. Basically, we'll forget this in a week. The hopes of a lot [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=934.88s)]
*  of decent people who hope their forces in that maybe Trump will come around, he'll realize that [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=941.4399999999999s)]
*  he can't afford to lose in Ukraine, it'll make him look bad. And there are people in the [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=946.64s)]
*  administration want to do better. I mean, that's looking increasingly like a very [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=950.48s)]
*  slim hope that that's going to Trump is going to pivot. But you know, I just come back to again, [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=956.08s)]
*  it's the enablers, right? I mean, there are half the Republican members of Congress voted for a [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=960.88s)]
*  to Ukraine a year ago, they could do so again, there's a lot that Ukraine needs to combat this [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=965.76s)]
*  particularly, the larger and larger waves of Russian attacks, and they've the Russians have [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=971.12s)]
*  improved their capabilities, a lot of help from North Korea and Iran. The Ukrainians have massively [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=978.96s)]
*  improved their capabilities. One of the really someone was telling me this the other day, who [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=985.6s)]
*  knows this stuff in a way I certainly don't. What Ukraine has done over the last three years is a [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=988.5600000000001s)]
*  matter of actual just military kind of learning and upgrading is sort of jaw dropping, you know, [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=993.36s)]
*  sort of comfortable maybe the US and World War Two would be a comparable example, but they can't do [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=1000.0s)]
*  it all themselves. We can help them. I mean, that's just the fact. And so when I'm sick of all the [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=1005.1999999999999s)]
*  rep, you know, I just a couple of people tweeted, it was very nice, Don Bacon, I think one, maybe [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=1009.36s)]
*  one or two Republicans, the Republican member from Nebraska, very upset by what Putin's doing very [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=1013.5999999999999s)]
*  bad. If only they were actually members of Congress who could, in Bacon's case, have refused to vote [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=1018.4s)]
*  for the reconciliation bill if it didn't have a for Ukraine, or if Trump didn't separately introduce [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=1023.68s)]
*  or if the leadership didn't introduce and guarantee a vote on aid for Ukraine, that vote would [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=1029.04s)]
*  pass. And sadly, Johnson just has to let it come to the floor. Thune has to let it come to the floor. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=1033.92s)]
*  Maybe Trump would veto it. Maybe he wouldn't, incidentally, because I'm not so sure he wouldn't [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=1038.8s)]
*  be overridden and maybe it just to sign off on it. So again, I need the passivity of elected [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=1042.48s)]
*  officials who have supposedly real responsibilities and supposedly real commitments and views on these [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=1048.96s)]
*  things. I just I don't know. I just, yeah, I want to call out one person in particular on this point, [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=1055.84s)]
*  Bill. And that's John Thune. John Thune has just gotten a really big pass, you know, maybe just [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=1061.4399999999998s)]
*  because he's like a generic Ken doll of a senator and people don't know him that well. He doesn't [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=1067.12s)]
*  have kind of the reputation that Mitch McConnell does. He doesn't pop off on social media. And so [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=1073.12s)]
*  I think that he gets to kind of hide in the background more than he deserves as the Senate [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=1077.9199999999998s)]
*  leader. And like I know John Thune, got to meet John Thune. I know people that work for John Thune. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=1084.56s)]
*  Like John Thune has traditional Republican strong military anti-Russia pro-NATO views. At least he [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=1090.72s)]
*  did his whole career. And he's been in there a long time. And John Thune was never never had like a [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=1100.56s)]
*  Rand Paul libertarian streak or, you know, one of the like a nationalist, isolationist streak in him. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=1108.8799999999999s)]
*  John Thune was indistinguishable as a politician through his stated words and actions from Mitch [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=1116.24s)]
*  McConnell or from pre-Trump administration Marco. But like that was John Thune. And like he has [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=1122.08s)]
*  paid lip service to being pro-Ukraine. He's always voted on the Ukraine side when things came to a [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=1131.36s)]
*  vote. He could do this. Like he could do it. Like they could, he could put up a bill, you know, [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=1136.88s)]
*  he could spearhead a bill through the Senate that provides more assistance and help to Ukraine right [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=1142.0800000000002s)]
*  now. And I agree with you. I think it would pass. And I think it'd pass with a veto-proof majority. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=1148.0800000000002s)]
*  And maybe depending on how the politics play out, whether Trump pressures people or strong arms [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=1152.8000000000002s)]
*  people, but I think it would. And the fact that he's not doing it is really shameful and weak. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=1157.44s)]
*  And I think it merits just being called out specifically. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=1167.5200000000002s)]
*  No, that's really, that's well said. I'm glad you developed that point because, you know, [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=1171.2s)]
*  Johnson gets beat up some, because he's not, you know, he's such a right-winger. And that's, [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=1175.8400000000001s)]
*  the media isn't personally sympathetic, I wouldn't say to Mike Johnson, but Thune's their friend. And [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=1180.96s)]
*  so he gets, but Thune has in no way been more responsible than Johnson. And indeed, the one [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=1185.2s)]
*  before the reconciliation bill, the one actual series of votes that were cast in either house [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=1190.96s)]
*  that mattered were the confirmation votes where Thune led the Senate Republicans in confirming [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=1195.92s)]
*  Hegseth, Patel, Gabbard, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. And I just, that thing, we fought those. I mean, [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=1200.88s)]
*  we fought, we opinioned, we editorialized against the confirmations. We reported on it. It was kind [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=1206.48s)]
*  of a big issue for us in November, December, January, which I'm glad we did our best. I wish [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=1212.0s)]
*  we had more effect, but that we've sort of memory hold a little bit. I mean, that was a huge moment, [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=1216.4s)]
*  I think, in retrospect. It really signaled that for the foreseeable future, there would be no [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=1221.68s)]
*  opposition to the most easily opposable thing, the most obviously unqualified, the kind of craziest [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=1226.0800000000002s)]
*  nominations. And they didn't oppose them, one or two or three Republicans opposed all those nominees. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=1232.4s)]
*  And now they're, A, they're in office and doing a lot of damage, if I could just say, whether it's [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=1239.8400000000001s)]
*  Hegseth or Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Tulsi Gabbard firing intelligence analysts who try to tell the [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=1244.24s)]
*  truth. And it really was a marker of just, I guess, even afterwards, some of I thought a little, [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=1249.76s)]
*  well, maybe that's Trump's personal nominations. They didn't want to oppose Trump on something [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=1255.36s)]
*  he cared about, but on policy, it'll be a little different. But no, the capitulation was [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=1259.76s)]
*  thorough at the beginning. It has been thorough ever since. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=1266.4s)]
*  Yeah. And just a simple way to put it is John Thune carried water for Tulsi Gabbard and has [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=1270.32s)]
*  abandoned Zelensky in Ukraine. Like that's what he's done. No matter what he says or what he [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=1274.96s)]
*  thinks his position is on private or whether he, you know, maybe in private, you know, he's made a [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=1278.88s)]
*  phone call or two. You know, but from a public standpoint, through five months of being leader, [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=1283.2s)]
*  that's what his record is. Just one specific example of this, I sent you this article Michael [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=1288.96s)]
*  Weiss flagged for me about these specific missiles, the response missiles that Ukraine needs to stop [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=1292.64s)]
*  the ballistic missiles that are coming in from Russia. And as you've mentioned, Russia's stockpiled [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=1299.0400000000002s)]
*  a bunch of these and they were the ones causing a lot of damage this weekend. And Zelensky is [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=1304.0s)]
*  saying that Ukraine will pay whatever it takes. Presumably Europe is helping with that. It's [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=1311.12s)]
*  Alaki, I guess, that makes these. And the White House like remains just non-committal on this. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=1319.12s)]
*  So again, like there are specific things that we can do that are defensive to protect Ukrainian [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=1328.0s)]
*  civilians. And Ukraine said they will pay for them. That's not even aid. And yet we're still not doing it. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=1334.56s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=1344.56s)]
*  It's shameful. I don't know much more to say on that. Okay. One more thing in Congress and then we'll [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=1347.76s)]
*  let everybody get back to their holiday after this uplifting listen. The big beautiful bill, [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=1353.92s)]
*  I want to play, I was listening over the weekend, a listener flagged for me the All In podcast. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=1358.8s)]
*  For folks who aren't familiar, it's these like four tech bros who to varying degrees have kind [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=1365.92s)]
*  of thrown in with Trump. David Balzac's most famously is actually working for Trump. This is [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=1371.3600000000001s)]
*  AI and cryptos are Chamath, Hibatia has been, I think, the most, he was an Obama supporting [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=1376.32s)]
*  tech guy who's gone full in with Trump to do the fundraiser for him. There are a couple other guys [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=1384.0s)]
*  also. And I thought that it was interesting because they've been also water carrying on this show, [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=1389.84s)]
*  for the most part, I should, Jason, who I had on this pod before the election at times has been [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=1396.96s)]
*  critical of Trump, but Chamath in particular, and Sachs have just been carrying water for all of [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=1404.16s)]
*  the most noxious things that Trump is doing, particularly immigration. And so I thought it [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=1408.3200000000002s)]
*  was noteworthy that like now that we're kind of closer to these guys wheelhouse, when it comes to [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=1412.3200000000002s)]
*  finances, what they're saying about the bill. And so I want to listen to Chamath here real quick. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=1417.68s)]
*  You're going to see energy prices spike. You're gutting the number of electrons that will be [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=1424.0800000000002s)]
*  available for things like AI, you're going to increase Medicare prices. And the math is wrong. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=1429.04s)]
*  So when you sensitize this thing to a four and a half or five or five and a quarter rate, [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=1435.68s)]
*  so meaning not what the CBO used, but the real conditions on the ground, [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=1443.6s)]
*  this thing is an albatross. And I think unfortunately, for President Trump's agenda, [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=1448.96s)]
*  and for a MAGA movement, this is the worst of all conditions, the financial markets will punish us. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=1454.48s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I think they're just kind of taking out the sort of ideological and like the political [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=1462.72s)]
*  side of this, like the folks that are just looking at it as straight math, have pretty alarming things [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=1467.92s)]
*  to say about the bill that's going through Congress right now. Yeah, I don't know these guys as well [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=1474.56s)]
*  as you do. But maybe they could have weighed in a little bit, like what it was in play and gotten [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=1479.84s)]
*  a few things changed isn't like one of those in the White House. But I guess, you know, you just [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=1485.36s)]
*  complain about the one that's in the White House was actually spinning for it, I should say on this [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=1489.4399999999998s)]
*  pod, but all the other three were on the others. Maybe the others did make some calls. And of course, [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=1492.8799999999999s)]
*  you can't really get any Republican to desert Trump or to insist on even some changes in it, [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=1497.1999999999998s)]
*  though. I mean, there were particular aspects of it that are more damaging than others. Now, [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=1501.76s)]
*  it's all terrible. And the immigration policy, these guys should, I think, understand why it's [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=1506.16s)]
*  important to have lots of immigrants in this country. But just from that point of view, [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=1512.16s)]
*  probably especially high skilled immigrants who will help us maintain our edge if we still have [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=1516.5600000000002s)]
*  it. I hope we do in who maybe went to Harvard for innovation, high tech, right, or any other place [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=1523.28s)]
*  where they're busy. Harvard just is obviously the tip of the spear there. So I don't know, [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=1527.92s)]
*  are they weighing in in a big way? I guess I haven't really heard that. But I welcome them, [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=1532.56s)]
*  to the degree that they're tiptoeing away from total slavishness to MAGA. Of course, they still [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=1537.44s)]
*  have to put it as if what's really bad about this, it's hurting the MAGA agenda. It's hurting the [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=1542.56s)]
*  country. Okay, enough of my, we should, I know I'm too, we need to welcome all of our new allies, [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=1548.48s)]
*  etc, etc. I'm not welcoming Chamath. I'm just saying that it is interesting that somebody, [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=1554.8s)]
*  I think it actually makes this point stronger. The fact that people that understand that you have [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=1560.16s)]
*  to assume if you speak to them privately after their microdosing ketamine or whatever it is that [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=1566.64s)]
*  people do in Silicon Valley these days, when they're being candid, you have to assume that [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=1571.04s)]
*  they are not thrilled with at least the high skilled immigrant that that side, the useful to [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=1574.5600000000002s)]
*  them side of the immigration policy and the fact that people are being scared away from this country. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=1580.72s)]
*  And you might assume, maybe not, I don't know that some of them would have issues with the research [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=1584.64s)]
*  being gutted since that is supporting a lot of the high tech and work that these guys are [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=1589.44s)]
*  investing in, particularly in biomedical space and elsewhere. So, but like the fact that none of that [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=1597.68s)]
*  rose to the level where they're like, we have to raise, we have to kind of wave a flag of caution [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=1603.2s)]
*  and that this did, I think just speaks to how bad it is on the merits. And because it is like, [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=1609.92s)]
*  it is a pretty traditional Republican framework. I do think maybe like the intensity of the [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=1615.84s)]
*  criticism is a little different than on the stuff that is uniquely Trump, like banning foreign [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=1621.28s)]
*  students from Harvard or something, the El Salvador, right? But like, since this is like [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=1626.6399999999999s)]
*  tax cuts and spending cuts, right? It's like traditional Republican stuff, but it's tax cuts [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=1631.92s)]
*  and spending cuts just on steroids. And it is at a time when it's that it's particularly ill-suited [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=1636.96s)]
*  for, given what's happening in the broader economy. And just really quick, here's Jessica Riddle [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=1643.76s)]
*  summing it up. This bill costs more than the Trump tax cuts, the Biden cares act and the Biden [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=1649.28s)]
*  American rescue plan combined. There's going to spend a 52 billion to bail out farmers, [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=1658.64s)]
*  that's tucked in here. And most importantly, in this relationship, Senator Chamath said, [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=1665.76s)]
*  it's already raising interest rates. We have interest rates that are high for recent times. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=1670.16s)]
*  Every time I bring that up, some of our boomer listeners are like, interest rates are nothing [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=1675.52s)]
*  compared to 1978. But it's high for recent times, the interest rates already are. And you saw it in [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=1679.92s)]
*  the bond market last week, Chamath goes on and talks about this at greater length in that podcast. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=1686.8000000000002s)]
*  And you're seeing it now that it's so irresponsible fiscally, that it's going to [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=1693.0400000000002s)]
*  that it is going to keep pushing interest rates higher, which has impact on everybody. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=1698.56s)]
*  So anyway, I just think that's why that's the interesting part of why it's worth flagging [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=1704.1599999999999s)]
*  the criticism here. No, I agree with that. Actually, I myself have been a little too, [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=1711.04s)]
*  this is just another stupid Republican bill that cuts taxes predictably and doesn't cut spending. [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=1715.12s)]
*  The only cost is for poor people, the food aid and especially Medicaid, obviously. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=1721.6799999999998s)]
*  But I think it's a good point that it's one thing to pass this in 2017, when after the great [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=1727.36s)]
*  recession, and after we fixed, I think, a lot of the financial sides of things, [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=1733.76s)]
*  we'd had a slow growth for six years, we had low interest rates, you could afford to pass a [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=1738.08s)]
*  maybe somewhat foolish bill, but the country sort of the economy chugged along. If you looked at [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=1743.28s)]
*  some big chart from 2013 to 2020, you would barely notice as a macro economic thing, I bet that tax [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=1748.08s)]
*  bill kind of just the same. Doing it when you're in a much more precarious position, [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=1754.24s)]
*  well, he inherited a good economy, mind you, but with interest rates, especially being high, [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=1761.28s)]
*  inflation not quite under control, and the pandemic leading to a lot of more deficit spending. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=1765.44s)]
*  Yeah, I think it's probably riskier. I think the interest rate focus is right. I mean, just [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=1773.76s)]
*  borrowing at 5%, the federal government borrowing trillions of dollars or billions of dollars, [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=1777.44s)]
*  at least hundreds of millions at 5%, as opposed to a 2% or something really changes the math. [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=1782.72s)]
*  It changes significantly. So, okay, we'll keep monitoring this. I was thinking of the Senate. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=1790.16s)]
*  We'll see. I don't have a lot of hope for my man, John Thune, to really find his old fiscal hawkish [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=1794.96s)]
*  muscles. Text him, email him today and say, look, we were pretty tough on you today. And if you [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=1802.96s)]
*  want to come on, have a respectful half hour discussion, that'll be a test of you, but [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=1807.68s)]
*  we should do that. I will email John Thune. I'm not counting my chickens on that one, [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=1813.6000000000001s)]
*  but we will. We'll send John Thune an email, see if he wants to come on the pod and hash it out. [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=1818.0800000000002s)]
*  Maybe I'm missing something. Maybe there is some really smart, considered policy happening behind [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=1821.92s)]
*  the scenes when it comes to our fiscal situation and the war in Ukraine. I'm not optimistic about [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=1828.96s)]
*  that, but hope springs eternal. Bill Crystal, thank you so much. Have a great Memorial Day. [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iat2nKnykeM&t=1833.36s)]
