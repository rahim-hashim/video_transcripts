Video Description: Trump was so awestruck by Israel's intel infiltration and air supremacy over Iran, that he just had to give himself an executive producer credit. And he's casting his appointees to help create a Hollywood ending—including using his Val Kilmer-esque SecDef to spike the success of the long-teased, "secret" military operation. At the same time, Trump is having trouble leveraging the intelligence community's confirmation of what happened in Iran since he's spent a decade undermining its credibility among his supporters. Plus, NATO gets a little cringe toward Daddy Trump, and Ukraine doesn't get the same credit as Israel. Michael Weiss joins Tim Miller.

# “Daddy” Demands Praise for Iran Strike, NATO Obliges (w/ Michael Weiss)
**The Bulwark Podcast:** [June 26, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU)
*  Daddy. Yeah. Actually, you know, dude, you're from the Netherlands. There are places in [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=0.0s)]
*  the red light district of Amsterdam where you can work through some shit, where you [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=4.88s)]
*  don't have to be referring to the president of the United States as daddy. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=8.0s)]
*  Hello and welcome to the Bulldog podcast. I'm your host Tim Miller. We are welcoming [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=18.240000000000002s)]
*  back one of our faves. He's the editor of the insider, which just won an Emmy on Wednesday [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=22.04s)]
*  Along with 60 minutes, which still existed last year and their spiegel for their joint [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=26.72s)]
*  investigation into Havana syndrome, which is associated with brain injuries and such. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=31.92s)]
*  We're going to talk about that in a second. It's Michael Weiss. What's up, man? Congrats. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=36.96s)]
*  Do you get the hardware? Were you enough involved to have actual hardware? [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=40.44s)]
*  I was talking to the spiegel guys today and I said, you know, we don't get to keep the [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=45.040000000000006s)]
*  statue, but at least we get the data point on our Wikipedia pages, which in this day [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=48.84s)]
*  and age, you know, I'll take it, right? You should get a fake statue. I think I would [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=53.959999999999994s)]
*  get an imitation gold wrapped in chocolate or chocolate wrapped in gold. Yeah, that's [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=57.64s)]
*  the statue I'll get. Yeah, it's cool. No, we didn't. I had no idea we were even nominated [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=62.92s)]
*  until very late last week and then thought, whatever. And Michael Ray, the producer of [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=67.96s)]
*  that segment, messaged us last night and it was just a photo of him holding the Emmy. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=75.44s)]
*  So I'm like, oh, okay. It's a nice way to come home from Barcelona. The birds are awake. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=80.52s)]
*  They're congratulating you. Oh, you can hear them now? Yeah, the birds are awake. I thought [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=85.72s)]
*  we had them covered. The listeners love your little menagerie in the background. It brings [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=90.0s)]
*  a little joy in the darkness. I've got to do one thing though. Can we just do, we have [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=96.0s)]
*  so much news to cover, but since you got the Emmy for Havana syndrome coverage, I'm like, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=100.47999999999999s)]
*  I'm a little bit of a tin pot conspiracy theorist on Havana syndrome. So can you give me the [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=105.84s)]
*  one paragraph on it? Or are you, where are you at on it? Well, I'll give you some news [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=110.8s)]
*  actually, which hasn't been reported yet, which is even better than the one line anti-conspiracy [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=117.2s)]
*  theory, pricey. As the Biden administration was turning off the lights in the White House, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=123.68s)]
*  they had a meeting at the NSC at which Mahabharata, I think the number three guy under Sullivan [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=131.8s)]
*  was there with some other members of the National Security Council, invited five very well known [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=139.12s)]
*  within the community, the intelligence community victims of AHAI, including Mark Palmaropoulos, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=146.68s)]
*  who's a friend of mine. Love Mark. Yep. A guy called, who's in the media as Adam or known [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=151.60000000000002s)]
*  he was one of the first victims hit in Havana, Cuba. And the NSC meeting, they were brought [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=157.96s)]
*  into the situation room and told you were right, quote unquote. Really? Yes. And I can [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=163.92000000000002s)]
*  tell you not only that you were right, meaning you were hit by a directed energy device. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=171.24s)]
*  This is not some sociogenic or psychosomatic phenomenon. There is evidence that has now [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=177.70000000000002s)]
*  through to the IC, including new collection, which substantiates the fact that a possibly [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=186.92000000000002s)]
*  a foreign state actor, no points for guessing which one is responsible for doing this to [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=193.96s)]
*  American servicemen and women abroad. And more to the point, some of the members of [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=199.18s)]
*  the National Security Council at that meeting drafted an op-ed for the Washington Post, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=205.32000000000002s)]
*  which was cleared and ready to go. The title of it was, we believe them, them referring [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=210.24s)]
*  to the victims. And at the last minute, Jake Sullivan spiked that op-ed from being published. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=216.52s)]
*  Why? You'd have to ask him. I think Jake wants to go on the pod. So I'd be agree. But there's, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=221.52s)]
*  yeah, there's more to come on this, including things that are kind of kicking around in [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=227.08s)]
*  insider editorial chats, new evidence that we've compiled. I mean, our investigation [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=232.88s)]
*  well over a year and we basically attributed or implicated, I should say, I'm going to [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=238.07999999999998s)]
*  be very conservative in my judgments here, my intelligence assessments. And because I [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=244.16s)]
*  know we're going to be talking about that in a minute. GRU unit 29155, which is sort [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=248.35999999999999s)]
*  of the Russians assassination and sabotage squad. They were responsible for poisoning [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=254.07999999999998s)]
*  Sergey and Yulia Skripal, blowing up ammunition and weapons depots across Europe as far back [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=260.6s)]
*  as 2011 in Bulgaria and then the Czech Republic a few years later. And we just exposed them [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=265.92s)]
*  as having had a hacker department that nobody knew about, which was pioneering the kind [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=271.52000000000004s)]
*  of hybrid warfare schemes that are now just everywhere and doing it in Ukraine. So not [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=276.8s)]
*  only hacking into Ukrainian critical infrastructure networks, but recruiting fifth columnists [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=283.6s)]
*  on Telegram paying them money to fire bomb the home of Ukrainian minister or dog graffiti [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=289.76s)]
*  on the walls of Kiev, basically suggesting that the government is collapsing and the [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=296.68s)]
*  only salvation is Russia. They were doing this before the full scale invasion. So 29155, [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=301.76s)]
*  their remit is explicitly kinetic. They're not doing pure espionage. So if they come [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=307.36s)]
*  to town, they might be there to do reconnaissance and they might be there to kind of get a lay [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=313.2s)]
*  of the land. But that means something is going to go bump in the night. Right. So that [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=318.08s)]
*  itself was very indicative to us that if they're in the places where these victims were hit [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=322.0s)]
*  and we managed to find two victims who could positively identify known members of unit [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=327.28s)]
*  29155 in the vicinity where they were, one was Frankfurt, Germany in 2014, the other [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=331.56s)]
*  was Spleecy, Georgia just a couple of years ago, that indicates that there's some there [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=336.64s)]
*  So put a pin in this because I assess with medium confidence that there's going to be [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=343.88s)]
*  more coming to light both at the governmental level, but also in the media level in the [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=349.28s)]
*  near future. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=354.8s)]
*  All right. We'll keep an eye on this. I'm disappointed. I'm in the market for a conspiracy [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=355.8s)]
*  theory I can really, you know, kind of just dig into because conspiracy theories serve [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=360.1s)]
*  you well in the podcast space. You know, I mean, Joe Rogan is crushing, you know, there's [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=365.28s)]
*  a lot of people who do very well there. And unfortunately, I'm kind of a conventional [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=369.8s)]
*  wisdom type guy, you know, I think which is limiting my ceiling a little bit. So I'm in [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=376.48s)]
*  the market for conspiracy theories, but I'm happy that reporting and for Mark. It was [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=380.59999999999997s)]
*  that so much that just we've there was a I feel like an extended group. There was the [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=385.64s)]
*  core five people was like, something was wrong here. And then there was other people who [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=390.28s)]
*  are like, I think I have it too. And that I think is what led to me to the tin pot. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=394.24s)]
*  Believe me, you know, coming at this blindly, if all I had to go on were the messages I [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=398.71999999999997s)]
*  received in my proton mail, since I published that investigation, I would definitely be [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=402.12s)]
*  more inclined to suggest that this is tin foil hat material. You know, Mossad is zapping [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=406.64s)]
*  me with death rays in the streets of Chicago, this kind of thing. But I just want to emphasize [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=411.52s)]
*  not everybody who thinks they've got a AHA, which is what stands for anomalous health [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=416.09999999999997s)]
*  incidents has got it. The subset we're looking at, it's very small, half a dozen victims. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=420.32s)]
*  We have examined their medical records, they were all diagnosed with traumatic brain [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=427.32s)]
*  injuries. We have done extensive interviews with them, including with Mark know their [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=430.59999999999997s)]
*  backgrounds, know where they worked, know what they were doing, even if they were under [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=434.52s)]
*  diplomatic cover, nudge nudge. And these are not people that just simply concocted a [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=438.15999999999997s)]
*  fairy tale, you know, in order to for what to maybe eventually down the line, get the [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=443.71999999999997s)]
*  US government to pay them $100,000 when, you know, if they're high ranking CIA officers [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=449.32s)]
*  abroad, when they retire, they stand to make orders of magnitude more than that going [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=454.24s)]
*  into the private sector. And many of these people were so badly hurt that they became [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=458.40000000000003s)]
*  medically retired. They cannot function day to day in office jobs. Some of them wear weighted [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=462.2s)]
*  vests because they have vertigo. Some of them, including Adam patient zero is legally blind [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=467.92s)]
*  in one eye. Some of them have service animals to get around. I mean, it's not a joke. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=473.42s)]
*  I gotta get Mark on the pod now. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=477.72s)]
*  You should get Mark on the pod. Yeah, I mean, he's, he's been doing yeoman's work kind of [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=479.96000000000004s)]
*  advocating on this issue for a long time. And you know, as I said, don't take my word [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=484.76s)]
*  for it. Biden's NSC. You were right. And he tweeted that actually, Mark, last night, alluding [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=489.12s)]
*  to this meeting that was had which nobody was meant to report on. But there you go. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=495.44s)]
*  All right, breaking news on the pod. All right. Speaking of Intel, as you as you referenced [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=499.64s)]
*  earlier, I think that's the main thing to talk about today. Following the attack on [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=503.88s)]
*  the Iranian nuclear program last week, Trump comes out immediately the day after and says [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=509.88s)]
*  it's been obliterated. It's done. Hague South echoes him. Kane is more or more judicious. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=514.68s)]
*  Now as the days pass, we have dueling reports out there. DAA has a report. So before we [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=521.08s)]
*  get into kind of the meta of all of it, as somebody who, you know, has to test to work [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=526.72s)]
*  through all this stuff as part of your day job, like what do you assess to be what we [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=531.6s)]
*  think is the truth of the situation at this point? And the truth might be that we just [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=536.72s)]
*  don't know. I don't know. Like what do you assess is the truth? [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=540.6s)]
*  I mean, look, I think it's likely that they inflicted severe damage on the physical [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=543.64s)]
*  facilities of Iran's nuclear program. If you watched the chairman of Joint Chiefs Kane [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=549.08s)]
*  today, his press conference, which followed Hague that's sort of, you know, [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=555.64s)]
*  We got a highlight reel from Pete's coming up here in a second. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=560.0799999999999s)]
*  Yeah. So I mean, it's just like it's like Animal House has taken over the Pentagon. It's [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=562.4799999999999s)]
*  great. No, Kane actually went through a very meticulous point by point with video PowerPoint [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=567.28s)]
*  explaining how these massive ordnance penetrators work and why it would not necessarily reflect [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=575.56s)]
*  the extent of the damage underground looking at satellite footage alone. Right. There is [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=582.4799999999999s)]
*  very all likelihood that all the centrifuges at Forto were completely wiped out. I mean, [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=588.64s)]
*  these things spin so fast. They are in such a sensitive environment that even taking out [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=593.24s)]
*  the power generators, this is David Albright's hypothesis, you know, American physicist who [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=598.5600000000001s)]
*  studies this stuff more closely than almost anybody, even taking out the power generators [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=604.2s)]
*  and literally forcing the centrifuges to stop spinning at such a high speed. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=608.5600000000001s)]
*  Eventually, what happens is they hit these resonances and then they crash against the wall [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=612.5600000000001s)]
*  and are destroyed. Right. So it's very likely, I would say, fordo has been damaged to the [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=617.52s)]
*  point almost of disrepair. It's not operational. However, the things that we don't know and [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=623.16s)]
*  the things that are going to take time to kind of piece together are, you know, where is [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=628.4399999999999s)]
*  the highly enriched uranium that even JD Vance alluded to possibly having gone missing. One [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=632.72s)]
*  thesis is that it is actually buried under the rubble in Fordo or in, you know, other [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=638.1999999999999s)]
*  nuclear facilities that were similarly bombed not just by the Americans, but also by the [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=644.72s)]
*  Israelis in a before that 10 day long campaign. And, you know, a lot of this is going to [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=649.36s)]
*  depend on signals intelligence. So what the US and its allies, including the Israelis, are [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=655.24s)]
*  collecting from the Iranian side, keep in mind, the Iranians are doing their own battle [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=661.6s)]
*  damage assessment. They don't necessarily know how badly their their program has been [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=664.84s)]
*  degraded or destroyed. So this is all happening in real time. And you have Donald Trump now [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=669.88s)]
*  in a, you know, sort of desperate mode to get the intelligence community to ratify his [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=676.12s)]
*  sort of fly, you know, shoot from the hip, shall we say, comments about, you know, fordo [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=683.92s)]
*  being completely quote obliterated. He's coming out and actually disclosing classified [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=692.12s)]
*  intelligence, again, compromising the Israelis the way he did in his first term in that famous [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=697.32s)]
*  meeting with Lavrov in the Oval Office about, you know, an imminent ISIS plot, which was [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=703.08s)]
*  uncovered by the Israelis and passed the Americans, which Trump then told the Russians [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=708.44s)]
*  about. He said that the Israelis have assets in place on the ground in Iran. Now, that's not [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=711.6800000000001s)]
*  such a surprise or mystery. How is it that, for instance, I've been able to figure that out [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=716.2s)]
*  from New Orleans? Yeah, you know, I mean, the Israelis kind of came out and said we had a [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=721.12s)]
*  three story or the Iranians, I think came out rather and said there's a three story drone [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=726.16s)]
*  warehouse in southern Tehran operated by Mossad. But how the hell did that get built without [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=731.28s)]
*  people in place? Right. So you've got now Barnea, the chief of Mossad saying that there were [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=735.92s)]
*  quote hundreds of Mossad operatives on the ground who will remain in Iran for the foreseeable [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=741.0799999999999s)]
*  future, which is also kind of a bold statement designed to psychologically vitiate the Iranians, [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=746.0s)]
*  make them go crazy with counterintelligence and paranoia, which they're already doing. They're [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=751.52s)]
*  arresting hundreds of Iranians. They accuse of espionage. I'm sure some of those people, most [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=755.28s)]
*  of those people, in fact, are probably innocent. But the point is, there was such a high level of [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=759.4s)]
*  infiltration by the Israeli side that there will be not in the next hour or even days, but weeks [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=764.28s)]
*  and months to come, a much better assessment of the state of this program. But the fact remains, [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=770.4s)]
*  these massive ordinance penetrators were built for a single purpose, which was to take out [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=775.76s)]
*  Fordeaux in the event that the United States had a military option that it was going to prosecute [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=781.52s)]
*  in Iran. So I'm a little bit skeptical of people who are saying, well, Trump is saying X, therefore, [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=785.68s)]
*  Y must be true. No, we find ourselves in a situation. And I tweeted about this. This is a guy [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=792.0s)]
*  who has spent a decade plus trying to convince the American electorate that the US intelligence [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=797.28s)]
*  community is fatally compromised, deceitful, ideologically motivated, and nothing that comes [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=804.56s)]
*  out of their mouth can be trusted. He would rather take the word of Vladimir Putin about what [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=811.28s)]
*  the Russian special services are doing than listen to his own CIA, NSA, and ODNI. Now, all of a sudden, [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=816.64s)]
*  he finds himself in a situation where he needs this intelligence community to come out and confirm [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=823.4399999999999s)]
*  what is probably true, that the US military inflicted a great deal of damage on Iran's nuclear [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=829.8399999999999s)]
*  program. But lo and behold, his electorate, or at least the MAGA constituency, thinks everything out [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=834.9599999999999s)]
*  of the IC is bullshit. And here you have Tulsi Gabbard, who was famously anti-intervention, [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=840.4s)]
*  testified before Congress that Iran was not that close to developing a nuclear weapon. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=846.16s)]
*  Its program had advanced, but is still a ways away. Now completely reversing herself, [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=851.52s)]
*  basically for job security reasons. And she's been banned from there's a Senate hearing on this today [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=857.28s)]
*  where they're sending eggs out, but not Tulsi. Right. So I mean, can you blame people for being [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=863.04s)]
*  a little bit skeptical that maybe she's not telling the truth? And also, you know, John [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=869.04s)]
*  Radcliffe, the director of CIA puts out a statement, official CIA statement, saying, you know, [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=873.8399999999999s)]
*  this program has been severely damaged. Okay. But then he personally tweets from his own Twitter [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=878.8s)]
*  account, Donald Trump deserves the Nobel Peace Prize. I mean, this is, you know, North Korean [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=884.24s)]
*  levels of, you know, lickspittle personality cult behavior coming from professionals whose one job [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=889.76s)]
*  is to be completely dispassionate and analytically rigorous. Right. Now they are becoming PR agents. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=897.2s)]
*  Yes, exactly. So, you know, this is the frustration, those of us who've been saying this is actually [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=905.76s)]
*  how intelligence gathering works, as opposed to what crazies on the far left and the far right have [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=910.48s)]
*  been saying, whether it's about Russian interference in our elections or hacking operations, or indeed, [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=915.44s)]
*  Havana syndrome and the stuff that, you know, I've spent my career working on. Now we find ourselves [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=921.92s)]
*  saying, well, you know, this is your bed that you made for yourselves. Now you off the line. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=927.28s)]
*  No one's going to believe a word out of your mouth. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=931.5999999999999s)]
*  Hey everybody. When I'm looking for clothes to wear on the pod, now that we're a YouTube pod, [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=937.28s)]
*  you guys are seeing me all the time, looking for basics, looking for essentials for things that are [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=941.36s)]
*  lightweight here in the summertime in Louisiana. And I keep turning back to Quince. Quince is all [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=946.4s)]
*  the things you actually want to wear in the summer, like organic cotton silk polos, linen beach [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=951.52s)]
*  shorts, and comfortable pants that work for everything from backyard hangs to nice dinners. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=956.72s)]
*  So, I mean, assuming you live with Jonathan Cohen up in Michigan, you could wear them. We're not [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=961.84s)]
*  wearing pants to backyard hangs here in Louisiana in June. The best part, everything with Quince is [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=967.1999999999999s)]
*  half the cost of similar brands. By working directly with top artisans and cutting out the [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=972.64s)]
*  middleman, Quince gives you the luxury pieces without the markup. I've been turning to Quince, [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=977.28s)]
*  I've mentioned before, you're seeing some of my Quince basics and the Quince shirts I've been [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=984.24s)]
*  wearing on the show, the Normcore Vibes, which are coming back with Gen Z. Also, they've got kid [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=989.28s)]
*  stuff too. I got my daughter a little Quince button up shirt. She likes to wear button up shirts like [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=995.04s)]
*  dads, which is really cute. And so I got her one of those. I have a little linen, pink little [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=1001.44s)]
*  linen button up number. And boy, has she been getting compliments. So, if you're looking for [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=1008.32s)]
*  something for the kiddos, you can go to Quince as well. You can stick to the staples that last with [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=1012.8000000000001s)]
*  elevated essentials from Quince. Go to quince.com slash the bulwark for free shipping on your order [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=1017.12s)]
*  and 365 day returns. That's q-u-i-n-c-e dot com slash the bulwark to get free shipping and 365 [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=1022.24s)]
*  day returns. Quince.com slash the bulwark. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=1030.32s)]
*  This is a question, and I was talking about this with JVL last night. The other element to this [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=1033.4399999999998s)]
*  is now, what do you make of this actually? I'll just put it as a question. The US and Israel now [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=1042.08s)]
*  kind of at cross purposes about the Intel assessment, because frankly, I've been talking [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=1047.6799999999998s)]
*  to a lot of military experts and the Iranian nuclear program could not be completely eliminated [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=1054.56s)]
*  just from air campaigns. And that was just the assessment that everybody had across the aisle. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=1062.32s)]
*  You could injure it. You could delay it. But you couldn't obliterate it just from an air campaign. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=1068.48s)]
*  And so Israel, who has an acute security interest here in the way that we don't, even Ted Cruz is [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=1074.1599999999999s)]
*  like on Fox, they might bomb Los Angeles. Okay, I actually don't think that's a real movie. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=1081.2s)]
*  That's not real. So Israel, which has an acute security interest in making sure they don't [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=1088.48s)]
*  continue to expand the program, will be incentivized to want to potentially do more [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=1092.32s)]
*  military action, depending as new information arises. Meanwhile, now, in order to run cover [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=1100.48s)]
*  for Trump's bombast, the US and our interest is now towards concocting intelligence to make it [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=1108.64s)]
*  seem like everything is dandy. Doesn't that eventually create some issues? What do you think? [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=1116.64s)]
*  Yeah, it does. And it's not even that the IC is necessarily concocting scenarios. This might be [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=1124.48s)]
*  credible. This might be rooted in very good human and SIGIN, but nobody's going to believe it because [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=1130.64s)]
*  it is being framed as just a public relations exercise. The reason this is happening, [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=1136.24s)]
*  and let's be clear, the Defense Intelligence Agency, which I'm being generous when I say this, [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=1142.56s)]
*  is sort of considered the redheaded stepchild of the intelligence community. I mean, there's a [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=1149.1999999999998s)]
*  reason Mike Flynn was the head of DIA at one point, right? They came out with an early preliminary [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=1153.28s)]
*  assessment, graded quote, low confidence, that said that actually, we kind of nicked it, but [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=1158.32s)]
*  we only set the program back a couple of months. CNN, New York Times, Washington Post, they all [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=1164.56s)]
*  ran with this, as any reporter covering national security would do. If I got my hands on a document [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=1170.08s)]
*  or I was read by a source, this is an IC finding, I would report it because it's newsworthy. It's in [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=1175.12s)]
*  the public interest. And to the credit of these journalists, because Trump is now going after them, [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=1180.48s)]
*  hammer and tong, demanding Natasha Bertrand be fired from CNN, they did frame it correctly. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=1185.04s)]
*  They said, look, this is a low intelligence assessment. It's early days. There's going to [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=1189.52s)]
*  be more as BDAs come in, et cetera, et cetera. But what happens is, and a lot of this falls to [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=1192.88s)]
*  sub-editors and just the nature of a 24-hour digitally driven news cycle, you read a headline [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=1198.48s)]
*  that says, US Intel says, Iran program's still doing dandy, not knocked out, just a few months. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=1203.6000000000001s)]
*  And to the layman, that sounds like, well, this has just been a complete anticlimactic disaster. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=1211.0400000000002s)]
*  I mean, we went to war with Iran and didn't even accomplish our objectives. No. Again, asteris, [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=1215.92s)]
*  asteris, axeris. It all depends on what comes later. Now, the Israelis, who, as we've discussed, [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=1221.04s)]
*  have a very extensive and sophisticated intelligence gathering program such that they have infiltrated [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=1226.3999999999999s)]
*  the Iranian regime, and I would rate the Iranian intelligence service probably second in the region, [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=1231.76s)]
*  at least up until recently, they have two interests now. One, what are the facts? What actually [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=1236.72s)]
*  happened? Because as you point out, this is an overriding national security concern for themselves. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=1244.0s)]
*  Two, how can we help craft the media narrative to back up Donald Trump and what he's trying to do, [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=1249.28s)]
*  which is to suggest that a military option was successful? And it's very difficult to parse [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=1256.56s)]
*  the facts from the bullshit. When we're getting facts and when we're getting Donald Trump, they are. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=1263.04s)]
*  Exactly. I mean, a lot of this will come out. It also is kind of one of the weaknesses of having [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=1267.44s)]
*  just like an insecure, bloviating idiot as the president, right? Where it's like, [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=1271.52s)]
*  that wouldn't, and we're gonna get into this in the NATO stuff, right? If countries didn't feel [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=1276.16s)]
*  like they had to rub Donald Trump's belly to make him feel good to get America to be nice to them, [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=1280.72s)]
*  then maybe we would be getting more accurate, straight information from countries that are [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=1285.3600000000001s)]
*  allies rather than sucking up. And Trump has also made himself a hostage to fortune. So he goes in [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=1291.2s)]
*  with a 30-minute military operation, comes out. I mean, I know everyone wants to call him daddy, [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=1298.96s)]
*  but if anybody, you should be calling daddy, it's the B-2 bombers. I mean, I've never seen such sort [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=1305.84s)]
*  of pornographic exultation in military hardware in my life. I mean, everybody's like, oh my God, [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=1310.1599999999999s)]
*  these players are amazing. They're built for this purpose and they've done it. And the pilots, oh, [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=1315.6s)]
*  the pilots, they're like pole dancing inside the cockpit of the fucking plane. I mean, it's just, [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=1320.3999999999999s)]
*  it's obscene, right? Okay, fine. So he gets his bright, shiny moment. And then he's like, [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=1325.6s)]
*  mission accomplished. We're all done here. Well, what if it wasn't accomplished, at least to the [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=1330.48s)]
*  satisfaction of what he believes is necessary. Does that mean you're going to do it again? [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=1334.96s)]
*  And then thus contradict everything you've just said. And it puts the Israelis in a bind too, [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=1340.56s)]
*  because if they feel there is a need for further military action, either renew the ground, the [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=1345.28s)]
*  aerial campaign or a ground operation, I mean, their plan B going forward from even before this, [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=1351.28s)]
*  I mean, they planned for this for 20 years, their plan B in the, in the event that the United States [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=1358.96s)]
*  did not do what it's just done was send in a commando team with sufficient air cover, which [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=1363.44s)]
*  the Israelis had established with air supremacy after 36 hours of bombing Iran and try to take [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=1371.2s)]
*  out Fordo from within. So, you know, you mind the place, you go inside, you just blow the whole [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=1376.88s)]
*  thing up. If they have to do that, then again, nobody will ever believe a word out of the US [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=1381.04s)]
*  government. The IC will be completely and utterly discredited. Maybe, except maybe this leaker from [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=1387.52s)]
*  the DIA or the NSC, whoever, or probably more likely a congressional staffer who got the DIA [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=1392.88s)]
*  assessment who leaked it, you know, up will be down, black will be white. And the conspiracy [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=1398.96s)]
*  theory that Trump has been pushing for so many years will sort of become a self-fulfilling [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=1405.44s)]
*  prophecy, right? The IC is now fatally compromised and we don't, and this is going to have detrimental [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=1410.24s)]
*  effects, not just on Israel, Iran, but on other things like Ukraine, Russia, China, Taiwan, [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=1415.1200000000001s)]
*  shenanigans that the North Koreans could get up to. I mean, you name it, right? So, he sort of put [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=1423.3600000000001s)]
*  himself in a box here and it's going to be very difficult for him to struggle his way out. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=1429.0400000000002s)]
*  Okay. You've referenced it now as I believe animal house and pole dancing. And so I think [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=1433.2800000000002s)]
*  we just got to give the people what they want. Pete Exxon had a press conference this morning [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=1439.44s)]
*  that Donald Trump called one of the greatest, most professional, most confirming, in quotes, [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=1444.64s)]
*  unclear why, press conferences he has ever seen. And so I want folks to judge for themselves a [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=1451.68s)]
*  little bit. Here are a couple of clips from Pete Exxon. How many stories have been written about [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=1457.3600000000001s)]
*  how hard it is to, I don't know, fly a plane for 36 hours? Has MSNBC done that story? Has Fox? [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=1462.16s)]
*  Have we done the story how hard that is? Have we done it two or three times? [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=1470.0s)]
*  Pete Exxon Let me read the bottom line here. President Trump directed the most complex and [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=1474.0s)]
*  secretive military operation in history. And it was a resounding success resulting in a ceasefire [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=1481.1999999999998s)]
*  agreement and the end of the 12-day war. Pete Slauson [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=1487.9199999999998s)]
*  It's like a combo between an executive producer at Fox yelling at his underlings [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=1492.8799999999999s)]
*  combined with Sean Spicer. Like a little Sean Spicer. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=1499.84s)]
*  Pete Exxon What's also funny is in Kane's presentation, [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=1501.84s)]
*  you know, I mean, this is a very serious guy as an accomplished military officer. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=1505.28s)]
*  Pete Slauson Despite the fact that Trump refuses to call [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=1509.6s)]
*  him by anything except his name. Sean Spicer [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=1511.52s)]
*  Well, he calls himself that to be fair. But you can see the desperation for that sort of cinematic [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=1513.84s)]
*  Hollywood quality because he goes, and I just let it be known that in the Air Force, you know, [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=1519.4399999999998s)]
*  base in Missouri where these planes took off, there is no volleyball tournaments and no football [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=1524.56s)]
*  on the beach. Okay, so now we're talking about Top Gun, which if you recall, I mean, it was [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=1529.2s)]
*  basically the greatest product ever produced, soft power exercise by the military industrial complex, [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=1534.64s)]
*  not Air Force, by the way, Navy. But so like, you know, they wanted this thing to end with, [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=1539.04s)]
*  you know, a shirtless Val Kilmer high-fiving Tom Cruise on a beach saying, I'll be a wingman any [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=1545.04s)]
*  day, man. You know, like, that's how this is supposed to go. It's all TV. It's all spectacle. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=1550.72s)]
*  It's all pageantry. And, you know, and people are like, why is he beating up on BB? Why is he so [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=1555.12s)]
*  upset on the tarmac headed off to the Hague NATO summit a couple days ago, you know, saying the [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=1560.08s)]
*  Israelis and the Iranians don't know what the fuck they're doing. He's messing with the script. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=1565.6s)]
*  Sean Spicer He's messing with the script. This was not the [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=1568.8799999999999s)]
*  Hollywood ending, right? Don't screw with my ceasefire, my perfect, beautiful ceasefire. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=1571.52s)]
*  You know, season two's cliffhanger is not yet. Like, don't get ahead of yourselves here. This [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=1576.0s)]
*  is a guy look, he's a product of television and the tabloid press, controlling his own narrative, [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=1581.12s)]
*  since he was, you know, outer borough real estate developer desperate to make the show in Manhattan, [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=1587.36s)]
*  right? For him, geopolitics and foreign affairs is the same, there's no different. If it's not, [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=1593.12s)]
*  it's not sort of tidally written up, like a Netflix series. It's just it's not worth it. So [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=1598.32s)]
*  anybody who's going to spoil his pageantry is going to come down, he's going to come down [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=1603.6799999999998s)]
*  extremely hard on it, be it the Israelis, the Iranians or whomever. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=1608.48s)]
*  Mike [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=1611.04s)]
*  You know, I was young. Bluto? What were the characters names in Animal House? That wasn't [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=1613.82s)]
*  really a big Animal House man. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=1616.24s)]
*  Sean Spicer You know, I went to- [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=1617.52s)]
*  Mike Lutarski. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=1618.72s)]
*  Sean Spicer Lutarski. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=1619.52s)]
*  Mike Lutarski. Yeah, I can't, you know, I've watched that movie so many times and it's actually [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=1620.56s)]
*  based on my alma mater, so I should know this. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=1624.56s)]
*  Mike Lutarski Okay, well, here's Blutarski. That's a big fail for you, Michael Weiss. Here's- [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=1626.72s)]
*  Sean Spicer It's a huge one. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=1631.28s)]
*  Mike Lutarski One more clip from Blutarski. He's yelling at his former, I guess, maybe a [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=1631.84s)]
*  sorority, the sorority girl that didn't give him the attention he wanted. Let's listen. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=1636.3999999999999s)]
*  Jennifer [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=1641.28s)]

*  Are you certain none of that highly enriched uranium was moved? [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=1647.52s)]
*  Mike Lutarski Of course, we're watching every single aspect, but Jennifer, you've been about [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=1650.48s)]
*  the worst, the one who misrepresents the most intentionally what the President says. I'm [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=1654.0s)]
*  familiar. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=1660.8799999999999s)]
*  Jennifer Griffin Jennifer Griffin, throwing down at her former colleague there. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=1661.28s)]
*  Mike Lutarski Fox News reporter, superb reporter, by the way, who's had to push back against her own [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=1679.76s)]
*  network. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=1686.32s)]
*  Sean Spicer Maybe only good reporter left over there. Honestly, she's great. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=1686.6399999999999s)]
*  You know, and he's attacking her. I mean, again, it's playing the man or, in this case, the woman, [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=1688.64s)]
*  not the ball, as they say, right? If you work in government, especially if you work in the Pentagon [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=1693.2s)]
*  and you're waging war, which usually tends to go sideways a bit, or maybe more than a bit, [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=1698.08s)]
*  you have to put up with these sort of critical and in some cases, severely skeptical questions. [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=1704.72s)]
*  And this guy just doesn't want to hear it. Again, where's my high five on the beach, Jennifer? [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=1712.56s)]
*  I just spiked the ball. Where's my hey, bro, good shot. That's what this guy is desperate for. He [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=1717.1200000000001s)]
*  doesn't want to hear, gee, maybe some highly enriched uranium went skedaddling in the back [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=1722.88s)]
*  of Toyota Hiluxes at some point. It's just not the script. [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=1729.2s)]
*  Mike Lutarski He's very emotional. [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=1732.4s)]
*  Sean Spicer Yes. [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=1733.68s)]
*  Mike Lutarski He's very emotional and defensive and sensitive. So we do honor the pilots here at [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=1734.3200000000002s)]
*  the Bullhawk. They did great work and we do honor our servicemen and women. I want to offer you just [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=1741.76s)]
*  kind of the biggest picture view of this. We got some feedback yesterday from a valued confidant. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=1747.04s)]
*  I've been deeply torn about the whole thing, you know, and at times I've been wanting to, [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=1756.0s)]
*  look, I don't like the Ayatollah. I don't want Iran to have a nuclear weapon. I don't particularly [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=1761.2s)]
*  think it was an acute national security concern for us in like the short term, where it was like [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=1767.36s)]
*  an urgent matter. But at the same time, I've been, you know, even though Pete doesn't want to admit [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=1770.96s)]
*  it, like they've been getting credit, like people have been, you know, saying this was a good mission, [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=1777.8400000000001s)]
*  heck of a job. The feedback I got was that like, really in the grand scheme of things, like yes, [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=1782.4s)]
*  it was successful. Like the bombs, like the narrow element of did bombs hit the building? [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=1788.88s)]
*  Like, and it was the did the building have bad material was kind of yes, that's good. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=1795.44s)]
*  Did that help? Like, is Israel safer than it was two weeks ago? Yes, which is good. That said, [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=1800.4s)]
*  looked at it from another way, wasn't completely successful and it can't be. Like, you can't just [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=1806.72s)]
*  take out Iran's nuclear system from the air. They lied about it right off the top. Israel did most [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=1811.8400000000001s)]
*  of the heavy lifting here. And like we did the one thing they couldn't do. There wasn't really a great [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=1817.3600000000001s)]
*  threat to the US acutely. And now you could argue maybe the threats are higher. You're already seeing [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=1822.3200000000002s)]
*  this. They're having to take some of their immigration goons at the FBI and CIA and redirect [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=1826.56s)]
*  them back towards, you know, terror threats. Trump doesn't have any interest in the long-term goals [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=1831.28s)]
*  that might make the region safer. He's not, he doesn't want freedom for people in the Middle East. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=1837.84s)]
*  Like he's happy to have other autocrats running places. And so at that biggest level, [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=1843.44s)]
*  like, fuck this. No, that was, it was not a success. What would you say to that? [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=1850.1599999999999s)]
*  Framing of the situation. Again, you know, I, my, my objective here has been very narrow, which is [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=1856.8s)]
*  I want to follow the reporting and I don't want to speculate or even offer any kind of editorial [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=1863.76s)]
*  comment. I don't know if this is going to pay off in the long run and I, nobody does. And the thing [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=1867.9199999999998s)]
*  that bugs me is, you know, everybody who is extremely sure that Israel and the United States [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=1872.8s)]
*  were not going to go to war with Iran. And then they did then became extremely sure exactly what [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=1878.3999999999999s)]
*  Iran was going to do in response. Right. And, you know, I was hearing doomsday scenarios, [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=1883.84s)]
*  world war three is going to break out. And what did the Iranians do? You know, they rocketed [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=1889.36s)]
*  our air base and cutter giving the cutteries and the United States advanced notice. So we had [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=1895.28s)]
*  cleared out all of most of our personnel and most of our hardware and everything was intercepted. [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=1900.8s)]
*  It was, it was a damn squib exercise designed basically to show their people to say face [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=1906.72s)]
*  internally because this regime has been, I mean, eviscerate, you know, I think that the one takeaway [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=1911.84s)]
*  I would, I think I'm okay in making now is if there is a positive outcome of all of this, [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=1917.52s)]
*  it has to demonstrate that a regime that has been built up both in its own internal mythology and [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=1923.76s)]
*  frankly speaking, in the minds of Western military analysts and subject matter experts for decades [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=1930.56s)]
*  as an impregnable fortress, an empire in the remaking, you know, custom Soleimani. And I was [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=1938.88s)]
*  susceptible to this to custom Soleimani. He was a superb intelligence officer and military commander, [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=1945.8400000000001s)]
*  and he did build an incredibly effective proxy apparatus across the region. His death, [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=1952.64s)]
*  which happened again, you know, Donald Trump bombed him and took him out when nobody thought [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=1960.24s)]
*  anybody, the United States would ever take out the Quds Force commander. I think lead was the [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=1965.84s)]
*  first domino to fall and to show that actually Iran is quite hollow and it's quite weak. And [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=1970.3999999999999s)]
*  obviously October 7th and the sort of multi-theater operations that the Israelis have waged, not just [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=1976.08s)]
*  against Hamas and Gaza, but most specifically Hezbollah in Lebanon. I mean, they neutered [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=1982.24s)]
*  Hezbollah to such a degree that Hezbollah came out repeatedly and said, we will not defend Iran in [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=1987.1999999999998s)]
*  this war because they did not come to our rescue when Israel assassinated Hassan Nasrallah, secretary [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=1993.36s)]
*  general, the entire upper echelon command structure of Hezbollah, and then famously with the pager [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=1999.36s)]
*  military intelligence pager explosions, you know, took off the balls of, you know, the middle cadres [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=2005.28s)]
*  of Hezbollah. So Israel has in the last two and a half years essentially chipped away at the IRGC's [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=2010.8799999999999s)]
*  power production project and really demonstrated in a way that the emperor has no clothes. Now, [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=2018.64s)]
*  that doesn't mean that Iran is not a threat. And there's a lot of things- [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=2024.3200000000002s)]
*  Just really quick on the Israel thing though. Because I guess that is the point I was trying [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=2027.44s)]
*  to make is that like, what really this was, was Donald Trump watching his stories and like [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=2031.5200000000002s)]
*  seeing that Israel had been very successful at this and now coming in and being like, [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=2037.44s)]
*  I want a bit of the credit now. And it's kind of like, well- [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=2041.44s)]
*  Coming back to the sort of Hollywood, yeah, the Hollywood or TV metaphor. I mean, he saw like a [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=2045.84s)]
*  fantastic season one series and he wanted an executive producer credit on it. And the Israelis, [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=2052.24s)]
*  their purpose in going to war with Iran, I wrote a piece about this. It was one, first and foremost, [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=2058.0s)]
*  to try and degrade or destroy Iran's nuclear program, but also to take out their ballistic [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=2063.2s)]
*  missile capacity, eliminate all air defense systems, which they've more or less done. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=2068.64s)]
*  I've seen different projections or assessments that anywhere between 50% and two-thirds of Iran's [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=2074.0800000000004s)]
*  missile launchers have been destroyed in this 12-day campaign. That's huge, right? Because [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=2080.0s)]
*  that's the other, their conventional capability was seen to be quite formidable up until recently. [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=2083.76s)]
*  But the second order priority for the Israelis was to telegraph to the United States, [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=2089.1200000000003s)]
*  come on in, the water's fine. You can do this too. We've cleared the path for you, [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=2094.96s)]
*  which is basically what worked. It was so tantalizing a prospect to Donald Trump that [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=2099.36s)]
*  all he would have to do is drop half a dozen bombs and go home that they played him sort of [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=2104.48s)]
*  magically in that way. We'll see if they can keep doing that. I think that, I guess that's my point, [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=2111.6s)]
*  is that that prospect becomes potentially a little more challenging depending on what happens inside [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=2116.32s)]
*  Iran in the next- Yeah, but look, I just want to also emphasize, like, I'm kind of with you on, [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=2120.96s)]
*  well, what is the immediate threat to the United States with the state of Iran's nuclear program [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=2127.76s)]
*  as it was prior to two weeks ago? One thing I would push back on is, and we get this wrong a lot, [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=2133.6s)]
*  a lot of the commentariat in the United States sees Iran as the best friend we just haven't made [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=2141.12s)]
*  yet, right? Much like a lot of the commentariat in the United States sees Russia as the best friend [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=2145.12s)]
*  we just haven't made yet. I just want to remind people, Iran has done some pretty horrific things, [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=2149.92s)]
*  including, I mean, one of the IRGC generals that the Israelis assassinated was in charge of the [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=2155.76s)]
*  Hezbollah project to blow up Jews in Argentina in 1994, the EMEA cultural center bombing. It's [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=2160.32s)]
*  pretty horrible, right? I mean, they were also in charge- I got to do it pretty old, so it's [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=2166.8s)]
*  probably easy to target him. He's probably walking pretty slow. Yeah, a lot of these guys are, you [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=2169.44s)]
*  know, sort of graying mains of the Islamic revolution, right? But they're hard to replace [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=2173.28s)]
*  for that reason because they have so much experience. But leave aside what they've done [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=2177.6800000000003s)]
*  to Israelis, to Jews, to Americans, what they've done to other people in the region, [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=2182.88s)]
*  including Sunni Arabs in Syria. I mean, without Hezbollah on the ground, Bashar al-Assad's bacon, [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=2189.28s)]
*  I mean, he would have been cooked in 2023, 2024, right? So Iran came to his rescue on the ground, [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=2196.2400000000002s)]
*  Russia came to his rescue in the air. You see how that worked out in the long term after October [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=2203.04s)]
*  7th, when again, Israel completely destroyed Hezbollah, ran bombing campaigns galore for 10 [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=2207.68s)]
*  years inside Syrian air space. Again, another piece of conventional wisdom was the Syrian regime [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=2214.0s)]
*  has the most formidable air defenses in the region. If you want to make an Israeli military officer [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=2219.2799999999997s)]
*  laugh, tell him about Syria's formidable air defenses. That was their backyard for 10 years. [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=2224.3999999999996s)]
*  And, you know, internally inside Iran, what they do to their own people is pretty horrific, right? [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=2229.9199999999996s)]
*  So I shed no tears for seeing IRGC personnel wiped out. I shed no tears for seeing Iranian [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=2236.64s)]
*  ballistic missiles destroyed. I think, yes, a lot of sort of variables and to coin a phrase, [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=2243.2799999999997s)]
*  unknown unknowns going forward. But again, it is a very useful exercise, especially for intelligence [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=2249.52s)]
*  gatherers to see how Iran is able or unable to fight a conventional campaign against a [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=2255.52s)]
*  peer adversary, or in this case, I would say a much more superior adversary, which is Israel. [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=2261.52s)]
*  And I think that was part of the sort of exercise here for the Israelis to demonstrate to the world [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=2266.24s)]
*  this is not a powerful, strong regime anymore. They are at the most vulnerable, [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=2271.3599999999997s)]
*  strategically at their weakest that they have ever been since 1979. And, you know, [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=2278.16s)]
*  okay, maybe that was worth the price of admission alone. [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=2284.56s)]
*  Pete Slauson Move on to NATO really quick. With the NATO meetings, there are two things I want to [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=2287.3599999999997s)]
*  talk about. One is related to this in the Middle East. What are my takeaways? And I understand that [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=2291.36s)]
*  there's not an unlimited number of patriots in the world, or patriot missiles. There are, hopefully, [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=2297.04s)]
*  an unlimited number of people who have patriotism in their heart. But not an unlimited number of [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=2302.32s)]
*  patriot missiles in the world. But watching how easily we rebuffed the fake Iranian attack in [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=2306.32s)]
*  Qatar and Bahrain, my initial response was, again, it's like, well, [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=2312.7200000000003s)]
*  isn't, like, weren't those resources better served in Ukraine? Like, why aren't we helping Ukraine [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=2318.72s)]
*  more? Like, why aren't we helping Ukraine more? Like, Russia seems to me to be a more acute threat [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=2326.0s)]
*  than Iran. Neither of them are particularly. But there's a war happening in Europe, on the European [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=2330.3999999999996s)]
*  mainland, where Russia took out a passenger train earlier this week in a hospital and a school. [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=2335.7599999999998s)]
*  And at NATO, Trump, I guess, expressed, it's always like, Trump expresses openness to everything. If [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=2342.56s)]
*  you're ever like, will you consider this? He says yes, no matter whether it's a good thing or a bad [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=2348.16s)]
*  thing. But he did express some openness to providing air defenses to Ukraine. What were you, [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=2351.6s)]
*  have you learned anything from the NATO meeting? Is there any potential cavalry coming for Ukraine? [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=2357.6800000000003s)]
*  Okay, so here's the sort of most optimistic gloss I can give you. Number one, let's start with [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=2364.48s)]
*  Lindsey Graham and Richard Blumenthal. Oh my god. Big, most optimistic gloss you can give me [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=2371.92s)]
*  starts with Lindsey Graham. That's not encouraging. So this is sort of at Lindsey Graham's expense, [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=2377.6800000000003s)]
*  but the ending is a little happier than it might seem. He's been going on and on about this bill, [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=2383.04s)]
*  which would impose 500% tariffs on any country that imports Russian oil, gas, uranium, or petroleum [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=2388.2400000000002s)]
*  products for months now. He's got an 84 Senate member veto-proof majority on board to pass this [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=2394.96s)]
*  thing if it's up for a floor vote. The House usually follows the Senate in this regard. [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=2404.32s)]
*  Why hasn't it been put up? And so the conventional wisdom would have you believe it's because [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=2409.2s)]
*  Donald Trump does not want any sanctions. It's true to a degree. Donald Trump does not want any [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=2412.96s)]
*  sanctions, and he's been very clear about that. And it's why Marco Rubio publicly says no sanctions, [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=2417.12s)]
*  but privately tells everybody we need sanctions on Russia. The other reason though, and here's [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=2421.76s)]
*  where you get the sort of the nitty gritty of congressional sort of bureaucracy doesn't really [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=2426.6400000000003s)]
*  come out in the Western reporting, is that the bill was drafted horribly, and it was so broad [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=2431.92s)]
*  in scope that it would be unenforceable. And more to the point, it actually penalizes European [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=2438.32s)]
*  countries that agreed with us when we imposed our sanctions policy to wind down their dependency on [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=2443.6800000000003s)]
*  Russian energy. So instead, we're going to beat up the people who said we agree with you, it's just [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=2451.04s)]
*  going to take us time to kind of get our house in order and become energy independent and put [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=2454.88s)]
*  sanctions on them, which makes no sense, especially at a time when the US-European divide is widening, [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=2458.88s)]
*  and the Russians are exploiting that chasm. I mean, their messaging now is not that the United [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=2465.68s)]
*  States is evil. It's that the Europeans are fascists, and oh, Russia, we are the great ally [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=2470.56s)]
*  of the United States in defeating fascism. Why are they doing that? Because they see that NATO, [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=2474.96s)]
*  the transatlantic relationship is kind of, it's on the skits. Right now, there is an effort to [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=2479.36s)]
*  rewrite the Graham bill and tighten it up and make it actually not just enforceable, but really [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=2484.88s)]
*  crippling to the Russian economy. More to the point, if that thing does pass, and again, [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=2491.44s)]
*  it's veto proof, so even if Trump says, I don't like it, well, too bad. You've got enough senators [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=2496.08s)]
*  who go with it, unless he really applies the pressure and, you know, threatens to primary them [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=2501.28s)]
*  up. But 84 is a lot, right? If it passes, it puts paid to any notion of a US-Russian reset, [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=2505.04s)]
*  or rapprochement, or I think more ambitiously, strategic realignment with Russia, which has been [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=2511.28s)]
*  the real danger. So let's see. I'm not, you know, for me, I'm probably less than 50% this thing would [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=2516.16s)]
*  get done, but there is a sort of more nuance here than perhaps comes out in the report. [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=2522.56s)]
*  The second thing I would say is, speaking of this divide between the US and Europe, [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=2528.4s)]
*  I don't like it when NATO secretary general calls Donald Trump daddy. Okay? I especially [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=2533.12s)]
*  don't like it when the White House tweets daddy's home. But just really quick, just for people who [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=2539.12s)]
*  did that, because I didn't see, I was not watching the fucking live press conference, and so I was [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=2542.8799999999997s)]
*  like, why did the NATO secretary call Trump daddy? And Trump was doing the stupid thing that he's [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=2546.64s)]
*  been doing, where he's like, the Ukraine and Russia are like two kids fighting on the playground. [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=2551.04s)]
*  No, no, no, Israel-Iran. Oh, sorry, this time it was Israel-Iran that were the two kids fighting [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=2555.68s)]
*  on the playground. Yeah, well, same metaphor he's used. And it's like, sometimes you got to let him [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=2560.16s)]
*  fight it out, you know, and let them blood each other up a little bit. And then Ruto is like, [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=2564.72s)]
*  well, no, sometimes daddy has to use certain language and tell him to stop. [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=2570.08s)]
*  Ben Fenske Daddy. Yeah. Actually, you know, dude, you're from the Netherlands, there are places in [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=2573.92s)]
*  the red light district of Amsterdam where you can work through some shit, where you don't have to [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=2579.04s)]
*  be referring to the president of the United States as daddy. But now the White House is just taking [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=2582.56s)]
*  this up. Maybe they're tweeting this out. The Dutch are so weird with their eating, you know, [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=2587.28s)]
*  it's like, you know, there are two things, like you, I mean, there are two things that I don't [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=2591.84s)]
*  like in this world, which is that people that are intolerant of other people's cultures and the Dutch, [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=2596.8s)]
*  you know, they have a weird culture and it might not have translated right. Daddy might have a [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=2600.8s)]
*  different meaning. No, well, yeah, I think there might be a bit of a disconnected sort of Dutch [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=2607.6800000000003s)]
*  on the psychosexual element. Yeah. I mean, the Dutch language to begin with is sort of a, [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=2613.84s)]
*  somebody invented at three o'clock in the morning. Yeah, it's ridiculous. [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=2619.5200000000004s)]
*  With Pete Hedges. Yeah, we have an unserious problem. We have an unserious problem when the [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=2622.2400000000002s)]
*  secretary general of NATO is calling the president of the United States daddy. However, however, [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=2628.1600000000003s)]
*  look, let us say like, again, I want to inject a little nuance here. Has it been the case that [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=2633.2000000000003s)]
*  other allies in NATO have not contributed their fair share to defense spending? So that the [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=2638.72s)]
*  benchmark was, I think, two, 3% of your GDP has to go to defense. Donald Trump came in and arbitrarily [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=2644.08s)]
*  raised that threshold to 5% pulled it out of his ass. But all of a sudden everyone at NATO has [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=2650.72s)]
*  affirmed that's the benchmark we want to reach except the Spanish, the Spanish, their socialists. [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=2656.3199999999997s)]
*  And Trump also still doesn't understand how the system works. He keeps being like, why won't Spain [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=2662.0s)]
*  pay the 5%? I'm like, it's not dues like a country club. It's not dues, right? It's a guideline, [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=2665.76s)]
*  not a requirement. But the fact that they've all committed to do this, the fact that across the [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=2670.7200000000003s)]
*  board, European allies are spending more. I mean, Germany is now, you know, Schultz, when the full [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=2675.5200000000004s)]
*  scale invasion came out, he gave this speech known as the Zeitinventa speech or the turning point [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=2681.36s)]
*  speech. And it was all sort of smoke and mirrors because Schultz was terrified of Russia and [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=2685.5200000000004s)]
*  terrified, frankly, of his own policy toward Ukraine, which was actually robust security [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=2690.0800000000004s)]
*  assistance. The Germans have given more to Ukraine than any country in Europe, and it's [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=2694.16s)]
*  not even close. But in comes the new chancellor, Friedrich Merz, who's actually putting some flesh [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=2697.68s)]
*  on the bones. And Zeitinventa is now a thing. Germany is set to spend, I think it's 3.5% [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=2704.3199999999997s)]
*  by 20, just in a couple of years time, they've committed another $8 billion to security assistance [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=2711.2s)]
*  or 8 billion euro to security assistance to Ukraine for 2025. Merz is serious about German [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=2716.8799999999997s)]
*  national defense and also recognizes the threat posed by Russia. This is all to the good. So if [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=2723.6s)]
*  coming away from the Hague is, you know, flattering daddy and patting him on the head and saying, [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=2729.04s)]
*  without you and without your brilliant bunker busting bombs in Iran, you know, we'd all be [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=2735.2799999999997s)]
*  nuclear ash and we'll do whatever you want. And if that gets the Europeans not only to spend more [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=2740.24s)]
*  on defense, but also- Couldn't the Europeans spend more on defense without flattering daddy? [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=2745.92s)]
*  Well, you would think, man. You would think. I mean, I don't know. [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=2750.24s)]
*  The energy I was looking forward to shout out to Dush, did you see the queen of the Netherlands [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=2753.2799999999997s)]
*  like mocking his mouth movements? I'll put a little link for people who need a little joy. [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=2759.2799999999997s)]
*  But also just as a sort of conclusion to that, if it also keeps Trump happy with respect to [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=2764.7999999999997s)]
*  the transatlantic relationship. And he said, I think at one point, you know, I came here, [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=2772.4799999999996s)]
*  literally before he arrived in the Hague, he was asked, would you enforce article five? And he was [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=2777.3599999999997s)]
*  sort of like, no, no, no. Or there's multiple interpretations of article five. No, there's one [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=2781.92s)]
*  interpretation. An attack on one is an attack on all. We come to collective defense. Now he comes [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=2785.68s)]
*  away saying, well, the scales have fallen from my eyes and these free loading welfare queens of [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=2790.4s)]
*  Europe have flattered me and polished my throne and praise me to such a degree that suddenly [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=2795.8399999999997s)]
*  might actually come to their defense if they get attacked. It's not great, but given the low [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=2802.32s)]
*  threshold for good news these days, it's not a bad result either. And it's cringe to watch this. [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=2808.88s)]
*  Nobody I know in the NatSec world likes to see the Europeans kowtowing and basically treating Trump [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=2815.6s)]
*  like the sort of authoritarian dictator who has led Europe to war time and time again. [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=2822.16s)]
*  But they understand that unfortunately right now Europe has not got, and not because of a lack of [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=2827.28s)]
*  economic capacity, but political will has taken a long time for the Europeans to get to sort of see [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=2833.44s)]
*  the future here. They have not got the ability to stand on their own two feet just yet. So they have [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=2839.44s)]
*  to keep the United States sweet, if only to receive weapons from us, to buy weapons, which they can [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=2843.92s)]
*  then donate to the Ukrainians and also to make sure that the messaging on NATO and article five is [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=2849.0400000000004s)]
*  good. Are we giving patriots to Ukraine? According to Trump, he is looking into trying to find more. [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=2854.4s)]
*  They're few and far between, honestly. This is the problem. We are looking to source them from [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=2863.6800000000003s)]
*  other countries such as Israel because these batteries are hard to find. So it is tough. [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=2868.88s)]
*  But keep in mind too, just one last point if I may, Trump is dazzled and completely [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=2874.48s)]
*  impressed by the military genius of Israel bombing Iran and taking out their aircraft and [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=2880.88s)]
*  air defense systems and ballistic missile launchers in Iranian territory. Less impressed by Ukraine [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=2885.6800000000003s)]
*  going into Russia with FPV drones and taking out Russia's fleet, or at least part of Russia's fleet [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=2891.6s)]
*  of strategic bombers. So it's the same principle. Kill the archer instead of shooting down the [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=2897.6s)]
*  arrows. But when Ukraine does it, it's a no-no. When Israel does it, it's I got a piece of this [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=2901.28s)]
*  action myself. Very last thing. Are we going to have an Abraham Accord expansion? Why do I keep [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=2906.56s)]
*  seeing tweets about that? Witkoff is teasing it. My guess, they're trying to work something with [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=2910.56s)]
*  the Saudis. They're trying to work something with the Syrians, to be honest. If the former lieutenant [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=2916.32s)]
*  of Al-Qaeda in Iraq recognizes the state of Israel before Saudi Arabia does, I will, I mean, yeah. [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=2922.24s)]
*  Welcome to the Middle East. We'll keep an eye on that. Michael Weiss, thank you as always. [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GClRh8RHzZU&t=2929.92s)]
