Video Description: Trump has moved public opinion against his own immigration policy platform by sending masked agents out to nab people off the street. So, Democrats should skip the last war, and instead push for laws requiring ICE agents to show their faces and wear their names on their badge. And another no-brainer for the midterms, in light of the Big Ugly Bill: they should also grab the green eyeshades and talk up the dangers from the debt and deficit. Plus, the electoral calculations behind slashing Medicaid, a Democratic primary draft for 2028, and what was Murkowski thinking?

# Is Trump Losing the Barstool Bros? (w/ Galen Druke)
**The Bulwark Podcast:** [July 02, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8)
*  I think that in aggressive, we're going to pass a law to make ICE agents show their face [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=0.0s)]
*  and put their names on it. And we're not going to deport anybody that hasn't committed any crimes. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=4.96s)]
*  Like I think there's a way to go at him that way aggressively for Democrats that is a winner, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=9.28s)]
*  not a vulnerability. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=14.64s)]
*  Hello and welcome to the Bollard podcast. I'm your host, Tim Miller. Delighted to welcome, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=23.12s)]
*  I think for the first time, host of the GD Politics podcast, also GD Politics on Substack. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=27.68s)]
*  Formerly hosted the FiveThirtyEight Politics pod and he's got a recent piece in the New York Times [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=34.4s)]
*  arguing the Democrats need their own Trump for 2028, but not in the way you're worried about. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=38.56s)]
*  It's Gale and Druke. What's up, man? [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=42.480000000000004s)]
*  Hey, how's it going? Thanks so much for having me. It's a pleasure. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=44.64s)]
*  It's going well. It's going well. I mean, I don't, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=47.36s)]
*  should you have just gone with the God damn America podcast? Are you a little concerned [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=51.28s)]
*  about the GD there? Whether that's sending the wrong signals to any, any potential Christian [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=56.0s)]
*  subscribers? Well, I thought of that, which is why I also purchased GoshDarnPolitics.com [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=62.56s)]
*  when I was setting up the site. So we have GDPolitics.com, Gale and DrukePolitics.com [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=69.36s)]
*  and GoshDarnPolitics.com because we're, we're an inclusive community, you know? [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=75.28s)]
*  Okay. GoshDarnPolitics. So that is, that is sweet. I think maybe I'm voting for that one. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=79.12s)]
*  We'll see how it goes. All right. I've got a bunch to talk to you about. I want to get eventually [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=84.24s)]
*  to that Trump article, which we agree with passionately, fervently, hence you coming on [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=88.64s)]
*  the pod, you know, because I want, I like to have passionate agreements with people. And so we'll [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=95.44s)]
*  get to that, but we got some new stuff we got to do first. So yesterday, since we taped yesterday's [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=99.44s)]
*  pod, the BBB, the one big, beautiful bill act, which is no longer called that actually, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=105.28s)]
*  Chuck Schumer got a big win. I don't know if you saw this in the Senate yesterday, he got a big win [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=111.28s)]
*  and he forced the Republicans to change the name of the bill. So big kudos to Chuck Schumer on that. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=115.44s)]
*  It's passed the Senate. It's going over to the House right now. You either said or wrote that [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=121.84s)]
*  this looks to be the least popular major legislation passed since at least 1990. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=128.48s)]
*  So I just want to start biggest picture before we get down into kind of the, the vote, the politics, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=133.92000000000002s)]
*  the vote itself, like why, why do you think it's so unpopular? Talk about that. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=139.36s)]
*  Yeah. So this was actually some analysis from Chris Warshaw at George Washington University, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=144.16000000000003s)]
*  who looked at the popularity of major legislation that's been passed since at least 1990. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=149.84s)]
*  And this looks to be the least popular, less popular things have been considered, like repealing [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=156.96s)]
*  the Affordable Care Act in 2017, that was less popular, but it failed and looking at [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=162.0s)]
*  social security privatization, where did we fit? Where did we fit on that? My boy. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=167.52s)]
*  Well, Tim, that didn't actually happen. So it wasn't included in the big legislation [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=171.20000000000002s)]
*  that got passed, but I have to imagine that somewhere near this and where this polls on average [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=175.68s)]
*  is about 25 percentage points underwater looking at four recent polls from reliable pollsters. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=182.96s)]
*  And so it's pretty bleak. And why is this happening? I think it's because this is an issue [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=190.24s)]
*  that Americans care increasingly about healthcare. It's also an issue that Republicans start with a [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=197.2s)]
*  deficit, where Republicans start with a deficit. You know, even throughout Joe Biden's unpopular [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=204.32s)]
*  presidency, Democrats still had an advantage on the issue of healthcare. And it's also an issue [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=208.72s)]
*  that's becoming increasingly salient. We see it moving up in the ranks of concerns for voters. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=214.32s)]
*  And unlike, I would say the Tax Cut and Jobs Act of 2017, that was quite unpopular when it passed, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=219.67999999999998s)]
*  the media moved on, Democrats kind of moved on and argued about other things. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=227.28s)]
*  This is the kind of story that if it ultimately gets signed into law, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=232.07999999999998s)]
*  sticks around because there's going to be stories about folks losing their health insurance. You [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=235.83999999999997s)]
*  know, there are projections that 10 million people will be put off Medicaid and that another 6 million [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=240.0s)]
*  or so might lose their subsidies through the Affordable Care Act. And that's not only something [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=245.83999999999997s)]
*  for Democrats to talk about, it's also something that the media is going to report on. And I'll [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=250.79999999999998s)]
*  just add here, as I'm spewing out all of these numbers, like the Yale Budget Lab did some [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=254.72s)]
*  rigorous work looking at how this shifts around funds for the American public. It found that the [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=259.84s)]
*  bottom 20% of Americans will end up with $700 less per year, if this becomes law, while the top 20% [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=266.48s)]
*  will end up with about 6,000 more. And if you break that top 20% down even more to like the [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=274.88s)]
*  0.1%, so people making over $3 million a year, they're going to get over $100,000 more a year [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=281.52s)]
*  when all is said and done. And so if you want to make an argument against the billionaires, [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=287.68s)]
*  against the oligarchy or whatever, and you're a Democrat, you were just handed a gift. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=292.32s)]
*  Yeah, so I guess my follow up is I've done a little Googling while you're talking and it feels like [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=296.71999999999997s)]
*  social security privatization was significantly more popular actually than this bill. So suck on [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=301.91999999999996s)]
*  that, Maga. I'm wondering, there was also some data come out that shows like, a lot of people [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=306.4s)]
*  don't actually know what's in this bill. So how do you kind of parse that? Like it's unpopularity [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=312.47999999999996s)]
*  with also the lack of familiarity. Yeah, so I think a couple things are going on. And to your [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=320.23999999999995s)]
*  point actually about social security privatization being more popular, in some ways, Republicans [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=326.0s)]
*  haven't even done the work to try to convince Americans that it's worth cutting Medicaid, [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=331.44s)]
*  right? Like in the Bush era, there would be some intellectual argument about how we need to make [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=336.16s)]
*  these programs solvent or why work requirements are actually a good thing. And by the way, [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=340.8s)]
*  when asked in abstraction, if there should be work requirements for Medicaid, a majority of [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=346.4s)]
*  Americans agree and a majority of Democrats even agree. And so in some ways, they've tried to do [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=352.15999999999997s)]
*  this in the dark of night, not really talking about it very much. And that may be to their [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=357.68s)]
*  deficit, because there are probably some areas where they could win over at least more Republicans, [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=363.04s)]
*  because even Republicans don't have the best view of this legislation at this point. It's like only [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=368.32000000000005s)]
*  two thirds that view it favorably. And when it comes to Americans not knowing much about it, [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=372.48s)]
*  I have seen, I've been watching the polling as this has all played out, increasingly Americans [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=378.72s)]
*  do know about it. So today, when you ask them, like, will this increase the deficit, [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=382.72s)]
*  a majority of Americans say yes. Who will this benefit the most? I was just looking at YouGov [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=387.52000000000004s)]
*  polling this morning, 57% of Americans say the wealthy when compared with other groups of [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=391.68s)]
*  Americans. And so I think that they have a general vibe. They might not know all of the [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=396.88000000000005s)]
*  provisions that affect green energy or the provisions that affect, I mean, I think people [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=402.96000000000004s)]
*  are also aware of the tax and sorry, the repealing a tax on tips to a certain extent. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=407.28s)]
*  But I think that they will probably learn more. And it's probably, I would say unlikely to get [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=414.32s)]
*  more popular. I want to get into the particular peculiarities of Lisa Murkowski, who did a very [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=419.59999999999997s)]
*  interesting podcast with recently and why she decided to become the tying and essentially [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=425.52s)]
*  tie breaking vote on the bill next. So like just putting her aside, what's your theory of the case [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=431.2s)]
*  on why they did this? Like they really didn't have to do this. Like they could have just extended [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=437.44s)]
*  the they could have done a two separate bills, one that was just border security, one that was [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=443.76s)]
*  just extending the Trump tax cuts, that would have also been bad on the deficit. But like, [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=448.15999999999997s)]
*  so was this. So you know what I mean? Like they could have just done popular stuff. Like that [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=453.11999999999995s)]
*  was an option to them. And that was something Donald Trump was pretty deft at in 2015, 2016, [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=458.55999999999995s)]
*  focusing on just doing things people like. So like, why don't you think they did that? [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=465.28000000000003s)]
*  Chris Well, the parties do have a problem with [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=469.28000000000003s)]
*  overinterpreting their mandates. If you'll remember, Joe Biden started off started off with, [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=473.44s)]
*  you know, a decent amount of popularity. And the idea was to do popular things. And quickly, [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=479.28000000000003s)]
*  they started also doing unpopular things. I mean, we don't have to rehash the whole thing. But [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=484.72s)]
*  on immigration and on inflation and things like that, he actually wasn't with the majority of [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=489.12s)]
*  Americans. And there was a backlash, which I expect to be the case here. And so on one hand, [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=494.32s)]
*  it's Trump overinterpreting his mandate and saying, I want to do this, I want to do that. And [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=500.0s)]
*  we'll put it all in one bill. It's also the Republican Party, you're intimately familiar [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=503.92s)]
*  with this, the Republican Party being drawn in different directions. So there are now the [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=508.71999999999997s)]
*  conservative populists like Josh Hawley, who say that they like Medicaid, although he voted for [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=513.52s)]
*  this bill, obviously. And then there are also the budget hawks like Rand Paul, who, you know, [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=518.0s)]
*  obviously didn't vote for this, but say that they're very concerned about the debt and deficit. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=524.08s)]
*  And so how do you both, you know, try to not explode the deficit so much, so you are going to [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=528.08s)]
*  cut benefits like Medicaid and SNAP benefits and also Affordable Care Act subsidies, but also [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=534.8s)]
*  try to, you know, be something of a conservative populist while also incorporating all of these [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=542.56s)]
*  promises that Trump made on the campaign, like no tax on tips, you know, no taxes on your interest [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=547.84s)]
*  payments for your car loan and the like. And what you end up with is something that kind of, [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=554.4s)]
*  I guess it accomplishes a little bit of each, but it also does quite a bad job on the deficit. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=561.0400000000001s)]
*  It does ultimately take away people's benefits. And ultimately, you know, the things that Trump [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=567.36s)]
*  said he wanted to do for folks like no tax on tips and the like will expire at the end of his turn. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=574.08s)]
*  Yeah, I just, I mean, like in a strange way, you don't, you hate to hand it to Bannon, [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=579.0400000000001s)]
*  but like the Bannon version of this bill would have been more popular, right? Like if they did, [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=584.32s)]
*  like not extending the top tax bracket and, you know, not doing as much on the benefit cuts. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=588.5600000000001s)]
*  And I don't know, maybe adding more money for like an alligator moat around all of the jails [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=596.64s)]
*  instead of just one. Like I think that kind of combination of policies feels like more popular [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=601.6s)]
*  than what they did. Yeah, I mean, that's what Susan Collins was pushing for as well. She tried to add [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=606.8000000000001s)]
*  an amendment that would bring the top tax rate back up to 39.5% from 37%, which I forgot to mention, [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=612.08s)]
*  if you want to do all those things that are priorities for different parts of the Republican [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=619.9200000000001s)]
*  party and then also not raise taxes on anyone, you're going to end up with something that kind [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=624.08s)]
*  of offends everybody in some way. Yeah. I think my theory of the case on this is, [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=631.12s)]
*  and part of this is just inertia and Trump want to get something done and it's stupid legislative. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=636.24s)]
*  It's like old night, you know, same problem with every legislature where everybody's trying to get [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=640.32s)]
*  a little bit of what they want. But I think maybe the fundamental sin is that like a shocking number [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=644.64s)]
*  of congressional Republicans believe their own bullshit when it comes to like them being [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=653.12s)]
*  fiscally responsible and the Democrats not being fiscally responsible. And so like they [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=659.12s)]
*  convince themselves that they have to do these cuts to maintain their self perception. You know, [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=664.64s)]
*  they don't, their identity as a fiscal hawk would be in doubt if they didn't do the cuts part of this. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=671.52s)]
*  And so they are going to kind of lop on these unpopular cuts to a bill that still is bigger [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=679.44s)]
*  than anything Biden did or Obama did as far as increasing the debt. Like I think that's [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=685.44s)]
*  like literally it. Like they fooled themselves into doing this. Yeah. I think there are [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=691.0400000000001s)]
*  plenty of people within the Republican party that believe in work requirements for Medicaid and [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=696.8800000000001s)]
*  reducing benefits. I should also say here that there is a cynical aspect to this, which is yes, [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=702.8800000000001s)]
*  we hear a lot about Trump doing better with lower income, lower education level voters, [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=708.24s)]
*  but Democrats still do quite well with the poorest people in America and then the upper middle class [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=713.92s)]
*  and wealthy in America. You know, Harris won outright the top income bracket that exit polls [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=719.76s)]
*  look at. And this is going to hurt most the people at the very bottom of the income ladder [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=725.12s)]
*  that actually Republicans don't rely on quite as much as they do the middle class, right? [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=732.24s)]
*  This is going to benefit the wealthy the most, but at least it's not going to have sort of the [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=737.28s)]
*  deepest negative impacts on the people who are the prime Trump voter. You know, everyone gets [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=742.48s)]
*  lumped into the working class here, but when we're talking about the working class, we're talking [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=748.88s)]
*  about people making, you know, 50, $60,000 a year. We're not talking about the people who are making, [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=752.08s)]
*  you know, according to this Yale budget lab, if you're in the bottom 20%, you're making very little [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=757.2s)]
*  money a year and you're seeing the deepest cuts and the most negative impact from this bill. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=762.24s)]
*  So there is, you know, there as Josh Hawley argued in the pages of the New York Times, [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=768.08s)]
*  there is some push within the Republican Party to care more about the worst off among us. But here, [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=773.76s)]
*  it seems like there may be some electoral calculations as well because what they weren't [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=780.96s)]
*  doing was slashing Medicare. Yeah, and that that's a good point. Well, and they also ended up [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=785.12s)]
*  do adding in a bunch for rural hospitals. I note that a huge chunk of money then goes to help [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=791.2s)]
*  support rural hospitals, which is needed and right. But nothing to help low income or hospitals in [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=796.96s)]
*  urban neighborhoods like that. That's like effort at sort of targeting your base versus the other [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=803.6800000000001s)]
*  sides. Speaking of efforts to do that Lisa Murkowski. So you talked to her at an opportune time. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=810.8000000000001s)]
*  When was like a week ago, two weeks ago? Time is what cycle she ends up being like the vote that [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=817.9200000000001s)]
*  is needed here to get to 50. The Republicans could only lose three. They have lost Paul Tillis and [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=824.4s)]
*  Collins. And and so Murkowski was kind of the teetering vote at the last second. She ends up [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=832.24s)]
*  supporting it extremely reluctantly. In a very unusual post positive vote interview, she says [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=838.9599999999999s)]
*  that she thinks it's a bad bill. It's going to hurt people. So I we're going to psychoanalyze [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=846.88s)]
*  that next. But I want to play just a little bit from your interview with her where there you're [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=852.96s)]
*  there. You ask her specifically about kind of this carve out for Alaska. Is this something where you [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=856.96s)]
*  could get to yes for this if there was a waiver for Alaska on those Medicaid provisions? Or do [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=863.2s)]
*  you think there are other places in America like the situation you've described in Alaska? Well, [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=869.9200000000001s)]
*  I think I think that there are other pockets where again you have you have limited economic [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=874.32s)]
*  opportunity right in some of our really rural areas. And and and and so again it's that's one [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=881.2s)]
*  example is work requirements. And I'm trying to trying to be specific because I think it helps [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=888.88s)]
*  people. I I'm not saying Alaska needs to be carved out of everything. What I'm saying is is I've got [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=893.2800000000001s)]
*  to have some some flexibility. I have to have some appreciation that not all states are are equal in [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=900.8000000000001s)]
*  terms of of of how you're able to implement. What did you make about? I obviously you asked [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=907.92s)]
*  her that question. So you kind of felt like this was coming. I just kind of look at it and it's [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=913.8399999999999s)]
*  like it's kind of a small cut in the grand scheme of things. I don't know. It's not like Alaska got [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=918.64s)]
*  something like avoided getting punished. Right. And so I don't know. What would you make about [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=924.0799999999999s)]
*  her kind of making the decision to vote for this after after some of those changes? Yeah, honestly [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=930.0799999999999s)]
*  at the end of my conversation with Lisa Murkowski, I thought she's a yes for this bill because she [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=936.08s)]
*  was pretty clear that she'd been working with her caucus, with leadership, with the White House, [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=942.4000000000001s)]
*  pursuing things that she wanted to pursue. And I mean a big priority for Murkowski is you know [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=948.8000000000001s)]
*  energy resource production in Alaska, which ended up I believe being part of this bill. Although [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=954.4000000000001s)]
*  things were getting added and subtracted at the last minute. So I'm not 100% sure on that. But [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=960.08s)]
*  Murkowski is somebody who said all along that I'm out here for Alaska. And she repeated that again [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=965.68s)]
*  and again in the interview. And so ultimately I think she felt that she got what she wanted. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=970.7199999999999s)]
*  And because there were so many carve outs made and so many sort of concessions in some ways made for [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=977.4399999999999s)]
*  Alaska in this bill, at least that they considered, probably she would have lost a lot of faith amongst [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=985.3599999999999s)]
*  her colleagues if at the end of all of that she voted no. And so you get this situation where she [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=991.68s)]
*  feels like she has something good for Alaska, but then she comes out and says I don't think this is [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=997.3599999999999s)]
*  a good bill for America. So what we can say is that's probably not the greatest political strategy [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=1001.04s)]
*  to get folks to you know admire the work that you're doing necessarily. And so in some ways, [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=1006.56s)]
*  like she's being honest. She said I'm here to represent Alaska and I got what I wanted for [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=1014.16s)]
*  Alaska and so I voted yes. You kind of landed there then on the two-pronged rationale for a decision, [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=1018.64s)]
*  which is the Alaska focus and the brand which she was very adamant about in your discussion. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=1025.44s)]
*  But also the social, like literally it's high school cafeteria stuff a little bit. Like she does [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=1034.72s)]
*  have relationships with Thune and with like the leadership in a way that maybe she wouldn't with [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=1040.16s)]
*  some of the more recent MAGA guys in the caucus. And I think felt like she had an obligation to [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=1046.0s)]
*  like work with them in good faith or whatever. Yeah, I mean I think they knew from the jump that [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=1052.32s)]
*  they needed her vote and the way to do it was to put positive things in the bill for Alaska. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=1057.12s)]
*  And they that's you know when we talked it was you know about two weeks ago at this point, [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=1063.68s)]
*  it was clear that they had been working on this for a while and she had raised plenty of issues [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=1071.28s)]
*  regarding Alaska that were being considered. And she said in the interview, you know they have to [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=1075.9199999999998s)]
*  consider my concerns for Alaska because they need my vote to pass this bill. And so I think that was [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=1081.2s)]
*  an open part of this whole negotiation from the jump. You were like during that there's another [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=1087.76s)]
*  section of the interview which I played last week which was kind of this question of you know whether [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=1094.3999999999999s)]
*  she might be interested in forging some kind of coalition government with Democrats or with other [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=1100.72s)]
*  independent you know types depending on how things go off in the midterms. You were like a dog with [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=1107.2s)]
*  a bone on that question that went on for like seven minutes. So I could only play a little clip of it [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=1112.8s)]
*  on this podcast. But what would you make about that whole exchange and how do you look at it now [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=1117.92s)]
*  like after seeing kind of how the last week has played out? You know to her credit she could have [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=1125.04s)]
*  just said no and ended the conversation. So at the very least I think she tries to be honest when [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=1131.68s)]
*  she's answering questions which is if this is something she would ever consider. She didn't say [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=1138.3200000000002s)]
*  flat out no which is what led to a conversation that I think it was even longer than that because [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=1142.72s)]
*  I first started by asking if she would ever consider being unaligned or independent and then [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=1147.04s)]
*  I said okay well if Democrats win three seats in the Senate at the midterms and they need a fourth [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=1152.8799999999999s)]
*  in order to have a majority would you ever consider caucusing with them if once again [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=1157.44s)]
*  if you could they promised that you could pass good legislation on behalf of Alaskans. And she [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=1161.76s)]
*  could have just said no I'm a Republican I'm going to stay this way. But the conversation kept going [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=1166.72s)]
*  for about 10 minutes which tells me it is something that she has considered. It's not a secret that I [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=1171.12s)]
*  think she has pretty you know I'm going to speak in like memeable language here but deep reservations [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=1176.96s)]
*  with the Republican party. And she talks at length in her book which is why she was doing these [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=1182.08s)]
*  interviews about places where she's broken with her party and her reactions to January 6th and [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=1188.08s)]
*  her concerns for her own security. There are people who are spending who are spending time [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=1193.28s)]
*  behind bars because of threatening her. And so I think that she doesn't necessarily and she said [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=1197.76s)]
*  in the interview itself it's no secret that my party has rejected me or something along [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=1204.16s)]
*  those lines has not embraced me I think she said. And so there's obvious discomfort there. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=1210.8000000000002s)]
*  You know she says that also she doesn't like Democratic policy. I think you aired that clip [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=1216.4s)]
*  with Nicole last week. And I think that that's probably also true. And so we're dealing with [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=1220.4s)]
*  somebody I think oftentimes we look at these folks in Washington and they're super cynical and they're [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=1227.76s)]
*  egotistical and they're kind of like unlikable people. I think she's truly conflicted. You know [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=1231.84s)]
*  I think that she is not a cynical politician. I think that in some ways she's got a lot of [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=1238.24s)]
*  feelings. She wants to represent Alaska and she oftentimes lands in places that piss off Republicans [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=1244.8s)]
*  and she oftentimes lands in places that piss off Democrats. And it works for her in Alaska in some [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=1250.6399999999999s)]
*  ways because of the electoral system that they have there with open primaries and then a rank [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=1255.04s)]
*  choice voting system in the general. But I would imagine that under any other system she'd be booted. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=1259.04s)]
*  And maybe the answer to that is that like she's conflicted and she's working through it because [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=1263.84s)]
*  part of it comes to the question of and please take this in the greatest spirit in which it's [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=1267.92s)]
*  intended because I love and honor the GD politics podcast. But it's like the fact that she's doing [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=1272.3999999999999s)]
*  that interview I mean I don't know maybe you're just pals with the chief of staff or something [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=1279.12s)]
*  but like she does she's not coming on my podcast. She's not really going on MAGA podcasts. Right? [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=1282.48s)]
*  You know what I mean? Like she isn't she doesn't have a natural you know usually if you're a [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=1288.4s)]
*  politician that's selling a book right you would find the podcast that fits your natural constituency [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=1293.52s)]
*  and you would go on that because you figure that the listeners would really like you. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=1299.68s)]
*  You know what I mean? Like if Abigail Spanberger was doing a book next year she's going to come [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=1303.2800000000002s)]
*  on the Bulwark podcast because she figures people will like her. Like she doesn't have that right? [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=1307.3600000000001s)]
*  And so she like I guess my question is like who is she trying to reach? [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=1313.12s)]
*  The GD politics podcast listeners? I mean I struggle with that myself. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=1318.24s)]
*  I am trying to reach statistical nerds you know cross tab divers. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=1323.12s)]
*  Well you know in a world where everyone sort of retreats to their partisan corners I struggle [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=1329.84s)]
*  with that too because the work that I do and have done for the past decade is not really about [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=1334.96s)]
*  sort of telling people what they should think or you know sort of sharing my moral values [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=1339.76s)]
*  necessarily with folks. It's more just saying this is the world as it is. There are parts of it that [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=1346.64s)]
*  you'll probably like. There are parts of it that you probably won't like and you know hopefully we [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=1351.28s)]
*  can go along on this ride together and and have a sense of humor you know where appropriate along [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=1355.44s)]
*  the way and it is a tricky space to occupy in an era when it's just way easier to find your tribe [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=1360.64s)]
*  and kind of celebrate with them and so in some ways I understand that sort of tricky in between. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=1367.68s)]
*  It's easy to end up pissing a lot of people off or providing opium to no one and you know Lord knows. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=1373.92s)]
*  Yeah that's true. That's true. Hey who doesn't? We honor that here too. Or she could go hang out [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=1378.16s)]
*  with Elon. Elon's trying to start a new party and you know it's kind of like the ketamine and [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=1384.5600000000002s)]
*  deficit hawk party and they could add on Alaska drilling to that and boom there we go. You might [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=1390.0800000000002s)]
*  have a ticket. I guess the interesting thing I guess just finally closing on the Murkowski thing [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=1397.12s)]
*  which is I'm wondering what you made of it is like she's not up until 28. I guess the argument [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=1403.28s)]
*  against for her to going the coalition government route that you guys were talking about is like why [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=1408.32s)]
*  she ends up voting for this bill. Like she thinks that she can get what she wants out of John Thune [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=1414.0s)]
*  and that like working the inside game with that is a workable path for her right now and so she [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=1418.3999999999999s)]
*  doesn't need to blow it all up you know over her feelings about you know the ICE police state that [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=1424.48s)]
*  we're gonna run. Yeah I think that it's probably less likely at this point in this very moment [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=1431.28s)]
*  that Democrats feel like they want her on their team but people have a short memory in politics [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=1441.3600000000001s)]
*  and folks are going to move on and there's going to be another vote and if Murkowski wants to you [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=1448.4s)]
*  know at the end of the day Murkowski has an awful lot of power in Washington and if she wants to [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=1455.6000000000001s)]
*  maintain that power in a different environment remaining the gettable vote is a good way to do [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=1462.5600000000002s)]
*  that and I don't think it's you know given how she's voted in different ways it's probably not [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=1469.8400000000001s)]
*  entirely worthless for Democrats to try to pursue some moderate Republicans here and there and [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=1476.24s)]
*  obviously they were successful in doing that during the Biden administration and so in a [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=1481.04s)]
*  future administration especially look you know the piece that I wrote in the New York Times that [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=1485.68s)]
*  we're going to discuss a big piece of it was like okay I think Democrats can win future presidential [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=1490.0s)]
*  elections by being top to bottom partisans because they'll rely on mediocre candidates from [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=1496.56s)]
*  Republicans and what we've seen over the past decade is kind of a race to the bottom in terms [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=1502.48s)]
*  of candidate quality for you know these national presidential elections but if Democrats want to [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=1506.08s)]
*  have any kind of meaningful majority in order to legislate they got to win majorities in the [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=1513.9199999999998s)]
*  Senate too and so you either have to sort of put together a policy platform that appeals to Americans [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=1518.3999999999999s)]
*  in states that are currently been written off or you have to pursue folks like Lisa Murkowski [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=1526.08s)]
*  and both of those are probably unappealing to top to bottom partisans but that's the world that we [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=1531.36s)]
*  live in. Well let's just do it let's just get into that because the the Dems need a new the core of [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=1537.84s)]
*  the Dems need a new Trump argument that you made in the Times is speaking about national politics [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=1542.56s)]
*  and I do want to close with some commentary on the draft you did about the Democratic nominee in 2028 [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=1548.6399999999999s)]
*  and I have some negative feedback for you on that but like while it's true about the national [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=1554.32s)]
*  political presidential candidates the argument you're making I think it's also true about [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=1560.32s)]
*  Democrats in the Senate and essentially I'm going to make the short of the argument then you can [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=1565.12s)]
*  kind of expand on it when you say Dems need a new Trump you're talking about the fact that Trump [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=1569.84s)]
*  like took heterodox positions in in both directions right like he came in and offered the Republican [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=1574.0s)]
*  base a lot of red meat when it came to immigration and issues such as that but then he also like [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=1581.2s)]
*  hedged to the middle if you want to call it that on other things like social security privatization [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=1587.68s)]
*  which you mentioned earlier like the wars right and that the Democrats haven't really had a lot [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=1594.96s)]
*  of candidates that have tried that and that could be a successful recipe so anyway is that a good [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=1601.6000000000001s)]
*  summary of the argument and expand on that? They haven't had a lot of candidates try that at least [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=1608.16s)]
*  not recently and I should say that another important piece of what Trump did was [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=1613.04s)]
*  at the time that he ran the Republican party was very unpopular about as unpopular as the [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=1618.4s)]
*  Democratic party is today now listen the Republican party is also unpopular today but it is more [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=1622.48s)]
*  popular than the Democratic party and so he was dealing with a pretty disillusioned electorate [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=1627.04s)]
*  primary electorate and he ran pretty aggressively against the Republican party and so that's another [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=1633.2s)]
*  piece of this I think that ambitious Democrats should consider trying to break with an unpopular [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=1638.0s)]
*  Democratic party by running against it sort of showing I'm going to be a different type of [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=1643.44s)]
*  Democrat and here's the evidence I'm not one of the Democrats that you've become familiar with [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=1648.96s)]
*  during the Trump era the Biden era the Hillary Clinton campaign etc. Yeah let me just add on [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=1654.16s)]
*  this point on Trump because just in the Trump nature like Trump didn't just run against the [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=1658.96s)]
*  unpopular Republican party he was withering in a way that like and that was part of why a lot of [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=1663.44s)]
*  people didn't think it was going to work like myself included right I was like I believed that [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=1669.04s)]
*  you could run as whatever a nationalist far-right Republican deep populist guy and win I got that [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=1673.6000000000001s)]
*  person probably would have won in 2012 if they were a good candidate I was skeptical of Trump [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=1680.56s)]
*  in 2016 because I didn't believe you could do that and like go after these like what you had [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=1685.1200000000001s)]
*  thought would be sacred cows of the fox watchers like you know people that had George Bush broaches [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=1690.56s)]
*  an elephant you know paraphernalia around their house wouldn't vote for somebody that like [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=1697.52s)]
*  actively shit on that legacy but that was wrong like he you know he didn't just kind of [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=1701.9199999999998s)]
*  run away from the Republican party he ran at it in a very aggressive way and you think that that [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=1707.76s)]
*  that same type thing could work here look and maybe he didn't have those people necessarily [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=1713.84s)]
*  early on he was winning those early primaries with 30 some percent of the vote but clearly those [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=1718.64s)]
*  people could still get on board and one thing about you know public opinion is on issues that [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=1722.72s)]
*  are uncontested you don't really know where the public lands so if you had polled in 2015 what [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=1730.0800000000002s)]
*  do you think of George W Bush what do you think of John McCain what do you think of Mitt Romney [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=1735.0400000000002s)]
*  Republicans would have said oh you know great you know today Democrats 75 percent of Democrats which [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=1738.4s)]
*  is still you know comparatively low we'll say that they have a favorable view of Biden but if somebody [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=1743.0400000000002s)]
*  starts trashing those things that you are kind of inspired by you find charismatic you might change [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=1748.48s)]
*  your opinion and so I think a lot of folks who had been sort of along the ride for the ride with the [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=1752.72s)]
*  Republican party did change their minds once Trump came onto the scene and made that pitch [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=1758.16s)]
*  and look I think that part of the argument here is you have to try to win look I started by saying [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=1764.24s)]
*  that both parties are unpopular in America today and so when you're running in a competitive [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=1770.88s)]
*  election for folks in deep red or deep blue seats you can tune this out you want to run to the extremes [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=1777.76s)]
*  if that's what floats your boat I guess go for it the primary electorate's going to keep you know [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=1784.0s)]
*  putting you back into office but if you want to win in a part of America that's actually competitive [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=1788.64s)]
*  one of the best ways to do it is to not be seen as fully one thing or the other not fully Republican [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=1793.6s)]
*  not fully Democrat but something else and Trump was able to do that by the time voters went to [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=1799.12s)]
*  the polls in 2016 they viewed him as the less extreme of the two options despite the fact that [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=1804.64s)]
*  he had taken extreme positions throughout the campaign and they saw him as less conservative [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=1809.2s)]
*  than any Republican nominee going back to George H.W. Bush which is as far back as the data went [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=1813.2800000000002s)]
*  and you know we haven't seen a Democrat try this recently but we have seen Democrats do this I mean [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=1820.0800000000002s)]
*  I mentioned in the piece Bill Clinton who you know Democrats were very disillusioned when he came onto [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=1826.48s)]
*  the scene if you'll remember Mario Cuomo didn't even run in that primary because he thought it was [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=1832.16s)]
*  so fated for George H.W. Bush to win re-election and you know he had his moments where he broke [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=1837.2s)]
*  with the Democratic Party and then he also ran to the right on crime and the debt and deficit and [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=1843.28s)]
*  he ran to the left on health care he was also a very charismatic person who was able to bring [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=1847.6000000000001s)]
*  people along for the ride I mean Obama as well we think of him now as like the most establishment [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=1852.16s)]
*  figure in the Democratic Party but at the time he was running against the establishment he you know [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=1856.24s)]
*  was running against Hillary Clinton on her Iraq war vote he was uh well he was to the left on that [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=1861.04s)]
*  he was actually to the right of Clinton on health care for example and and then also talked a lot [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=1866.48s)]
*  about sort of putting partisanship to the side and rising above the fray and that is one of the [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=1871.92s)]
*  best ways to win over sort of marginal persuadable voters uh is by saying oh that negative caricature [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=1878.32s)]
*  that you think of when you think of a Democrat that negative caricature that you think of when [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=1885.92s)]
*  you think of a Republican I'm neither of those things I have you know these sensible popular [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=1889.2s)]
*  policy positions that I will pursue on behalf of you and sort of try to cut the partisanship out [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=1895.8400000000001s)]
*  of it in this piece in particular some positions I mentioned that a plausible candidate could take [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=1901.68s)]
*  and again the issue landscape will change between now and when this becomes applicable but is [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=1907.76s)]
*  something like you know run pretty heartily to the left on health care and move to the right on [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=1911.52s)]
*  immigration in particular border security run to the left on housing and run to the right on the [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=1916.64s)]
*  debt and deficit that may not sound coherent to a top to bottom partisan but again the marginal [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=1921.1200000000001s)]
*  gettable swingable moderate people who code as moderate have you know views that don't [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=1927.3600000000001s)]
*  fit one party top to bottom yeah I want to hear a couple of models for what you think might look [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=1934.64s)]
*  it look like in a senate race because I think that the senate race is a little different than [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=1939.3600000000001s)]
*  a presidential race in particular because for Democrats to win a marginal senate race you're [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=1943.28s)]
*  trying to win the marginal voter in Iowa that's what we're talking about right now really we're [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=1947.68s)]
*  not talking about the Maine or North Carolina race we're talking about how do the Democrats win [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=1951.28s)]
*  senate seats outside of the purple states so that I think that Democrats still haven't been able to [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=1954.8799999999999s)]
*  do in Maine over the past decade right good point but I'm just saying that like you could probably [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=1959.2s)]
*  win a Maine with a more traditional type of campaign with some caveat supply in Iowa you're [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=1963.28s)]
*  going to have to do something different right and so it's a little bit different on the on a senate [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=1968.24s)]
*  race than an international campaign but on a national campaign like I don't know if like [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=1972.56s)]
*  looking at the Democrats need a Trump model I think that somebody could win a Democratic primary [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=1977.36s)]
*  in 2028 like being absolutely the most withering person possible about how awful the Republicans [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=1983.44s)]
*  are and just being absolutely against not just Donald Trump but JD Vance Mike John you know but [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=1992.32s)]
*  they're the BBB just a withering attack on their policies while also taking very weird positions [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=1999.6s)]
*  like against the Democrats on like any series of issues like literally you could pick the buckets [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=2006.0s)]
*  could be fucking AI you know it could be phones could be schools like you know you could do [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=2011.36s)]
*  you could do a bunch of different stuff do you think that's right like do you think it's about [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=2016.56s)]
*  affect like being like you win over the partisans by by being you know like Trump was good at [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=2021.04s)]
*  fighting the other side and then you went over the moderate voters with a couple of random issues [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=2029.12s)]
*  or do you think that it has to be policy based so I think you bring up a very important point [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=2034.0s)]
*  which is that voters cast ballots based on a lot of things that have nothing to do with policy [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=2039.76s)]
*  because campaigns oftentimes get waged over policy policy is one way talking about how you talk about [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=2045.9199999999998s)]
*  policy is one way to communicate information about yourself beyond just what you might do in office [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=2051.8399999999997s)]
*  because remember Donald Trump didn't do a lot of this stuff once in office it was mostly about [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=2057.84s)]
*  telling people what kind of person he was and it's it's right that you bring up that he didn't just [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=2062.48s)]
*  attack the Republican Party he spent a ton of time also attacking the Democratic Party the media the [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=2068.32s)]
*  left all you know so I'm not saying here that this sort of Democratic Trump who again to be clear I'm [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=2073.44s)]
*  not talking about violence better than democratic norms or you know attacking institutions I'm [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=2080.7200000000003s)]
*  talking more about this this triangulation sort of thing is somebody who would you know heartily [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=2085.52s)]
*  attack the Republican Party well Federman is just the example of this just really quick like we'll [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=2090.8s)]
*  look at what Federman has done the last year like he's only he's he's run against the Democratic Party [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=2094.88s)]
*  but then only like you almost never hear him talking about how terrible or and he does from [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=2099.92s)]
*  time to time but like he doesn't do it in a way that gets attention like his provocations are all [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=2105.12s)]
*  aimed left like I don't think that that is that what will work like it has to be you have to have [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=2110.72s)]
*  provocations aiming right and and left yeah and especially during the primary you focus on [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=2116.56s)]
*  the red meat to your base and so for Trump that was immigration but for this person I don't know [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=2123.68s)]
*  if AOC would ever take right positions on some of these things or say it's Josh Shapiro or whatever [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=2130.3999999999996s)]
*  you talk a lot about a public option you talk a lot about how health care is broken and Republicans [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=2135.3599999999997s)]
*  have broken it even further and you really get people riled up believing in you on that issue [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=2139.52s)]
*  and also maybe bring up some issues that aren't fully polarized fully partisanized like housing [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=2144.88s)]
*  for example and you know talk about affordability there you also sort of the Democratic Party is [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=2150.4s)]
*  unpopular and Joe Biden's presidency wasn't particularly popular so there are a lot of [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=2158.4s)]
*  opportunities to create those differences create those distinctions by just attacking what's [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=2162.4s)]
*  already been done that's unpopular and you know you don't have to probably go as far as Donald [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=2167.44s)]
*  Trump did in 2015 2016 but again you're right that it's not just policy it's also charisma it's also [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=2174.2400000000002s)]
*  celebrity and it's authenticity right and you know for Donald Trump being that kind of brash [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=2181.12s)]
*  off the cuff whatever kind of person was authentic to him I think that whoever Democrats field it'll [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=2191.68s)]
*  be important that the path that they take is authentic to them so when thinking about this [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=2198.08s)]
*  strategy it's harder for somebody like Pete Buttigieg who was part of the Biden administration [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=2202.7200000000003s)]
*  or somebody like Gavin Newsom who has become at least was something of a poster child for the [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=2208.0s)]
*  Democratic Party to then go and like run against the Democratic Party it would probably be easier [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=2212.32s)]
*  for a lesser known person like a Josh Shapiro like an Andy Beshear somebody like that to make [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=2217.76s)]
*  like I'm not saying that those are necessarily the the strongest candidates for Democrats in [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=2224.48s)]
*  2028 I think in some many ways time will tell the issue landscape will change exactly how unpopular [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=2229.92s)]
*  Donald Trump is and the specific areas in which he fails or succeeds are yet to be seen entirely [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=2236.6400000000003s)]
*  um but I think your right to point out that authenticity charisma celebrity even just get it [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=2243.12s)]
*  going viral can mean an awful lot you you keep trying to drag me into the 2028 hot stove discussion [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=2249.6s)]
*  and we are saving it for dessert okay that is saved I have three other topics I want to get to [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=2256.16s)]
*  so just as leaning in on the Senate for example the Democrats are gonna and we I talked about this [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=2261.68s)]
*  a glacius a couple weeks ago if the Democrats are gonna have any kind of majority where they can do [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=2267.68s)]
*  anything in the Senate they have to win in places like Texas and Iowa this time like there's just no [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=2271.76s)]
*  other like even if they sweep all of the blue and purple states I think that their ceiling is like [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=2279.6000000000004s)]
*  54 or 53 or maybe 52 even I don't have in front of me but it's like not a not a high number of [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=2284.7200000000003s)]
*  centers well Tim let me I'll do the math fee they got to win four seats in order to win the majority [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=2289.84s)]
*  in the Senate their top pickup especially now with Tom Taylor's retiring is North Carolina [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=2294.2400000000002s)]
*  their second best opportunity is Maine with Susan Collins up for reelection although that has eluded [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=2300.88s)]
*  them for a decade then after that it is take your pick but states that Democrats have not done well [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=2306.56s)]
*  and it's Iowa it's Texas it's Alaska those are probably their best options from there I don't [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=2313.76s)]
*  know maybe Kansas those are probably their best options from there and then they also have to [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=2320.8s)]
*  defend some of their seats you know in Michigan on the lakes okay so yeah I was I was I meant more [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=2324.8s)]
*  like long-term like if you're like playing like playing this out into the future if the Democrats [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=2330.6400000000003s)]
*  also want to like have a governing majority you know because you don't have a chance to win the [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=2334.5600000000004s)]
*  Pennsylvania seat back for six years or whatever but like if you play it out a decade even if you [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=2339.1200000000003s)]
*  win all the blue and purple seats now like the ceiling is still very low like there's not there's [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=2342.96s)]
*  there's there's not a lot of seats to pick up there um you have McCormick you got Ron Johnson [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=2347.92s)]
*  you know just a couple so then the question for you is like what does a candidate look like that [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=2353.44s)]
*  wins in in Texas and Iowa and I want to put aside the caveat that you know we lost 30,000 jobs last [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=2358.08s)]
*  month maybe we go into a great depression by next October and the Democrats don't have to do anything [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=2364.88s)]
*  and they accidentally win a couple senate seats but so like let's put the exogenous event aside [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=2370.2400000000002s)]
*  like what is a Democrat that would even have a chance for you in Texas or Alaska or Iowa or Kansas [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=2375.68s)]
*  what that would call I I think it's probably the mold that I mentioned so what is Americans biggest [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=2382.08s)]
*  concern today it's still the economy and the cost of living and so you want to present probably [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=2389.6s)]
*  more progressive policies on something like that which I know we're holding off the Zoran [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=2397.44s)]
*  Mamdani conversation oh that's next it's coming up next but you probably present like run something [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=2401.84s)]
*  of a of a single issue campaign on the things that Americans care most about while also I think [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=2409.12s)]
*  pivoting on some of the areas where Democrats have been least popular I think in a place like Texas [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=2416.24s)]
*  in particular border security I mean that was one of Joe Biden's worst issues it was pretty clear to [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=2422.0s)]
*  people I think at this point that those were policy choices that exacerbated the migrant crisis and so [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=2427.7599999999998s)]
*  sort of letting that be known I don't know if you want to touch this stove [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=2434.88s)]
*  but there are even plenty of arguments that the American rescue plan was significantly too large [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=2438.16s)]
*  and inflationary in its own right I mean by the end of 2021 the San Francisco Fed had concluded [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=2443.04s)]
*  that it added three percentage points to annualized inflation and so there are areas where you know [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=2447.7599999999998s)]
*  Democrats have fallen down on the issues that Americans care most about and I think by breaking [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=2456.0s)]
*  with the party or even just giving voice to it like I know that Pete Buttigieg is trying to do [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=2461.68s)]
*  this in places where he's like oh we kept schools closed too long and the like but saying you know [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=2466.56s)]
*  Democrats fucked up here and there I think to a Texas audience is going to buy you a lot of [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=2472.88s)]
*  credibility with folks who might not naturally be in your corner and then in addition to that sort of [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=2478.48s)]
*  juicing enthusiasm boosting enthusiasm by talking a lot about the most important issues like cost of [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=2485.04s)]
*  living I think that you're not even thinking big enough I think you just lost by five points in Texas [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=2490.72s)]
*  all right with your candidate I don't I mean I don't think that there's a great answer to this [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=2498.24s)]
*  but like I think that if you do what you're the playbook you just laid out and you have a really [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=2502.9599999999996s)]
*  heavy focused on cost of living that's as a candidate and that's your number one issue [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=2507.9199999999996s)]
*  and that goes from health care to housing to all that and if there's some populist economics in [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=2512.56s)]
*  there like that's fine but like to pair with that like you need to like own a gun store or [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=2516.8s)]
*  or like be actively like have some have a view a passionate view about a cultural issue [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=2525.1200000000003s)]
*  where you think the left is really wrong and like that and that's not just like a random thing you [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=2533.04s)]
*  mentioned sometimes but that's like the second most important thing that you talk about and [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=2538.4s)]
*  when you ask people in Texas like what do you know about this person it's like well they want [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=2544.1600000000003s)]
*  to make cost of living better and they also really care about trans sports being only only boys and [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=2548.88s)]
*  girls I don't I could get this is why I would not be a good candidate for this because I'm a cultural [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=2554.48s)]
*  lib but like I don't I think you have to be a hard cultural pivot away from the Democrats on something [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=2558.6400000000003s)]
*  yeah and I think that's probably in a place like Texas on immigration now it's not sort of how you [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=2564.56s)]
*  necessarily treat people who are already in the country who came in illegally but more how you [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=2570.56s)]
*  deal with the border I think that probably the trans issue gets over played a little bit in the [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=2575.36s)]
*  role that it played in 2024 it's a clearly an 80 20 issue the Democrats have been on the wrong side [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=2580.96s)]
*  of this but it's just not a salient issue Americans don't care that much about it's a signaling thing [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=2586.32s)]
*  it's a signature thing you have to figure out something to signal to people that you are not [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=2592.08s)]
*  like one of the elite libs that they don't like and so and something like that it's like that would [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=2596.56s)]
*  just be a signaling and Americans care a lot more about immigration and it's also the two parties [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=2600.96s)]
*  have become highly distinguished on that issue and so breaking with your own party on that I think [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=2606.7999999999997s)]
*  would also accomplish the same thing well actually let's do the immigration thing because I think the [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=2612.7999999999997s)]
*  immigration part is complicated so I'm about to argue against myself a little bit and and maybe [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=2616.88s)]
*  not really because I think the thing might be different if you're if you're an Iowa Senate [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=2623.04s)]
*  candidate in 2026 and if you're a Democratic presidential candidate in 2028 it's different [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=2626.48s)]
*  for a variety of reasons but I feel like the immigration issue is going to become so salient [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=2630.48s)]
*  over the next year and a half that it is going to become very hard for Democrats to zag towards [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=2637.6s)]
*  Trump on it in a way that makes sense like I think they could have done that with effect in 2022 [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=2644.8s)]
*  zag against Biden by saying we needed to be harder on on the border but being but but trying to do it [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=2651.44s)]
*  in a way that triangulates between what Trump is going to do and and whatever what some Democratic [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=2657.44s)]
*  policy would be I think is going to be very challenging and and I just I want to use one [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=2664.4s)]
*  example of this I play every clip of this that I find but in the Manosphere recently we've had [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=2668.08s)]
*  Andrew Schultz saying he's uncomfortable with what's happening with immigration we've had Rogan [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=2673.44s)]
*  saying what's he's uncomfortable with what's happening with immigration here is a Barstool [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=2677.12s)]
*  sports podcast that I was listening to earlier this week and I want to play it I totally flipped [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=2681.8399999999997s)]
*  on immigration oh okay I guess 100% so for years I thought if you're not here legally you shouldn't [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=2686.24s)]
*  be here at all I flipped I think the people who are working the people who are paying taxes [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=2697.2s)]
*  those people should be able to stay okay and the other people who are doing bad things we need to [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=2702.64s)]
*  find those people and get them out okay so seems well reasoned yeah you know why my thoughts [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=2706.64s)]
*  switched on immigration well I was talking to my girlfriend in bed one night and she knows I'm [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=2711.68s)]
*  I'm a little right she knows that and uh she was like um just talking she's like can we talk I was [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=2715.92s)]
*  like yeah sure she's like this is fucked up like what's up talk to me she goes they explained to me [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=2721.52s)]
*  you know you know how our family got here all that stuff and I was like you know what you might be [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=2727.3599999999997s)]
*  right oh wow you might be right because there are people here who work very hard in pay taxes [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=2731.28s)]
*  and they should be able to live in America shout out to Jersey Jerry's girlfriend uh not giving [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=2737.44s)]
*  out blowjobs until he switches on immigration I guess but um that was him with Big Cat on Barstool [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=2742.6400000000003s)]
*  yeah I like talk uh very enticing pillow talk I don't know man I like talk about the immigration [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=2748.0800000000004s)]
*  polling I think that I think that sometimes the Democrats are fighting the last war on this one [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=2754.7200000000003s)]
*  and I think that the uh the divide on immigration is going to be less about the border and more [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=2760.08s)]
*  about wire wire masked agents nabbing people off the streets in a free country yeah let me throw out [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=2765.6s)]
*  one other thing that I just remembered while we were listening to that that I do mention in the [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=2772.0s)]
*  piece is another way you can signal sort of your openness to non-fully partisan ideas is the debt [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=2775.68s)]
*  like every 15 years the debt and deficit takes on a new role in electoral politics and people [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=2784.3199999999997s)]
*  start talking about it again I think especially after this recent you know tax and spending bill [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=2789.76s)]
*  voters are I think primed to hear an argument about how the debt and deficit are too big and [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=2796.5600000000004s)]
*  it's not natural territory for Democrats but if they want to be the people who do that I think [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=2801.28s)]
*  that could help them to significant effect in the places that you mentioned like Texas, Iowa, Alaska, [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=2805.28s)]
*  and the like and it's also finally a bulwark Democrat a green eye shade bulwark Democrat running [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=2810.32s)]
*  and and if only do we have any contributors live in Iowa we got to move Amanda Carpenter out of [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=2817.92s)]
*  West Virginia and just see where she can run now look pretty much everyone who runs on the debt [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=2822.32s)]
*  and deficit doesn't actually do anything about it but it is a way to also fight the establishment [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=2826.96s)]
*  because it's an area where you can say both parties have fucked up on this Donald Trump [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=2832.32s)]
*  during his first term spent more deficit dollars than any other president in American history [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=2837.6000000000004s)]
*  you know Democrats have not cared about it as well you can even like bend the idea [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=2843.04s)]
*  and talk about it in different ways like it's about generational equality the more money we [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=2849.2799999999997s)]
*  spend today the less money we can spend on young people's education and health care tomorrow [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=2852.48s)]
*  and so are we going to bankrupt ourselves for the boomers or are we going to sort of put together [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=2856.72s)]
*  some policies that millennials and that watch out for millennials and gen z there are many [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=2861.44s)]
*  different ways to talk about an issue if you want to frustrate it in people's minds anyway I'm not [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=2866.56s)]
*  thank you for pandering to the host thank you for pandering to the host on debt and deficit [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=2872.16s)]
*  issues but what what about on the topic of do we think that the immigration number polling is [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=2875.8399999999997s)]
*  this might be hopium on my part yeah I think that's what I'm wondering you are 100 correct that the [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=2880.8799999999997s)]
*  polling is changing this is going back to the idea of politicians presidents in particular [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=2887.52s)]
*  over interpreting their mandate we saw that happen with Biden you know at the end of Trump's first [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=2893.6s)]
*  term folks higher numbers than ever before said that immigration benefited the country we should [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=2900.32s)]
*  be more open to it and we're very down on Trump's approach to immigration Biden comes into office [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=2906.0800000000004s)]
*  there's a migrant crisis they don't do very much to sort of stem it at the border obviously it [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=2912.2400000000002s)]
*  became clear in blue cities and blue states with sort of like busing migrants up to those places [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=2918.7200000000003s)]
*  and Biden became very unpopular on the issue and for the first time ever Americans said [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=2926.32s)]
*  oh actually you know because when he first ran this wasn't actually a popular policy outside of [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=2931.0400000000004s)]
*  his base Americans said we should build the wall we should do mass deportations Americans turned [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=2935.36s)]
*  sharply to the right on immigration in reaction to what they perceived as Biden's de facto open [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=2939.6000000000004s)]
*  borders policy now we are seeing we call this thermostatic public opinion in the industry [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=2944.8s)]
*  now we are seeing Trump come back into office over interpret the mandate once again [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=2951.92s)]
*  pursue deportations in what in a way that many people see as inhumane ad hoc and not even sort [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=2957.28s)]
*  of in line with what they envisioned as his priorities and so increasingly we're seeing [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=2964.48s)]
*  folks move against him I was just looking at a Quinnipiac poll this morning where the number [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=2970.96s)]
*  of Americans who say that most immigrants in the country illegally should be given a pathway to [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=2975.36s)]
*  citizenship has increased by 10 percentage points over the past month or so and so Trump is going [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=2979.6s)]
*  to now make his own policy platform unpopular by doing it in a sort of careless ad hoc you know [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=2985.2799999999997s)]
*  potentially inhumane way and you know I want to I want to say something here about like how do [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=2996.72s)]
*  you critique that as a as a Democrat without going full 2019 like abolish ICE decriminalized [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=3002.24s)]
*  crossing the border all of that kind of stuff for one views on the border itself hasn't changed like [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=3008.88s)]
*  Americans are happy with the way that Donald Trump has decreased for the most part decreased [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=3016.96s)]
*  encounters at the southern border and and that data is pretty clear in terms of what has happened [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=3024.0s)]
*  there but and the the data has been slow to update here so I think the most recent data we have is [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=3029.84s)]
*  from 100 days in on Trump's first term he has made more arrests but deported fewer people than Biden [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=3036.08s)]
*  in his last year in office and fewer of those people have criminal records so even if you take [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=3044.7999999999997s)]
*  the promises that he made which is worst first deport you know people with a criminal record [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=3050.7999999999997s)]
*  he is not doing it as effectively as some past Democrats have done and you can use Obama as an [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=3057.52s)]
*  example as well and so part of this is part of this is because of the border crossing so [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=3062.48s)]
*  you can cut sure you can kind of just Biden was deporting people that just came across the border [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=3068.64s)]
*  they're going right back but but anyway well but that's different it's different to emphasize those [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=3072.48s)]
*  numbers like sometimes this is what this is where you're yeah but this is where your stats nerds [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=3077.84s)]
*  sometimes fall apart because like it is it is a difference to people if you're deporting somebody [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=3082.88s)]
*  that just came across the border that's sitting in some place in Texas waiting for a hearing [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=3088.32s)]
*  versus taking the Iranian mother out of the suburbs and like sending her across the border [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=3092.6400000000003s)]
*  right and so like because there's fewer border encounters there's also fewer deportations of the [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=3096.96s)]
*  kind that people are okay with okay well then we can look at Obama's situation right he was far more [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=3101.36s)]
*  effective at do it far more effective at doing the thing that Trump says he wants to do than Trump [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=3107.36s)]
*  himself and so because they have sort of been careless in this and now they're they were [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=3111.92s)]
*  pursuing workplace raids and then they kind of did a u-turn on that you there are lots of different [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=3120.7200000000003s)]
*  areas to critique the Trump administration on immigration but you're right that the humanitarian [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=3125.52s)]
*  issue is absolutely one of them and he has made his own approach to this unpopular what what did the [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=3130.88s)]
*  um path to citizenship number rise from and to do you know do you have it offhand [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=3137.6s)]
*  Quinnipiac number i do have it offhand so new nearly two-thirds of voters 64% say they prefer [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=3141.52s)]
*  giving most this is Quinnipiac by the way they prefer giving most undocumented immigrants in [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=3147.6s)]
*  the united states a pathway to legal status while 31% say they prefer deporting most undocumented [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=3151.3599999999997s)]
*  immigrants in the united states this is a change from roughly six months ago so i stand corrected [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=3156.96s)]
*  it was not a month ago in Quinnipiac university's december 18th poll 55 percent of voters said they [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=3161.36s)]
*  preferred giving most undocumented immigrants a pathway to legal status so Trump himself has [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=3166.7200000000003s)]
*  moved public opinion against himself uh by 10 percentage points over the past since he's been [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=3171.92s)]
*  in office it's interesting uh anyway i i think that an aggressive uh we're gonna pass a law to [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=3176.8s)]
*  make ICE agents show their face and put their and put their names on it and we're not going [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=3183.2000000000003s)]
*  to deport anybody that hasn't committed any crimes like i think there's a way to go at him [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=3188.32s)]
*  that way aggressively for democrats that is that is a winner not a vulnerability and i'm just [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=3192.56s)]
*  worried i think one of the challenges scared of that tab i think one of the challenges is that [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=3198.0s)]
*  and we're seeing this change a little bit but the people in american life [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=3203.44s)]
*  for whom immigration is a number one issue are almost all republicans and the people [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=3207.36s)]
*  you know for democrats their top issues are you know well one the economy and affordability but [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=3214.3999999999996s)]
*  health care is really high up there um you know even even some of the most liberal younger voters [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=3220.08s)]
*  when you when you looked at polling in 2024 it showed that it was all like jobs housing [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=3227.12s)]
*  affordability that kind of stuff um and so i think making the central focus of a campaign [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=3232.24s)]
*  an anti-trump message on something that is just not democrats biggest priority while that probably [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=3240.32s)]
*  will scratch an itch for the msnbc set because i think that people are very offended by what [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=3246.2400000000002s)]
*  trump is doing i don't know that that expands the tent or sort of increases enthusiasm amongst more [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=3251.92s)]
*  marginal voters in the way that you were describing but i will say that part of the way that one of [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=3259.52s)]
*  the reasons that when sort of folks who do a lot of research into latino voters part of the reason [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=3267.68s)]
*  that they were so solidly part of the obama coalition what they'll tell you is that that [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=3273.44s)]
*  was when the conversation was focusing on people who are in the country today and not the border [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=3280.0s)]
*  right during biden the conversation was about the border during w bush jr the conversation was about [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=3287.2s)]
*  the border and that's just going to be bad terrain for democrats because americans trust [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=3294.24s)]
*  republicans more on border security but once you start talking about people who are already in the [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=3299.4399999999996s)]
*  country it gets a lot easier for democrats to make that case and i think obviously you know you know [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=3304.24s)]
*  we saw latino voters shift seven points to the right between 2016 and 2020 and then another nine [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=3309.4399999999996s)]
*  between 2020 and 2024 being a total of 16 percentage points to the right and two presidential elections [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=3316.0s)]
*  i think if republicans want to keep those voters they should be careful about signaling to the [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=3322.32s)]
*  broader latino electorate like you know having a secure border is something that latino voters are [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=3328.0800000000004s)]
*  broadly positive about but signaling to people that like you don't give a shit about um like [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=3332.88s)]
*  latinos who are in the country um including some people who are in the country illegally [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=3339.1200000000003s)]
*  uh is probably bad for republicans long term with the latino electorate right i'm going to give you [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=3343.6000000000004s)]
*  a preview of where i'm going with the 2028 draft review by telling you that we're going to lump [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=3348.16s)]
*  the new york mayor conversation into that so that's how we'll close the that's how we'll close the [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=3354.0s)]
*  podcast for listeners uh gay uh uh galen did a draft with nate silver where they uh picked who [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=3358.3199999999997s)]
*  they thought was gonna be the most likely to be the democratic nominee there was a very complicated [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=3367.8399999999997s)]
*  point system which i do want to put to the side for this because i think that my listenership [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=3371.8399999999997s)]
*  is going to be less interested in the game theory of uh what nate had put together as a as a kind of [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=3376.24s)]
*  a uh complex point system but so just just for the basics like you get more points if they're the [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=3382.8799999999997s)]
*  nominee and you also get some points if they decide to run um your first pick was aoc nate [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=3388.56s)]
*  was mad at you because that was also his first pick um which i think is interesting i want to [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=3394.64s)]
*  talk about that uh then he then he picked josh shapiro um as his first pick and now i want to go [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=3398.72s)]
*  just go down your top five this is uh this is what i'm gonna call your team your first five rounds [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=3404.96s)]
*  aoc kamala harris pete rubin giego and jared polis were your first were your candidates nates [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=3410.0s)]
*  five candidates were josh shapiro korey booker gavin newsome gretchen whitmer andrew cuomo [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=3417.04s)]
*  and i would like to be invited into the game uh i'd like to invite into the game [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=3424.7200000000003s)]
*  your quora picks looking real good right now i'm um i i at first i was like i can i take the field [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=3429.8399999999997s)]
*  against both of your first five rounds uh but then i decided i actually want to be invited into the [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=3436.24s)]
*  game and i and we i would like to include i get to start at round six and um i'm gonna take west [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=3441.04s)]
*  more rafael warnock andy bashear jb pritzker and zo run and i'm roll and i'm rolling my squad against [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=3449.6s)]
*  either of your five either of your teams and um i want to talk about why in a second but but but [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=3458.8s)]
*  what what do you make of that so i think many of those people were eventually picked um you know [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=3464.8s)]
*  i would say that i made the mistake of going into the exercise thinking a lot about my first pick [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=3471.84s)]
*  because i thought it was something of a hot take and not thinking enough about my subsequent picks [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=3480.6400000000003s)]
*  which obviously jared polis sometimes sometimes when you're doing this you you pick people to [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=3487.6s)]
*  make a statement more than you do to suggest that they won't they're actually the likeliest to win [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=3493.8399999999997s)]
*  the nomination um but maybe polis and harris weren't the best picks in that case i mean i [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=3499.04s)]
*  probably would have picked aoc then josh apiro if i had my druthers but um yeah i mean the reason i [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=3504.64s)]
*  picked aoc which again is to say that i viewed her at the time as the likeliest nominee not [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=3512.08s)]
*  necessarily the likeliest sort of the best option to win a general election or the person that i [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=3518.3199999999997s)]
*  wanted or whatever for what it's worth i'm not a registered democrat so in new york state i can't [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=3524.24s)]
*  vote in a democratic primary anyway we have close primaries here which was also the case in the new [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=3527.84s)]
*  york city mayoral uh race a couple weeks ago a week ago and so uh the argument that i was making [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=3532.4s)]
*  is that democrats i think are ready for some someone who can offer something anti-establishment [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=3541.36s)]
*  e that it's likely to be a really deep field in 2028 and when you have a deep fractured field [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=3549.2000000000003s)]
*  somebody who's well known and has an energetic base of support is can sort of win those early [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=3556.2400000000002s)]
*  primaries with 30 some percent like trump did in 2016 where whereas like you know the rest of the [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=3563.04s)]
*  field may be fractured between westmore and josh shapiro and and gavin newsome or p buddha judge [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=3570.32s)]
*  or whoever else that having a sort of strong energetic charismatic message um can be to and [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=3576.48s)]
*  being kind of a celebrity in your own right can be to your benefit it was interesting that you guys [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=3584.4s)]
*  both picked aoc so since that's the thing you spent the most time thinking about and that was your hot [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=3588.2400000000002s)]
*  take i hear everything that you're saying there do you not think that she is um bogged down too much [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=3591.92s)]
*  by her um presence in the uh during the you know great and woken of america during the 2020s [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=3599.2s)]
*  i that's why i kind of like it's cheeky and but we get to zoran like zoran is really the closest [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=3610.64s)]
*  right now to the obama emerging figure like somebody that emerges kind of after that period [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=3618.3999999999996s)]
*  like he was not you know obama was not bogged down by any iraq baggage like like uh harris was [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=3625.36s)]
*  zoran will kind of be you know he was on twitter so he was posting you know about queer liberation [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=3631.28s)]
*  and stuff but like his image did not uh emerge during that time and like if he is like someone [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=3636.32s)]
*  like that i think that is interested in trying to triangulate themselves that emerges in kind of more [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=3643.2000000000003s)]
*  of a the end of trump versus having been involved in the trump era and having done all of the [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=3648.88s)]
*  ibram x kendi stuff i don't know what what do you what do you make of that as far as zoran [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=3655.28s)]
*  ramdhani in 2020 is concerned uh you know i don't know that he has his sights set on the presidency [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=3660.88s)]
*  but also just from a mechanical perspective uh because he was born in uganda because it's not [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=3668.6400000000003s)]
*  really a serious suggestion it's more of just a commentary on like the bat like what type of [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=3673.84s)]
*  person is going to be able to run against the democratic party so i think that you make good [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=3678.96s)]
*  points about why aoc might not be a good general election candidate but i don't think that those [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=3685.44s)]
*  come into play as much during the primary historically we've seen that democratic voters [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=3691.76s)]
*  say they care more about electability than somebody who shares their views on the issue [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=3696.56s)]
*  but that's shifted a little bit as democrats have i think become exhausted by i don't know being [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=3701.36s)]
*  force fed the establishments like middling presidential candidates like democrats have not [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=3707.36s)]
*  had um a sort of strong charismatic contender since obama and then bill clinton before that [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=3712.1600000000003s)]
*  and so a whole generation has has missed out on that you know charismatic semi-populist [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=3720.4s)]
*  whatever kind of figure within the democratic party obviously sanders losses made people who [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=3728.0s)]
*  were looking for that maybe even more complacent or sort of um not complacent but upset disillusion [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=3733.6s)]
*  with the democratic party um and so i hear those concerns from a general election perspective i [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=3739.68s)]
*  think that she she and zoran and look zoran was he obviously ran for assembly during the trump era [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=3747.2s)]
*  in a sense and he has a lot of stuff on record that is also um you know on the 20 side of the [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=3754.64s)]
*  80 20 issues and they are both running sincerely it seems well sincerely they're both running [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=3762.0s)]
*  pretty aggressively against those that version of the progressive party um they're not trashing [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=3769.36s)]
*  what they said but they are not talking about it i mean the fight the oligarchy tour from aoc was [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=3776.56s)]
*  all about you know partisanship doesn't matter like we just need to fight the rich it was so obama-esque [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=3781.28s)]
*  uh in in the sort of bid toward to kind of putting partisan divides behind us [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=3787.28s)]
*  zoran mum donnie totally backtracked on defunding the police during his campaign [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=3792.32s)]
*  and while he didn't backtrack on other things really didn't talk about them um was really [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=3796.32s)]
*  laser focused on affordability and you know he didn't run against a primary election candidate [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=3800.8s)]
*  who had enough of a campaign to really bring those things up and so part of the reason we [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=3807.44s)]
*  haven't heard about them or it maybe seems like he doesn't have that history is because andrew [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=3811.6800000000003s)]
*  cuomo didn't want run a real campaign against him it's interesting i i just think that the um [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=3815.52s)]
*  and maybe that's just wrong i don't know and a lot of it will depend on what happens with trump but [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=3821.6s)]
*  as as i was watching you guys draft i was just like you know the the person that is able to most [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=3825.2s)]
*  run against the party is also going to have to run against the era and having been a major figure of [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=3831.44s)]
*  the era i think is going to make things very challenging for aoc and for gavin and even for [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=3837.44s)]
*  pete kind of you know like people that i do think people kind of are going to want some like someone [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=3843.7599999999998s)]
*  and maybe no one else will have the charisma to emerge and they'll kind of fall back on on a gavin [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=3848.8799999999997s)]
*  or pete or you know somebody that they they know and like that to me i guess that's my that's where [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=3853.6s)]
*  i agree with you most on the trump thing i think that somebody that has the ability to emerge and [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=3859.3599999999997s)]
*  say to people guys like we are totally i'm going a totally different direction for all those my [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=3863.04s)]
*  focus my passion is different these guys are bogged down and that it would probably benefit them and [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=3867.7599999999998s)]
*  again i'm being cheeky by suggesting that could be zoran but the fact that nobody knew who zoran [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=3873.6s)]
*  was three months ago demonstrates that like really could be like i think the options are much greater [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=3877.12s)]
*  than maybe people are thinking well i mean maybe they wouldn't be up for it because they have two [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=3883.2s)]
*  strong ties to the democratic party but do you think a josh shapiro or west moore type could be [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=3890.0s)]
*  could fit that role in your mind i think west could for sure um yeah shapiro maybe i'm more i [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=3894.48s)]
*  love these are now we're now into my people like i like josh shapiro is great i've interviewed him [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=3901.2799999999997s)]
*  i've interviewed wes i i think josh is like in a media you're gonna get bogged down and like all of [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=3905.68s)]
*  the you know it's just not his fault but like all the israel palestine fight you know if you're [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=3911.04s)]
*  running for president you become a national figure like the hatred for him among the far left well i [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=3916.56s)]
*  think bog him down in that like west moore west is a little bit more of a blank slate i think west [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=3922.72s)]
*  could do it in a way that that it would be a little tougher for shapiro and from what i understand [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=3926.48s)]
*  there are plenty of powerful democrats who want that to happen um and for everything i said the [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=3930.4s)]
*  democratic party has during the past decade been pretty good at getting its wishes when it comes to [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=3936.08s)]
*  triangulating in the presidential primary so we'll see gail and droke uh i'm going on vacation so i'm [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=3940.48s)]
*  on a podcast marathon today i'm doing like 19 podcasts today so this is it this is over i [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOimOMiJY8&t=3946.7200000000003s)]
