Video Description: No, the Trump administration is not focused on the forgotten man or bringing industrial jobs back. Instead, the real estate developer is  handing out threats left and right—fresh off his Middle East trip, where he scored numerous deals with Islamofascists for himself, his family, and his cronies. And no matter what he says, the 'Palace in the Sky' is for him, once taxpayers pony up all the funds for retrofitting. Meanwhile, House Republicans are attempting to ram through their reconciliation bill—which is a huge debt bomb and is a big reason why Moody's downgraded the credit rating of the United States. Plus, Biden's cancer diagnosis, Epstein's 'absolutely crystal-clear' suicide, Trump proves Springsteen's point, and the administration gladly takes some of Mexico's worst. Bill Kristol joins Tim Miller.

# Trump's OUTRAGEOUS Deal to Protect El Chapo’s Family! (w/ Bill Kristol) | Bulwark Podcast
**The Bulwark Podcast:** [May 19, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw)
*  17 family members of cartel leaders crossed into the US last week as part of a deal between [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=0.0s)]
*  the son of the former head of the Sinaloa cartel and the Trump administration. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=7.12s)]
*  It is outrageous. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=11.52s)]
*  It should be the type of thing that people can get, which is like Trump is doing favors [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=13.4s)]
*  for El Chapo's family as part of a deal while he's kidnapping regular Venezuelan refugees [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=17.68s)]
*  and sending them to a prison. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=24.92s)]
*  Hello and welcome to the Bulldog podcast. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=30.0s)]
*  I'm your host, Tim Miller. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=35.76s)]
*  It is Monday, so I'm here with editor at large, Bill Kristol, and there's a lot of news to [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=37.24s)]
*  discuss. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=42.92s)]
*  Bill, how are you doing? [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=43.92s)]
*  I'm doing fine, Tim. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=44.92s)]
*  And you? [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=45.92s)]
*  You know, I'm doing pretty good. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=46.92s)]
*  All things considered, we had a pretty devastating nuggets loss in game seven. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=49.519999999999996s)]
*  It looked very close the last time I looked at the score there. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=53.8s)]
*  I'm just going to say. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=56.0s)]
*  Wasn't close. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=57.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=58.0s)]
*  I don't know what to say about it. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=59.0s)]
*  As we got the news of Joe Biden's pretty concerning prostate cancer diagnosis. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=60.28s)]
*  And so if people allow me, obviously, there's some limits in the comparison between the [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=69.2s)]
*  Denver Nuggets and Joe Biden. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=74.12s)]
*  But sports in some ways is this facsimile of life. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=75.68s)]
*  Life's a tragedy, right? [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=79.48s)]
*  We all, it's not just Joe Biden. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=82.16s)]
*  All of us in the end, we're going to die. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=84.36s)]
*  We're going to decay. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=86.03999999999999s)]
*  And the challenge is how we find some beauty and fulfillment in the process. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=87.08000000000001s)]
*  Like sports gives us this on the side, but we have rules and structure that go along [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=94.04s)]
*  with it. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=98.08000000000001s)]
*  You get to have actual rewards put in place in the middle of it, which sometimes you don't [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=99.08000000000001s)]
*  get in life. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=102.68s)]
*  But we had this guy, Aaron Gordon. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=103.68s)]
*  Do you know Aaron Gordon, Bill? [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=105.68s)]
*  Yeah, not really. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=106.68s)]
*  OK. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=107.68s)]
*  All right. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=108.68s)]
*  I'm going to just tell you one sec. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=109.68s)]
*  People will just allow me one minute about Aaron Gordon because we need some people [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=110.68s)]
*  in public life to actually just genuinely admire these days. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=114.44s)]
*  He was the best player on a terrible team, his little career in Orlando. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=118.28s)]
*  He comes to Denver to be a role player, sacrifices the spotlight he's always had. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=121.6s)]
*  He's just always happy, always joyful. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=126.2s)]
*  Reading between the lines of his Instagram, pretty sure he's a Kamala voter. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=129.52s)]
*  His brother Drew dies in a car crash last year, his older brother, and his three young [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=133.44s)]
*  kids. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=137.68s)]
*  And so this year, Aaron changes his number to honor his brother and he brings the kids [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=139.32s)]
*  around all the time. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=144.0s)]
*  Like Drew, his nephews are like around at the games, the press conferences, sitting [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=145.0s)]
*  in the front. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=150.16s)]
*  He's nurturing them. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=151.88s)]
*  You can always see him trying to kind of buck them up. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=152.88s)]
*  During the playoffs, he hits two Miracle Game winners and a game tying three in the first [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=155.4s)]
*  12 games of the playoffs. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=161.16s)]
*  In the penultimate game, he pulls his hamstring, going for a loose ball with like a minute [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=163.35999999999999s)]
*  left at the end of the game. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=169.07999999999998s)]
*  It's the type of thing you're supposed to have like a one month recovery process for. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=171.4s)]
*  But he decides to play anyway in the deciding game, game seven. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=176.08s)]
*  And like he's hobbling around out there. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=179.92000000000002s)]
*  He's got 11 rebounds. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=181.72s)]
*  It's just unbelievable the amount of guts that he's showing. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=184.20000000000002s)]
*  We get our ass kicked, as you pointed out. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=187.72s)]
*  But like, this is all we're supposed to have in life, right? [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=190.48000000000002s)]
*  Like you get these little moments of triumph, you know, that he won a championship two years [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=195.68s)]
*  ago. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=200.12s)]
*  You are there for your nephews. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=201.12s)]
*  You showed that you have guts. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=203.4s)]
*  You get fulfilled and you get these moments of joy, the game winning shots. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=204.84s)]
*  And in the end, like in the end, it's, you know, it's loss. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=210.52s)]
*  You always lose in the end, right? [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=217.0s)]
*  And so that is kind of like how I was processing all this yesterday about why I was not as [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=218.96s)]
*  down as I could have been about the nuggets. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=224.56s)]
*  And then the Joe Biden news comes across and it's, you know, maybe kind of a similar story. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=227.2s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=233.16s)]
*  Am I stretching for you? [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=234.16s)]
*  No, no, you're allowed to stretch. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=236.96s)]
*  You're the host of this fine podcast. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=238.6s)]
*  And no, it's very... [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=241.44s)]
*  One of my buddies texted me this morning, he's like, how are you going to handle the [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=242.6s)]
*  Joe Biden news? [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=244.48s)]
*  And I said, I think I'm going to compare it to Aaron Gordon's hamstring. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=245.48s)]
*  Do you think that's going to land? [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=247.72s)]
*  And he's like, I don't know, man. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=248.88s)]
*  No, no, it was well done. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=250.04s)]
*  And, you know, I was thinking, I mean, so when I was in high school, my last year in [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=251.56s)]
*  high school, Willis Reed, speaking of full hamstrings, hobbled on, I don't know quite [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=256.64s)]
*  what his injury was, but he hobbled onto the court in game seven against the Lakers and [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=260.71999999999997s)]
*  played at sort of half speed, half capacity, but the Knicks won. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=264.71999999999997s)]
*  So that's the sort of, that's the really fairy tale version of the story, right? [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=269.52s)]
*  Yeah, but Willis Reed ends up, this is the thing about sports like life, you know, eventually [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=275.56s)]
*  it breaks down, you know? [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=279.59999999999997s)]
*  You get to, you lose, in the end it's over. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=281.91999999999996s)]
*  It's always over at some point. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=284.03999999999996s)]
*  I don't disagree that the fairy tale version is less, you know, maybe true to life than [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=285.44s)]
*  the nobility, but ultimate failure, or at least failure may be too strong, but ultimate, [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=290.24s)]
*  you know, you can't be carried through forever. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=296.44s)]
*  Carlton Fisk, the other greatest, the greatest game I was ever at, baseball game I was ever [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=298.68s)]
*  at, 75 World Series, sixth game, Fulkish League got tickets, Susan and I had tickets. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=302.12s)]
*  And so Carlton Fisk's 12th inning home run, and I was a Red Sox fan at that point in the [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=306.96000000000004s)]
*  American League at least, I was a Mets fan of the National League, and I was up there [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=310.40000000000003s)]
*  at Boston in grad school, and Carlton Fisk has that great home run, really the great, [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=313.32s)]
*  unbelievable moment, baseball, and of course the Red Sox then lose the seventh game, everyone's [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=318.03999999999996s)]
*  forgotten that side, and lose the World Series. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=321.15999999999997s)]
*  So yes, that was a good lesson, that's a good lesson. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=324.15999999999997s)]
*  That was a lucky moment, where were your seats? [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=327.03999999999996s)]
*  They were pretty good, because the Fulkish way we got there was we knew someone who knew [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=329.64s)]
*  a relative of one of the team owners who didn't want to use the tickets, and I think that [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=334.32s)]
*  afternoon just hanging around in grad school, I don't even know where, how we got them, [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=338.32s)]
*  maybe Susan got them, someone said, hey, you want two tickets to tonight's game? [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=343.12s)]
*  And Susan was like, I don't know, I'm kind of busy, I have a lot of work to do, and I [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=346.48s)]
*  was like, no, we want two tickets to tonight's game, sixth game of the World Series at Fenway. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=349.56s)]
*  What a life, that's a good memory. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=354.04s)]
*  Anyway, all right, on the details of Joe Biden, we got to do it. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=356.96s)]
*  So last, here's the statement that was put out by Biden last week. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=360.68s)]
*  He has seen for a new finding of a prostate nodule after experiencing increasing urinary [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=366.08s)]
*  symptoms. We're getting really detailed here. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=371.48s)]
*  On Friday, he was diagnosed with prostate cancer characterized by a Gleason score of nine, [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=373.52s)]
*  which is very high with metastasis into the bone. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=378.96s)]
*  So this represents a more aggressive form of the disease. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=382.71999999999997s)]
*  The cancer appears to be hormone sensitive, which allows for effective management. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=385.16s)]
*  That was the statement from the Biden family. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=388.44s)]
*  You know, you guys wrote this morning about this and like there is the personal tragedy [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=393.44s)]
*  side of this, which is, you know, he's just had so much personal tragedy and it's [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=399.84s)]
*  particularly related to cancer with his son, Bo dying. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=404.4s)]
*  And, you know, so there's sort of that side of the discussion, which is just extremely [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=407.44s)]
*  human. And then there's this kind of more elusive legacy side of the discussion. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=412.28s)]
*  But you wrote about it a little bit in the context of it's Seamus Heaney. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=418.12s)]
*  Is that how you say it? Seaney? [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=423.0s)]
*  Seamy, I think so. Seamus Heaney, one of the famous poet, an Irish poet that [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=424.03999999999996s)]
*  Biden also always would quote often at funerals. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=429.6s)]
*  Biden was a good eulogizer of all the things about Joe Biden. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=432.36s)]
*  There's one thing that he's really wonderful at was eulogizing. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=434.84000000000003s)]
*  But anyway, why don't you give us a brief [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=437.8s)]
*  of the takeaway that you offered this morning in the news? [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=443.20000000000005s)]
*  I mean, Andrew really has an excellent piece, I think, on we talked last night, obviously, [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=447.32000000000005s)]
*  decided we should write it up. We both had the sense of we don't have much to say. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=452.24s)]
*  I mean, I respect Joe Biden and I'm very sorry about the obviously the medical developments. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=455.8s)]
*  You don't want to write a eulogy for someone when he's around on the other hand. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=460.56s)]
*  So I'm quite what to what to say. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=463.28s)]
*  And we thought maybe we'll just write on reconciliation bill and all this. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=465.32s)]
*  And then last night, late last night for Andrew and earlier this morning for me, [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=468.44s)]
*  we both decided I got to sort of write about it. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=473.56s)]
*  It's it's he's president. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=475.68s)]
*  You know, aren't that many people have been president? [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=477.52s)]
*  And here he is, our most recent president. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=479.8s)]
*  And so Andrew wrote a very nice piece, I think, on on on Biden's uncertain legacy [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=481.8s)]
*  and how it's a little unusual in his case and tragic, maybe more so in the sense [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=486.0s)]
*  that he'll presumably die. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=490.96000000000004s)]
*  Not quite certain about how he'll be judged. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=494.56s)]
*  I mean, no, it's really certain, of course, but, you know, other people [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=498.28000000000003s)]
*  can see the effects of some of their policies and feel somewhat reassured [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=500.68s)]
*  or maybe an unfortunate case is not reassured that the country will think of them [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=504.52s)]
*  in a certain way or future generations will. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=508.6s)]
*  And Biden beat Trump and was, you know, an avarable contrast to Trump. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=511.04s)]
*  And I think a pretty decent president. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=515.04s)]
*  But on the other hand, it succeeded by Trump. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=517.12s)]
*  And so which is the sort of, you know, which which dominates? [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=518.9200000000001s)]
*  Yeah, this legacy question is frustrating for me. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=523.28s)]
*  I was reading it. I was reading in the streets. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=525.08s)]
*  It made me think about [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=527.28s)]
*  something Rudy Giuliani said a couple of years ago. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=530.04s)]
*  Do you remember this people? [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=532.24s)]
*  Somebody, some reporter was lamenting to him how he'd ruined his legacy. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=534.4s)]
*  And he said, My attitude about my legacy is fuck it. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=538.1199999999999s)]
*  I'll be dead. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=543.0s)]
*  And that is like a deeply sociopathic view of legacy. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=544.8s)]
*  It's like I think about all the stuff and like, you know, as a as a as a moderate [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=550.52s)]
*  squish, I'm always like, you're looking for balance in all things, right? [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=554.7199999999999s)]
*  Like obsession over one's legacy and trying to sculpt and mold it. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=557.4399999999999s)]
*  But like, especially at this time, I mean, there's Steve Schell [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=562.88s)]
*  just wrote this great piece for us last week about kind of how Biden, [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=565.7199999999999s)]
*  you know, like you can only do so much, right? [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=570.16s)]
*  Like, I mean, he had this life or has this life still where he, you know, [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=572.7199999999999s)]
*  they did all this research into cancer and other kind of irony, [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=577.52s)]
*  a sad irony about what he's going through now, you know, [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=580.68s)]
*  how he cared about this cancer moonshot because of his son and, you know, [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=584.28s)]
*  the legacy of all the bill, you know, the what build back better and chips [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=587.16s)]
*  and like the things he accomplished and like the things that he accomplished [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=590.8399999999999s)]
*  in the Senate. Right. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=593.4s)]
*  So all these things that you could, [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=594.4s)]
*  you know, that you want to talk about and focus on right [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=597.12s)]
*  in your post presidency or or do or or continue to advance in some way. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=599.52s)]
*  So and foreign policy for him to [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=604.56s)]
*  and then there's kind of like the pop cable news punditry legacy. Right. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=608.0799999999999s)]
*  And and and, you know, Shail was trying to talk about how like Biden should think [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=613.04s)]
*  about just trying to advance all those things that that he actually [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=617.28s)]
*  that he worked on, that he had successes on, you know, like rather than [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=622.4000000000001s)]
*  trying to win this fucking talking head battle that is a unwinnable [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=625.9200000000001s)]
*  since Trump won and be like uncertain. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=632.0400000000001s)]
*  Like, who knows, like how things will will shake out. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=636.0s)]
*  And I do feel like there is there's like some healthy place in the middle, [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=639.8000000000001s)]
*  you know, that we want from public servants. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=644.2800000000001s)]
*  That's somewhere between the horrific nihilism of Rudy Giuliani [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=646.48s)]
*  and kind of like an obsession with legacy that becomes unhelpful. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=651.5200000000001s)]
*  Right. Or maybe even counterproductive, like at times. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=656.96s)]
*  And, you know, that is like and it just feels so much more cute for him. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=660.2s)]
*  Maybe just maybe because of his age. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=665.44s)]
*  I don't know why. Like, maybe it feels less acute for Obama and W [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=667.36s)]
*  because there's there's a longer arc of post presidency. I'm not sure. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=670.72s)]
*  Yeah, I'm not sure either. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=675.6800000000001s)]
*  I've always thought that the focus on legacy is both [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=677.5200000000001s)]
*  obviously humanly understandable. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=680.2s)]
*  It can lead in a good direction, as you were sort of suggesting, [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=681.96s)]
*  in the sense that you want to do admirable things, [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=684.24s)]
*  the admirable things that you'd be remembered for. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=686.2s)]
*  It can also lead to a kind of overthinking. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=688.6s)]
*  I've seen this in other people, not just presidents, but public, [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=690.52s)]
*  not just public officials, incidentally, that you sort of you can't really. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=693.64s)]
*  You don't know what's going to happen next. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=697.32s)]
*  You don't know how things are going to be judged 10, 20, 30 years from now. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=699.12s)]
*  Things that look great at first don't look so good. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=702.1600000000001s)]
*  And vice versa. Harry Truman, for example. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=704.0400000000001s)]
*  So I think probably sounds kind of totally trite. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=708.6s)]
*  But I mean, you know, the best thing is to try to do the right thing [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=711.96s)]
*  and to take a she's going to take a long view of the right thing. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=715.16s)]
*  So you are thinking about future generations. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=718.24s)]
*  You're not just thinking about, you know, leaving office [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=720.9200000000001s)]
*  and everything falls apart a year later. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=723.0s)]
*  But this the the legacy thing is hard to shape and obviously hard to control. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=724.84s)]
*  Oh, it's tough. It's such a downer. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=730.28s)]
*  One of the thing worth mentioning about it, [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=733.6800000000001s)]
*  if we move on to the [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=735.88s)]
*  the Trump news, which is downer in a different kind of way, [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=738.4399999999999s)]
*  is that Zeke Emanuel is on Morning Joe this morning. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=742.24s)]
*  And it just it bears mentioning because this is just going to be part [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=745.56s)]
*  of the conversation about all of this, sadly, over the coming months. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=750.04s)]
*  But he just says, like pretty matter of factly to Scarborough that like [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=754.4s)]
*  this is the type of cancer that you've had for a while. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=760.2s)]
*  Like the nature of it is not such that that it metastasizes [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=762.8s)]
*  in 100 days or 200 days. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=767.6s)]
*  And and so, you know, not that's not necessarily to make [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=770.08s)]
*  mean that there's any conspiracy surrounding this, I guess. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=773.88s)]
*  Maybe you're maybe you're more suited to talk about this to me. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=777.52s)]
*  But I guess, man, over 70, there's certain reason not to, [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=780.16s)]
*  you know, get certain tests, particularly with regards to prostate, [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=784.0s)]
*  because you can there can be some over treatment. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=786.68s)]
*  And a lot of times it takes much longer to to progress. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=789.72s)]
*  But anyway, I just like the blunt nature with which he said, [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=794.28s)]
*  it seemed to take Scarborough off guard this morning. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=798.96s)]
*  And I think certainly it's going to be things that people are talking about. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=801.2s)]
*  A lot of bad faith Republicans and like not, you know, there'll be a lot of conspiracy [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=804.0400000000001s)]
*  theory theorizing about it when you get into that more on the conspiracy [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=807.36s)]
*  side in a second. But it was interesting to see Zeke's [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=810.9200000000001s)]
*  assessment just be so matter of fact on this. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=815.64s)]
*  The one thing that occurred to be reading some of the stuff late last night, [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=818.8800000000001s)]
*  early this morning is that [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=821.1600000000001s)]
*  I think President Biden deserves some blame for his stubbornness and his [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=823.84s)]
*  sort of desire against what was [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=830.5600000000001s)]
*  what was prudent and what was really right. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=834.5600000000001s)]
*  I'm going to say not just politically right, but right in terms of the country [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=836.36s)]
*  for the next four years to try to have a second term. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=839.72s)]
*  It was a mistake. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=841.96s)]
*  Having said that, it's a very natural human mistake. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=842.84s)]
*  He's he was the president. He's the guy who beat Trump. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=845.12s)]
*  He thought he could keep doing a good job. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=847.6s)]
*  He could well have, you know, maybe not with this diagnosis now, [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=849.44s)]
*  but he could have kept doing a decent job for a year or two, maybe not for four years. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=852.6800000000001s)]
*  I don't think it wasn't, as I say, the right thing to do. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=856.08s)]
*  But what I guess I do blame and I but I do blame more his people close to him. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=858.72s)]
*  I mean, they're the ones who have to tell them, no, you can't do this. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=863.28s)]
*  It's very hard for a person to this is what friends are for. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=866.52s)]
*  Not to be again, cliches and everything. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=869.84s)]
*  People don't have great self knowledge or self-awareness always, or they do, [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=872.2s)]
*  but they suppress it in the interests of other things. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=875.68s)]
*  And really, people close to him needed to tell him [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=878.88s)]
*  that he shouldn't run again. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=882.68s)]
*  The cover up side of it is not great either. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=883.88s)]
*  But I've got to say that's the thing I hope most hold against is too strong. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=886.28s)]
*  But I do think is a problem for those people who are close to him. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=889.92s)]
*  I don't think they told him. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=893.56s)]
*  They gave him honest advice when he didn't want to hear it. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=895.4s)]
*  Yeah, I agree with all that. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=899.12s)]
*  I actually the cover up thing, I think, is the stupidest part of all this. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=900.68s)]
*  Like they put him on the stage because they thought he could do it. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=904.0s)]
*  Like, I mean, I think there's a ton of things to criticize [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=907.12s)]
*  all the people around him for. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=909.68s)]
*  But I think self [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=912.0s)]
*  they fooled themselves. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=915.92s)]
*  That's fair enough. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=917.16s)]
*  They played themselves, so to speak, as DJ Khaled would say. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=918.16s)]
*  All right. Speaking of playing ourselves, the country's played themselves [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=923.16s)]
*  by putting Donald Trump back in the White House. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=926.96s)]
*  I guess I'm going to start. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=929.0s)]
*  I want to start with just a random oblique he sent. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=931.8s)]
*  He sent a lot of insane ones over the weekend. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=934.56s)]
*  I want to start with one that he sent about Disney. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=936.8399999999999s)]
*  So I think it ties into a couple of other topics I want to get into with you. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=938.92s)]
*  I'm going to read it for folks, because I assume most of our listeners aren't [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=942.56s)]
*  aren't watching Trump's truth social feed with with with a close eye. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=946.04s)]
*  Why doesn't Chairman Bob Iger do something about ABC fake news, [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=951.8s)]
*  especially since I just won 16 million based on the fake and defamatory [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=956.52s)]
*  reporting of little George Slopidopoulos? [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=960.2s)]
*  He was given warnings but couldn't be restrained by management. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=963.2s)]
*  Now I see they're at it again. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=966.88s)]
*  And again, I give these sleazebags fair warning. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=968.2800000000001s)]
*  The wonderful country of Qatar after agreeing to invest more than one [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=971.2800000000001s)]
*  that they didn't give this gift to me, they give the gift of the country. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=975.0s)]
*  So this is Trump threatening ABC again. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=978.5600000000001s)]
*  I guess there's some report where where they framed the Qatar plane [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=982.32s)]
*  as a gift to Trump or Trump is saying that is false. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=986.84s)]
*  It's a gift to the country. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=989.52s)]
*  Scott Besson used the same spin on the shows over the weekend. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=990.72s)]
*  It's an interesting spin for me because I don't I don't plan on getting to ride [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=993.8s)]
*  on the plane, so I don't you know, I'm not sure it's quite a gift [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=996.72s)]
*  to the whole country. A gift to me. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1000.52s)]
*  I'm not sure if many of our listeners are going to get to get a ride [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1002.24s)]
*  on the palace in the sky. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1005.24s)]
*  So does seem kind of like a gift to Trump to me. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1006.28s)]
*  But the interesting thing here is just how [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1010.0s)]
*  Trump's never subtle, right? [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1015.72s)]
*  And he just lays bare that giving into him [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1017.68s)]
*  and that what Disney did with this kind of ridiculous settlement [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1022.08s)]
*  over the over the Stephanopoulos comments [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1026.0s)]
*  about about the E.J. and Carol case [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1029.32s)]
*  was very obvious at the time. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1032.32s)]
*  Like that was a mistake. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1035.04s)]
*  All of a sudden, so it was very obvious that they were not going to get anything [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1036.68s)]
*  out of Trump, like making these sort of deals with Trump does not ever pay off [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1039.72s)]
*  in the end. He just wants more and more and more. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1042.8s)]
*  He's just going to push and push and push. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1044.6s)]
*  And here's Trump just publicly basically saying that, like holding it over [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1046.44s)]
*  their head and, you know, saying that that he's going to keep. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1050.6000000000001s)]
*  Keep filing, you know, keep doing these silly lawsuits, keep attacking them, [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1055.56s)]
*  that there will be no, you know, [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1059.92s)]
*  no relief from the attacks from Trump and our government [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1063.4s)]
*  just because you bend over for it. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1067.48s)]
*  Well, maybe there'll be relief if they just never report anything negative [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1070.76s)]
*  about Trump. I mean, yeah. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1073.56s)]
*  But I'm serious. The intimidation worked. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1075.52s)]
*  I mean, that's for me. That remains the big he's going to keep doing it [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1077.04s)]
*  as long as it works. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1079.96s)]
*  It's worked. It's worked for media companies. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1081.04s)]
*  It's worked for businesses. It's worked for law firms. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1084.08s)]
*  And we'll see what happens to the universities. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1086.44s)]
*  It's worked, God knows, with the Republican Party and with Congress. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1088.8799999999999s)]
*  And that's that's why we're in such bad shape, though. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1092.4s)]
*  I mean, he is in his own cunning and insane and narcissistic way. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1094.68s)]
*  You know, he knows that the levers of power matter and people can snicker at him. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1099.04s)]
*  And incidentally, Qatar, which gave him the plane, [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1103.76s)]
*  did get rewarded a little bit by him calling it what do you call it? [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1106.16s)]
*  The tweet, a wonderful country. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1109.28s)]
*  Suddenly, Qatar's really fantastic place. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1110.4s)]
*  I wasn't aware of that. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1112.68s)]
*  That was that was the conventional view here in America for this country, [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1113.56s)]
*  which hosts, you know, Hamas's leaders and so forth. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1117.56s)]
*  But but they're getting something, at least in the very short term. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1119.8799999999999s)]
*  It will see how much more they have to pay down the road. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1123.92s)]
*  So now that's what it's easy to, you know, to [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1126.96s)]
*  for other people to sort of snicker at the way he goes about being a mob boss. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1131.6399999999999s)]
*  But of course, mob bosses, they usually get their comeuppance ultimately. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1136.04s)]
*  But if you watch like American movies, you know, but [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1139.3999999999999s)]
*  but I don't know, the real world, they they can they they they can do OK [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1143.2399999999998s)]
*  for a fair amount of time, unfortunately. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1146.8799999999999s)]
*  Yeah. Highly respected country. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1149.6399999999999s)]
*  Highly respected. Oh, yeah. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1151.6s)]
*  It's very much. I notice it. Yeah. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1152.8s)]
*  Yeah. I've got a ton of respect for the from the leaders of Hamas [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1154.9599999999998s)]
*  who they're harboring the [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1157.6799999999998s)]
*  the other like element of this, [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1161.8s)]
*  you know, with it. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1165.08s)]
*  Well, let me just back up a second. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1167.04s)]
*  Let me say it's easy to say it's easy to snicker at Trump's ham handed, [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1169.28s)]
*  you know, intimidation tactics. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1174.32s)]
*  And as you say, they've worked. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1176.8s)]
*  And so, you know, that that cuts both ways. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1178.9199999999998s)]
*  It doesn't really cut both ways for Bob Iger and Disney. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1182.0s)]
*  And I think that snickering at the people that folded [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1184.4399999999998s)]
*  is is actually probably valuable at this point. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1188.36s)]
*  And pointing and laughing at them so that more people don't do this [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1190.96s)]
*  because they folded and got nothing, which was obvious [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1193.96s)]
*  from the start that that was going to be the case. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1198.88s)]
*  It's not like you pay your 16 million dollar indulgence, [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1201.52s)]
*  you know, to Trump and then, you know, you get you get blessed [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1204.68s)]
*  by dear father and then and then it moves on like it never it never ends. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1208.92s)]
*  And so there's no point in paying the indulgence in the first place. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1212.8s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know. I'm a little less. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1217.8400000000001s)]
*  I wish I were more confident of this. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1219.2s)]
*  We need to make it that there's no point paying the indulgence [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1220.56s)]
*  the first place. And part of the way to do that is to, you know, snicker at it [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1223.36s)]
*  and make it unrespectable and to do so and make people pay a social and cultural [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1226.72s)]
*  and maybe even economic price for for doing so. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1231.12s)]
*  But I'm I wish I were more confident that all those business leaders [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1233.8799999999999s)]
*  who went with Trump to on his Middle Eastern trip and, you know, sucked up to Trump. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1237.6399999999999s)]
*  And I'm sure people in their company are not going to be very critical of Trump [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1242.84s)]
*  for the next few weeks and months and so forth. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1246.3999999999999s)]
*  And all the elites who've gone along with Trump, I wish I wish I were more confident [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1248.96s)]
*  they're not going to end up at least in the short term, [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1253.72s)]
*  feeling like they made a pretty clever move, you know, maybe not. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1257.3600000000001s)]
*  Come on, Bill, give me something here. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1261.1200000000001s)]
*  Now, maybe not something today. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1262.6000000000001s)]
*  I mean, honestly, well, it's not even worth getting into media. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1264.76s)]
*  Is it like different situation in a way? [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1266.92s)]
*  Is this more public facing? [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1268.3600000000001s)]

*  You had on the Sunday interview on Substack yesterday, Tom Malinowski, [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1419.8s)]
*  former Congressman from New Jersey. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1424.6s)]
*  And you also were talking about the Cutter plane bribe and Malinowski kind [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1426.72s)]
*  of had a little bit of a different take on it. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1431.52s)]
*  So why don't you kind of give us a little recap of what you guys discussed? [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1435.76s)]
*  So Tom, who was both Assistant Secretary of State under President Obama and [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1440.08s)]
*  had been elected to Clinton at a seat, and then he was elected to the [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1444.04s)]
*  Congress, so he knows his way around Washington very well and knows the way [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1448.2s)]
*  around foreign capitals very well. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1451.68s)]
*  And has fought a lot with the dictatorial Middle Eastern states. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1453.6399999999999s)]
*  I think he was expelled from Bahrain once for meeting with some dissidents. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1457.6399999999999s)]
*  So he's on the human rights, pro-democracy side of things. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1462.68s)]
*  He had two things to report, though, which I think are interesting that [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1466.56s)]
*  he thinks are true and pretty confident it seems like are true. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1469.48s)]
*  One that the Qataris didn't just decide, hey, we've got to get rid of the [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1472.6399999999999s)]
*  plane, let's just give it to Trump and try to buy some goodwill. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1478.28s)]
*  That it was more of a shakedown than a bribe. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1481.4s)]
*  Trump, presumably through Steve Witkoff, saw the plane. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1484.28s)]
*  He knew about the plane. He heard about it. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1488.44s)]
*  He knew he saw it in February, actually. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1489.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1492.16s)]
*  It was parked in the air force one for a long time. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1492.32s)]
*  And he sort of basically asked for it. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1495.64s)]
*  And Qatar is in a very weak position, actually. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1497.56s)]
*  They are, you know, not a strong one of the strong petro states, I would say. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1499.56s)]
*  And so they need U.S. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1504.68s)]
*  support and goodwill. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1506.56s)]
*  And so they got shaken down and they shook or whatever the right way to say that is. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1508.56s)]
*  And they provided the plane. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1514.3600000000001s)]
*  So the fact that it's more of a, if that's true, that it's more of a shakedown, [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1516.48s)]
*  not just a bribe is even worse. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1519.6000000000001s)]
*  Now, I will say the founders in there, to their credit, didn't understood [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1521.92s)]
*  that you can't really tell often. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1524.88s)]
*  So they just banned in the Constitution gifts and emoluments from foreign nations [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1526.3200000000002s)]
*  unless Congress approves them, because they understood that in a way you don't [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1530.56s)]
*  know, it doesn't matter that much, I guess, who goes first. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1533.68s)]
*  Then maybe the more interesting thing from a policy point of view that Tom pointed out [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1536.5600000000002s)]
*  is the Emirates, the UAE, who got, you know, also massive amounts of U.S. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1539.52s)]
*  investment and promised massive amounts of money for us, for the U.S. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1545.76s)]
*  companies and U.S. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1550.8400000000001s)]
*  businesses. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1552.48s)]
*  But the deal there was that Trump waived restrictions that had been put on in the [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1553.5600000000002s)]
*  Biden administration and had bipartisan support in Congress on sending AI chips [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1557.52s)]
*  to the Middle East, in this case, to the Emirates, which I don't really understand [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1564.6000000000001s)]
*  fully how this works. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1570.48s)]
*  I sort of understand in principle how it works. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1571.88s)]
*  I don't know anything about AI to speak of, but yeah, we had these export [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1573.5200000000002s)]
*  restrictions on these chips because they're very sensitive and powerful. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1577.2800000000002s)]
*  We didn't want to get into the wrong hands. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1580.76s)]
*  The wrong hands could be different people hanging around in the Emirates. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1582.2800000000002s)]
*  It could also be China with whom the UAE has a close relationship. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1585.92s)]
*  This is bipartisan. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1588.92s)]
*  China hawks in both parties and people concerned about AI and how it could be [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1590.28s)]
*  misused in both parties. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1594.9199999999998s)]
*  UAE is a pretty totalitarian place. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1596.6799999999998s)]
*  They use a lot of facial recognition technology and stuff. [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1598.3999999999999s)]
*  Presumably, they've gotten that from the Chinese, but it shows how much close the [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1601.96s)]
*  relationship is with the Chinese. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1604.8799999999999s)]
*  And so suddenly, Trump is basically, Tom took this, takes this very seriously, [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1606.9199999999998s)]
*  that, you know, AI stuff, which is very sensitive and, you know, has, has kind of [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1612.1999999999998s)]
*  pretty dire effects if put in the wrong hands already, maybe already too much in [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1617.76s)]
*  the wrong hands with China. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1622.2s)]
*  But we're just making it infinitely easier with this, with this deal he's [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1623.3600000000001s)]
*  made with the UAE. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1627.24s)]
*  Yeah, it's interesting. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1629.44s)]
*  China had a statement out this morning that was on this exact point on [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1630.08s)]
*  essentially these chip, the AI chip exports. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1635.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1638.32s)]
*  So basically they said that the US seriously undermined consensus reached at [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1638.72s)]
*  the Geneva talks, you know, with these conversations. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1643.44s)]
*  So I, without getting into, I guess the broader point is like, who the hell knows, [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1647.48s)]
*  like what machinations are happening behind the scenes between these big tech [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1654.76s)]
*  oligarchs and Sam Altman is there in Saudi, you know, and Trump and Whitcoff [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1659.44s)]
*  and, you know, these Middle Eastern dictatorships and the Chinese. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1665.96s)]
*  That's like, there is no, there's no reason to have any trust that any of the [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1670.68s)]
*  decisions being made are based upon the public interest. [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1676.04s)]
*  Right. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1679.8s)]
*  Right. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1680.08s)]
*  And to me, this is like something else I wanted to get into with you. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1680.84s)]
*  There's this big hullabaloo last week over with Trump's speech in Saudi [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1684.52s)]
*  Arabia about how he was marking the end of this old, you know, whatever you want [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1690.08s)]
*  to call it, bipartisan, neoliberal, neoconservative world, the global order. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1695.32s)]
*  And that we are going to stop caring about, you know, making decisions, you [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1699.6s)]
*  know, and having relationships based on shared values and, you know, the [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1704.2s)]
*  combination of the intersection of shared values and shared interests. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1708.04s)]
*  And instead of that, you know, we are just, you know, we're going to stop [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1711.04s)]
*  being so gullible when it comes to all of that. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1714.76s)]

*  You know, it's just going to be about the bucks. [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1720.2s)]
*  It's just going to be about money and just going to be about how we, America [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1722.56s)]
*  can get ours and Donald Trump's going to do these deals and it's much savvier. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1725.8s)]
*  And we won't get into any of these problems that these goody two shoes who [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1730.68s)]
*  cared about democracy and values and human rights got into, and now we have [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1734.4s)]
*  a much more savvy relationship. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1739.48s)]
*  And like, to me, all of that is so naive and so stupid. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1741.92s)]
*  And like the idea that we would trade away, like these values based [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1748.24s)]
*  relationships where we try to, where we care about the rule of law and replace [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1752.96s)]
*  it with like Donald Trump and some Islamo fascists and the Chinese and a [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1757.12s)]
*  bunch of fucking want to be trillionaires at a table cutting deals. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1763.4399999999998s)]
*  I just, I really, I think that there's probably a way to frame that in a way [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1768.6s)]
*  that people won't like, right? [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1775.04s)]
*  Like I understand, like, like they, their frame, I can understand how it's [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1776.36s)]
*  appealing to some people, which is like, we're just going to care about your [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1780.6799999999998s)]
*  pocketbook, we're going to stop caring about human rights concerns in Riyadh. [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1782.84s)]
*  Right. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1786.24s)]
*  But like the other side of this coin is that they are making these hugely [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1786.92s)]
*  serious decisions about the, like our future safety and security, like based [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1791.84s)]
*  on some fucking real estate developer and a trillionaires desire to get it, [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1797.2s)]
*  you know, to get extra kickbacks. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1803.92s)]
*  I mean, it is true mad. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1805.84s)]
*  It's madness. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1807.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1808.52s)]
*  It's madness that it's personal grift. [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1808.68s)]
*  I mean, that is to say there is a case sometimes maybe for, let's just [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1810.92s)]
*  call it a rail politique. [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1814.32s)]
*  You know, they have a lot of oil. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1815.72s)]
*  We can't litigate the human rights issues too much with those countries. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1817.88s)]
*  They try it is too powerful. [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1820.84s)]
*  We can't stand up as much as we would like to for the winger. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1822.24s)]
*  So you and I are more on the other side of that, but you know, that's a [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1824.96s)]
*  Kissingerian point of view, but that still presumes that people are trying [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1827.8s)]
*  to act in what they think are the best interests of the country. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1831.0s)]
*  They just differ on the balancing of some, you know, material interests, [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1833.68s)]
*  economic interests, as opposed to values or human rights and so forth. [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1838.32s)]
*  The Trump's not even balancing anything. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1842.28s)]
*  I mean, this is the farce of it, right? [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1843.88s)]
*  I mean, some of his defenders want to make it look like there's [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1845.36s)]
*  some kind of theory here. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1847.6799999999998s)]
*  He's just out from South and, and, uh, and his family and his buddies, [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1849.1599999999999s)]
*  and they're all out for themselves. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1854.3999999999999s)]
*  I really wonder. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1855.3999999999999s)]
*  And so I think that a political, I think that means you don't even have to reach [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1856.32s)]
*  the more sophisticated kind of discussions. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1859.24s)]
*  You just have to say that if you're the opposition and it does make me think, [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1861.4799999999998s)]
*  uh, I don't know, just the attack on him and his buddies, the plutocrats, [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1865.1599999999999s)]

*  Shouldn't that be effective politically? [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1872.36s)]
*  I mean, it's really unbelievable to see what's going on. [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1873.84s)]
*  It's being done out in the open and to a degree that really exceeds, I think, [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1876.12s)]
*  the Gilded Age and all the other, you know, sort of things we sort of learn [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1880.12s)]
*  about a little bit of, you know, the sort of unattractive parts of American [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1884.48s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1890.8s)]
*  And you combine it with the, oh, you're just going to have to eat the tariffs. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1891.24s)]
*  It's like, what are these guys eating? [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1895.3999999999999s)]
*  Like, what are they, what sacrifice are they making? [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1897.8s)]
*  Like there's nothing. [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1900.08s)]
*  I mean, not absolute opposite. [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1901.68s)]
*  They're trying to squeeze every penny they can out of the, out of like [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1903.44s)]
*  middle Eastern despots, like in order to like live as opulent lives as they can [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1908.48s)]
*  in order to sell as many of the chips that, right? [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1914.52s)]
*  Like there's no, I, you know, and they're, they're not even shy about it, right? [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1916.48s)]
*  They're not even acting as if that, like there's some greater good [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1921.0800000000002s)]
*  or greater sacrifice. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1924.68s)]
*  I mean, since you mentioned that, just one word on the Walmart [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1925.96s)]
*  tariffs thing, which there was, you know, that Trump attacked Walmart for saying, [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1928.52s)]
*  you know, saying in the earnings call, I guess that they had to raise, they thought [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1932.32s)]
*  that after his prices, which the terrorists and Trump, you got to eat the [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1935.52s)]
*  terrorists and stuff, you have billions of profits, record profits last year, [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1938.08s)]
*  billions of profits. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1941.68s)]
*  And it made me think, I think I was going to write about this. [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1942.8400000000001s)]
*  Maybe I'll do this tomorrow. [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1944.96s)]
*  I was going to write about this today. [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1945.72s)]
*  If Biden, Biden, you said in broken, I mean, who was president last year when [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1946.52s)]
*  Walmart had record profits that Trump is now trumpeting Joe Biden. [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1950.56s)]
*  I mean, the whole Republican narrative, half the time when they're defending [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1955.72s)]
*  things, they have to talk about how, how, how much money everyone was making last [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1959.2s)]
*  year and therefore can afford to suck it up a little bit this year, you know? [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1962.96s)]
*  Um, and so, uh, I, anyway, I mean, I just think the, the degree to which all of our [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1967.0s)]
*  friends, all of us, some of our ex friends and acquaintances who have to justify [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1973.48s)]
*  going to reluctantly vote for Trump because I'm man, Biden, I can't live with that. [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1977.72s)]
*  I mean, you're in the business world. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1982.0400000000002s)]
*  You just, that Biden, he was just, that administration was out to get you. [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1983.1200000000001s)]
*  And then every time you look around, it turns out record profits. [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1986.32s)]
*  The U S has never been doing better, low unemployment. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1989.08s)]
*  Uh, I mean, I don't know. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1992.92s)]
*  I'm just, the Democrats should take more advantage of that. [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1994.72s)]
*  I guess that was the point I was going to make, and maybe we'll make tomorrow morning. [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=1997.4s)]
*  You know, they are the party that defends a healthy version [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2000.4s)]
*  of democratic capitalism today. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2002.8400000000001s)]
*  Republicans defend kleptocratic, you know, oligarchic, um, uh, [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2005.24s)]
*  crony corporate capitalism. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2011.16s)]
*  And I do think the Democrats could do a lot to sort of, because it's [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2013.0800000000002s)]
*  funny how much, don't you find this? [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2016.6000000000001s)]
*  I mean, how much that old argument, which is like 40 years old now, [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2017.8400000000001s)]
*  Reagan, Carter kind of, you know, Montgomery arguments still linger. [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2020.88s)]
*  I don't know if it really lingers in people's minds or it's an excuse for [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2024.5200000000002s)]

*  it is kind of amazing how strong it is after we've had pretty good economies [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2031.16s)]
*  under democratic presidents and the biggest crash happened again, who, uh, [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2034.8000000000002s)]
*  who knows who's to blame, but happened when a Republican [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2040.1599999999999s)]

*  Anyway. [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2120.7200000000003s)]
*  All right. [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2121.1600000000003s)]
*  I could do a rant. [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2121.56s)]
*  I like the fact that oil CEOs. [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2122.2000000000003s)]
*  More mad than anybody actually. [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2123.96s)]
*  I like the fact that you pick on Besant so much. [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2125.36s)]
*  He seems like particularly for a guy who's presumably a senior, you know, [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2127.12s)]
*  been around wall street and high levels and done a million of these kinds of [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2131.36s)]
*  public presentations, he's extremely bad. [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2135.36s)]
*  Isn't he? [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2138.48s)]
*  I mean, unusually, I mean, I found, I find him to be just totally appalling and [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2139.36s)]
*  unappealing and on every level. [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2143.2400000000002s)]
*  And I find it the whole thing embarrassing for anybody who's made it this long [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2145.56s)]
*  without falling into deep despair. [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2149.2400000000002s)]
*  We're going to end with the conspiracy theorists coming home to roost for some [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2150.88s)]
*  of the Trump administration officials. [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2155.12s)]
*  So we can, we can end by kind of enjoying their pain a little bit. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2156.76s)]
*  Um, but, uh, well, let's stick with the economy. [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2161.04s)]
*  So, uh, there's the Moody's, uh, uh, is the, I guess, last, um, ratings [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2163.44s)]
*  agency to downgrade us, and this is related to what is happening on the [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2169.88s)]
*  Hill with this reconciliation bill. [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2173.96s)]
*  Um, and I think there are two elements that I want to talk to you about one. [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2176.92s)]
*  Jonathan Cohen wrote about for us, which is just how, uh, last night, [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2179.28s)]
*  whichever we should go read, it was just about how rushed and how opaque this is [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2183.2400000000002s)]
*  and what the implications of that are. [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2187.0800000000004s)]
*  Uh, but first just really quick on the Moody's side of it. [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2189.76s)]
*  I'll also, it's just like the, the, the debt bomb that is coming, like all of [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2192.36s)]
*  this stuff is interacting together, right? [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2197.1200000000003s)]
*  Like, well, we have these tariffs that are going to, you know, increase [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2199.0400000000004s)]
*  its increased prices on people. [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2202.52s)]
*  We have the, you know, the cuts that are coming to the federal government. [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2204.2000000000003s)]
*  Um, and then you have this tax bill that's going through that is going to [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2207.72s)]
*  increase the deficit more than anything that any of the previous presidents have [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2211.08s)]
*  done in our lifetime, none of whom have been particularly fiscally responsible. [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2215.56s)]
*  And they're going to do it at a time of high interest rates, relatively [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2219.2s)]
*  high interest rates, um, at least recently speaking, maybe not as much [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2221.92s)]
*  with a full historical perspective, but relatively high interest rates. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2225.0s)]
*  And I, the results of which is, is really, you know, going to be us having [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2228.52s)]
*  huge payments on interest on the debt coming during the next decade and like, [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2236.44s)]
*  uh, interest rates staying high, you know, on, on people and business on [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2243.88s)]
*  and develop, and it's, it's just a totally irresponsible bill that they're [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2248.4s)]
*  jamming through and like, you see like little, little, little green shoots of [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2253.52s)]
*  truth coming out of people on the Hill. [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2258.48s)]
*  Plus some Republicans on the Hill that are like, this is like too bad for me [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2260.68s)]
*  to not say anything about. [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2264.28s)]
*  Um, and yet they're, they still like last night in the middle of the night, kind [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2266.0800000000004s)]
*  of advanced it to the next step. [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2269.28s)]
*  So I don't know what you make of all that. [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2270.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2272.6400000000003s)]
*  I like the fact that the rules committee markup in the house now will be, has [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2272.84s)]
*  been scheduled, noticed, you know, formally for 1 a.m. Wednesday morning. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2276.0800000000004s)]
*  I don't think I've ever seen that. [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2281.4s)]
*  Oh, my years. [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2282.52s)]
*  Sometimes things go late. [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2283.4s)]
*  Obviously I like this hearing the other day went all through the night and they [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2284.6000000000004s)]
*  sort of attend that and they want to get it done and they don't care. [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2288.48s)]
*  And it's all kind of rubber stamping. [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2290.88s)]
*  But to actually officially call a hearing for 1 a.m. Wednesday, I think it [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2292.76s)]
*  has to do with them getting it to the floor before Memorial Day and that they [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2296.48s)]
*  don't feel they'll have it done before Wednesday or something. [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2300.5600000000004s)]
*  So that's the earliest they can do it on Wednesday. [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2302.84s)]
*  I don't quite understand the, you know, the rules of how that timing rules of [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2304.5200000000004s)]
*  Congress, so to speak with the rules committee. [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2309.2000000000003s)]
*  Still, it's pretty startling, right? [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2310.88s)]
*  Huge pieces of legislation. [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2312.5200000000004s)]
*  Jonathan Cohen makes a very good point. [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2313.6400000000003s)]
*  Obamacare, I was a pretty big opponent of it and the weekly standard published [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2315.0800000000004s)]
*  more pieces that I care to remember. [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2318.6400000000003s)]
*  And I don't remember, thank God, about all of its problems and deficiencies and bad [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2320.48s)]
*  policies and misleading rhetoric. [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2325.2400000000002s)]
*  That thing was debated for a year and there were eight. [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2327.28s)]
*  There were extensive hearings with critics as well as defenders of it testifying. [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2330.6800000000003s)]
*  Waxman held, I think, eight hearings, Energy and Commerce, and there were [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2335.76s)]
*  others and other committees and every little part of it. [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2338.84s)]
*  Remember all the debates, the death panel? [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2341.6800000000003s)]
*  The reason Sarah Palin was able to discover the death panels and Joe Lieberman [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2343.52s)]
*  was had a huge fight with the left about what was about any more public, the public [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2347.16s)]
*  option and all these things. [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2351.3199999999997s)]
*  It was like, whatever you think of the legislation, it was examined, debated, [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2353.04s)]
*  changed actually in the course of its progress. [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2359.04s)]
*  And here they're jamming it through with a 1 a.m. [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2361.56s)]
*  rules committee markup after a 10 p.m. [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2363.6s)]
*  committee hearing the other night. [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2367.44s)]
*  No public hearings. [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2369.48s)]
*  Lots of it, you know, just released the text what a couple of days ago. [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2371.2s)]
*  So the Medicaid cuts, which are pretty complicated, actually, you know, to figure [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2374.56s)]
*  out. Jonathan's helpful on that, but, you know, still kind of murky. [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2378.2s)]
*  So I think they can don't you think the whole putting it all together? [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2383.0s)]
*  I was thinking about this. I've been a little skeptical that Republicans would [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2385.72s)]
*  pay a real price for it, but I don't know. [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2388.72s)]
*  I think the combination of the tax cuts for the rich, who busting the deficit open [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2390.32s)]
*  as well, cutting Medicaid, the foreign grift that we just saw on this trip. [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2395.0s)]
*  I mean, it is a pretty it's a pretty good story and it's a pretty easy. [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2400.04s)]
*  Sometimes they're good stories, but they're hard to explain or where they cut [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2404.76s)]
*  against the image of the party. [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2407.84s)]
*  So they're a little bit people. [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2409.8s)]
*  Takes a while for people to, you know, to assimilate them. [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2411.36s)]
*  This is like such a perfect, I think, classic Democratic story to tell about [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2413.88s)]
*  what happens when you give Republicans, especially Trump Republicans, control of [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2418.88s)]
*  the executive branch and both houses of the legislature. [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2423.44s)]
*  Yeah, I totally agree. [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2427.52s)]
*  I think that there's going to be real price to be paid for it politically. [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2428.7599999999998s)]
*  And, you know, Trump's instinct, as is usual, like it's just his like lizard [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2432.8399999999997s)]
*  instinct on some of the stuff of breaking from traditional Republican policies [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2438.6s)]
*  when they when they're unpopular was right on this, where he basically kind [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2444.3199999999997s)]
*  of alluded to the fact that he they let the tax increase on whatever 500,000 or [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2447.24s)]
*  600,000 plus earners expire at the tax cut on that top tax bracket expire. [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2452.56s)]
*  And that's still because of what they're doing with a bunch of other stuff. [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2458.7999999999997s)]
*  It still would have, you know, there was still would have been a [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2461.12s)]
*  disproportionate tax benefit for the rich. [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2463.72s)]
*  But that would have complicated the story quite a bit. [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2467.16s)]
*  Right. [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2470.72s)]
*  And, and the fact that these guys in the Hill won't let him do that. [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2471.64s)]
*  And you're just going to kind of jam through a full, full extension of the [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2475.24s)]
*  tax cuts for the rich, in addition to these Medicaid cuts, in addition to the [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2479.8799999999997s)]
*  debt bomb, I just know, I think it's going to be a very easy story to tell. [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2484.04s)]
*  And I don't know that it's, I think it's going to be complicated for them to [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2488.04s)]
*  continue to get it through. [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2492.72s)]
*  I, part of the reason it'll be an easy story to tell is because Republicans are [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2493.76s)]
*  going to help the Democrats tell the story by doing by infighting, you know, [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2496.4s)]
*  Johnson is trying to fight that with this, you know, pushing these stuff through [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2499.8s)]
*  in the dead of night, but you know, it's going to have to, even if they get it [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2503.2400000000002s)]
*  through as a funny aside, Mike Johnson, his threat to people was that they're [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2507.44s)]
*  not going to get to leave for Memorial Day if they don't pass this bill. [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2512.28s)]
*  I wish it was just so insane when you think about it. [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2516.6s)]
*  It's like, you need to jam through this total reordering of the economy or you [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2519.2799999999997s)]
*  don't get to have your Memorial Day vacation. [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2522.56s)]
*  Like it's like a, like they're a child, you know, like they're a teenager who [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2524.48s)]
*  isn't allowed, who isn't going to be allowed to go on the spring break trip [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2529.0s)]
*  with their friends to the, to Mexico unless they get their homework done. [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2532.3599999999997s)]
*  And it's just, it's embarrassing. [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2536.08s)]
*  It's pathetic. [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2537.88s)]
*  But even if they do jam it through this week and then it goes to the Senate, [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2538.7999999999997s)]
*  you know, I, the senators, I senators are still senators. [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2541.92s)]
*  There's still 53 Republican senators that are going to want to put their, you [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2545.56s)]
*  know, mark on it. [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2548.96s)]
*  It's going to be the only thing they do this year. [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2549.8s)]
*  So, you know, the handful of them that still have an ego that hasn't been [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2551.6400000000003s)]
*  totally stripped away from them and given up, you know, to, to Donald Trump, [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2554.44s)]
*  you know, are going to, are going to make changes. [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2562.08s)]
*  So, and they're going to criticize what happens in the house. [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2563.6400000000003s)]
*  So I think they've got major, major issues ahead. [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2566.32s)]
*  Ahead on all this. [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2571.4s)]
*  And the one thing that, the only thing I'd add is, I mean, you and I have [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2572.84s)]
*  emphasized the past Trump's approval rating on important that is for what [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2576.48s)]
*  happens in November 20th, 26th. [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2579.16s)]
*  I think that's true. [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2580.88s)]
*  It also helps though, when you're actually in the last two months of a [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2581.92s)]
*  campaign and running ads to have something they've, your opponent has [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2584.28s)]
*  voted for that is unpopular and bad policy. [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2587.44s)]
*  And so you, I mean, the immigration stuff's horrible and, and, and tariffs [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2591.12s)]
*  are very bad, Congress should be doing things about both, both issues. [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2595.4s)]
*  They're not doing, but no Republican member of Congress has exactly voted [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2598.48s)]
*  for, you could say Trump's, you know, cruel immigration policies or his [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2602.52s)]
*  idiotic back and forth on tariffs. [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2609.04s)]
*  They're going to vote for this. [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2610.84s)]
*  This is a vote. [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2611.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2612.64s)]
*  I mean, the ad writes itself, Mr. [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2612.8s)]
*  so-and-so voted for this massive tax cut for the rich and for cutting [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2614.84s)]
*  healthcare for, for, for working class and middle-class Americans. [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2618.12s)]
*  And, you know, and if there's a little bit of an economic dip over the next [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2621.36s)]
*  year, just to compound it, or anyway, interest rates don't come down. [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2624.96s)]
*  You just tack that on and blame them for all of it. [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2630.88s)]
*  I think it's, yeah. [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2632.88s)]
*  Even the Democrats could probably take advantage of this, you know? [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2635.52s)]
*  I don't know if you saw the story. [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2638.6s)]
*  It's, it's been kind of flying under the radar. [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2639.6s)]
*  Mexico's security chief confirmed Tuesday that 17 family members of [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2641.8s)]
*  cartel leaders crossed into the U S last week as part of a deal between the [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2647.12s)]
*  son of the former head of the Sinaloa cartel and the Trump administration. [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2652.52s)]
*  So it's, this is El Chapo. [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2656.7599999999998s)]
*  Some of El Chapo's brothers and families, family members are, are like walked [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2659.96s)]
*  across the border from Tijuana with suitcases and they are, they're here. [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2666.68s)]
*  His wife, El Chapo's wife, their kid. [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2672.0s)]
*  I mean, it's just like, like this is a matter of fact, CBS story. [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2676.52s)]
*  Again, those, the Mexican security, security secretary that mentioned it. [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2681.44s)]
*  I don't know anything about El Chapo's wife. [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2685.92s)]
*  I've watched enough drug dealing movies to know that the wife usually knows what's [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2689.08s)]
*  happening. I don't, I don't, I don't know that she was in the dark. [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2692.84s)]
*  I don't think that she thought that El Chapo was just like a, a very, you know, [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2695.1600000000003s)]
*  a very successful, you know, businessman selling lawnmowers or whatever to people [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2699.36s)]
*  in, in Mexico city. [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2704.08s)]
*  I think that she knew what was going on. [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2706.2400000000002s)]
*  And the contrast, it's hard to bring this up because the contrast between this, [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2708.16s)]
*  like these guys are making deals with the rich, successful gang members and drug [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2713.04s)]
*  dealers, the ones that, that, that were created, that were bringing fentanyl into [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2719.16s)]
*  the country and, and doing the rapes and the murders. [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2722.6s)]
*  He's making deals with the top guys while they are kidnapping people off the street [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2726.3199999999997s)]
*  who were just, who just happened to be Venezuelan. [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2733.68s)]
*  We're here fleeing communism. [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2736.0s)]
*  Had the wrong tattoo and sent them to a foreign Gulag. [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2737.8399999999997s)]
*  And it is fucking outrageous. [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2741.2799999999997s)]
*  And absolutely like it should be again, because this is the type of thing. [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2744.64s)]
*  I'm not sure why it's one of the radar. [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2751.24s)]
*  It should be the type of thing that people can get, which is like, Trump is doing [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2752.92s)]
*  favors for El Chapo's family as part of a deal while he's kidnapping regular, [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2756.7999999999997s)]
*  regular Venezuelan refugees and sending them to a prison. [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2762.24s)]
*  Uh, you know, it is, I think it was of a piece of the stuff we were talking [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2766.96s)]
*  about in the middle East. [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2771.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2772.56s)]
*  Who made the deal? [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2772.8s)]
*  I mean, it's not as if the border is exactly wide open to people coming [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2773.56s)]
*  from Mexico these days and this family, however, 17 family members show up with [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2776.4s)]
*  the end of the photo was pretty, you know, these large suitcases, I guess [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2780.68s)]
*  there were $70,000 of cash in some of these suitcases was the headline I saw. [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2784.64s)]
*  And so that's not your normal, I'm going to just guess your normal customs agent [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2789.48s)]
*  border patrol guy doesn't just let them through, you know, he's like, [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2793.2400000000002s)]
*  wait a second, this is, I don't think we're supposed to be letting you guys through. [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2796.4799999999996s)]
*  So some orders came down from on high and that's, I guess, Christina, I think [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2799.2799999999997s)]
*  it may be testifying tomorrow. [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2803.0s)]
*  She never answers anything obviously, but it really would be where exactly who [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2804.04s)]
*  ordered that these people be let in what deal was cut and by who was Donald Trump [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2807.9599999999996s)]
*  Jr. [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2812.56s)]
*  I mean, God knows, right? [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2813.3199999999997s)]
*  Right. [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2815.04s)]
*  What was the deal? [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2815.3199999999997s)]
*  What did we get out of it? [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2815.8399999999997s)]
*  What was the exchange? [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2816.7999999999997s)]
*  Um, well on this point, just a reminder folks June 6th, uh, me and John Lovett, [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2818.3999999999996s)]

*  We're going to be doing a fundraiser, uh, for, uh, Andrea Hernandez, Romero, [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2824.68s)]

*  Romero, and a couple of the other folks that have been, uh, disappeared to [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2832.48s)]
*  El Salvador. [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2835.7599999999998s)]
*  So come hang with us. [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2836.2799999999997s)]
*  If you're in Washington, June, June 6th, uh, it's going to be serious. [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2837.16s)]
*  I'm going to rant and yell, but we'll also laugh a little bit and have some fun [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2842.52s)]
*  because it is world pride. [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2846.44s)]
*  So hopefully, you know, it won't be too big of a downer for you on your Friday [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2847.4s)]
*  night. [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2850.52s)]
*  Um, all right. [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2850.8s)]

*  Bon Gino. [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2856.0s)]
*  Um, so the fact that this had to be scheduled, I just think tells you a lot [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2857.0800000000004s)]
*  about the priorities of the Trump administration and who they're responsive [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2865.0s)]
*  to, uh, there's been outside of the view of almost everybody listening to this, [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2868.5600000000004s)]
*  except for those who like me, like enjoy following random mega weirdos on [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2873.6800000000003s)]
*  social media. [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2877.88s)]
*  Um, there's been some angst about how the FBI has not been following through [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2878.92s)]
*  on a lot of the conspiracy theories that were advanced in the mega world. [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2885.76s)]
*  Why hasn't any of the Biden crime family been arrested yet? [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2889.96s)]
*  Just want something that comes up. [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2893.04s)]
*  Why haven't they revealed that it was the deep state that was behind the [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2894.28s)]
*  assassination attempts or the Russia hoax? [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2899.12s)]
*  Why haven't they revealed that it was the Clintons that were behind the Epstein [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2901.92s)]
*  murder? [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2905.2400000000002s)]
*  Oh, this is, you know, there's some, you know, some of the people, some of the [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2906.2s)]
*  rubes like want the payoff on, on the QAnon stuff. [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2910.24s)]
*  Like they got the QAnon guys and the FBI. [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2913.7999999999997s)]
*  So where's the payoff? [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2916.24s)]
*  And so in order to manage this, Kash and Bon Gino do a joint interview with Maria [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2918.04s)]
*  Barrett-Romo, the biggest conspiracy theorist on Fox, just an insane scene. [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2922.56s)]
*  And, uh, and I want to play a couple of clips from it. [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2927.92s)]
*  First, uh, first their response to the Epstein situation. [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2930.0s)]
*  You said Jeffrey Epstein committed suicide. [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2932.7999999999997s)]
*  People don't believe it. [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2937.04s)]
*  Well, I mean, listen, they have a right to their opinion, but as someone who has [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2938.12s)]
*  worked as a public defender, as a prosecutor who's been in that prison system, [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2943.24s)]
*  who's been in the Metropolitan detention center, who's been in segregated housing, [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2946.96s)]
*  um, you know, a suicide when you see one. [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2950.88s)]
*  And that's what that was. [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2953.04s)]
*  He killed himself. [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2955.16s)]
*  You, again, you want me to, I've, I've seen the whole file. [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2956.72s)]
*  He killed himself. [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2960.0s)]
*  Hmm. [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2960.72s)]
*  Uh, I don't know. [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2962.24s)]
*  The lady doth protest too much, maybe a little bit for me. [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2963.08s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2966.04s)]
*  I always come back to why that Epstein didn't kill himself is not a conspiracy [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2966.3199999999997s)]
*  theory about Donald Trump, who we know had a very close relationship with Jeffrey [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2970.6s)]
*  Epstein was pictured with him, flew with him, was president when Jeffrey Epstein [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2974.9199999999996s)]
*  killed himself. [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2978.8399999999997s)]
*  Uh, so he was in the custody of federal, uh, federal officials in the Trump [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2980.3999999999996s)]
*  administration. [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2985.7999999999997s)]
*  He had cabinet members and Alex Acosta, uh, and he was in the [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2986.68s)]
*  That were, that did lawyering on behalf of, uh, on behalf of Epstein, at least [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2991.04s)]
*  his firms did. [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2995.68s)]
*  And so I don't know anyway, if you're going to be a conspiracy theorist, it's [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=2996.96s)]
*  kind of intriguing. [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=3001.2799999999997s)]
*  It's kind of intriguing. [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=3002.48s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=3003.48s)]
*  Maybe it, maybe it's Trump or maybe it's nothing, but it's funny that these guys [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=3003.92s)]
*  had to go do the hostage tape about how Jeffrey Epstein really, really killed [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=3007.64s)]
*  himself. [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=3011.3599999999997s)]
*  What'd you think? [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=3012.3199999999997s)]
*  Did you enjoy that clip? [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=3012.68s)]
*  I did. [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=3013.7999999999997s)]
*  I was a little struck also that of course they are able to see, they were able to [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=3014.16s)]
*  knock down conspiracies when they want to and say, I've looked at the facts and [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=3018.2s)]
*  it's not true. [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=3022.24s)]
*  So for me, it brings home how unbelievably irresponsible, it's not even [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=3023.2s)]
*  the word, even close to the word, uh, you know, cynical and demagogic they are in [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=3028.3599999999997s)]
*  exploiting the people who believe in all these things. [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=3032.7999999999997s)]
*  They don't believe it. [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=3035.24s)]
*  I think that's a bit of a mistake. [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=3036.2799999999997s)]
*  Some of our friends make that, you know, they're all gone down this rabbit hole. [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=3037.7599999999998s)]
*  I don't believe that they all know what they're doing. [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=3040.8799999999997s)]
*  They are all utterly cynical, uh, people exploiting, you know, foolishness and [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=3043.48s)]
*  misinformation for their own political and mercenary ends, but they're, they're [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=3050.64s)]
*  also capable of when they feel they have to, of course, they knock down the, the, [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=3055.56s)]
*  theories. [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=3059.36s)]
*  So then weren't you amused by how much the rhetoric is so much like it when one of, [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=3059.68s)]
*  you know, a public health official says, look, I'm sorry, I've looked at the data. [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=3063.52s)]
*  It's not right. [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=3066.36s)]
*  I mean, it's like suddenly they sound like, you know, semi-normal public [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=3067.0s)]
*  officials, right? [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=3070.56s)]
*  Yeah, no, immediately. [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=3071.64s)]
*  Dan Bongino has to sound like you, Andrew McCabe, right? [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=3073.0s)]
*  Or like whoever, right? [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=3076.8s)]
*  It's like having to do the responsible thing. [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=3077.84s)]
*  And the only silver lining, I guess, is that I know there was an alternate [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=3079.92s)]
*  universe for cash and Dan Bongino were, you know, trumping up charges on people [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=3083.84s)]
*  over all of this stuff. [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=3089.0800000000004s)]
*  So I guess this is preferable to that. [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=3090.0800000000004s)]
*  But no, your point is well taken just about how like embarrassing it is that [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=3092.1600000000003s)]
*  you, anybody who's being honest with themselves, if cash or Bongino had not [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=3095.5600000000004s)]
*  let's do a different counterfactual had come low one cash and Bongino would have [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=3102.04s)]
*  been every day on their podcasts, on their social media feeds, on their grifty [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=3107.3599999999997s)]
*  book tours, talking about how the Harris administration was covering up, you know, [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=3112.7599999999998s)]
*  Epstein because of a Clinton body count or whatever, and how they're covering up [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=3118.08s)]
*  the fact that the assassination attempt on Trump was a deep state effort to take [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=3122.2s)]
*  out the, you know, Republican presidential candidate and they would be banging the [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=3126.64s)]
*  drum on that. They'd be getting rich on that. [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=3131.16s)]
*  That is what those guys would be doing. [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=3133.3199999999997s)]
*  There is absolutely no doubt about it. [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=3134.68s)]
*  And you get into a area of responsibility and they have to say what is real and [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=3136.8399999999997s)]
*  it to be, I guess, the victim of the type of demagoguery they would have been [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=3144.92s)]
*  engaging. Well, the types are still engaged in the issues where it's useful [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=3149.16s)]
*  for them to engage it. They certainly haven't come clean. [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=3151.7999999999997s)]
*  They haven't looked at all the data and decide, you know what, that 2020 election [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=3153.7599999999998s)]
*  wasn't rigged. I believe that I believe the evidence for that is as strong [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=3156.8799999999997s)]
*  maybe stronger than the evidence of Jeffrey Epstein having committed suicide. [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=3161.2s)]
*  You know, there's like a lot more impartial observers who have said the 2020 [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=3165.96s)]
*  election was not rigged. Why don't why don't why doesn't one of them tell the [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=3169.2799999999997s)]
*  truth about that? That would actually be a contribution to the public welfare, [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=3172.6s)]
*  you know. [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=3175.48s)]
*  It's a great point, Bill. [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=3176.3999999999996s)]
*  Just for kicks, let's listen to them talk about the assassination attempts, too. [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=3177.56s)]
*  Are we going to be surprised at what you learned? [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=3180.68s)]
*  The there you're looking for is not there. [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=3183.16s)]
*  And I know people I get it. [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=3185.8399999999997s)]
*  I understand it's not there. [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=3188.2799999999997s)]
*  If it was there, we would have told you. [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=3191.9599999999996s)]
*  This goes on for like a minute and a half. [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=3195.04s)]
*  I just I spared everybody. [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=3196.52s)]
*  But it's hilarious. It's like it's like damn, but you know, who was a podcast [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=3198.08s)]
*  host advancing these conspiracies. [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=3201.3199999999997s)]
*  Now it's like, you know, I know that there's a there that you're looking for, [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=3204.3999999999996s)]
*  that I promised you would be there, that I'd tell you there, that there was some [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=3207.12s)]
*  evil deep state that was going to go out, that was going after Mr. Trump. [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=3209.72s)]
*  But actually, it wasn't that. [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=3212.3599999999997s)]
*  The problem was that, you know, we live in a society with a with a way too easy [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=3213.2799999999997s)]
*  proliferation of guns and weaponry and bullets and that a crazy young man [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=3217.08s)]
*  was able to get access to all of that and go after Donald Trump. [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=3222.84s)]
*  And that actually that's the problem, not not the conspiracy theory [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=3226.48s)]
*  that you want it to be. But, you know, it's fun watching them squirm. [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=3229.08s)]
*  It is now. Did you get to enjoy watching them? [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=3234.04s)]
*  I did. I did. I pardon me. I just can't still. [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=3236.0s)]
*  It's fun watching the squirm, but it's kind of bad for the country [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=3238.7999999999997s)]
*  that they're in the positions they're in. [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=3241.72s)]
*  I'm just going to remind you extremely not to end down or node. [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=3242.7999999999997s)]
*  I know we're not going to know we're ending on an upbeat note, [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=3245.28s)]
*  but I just look at those. [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=3247.2400000000002s)]
*  I did an FBI director, Cash Patel and deputy FBI director [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=3248.4s)]
*  Dan Bongino, that those words have to cross our lips in that order. [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=3252.88s)]
*  I can't I can't quite live with that. [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=3257.2400000000002s)]
*  I hear you. I must add that this morning at the press conference, [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=3260.44s)]
*  the trust briefing, just in case you thought that maybe once the people [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=3264.32s)]
*  heard from Cash and Dan that the that that would be the final word on the matter. [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=3268.52s)]
*  Unfortunately, not in the new media seat where Andrew Egger once sat. [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=3273.52s)]
*  They brought in a gentleman named Zero Hedge. [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=3278.2s)]
*  It's funny, if you've seen this guy on Twitter, his Twitter picture, [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=3282.04s)]
*  is it still like that? Oh, yeah. [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=3286.68s)]
*  His Twitter picture is maybe from the movie Fight Club. [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=3288.04s)]
*  I don't know. We need a bunch to tell me what movie it's from, [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=3291.6s)]
*  but it's an image of a shirtless, muscled man with like a like a little bit of blood [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=3294.2799999999997s)]
*  coming down the middle of his body, showing how tough this guy is. [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=3299.08s)]
*  I've never seen the person's face. I've seen his Twitter account. [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=3302.24s)]
*  There he was in the Andrew Egger chair and the new media chair in the briefing room. [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=3304.56s)]
*  And he looks like the biggest dork, like the biggest just total dweeb. [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=3308.3599999999997s)]
*  Couldn't even comb his hair. [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=3313.3999999999996s)]
*  I don't think he's ever done a bicep curl. [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=3314.52s)]
*  And there he was asking [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=3316.68s)]
*  our press secretary, Carolyn Levitt, about the Clinton body count [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=3319.64s)]
*  and how Jeffrey Epstein was maybe the most famous Clinton related suicide. [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=3324.04s)]
*  And he points to allegations of a blackmail ring [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=3329.3199999999997s)]
*  with potential ties to the Israeli government, [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=3332.24s)]
*  which I think I think might be part of the anti-Semitism campaign [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=3336.0s)]
*  that the administration is going after. [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=3339.64s)]
*  But this guy didn't qualify for that, I guess. [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=3341.3199999999997s)]
*  But it's pretty it's it's no way that there we are. [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=3344.3999999999996s)]
*  And it just it feels like we're in a total Looney Tunes world [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=3346.7999999999997s)]
*  with the FBI director and the deputy FBI director have to be like, [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=3349.6s)]
*  no, this stuff isn't true. [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=3352.3199999999997s)]
*  And then the next day anyway, they put a guy in the briefing room [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=3353.4399999999996s)]
*  to be like, well, you never know. [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=3358.16s)]
*  And Carolyn Levitt, instead of saying [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=3359.76s)]
*  this is an insane question, this is not true. [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=3362.6800000000003s)]
*  I refer you to Cash Patel's interview yesterday. [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=3366.0s)]
*  She said, no, you know, Pam Bondi and the DOJ is looking into it. [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=3368.6000000000004s)]
*  Next question. [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=3371.6400000000003s)]
*  Geez. It's a pretty sad state of affairs, Bill. [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=3372.6000000000004s)]
*  Not good. I think we're just not good. [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=3375.4s)]
*  We're not beaten out. But OK, how about this? [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=3377.5600000000004s)]
*  Because this is not beat. [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=3380.0800000000004s)]
*  No. Trump wants to investigate Bruce Springsteen. [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=3380.8s)]
*  That's another bleep from the weekend. [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=3385.7200000000003s)]
*  How much should Kamala Harris pay Bruce Springsteen [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=3387.52s)]
*  for his poor performance during her campaign as president? [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=3390.2400000000002s)]
*  I'm going to call for a major investigation into this matter. [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=3393.2s)]
*  Isn't that a made illegal campaign contribution? [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=3396.52s)]
*  So there you go. [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=3399.76s)]
*  What's that? Well, it's all it's all, you know, there there. [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=3401.28s)]

*  No question there. [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=3406.08s)]
*  They're concerned about the forgotten man. [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=3407.2s)]
*  They're worried about, you know, bringing back jobs, you know, to industrial America. [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=3409.28s)]
*  And as part of the process, they just need a palace in the sky. [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=3413.88s)]
*  They need to investigate Bruce Springsteen and the Disney Corporation [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=3417.08s)]
*  and, you know, make sure El Chapo's family members [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=3421.48s)]
*  get back into the country safe and sound. [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=3424.7599999999998s)]
*  It's a great, good agenda. [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=3426.96s)]
*  Make America great again. Well said. Well said. [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=3428.56s)]
*  All right. And I guess we should also close just [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=3431.7599999999998s)]
*  just once again at the story. [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=3437.2799999999997s)]
*  So fucking sad. It just really sucks so bad. [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=3439.48s)]
*  So best wishes to President Biden, his recovery. [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=3441.64s)]
*  And hopefully kind of what they alluded to there at the end of the statement [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=3444.04s)]
*  about how it is treatable. [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=3449.32s)]
*  Hopefully that turns out to be the case. [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=3451.92s)]
*  I know we've all had a bunch of friends who have gone through cancer [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=3453.24s)]
*  and it sucks and the treatment sucks. [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=3455.72s)]
*  And so sending our best wishes to him and his family. [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=3457.32s)]
*  We've got a good guest tomorrow. [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSgOR5yWwRw&t=3462.0s)]
