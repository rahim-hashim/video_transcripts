Video Description: Our VP used to think his path to power was through the ruling class at Yale Law School. But after 2016, he saw that his route was through Trump, so he swapped one set of elites for another. And now as a lord among the MAGA ruling class, he's embracing his true cruel, lying self—and railing against the globalists who nitpick about this silly due process thing. Plus, America: stay and fight. The Atlantic's George Packer joins Tim Miller.

# What’s Behind JD Vance’s Cynical MAGA Makeover? (w/ George Packer) | Bulwark Podcast
**The Bulwark Podcast:** [May 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ)
*  I find JD Vance to be the least appealing person in all of public life. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=0.0s)]
*  If I had to spend the rest of my life with Ted Cruz living in an apartment, I would rather [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=4.72s)]
*  do that than have to go on a single road trip with JD Vance. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=11.040000000000001s)]
*  I think it's all bulls**t. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=14.8s)]
*  And I think he's a sociopath. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=16.12s)]
*  I think he's mean. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=18.32s)]
*  Hello and welcome to the Bulwark Podcast. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=21.32s)]
*  I'm your host, Tim Miller. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=28.36s)]
*  First, he's a staff writer at The Atlantic. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=29.64s)]
*  He wrote a profile recently of JD Vance called The Talented Mr. Vance. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=31.759999999999998s)]
*  Welcoming back George Packer. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=36.28s)]
*  How are you doing, George? [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=37.28s)]
*  I'm well. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=38.28s)]
*  How are you, Tim? [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=39.28s)]
*  I'm doing pretty good, all things considered. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=40.28s)]
*  Personally, that's how I have to put it these days. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=43.32s)]
*  I'm personally well. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=46.28s)]
*  Great. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=48.28s)]
*  Everything is good. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=49.28s)]
*  School's out. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=50.28s)]
*  Kids happy. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=51.28s)]
*  I'm in Chicago. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=52.28s)]
*  We're taping a live show with Adam Kinzinger tonight that everybody will be able to listen [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=53.28s)]
*  to tomorrow. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=56.32s)]
*  It's as cold as balls in Chicago. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=57.519999999999996s)]
*  So interpersonally, that's my only real complaint right now. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=59.32s)]
*  And mine is that the New York City schools don't let out until mid-June. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=62.4s)]
*  Oh, man. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=65.24s)]
*  Well, no, that's a win. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=66.24s)]
*  I would trade you. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=69.03999999999999s)]
*  I could use two more weeks of school. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=70.36s)]
*  I guess it's not me. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=72.56s)]
*  It's my husband that's doing parenting. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=73.56s)]
*  There's wins and losses. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=75.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=76.32s)]
*  All right. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=77.32s)]
*  I guess I had one more complaint. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=78.32s)]
*  It's that both these NBA conference finals are looking like they're going to be kind [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=80.52s)]
*  of boring. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=83.75999999999999s)]
*  So anyway, that's all I got. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=84.75999999999999s)]
*  Wait a minute. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=85.75999999999999s)]
*  You mean small market teams because they are really exciting teams to watch. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=86.76s)]
*  Oh, they're great. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=91.96000000000001s)]
*  They're great to watch. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=93.2s)]
*  They're kind of corny and she flops around a lot. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=94.2s)]
*  But I meant more like this Pacers-Nicks series is so fun. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=96.76s)]
*  I wanted seven games. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=99.96000000000001s)]
*  I'm annoyed that it might be ending sooner than I'd wished. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=100.96000000000001s)]
*  But alas, you never know. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=105.32000000000001s)]
*  Maybe the Knicks will do a miracle comeback. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=109.44s)]
*  I doubt it. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=111.56s)]
*  But I'm just excited that Oklahoma and Indiana look like they're going to be in the finals [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=112.56s)]
*  which is a very improbable sentence to utter. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=116.56s)]
*  I guess I'm not ready to be happy for the Oklahoma people yet, but that's for another [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=121.88s)]
*  day. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=125.24000000000001s)]
*  All right. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=126.24000000000001s)]
*  The talented Mr. Vance. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=127.24000000000001s)]
*  Obviously, this is a play on talented Mr. Ripley, the shapeshifter. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=128.24s)]
*  He said at least three names. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=130.96s)]
*  Donald Bowman for a while, James David Hamill, JD Vance. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=133.88s)]
*  Some of that is not his choice as a childhood, his mother's choices, but changing your name [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=138.84s)]
*  is adults. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=142.52s)]
*  It's kind of a weird decision and I think maybe reflective. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=143.52s)]
*  Talk to us about why you framed it up like that. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=147.48000000000002s)]
*  I don't fault him for changing his name. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=149.56s)]
*  I think that had to do with who he felt the closest figure to his father was and there [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=151.52s)]
*  really weren't very many good choices. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=156.84s)]
*  It's kind of a gender affirming change, maybe. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=159.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=163.04000000000002s)]
*  I mean, there's an obvious analogy to the talented Mr. Ripley because JD Vance has transformed [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=164.04000000000002s)]
*  himself before the country's eyes twice, you could say. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=172.6s)]
*  The first time he went from being the son of a relatively poor and broken family in [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=178.4s)]
*  a declining steel town in Ohio with Appalachian roots, a member of what he would call the [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=187.51999999999998s)]
*  hillbilly culture or the white working class to a shining star of the Ivy League, of Ventura [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=194.35999999999999s)]
*  Capital and of number one bestsellerdom with his book Hillbilly Elegy, which really holds [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=202.56s)]
*  up. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=209.68s)]
*  I reread it for the piece. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=210.68s)]
*  It is a really good book. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=211.68s)]
*  And then again, it is. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=214.08s)]
*  That hurts me inside. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=216.64000000000001s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=217.64000000000001s)]
*  George Packer thinks it's still a really good book. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=218.64000000000001s)]
*  Part of being the bulwark means being able to say a book on the other side of a partisan [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=222.08s)]
*  line is a good book. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=228.08s)]
*  For sure. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=230.24s)]
*  I'm happy to give credit where to. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=231.64000000000001s)]
*  Well, as we're about to get into, JD particularly rubs me the wrong way. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=232.88s)]
*  And so it's not really an ideological point. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=237.44s)]
*  It's more of, I find him very annoying. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=239.8s)]
*  It's a cellular point. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=242.88s)]
*  Well, look, and then the next transformation, of course, was from thoughtful, sensitive, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=244.36s)]
*  complex spokesmen about the troubles of the white working class to fire breathing culture [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=251.52s)]
*  warrior, mega knight onto the White House and looking like heir apparent to Trump. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=257.16s)]
*  And so that's an incredible journey, unbelievably fast and zigzaggy roller coaster, like a kind [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=266.12s)]
*  of to me, almost a literary story. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=275.04s)]
*  I kept imagining him as the protagonist of a novel, talented Mr. Ripley or Pip in Great [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=277.72s)]
*  Expectations. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=284.76000000000005s)]
*  Because some poor kid from the provinces who keeps rising and rising and rising and does [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=285.8s)]
*  it at some cost to himself and others. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=291.36s)]
*  Yes, the novel, a tragedy with the main character. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=294.96000000000004s)]
*  It's not a tragedy. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=298.6s)]
*  It's not a tragedy. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=299.6s)]
*  It's a tragedy maybe for the country. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=300.96000000000004s)]
*  For him, it's been a kind of miracle success story. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=306.16s)]
*  Although those don't often, they don't always end well, those miracle success stories. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=312.68s)]
*  So we don't know. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=317.24s)]
*  It's really the big question of the future is whether he will inherit the crown or whether [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=319.2s)]
*  the crown itself will be so tarnished and the country so sick of it that it'll have [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=327.44s)]
*  been the worst decision of his life to have tied himself to Donald Trump. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=332.24s)]
*  We don't know. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=336.12s)]
*  You talked about all the various transitions and we've spent a million podcast hours, [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=337.12s)]
*  at least on JD going from me basically, the never Trump or David from to being Donald [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=346.64s)]
*  Trump's butt boy. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=354.56s)]
*  So I kind of want to set that transition aside for a second. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=356.08s)]
*  And since you just read Hillbillyology, there's I think a less analyzed transition, which [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=359.64s)]
*  the heart of that book was an ethos of like this culture has problems. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=364.32s)]
*  You know, like there are, you know, culture that folks need to take responsibility and [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=371.36s)]
*  the opportunity arises for somebody who's able to overcome the cultural issues like [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=377.20000000000005s)]
*  himself. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=382.52000000000004s)]
*  That's kind of the arc of the story. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=383.52000000000004s)]
*  And that story that he tells now is that these folks are all the people he grew up with are [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=384.52000000000004s)]
*  victims, that they were abused by the globalist society and they have no chance in the meritocracy [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=389.88s)]
*  and these elites have been out to get them. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=398.32s)]
*  I'm not sure what you make of that art. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=400.71999999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=404.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=405.44s)]
*  At one point when he was outselling the book, he said there's a, in fact, I think this was [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=406.44s)]
*  an interview with Rod Dreher of the American Conservative. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=411.04s)]
*  He said there's a tendency in the white working class to blame society and government for [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=413.88s)]
*  all of their ills. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=419.88s)]
*  And that's a very dangerous tendency. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=421.24s)]
*  I'm paraphrasing that in a capsule is what the book says and what you what you just said. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=424.0s)]
*  It's a it's a lacerating self-portrait, portrait of his family, portrait of his people. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=431.92s)]
*  It holds nothing back. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=438.71999999999997s)]
*  What I admire about it is the honesty and the quality of the prose. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=440.88s)]
*  But that honesty requires him to say, we've brought a lot of this on ourselves. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=446.64s)]
*  There's a lot of self-pity. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=453.52s)]
*  There's, yes, there are larger forces. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=454.52s)]
*  There's globalization. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=457.76s)]
*  There's trade. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=458.96s)]
*  He doesn't talk about immigration very much in, if at all, in Hillbilly Elegy for some [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=459.96s)]
*  reason. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=465.56s)]
*  But he blames, yeah, he does talk about the structural forces, but mostly he talks about [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=466.72s)]
*  how those structural forces have produced a culture of defeat, of decline and of grievance. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=471.4s)]
*  And he thinks that that's very dangerous and wants to tell people like him, young people [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=478.32s)]
*  like him, I made it out. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=484.8s)]
*  Here's how I did it. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=486.76s)]
*  I had some mentors. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=487.76s)]
*  I had some people looking out for me and I didn't give up because they didn't give up [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=488.76s)]
*  on me and you don't need to give up either. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=493.24s)]
*  So it's a bit of a, you know, bootstrap story. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=495.82s)]
*  And now, as you say, the story is globalist elites, childless cat ladies, Haitian immigrants. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=501.09999999999997s)]
*  There are these groups who he demonizes regularly and everything that he says, whether it's [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=510.3s)]
*  making up a lie about the Haitian immigrants eating pets or anything else, he justifies [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=518.02s)]
*  in the name of those victims, the working class victims of his world. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=524.9s)]
*  So how did that happen? [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=530.6s)]
*  Well, I think one reason is Donald Trump was elected president in 2016 and pretty quickly [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=532.6s)]
*  JD Vance realized that his path to politics was now blocked as long as he was Tim Miller [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=539.32s)]
*  because Tim Miller was not going to become a star of the Republican Party after 2016. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=546.82s)]
*  I spoke to a close friend of Vance's who said, no, look, this is what happened. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=554.38s)]
*  He had a legitimate change of view about tariffs and trade, immigration and Trump himself. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=559.84s)]
*  And this came from having gone back to Ohio. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=568.22s)]
*  A new friend or an old friend? [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=572.5400000000001s)]
*  An old friend. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=574.62s)]
*  An old friend. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=575.62s)]
*  He has? [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=576.62s)]
*  I want to sit on this for a second. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=577.62s)]
*  He does. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=578.62s)]
*  He has old friends? [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=579.62s)]
*  He does. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=580.62s)]
*  So just as I defended Hillbilly Elegy, I will tell you that Vance has remained quite loyal [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=581.62s)]
*  to a handful of men from Ohio and from the Marine Corps. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=587.9s)]
*  And they were at his inauguration. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=595.3s)]
*  They've gone to the vice president's residence in Washington. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=597.22s)]
*  So he has not cut loose all the people who are no longer useful to him. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=601.3s)]
*  Just some of them. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=606.62s)]
*  People like David Frum, he's cut loose. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=607.94s)]
*  But they've, so somebody really told you, I just can't see how you could possibly believe [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=609.98s)]
*  that it's a genuine transition to switch on every single thing to make it the most [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=615.4200000000001s)]
*  convenient thing at a moment. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=620.46s)]
*  I think a more workable theory that I have is he's really good at mirroring a mentor, [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=621.66s)]
*  like his mentors. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=626.74s)]
*  I mean, Amy Chua? [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=627.74s)]
*  Chua? [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=628.74s)]
*  Chua? [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=629.74s)]
*  Is that how you pronounce it? [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=630.74s)]
*  Chua? [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=631.74s)]
*  And I think even more importantly, Peter Thiel. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=632.74s)]
*  Right. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=634.02s)]
*  Well, so, but let me just go through the progression, right? [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=635.02s)]
*  Amy Chua was really kind of a bootstraps tiger. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=636.54s)]
*  Like that was the thing, right? [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=639.82s)]
*  Like tiger mom, right? [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=641.14s)]
*  Like you can do it yourself and your family and you have to take responsibility, right? [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=642.14s)]
*  So that is like kind of a lot of the ethos and hillbilly elegies from a different cultural [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=648.5s)]
*  perspective. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=652.86s)]
*  And then he kind of takes after Frum's view, which was at the time a little bit different [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=654.02s)]
*  than kind of the in vogue Republican view on various, on some of these issues. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=661.76s)]
*  It was reformist. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=666.3s)]
*  Reform, right? [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=667.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=668.3s)]
*  And so, and then Thiel, right? [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=669.3s)]
*  And then it becomes more, you know, and then he slowly starts moving more towards, you [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=671.06s)]
*  know, whatever you'd call the tech utopian Trumpist view. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=675.38s)]
*  And then that gets him a Senate seat. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=680.26s)]
*  And then he starts mirroring all of Trump's views. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=682.06s)]
*  Tucker Carlson, Don Jr., and Trump himself. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=684.66s)]
*  So isn't that a more coherent explanation? [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=687.94s)]
*  That's a legitimate story that you just told. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=690.98s)]
*  There's a lot of truth to it. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=693.74s)]
*  I don't know quite how to say this. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=696.78s)]
*  I feel like as a writer, I need to allow for some degree of good faith in what I hear. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=699.98s)]
*  I don't want to just assume every word out of his mouth is cynical and opportunistic. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=709.02s)]
*  I don't think it is. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=713.7s)]
*  I don't think people are that way. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=714.66s)]
*  People convince themselves of things. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=716.7s)]
*  And as I wrote in the piece, ventriloquize long enough and your voice changes. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=719.78s)]
*  The mask becomes your face. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=725.42s)]
*  And so if he imitated the way of speaking, he heard from David, from Peter Thiel, Tucker [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=727.38s)]
*  Carlson, it has become him. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=735.66s)]
*  That's who he is. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=738.22s)]
*  He's not going home and saying to Usha, I can't believe I just use the phrase childless [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=739.1s)]
*  cat ladies. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=745.22s)]
*  But I agree with that. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=747.38s)]
*  Yes. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=748.66s)]
*  He convinced himself that it was a real conversion. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=749.18s)]
*  But I think there may be one other thing to it, Tim. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=752.62s)]
*  I'm agreeing mostly with what you say. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=755.7399999999999s)]
*  I think it's possible he's decided tariffs are the way to bring back manufacturing. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=759.0999999999999s)]
*  I think that's quite possible. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=762.8599999999999s)]
*  I think he's quite possibly decided that the open border was a disaster for the working [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=764.54s)]
*  class. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=771.38s)]
*  He may well have decided those things. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=772.14s)]
*  I can't know for sure. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=774.02s)]
*  But here's one thing that I think has been at work. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=775.78s)]
*  The new JD Vance, aggressive, vitriolic, combative, getting into Twitter fights with [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=780.18s)]
*  not particularly famous journalists and using a lot of inflammatory language about groups [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=788.3399999999999s)]
*  like immigrants. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=795.26s)]
*  I think it's been a sort of relief because think about what it took to make himself [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=796.74s)]
*  acceptable at Yale Law School. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=805.78s)]
*  He writes about this at length in Hillbilly Elegy. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=810.26s)]
*  His girlfriend, now wife, Usha, became his Yale spirit guide. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=812.82s)]
*  She taught him how to use the silverware at a fancy dinner party and what seltzer water [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=817.3s)]
*  was for Christ's sake and how to take advantage of office hours and go to the right interviews [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=823.58s)]
*  and behave correctly. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=832.0200000000001s)]
*  I hear you. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=833.26s)]
*  I'm serious. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=833.94s)]
*  We all went away to Cal. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=834.82s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=836.1800000000001s)]
*  I didn't know fucking shit when I went to GW either. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=836.62s)]
*  I just some of this stuff is a little bit a little bit dramatized. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=839.38s)]
*  He may be dramatizing himself. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=843.5s)]
*  I don't know what seltzer water was either. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=845.34s)]
*  We didn't have it in my house. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=847.34s)]
*  I don't know where you grew up, Tim. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=848.38s)]
*  Did you grow up with? [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=850.1800000000001s)]
*  No, I didn't grow up anywhere like JD Vance. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=851.7800000000001s)]
*  I had a great childhood, but I was a sheltered suburban kid. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=853.5s)]
*  His parents went to church. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=856.62s)]
*  I didn't. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=858.14s)]
*  I'd never been to New York or any big city when I went to college. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=858.86s)]
*  And so there were things I didn't know. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=862.78s)]
*  There were a lot more kids at my. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=864.2199999999999s)]
*  So you think it's a bit of an exaggeration and you know what? [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=865.9s)]
*  A little bit. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=868.2199999999999s)]
*  Some of the witnesses would agree with you. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=868.86s)]
*  I talked to a friend of his from Yale Law School who said, we all were intrigued by this guy. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=871.18s)]
*  Not having gone to Yale or Harvard undergrad didn't hurt him at all. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=877.8199999999999s)]
*  He was charismatic. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=880.86s)]
*  He was confident. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=882.14s)]
*  So I think he may have overplayed that. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=883.42s)]
*  But I also think there's something called the ordeal of civility. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=887.1s)]
*  It's a book by a sociologist, I think, in the 70s. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=891.9s)]
*  And it's really about how people from kind of disadvantaged ethnic groups, racial groups, [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=894.62s)]
*  religious groups, minorities come into the world of the elites, the cosmopolitans, [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=900.38s)]
*  the meritocrats, as we now call them, and have to fit. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=908.14s)]
*  They have to change a bit, maybe even the way they talk, the way they act. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=912.78s)]
*  And it costs them something psychologically. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=916.6999999999999s)]
*  And Vance writes about this, how when he was and talks about this, [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=919.26s)]
*  when he was out thumping Hillbilly elegy, he would have these fancy dinners with CEOs [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=924.14s)]
*  because he was a star at this point. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=929.18s)]
*  And they would inevitably say something vaguely offensive, like, yeah, you know, [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=931.5s)]
*  you just can't get good help anymore in some of these towns or, you know, [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=936.86s)]
*  immigration has helped me because I don't have to pay my workers as much. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=941.1s)]
*  Things that are going to piss off a son of that world. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=944.9399999999999s)]
*  He probably bit his tongue most of the time. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=949.42s)]
*  And this is like he's now back. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=952.06s)]
*  I thought of calling the piece, it's not up to me what to call it. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=954.6999999999999s)]
*  But my working title was The Return of the Repressed because he repressed [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=957.9s)]
*  that angry combative. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=963.8199999999999s)]
*  You challenge my honor. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=966.06s)]
*  I'm going to take you on Hillbilly culture that he writes about. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=968.06s)]
*  And now he's been rewarded beyond his dreams for that very same attitude. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=971.8199999999999s)]
*  It's the attitude of MAGA. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=979.26s)]
*  MAGA and how he describes, I don't want to insult Hillbillies. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=981.18s)]
*  I'm going on his description, his description of, you know, in-group, out-group, [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=984.54s)]
*  you're the enemy, we have to go after you. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=989.02s)]
*  Reminds me a little bit of MAGA and he's been rewarded with the vice presidency. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=991.42s)]
*  And that might be in some way more satisfying than going around telling [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=995.42s)]
*  rich CEOs about all the pathologies of the white working class. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=1000.4599999999999s)]
*  I'm sure it's satisfying. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=1003.98s)]
*  Does that make sense? [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=1005.1s)]
*  It does. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=1006.06s)]
*  I don't mean to pick on you in my responses because I should just, [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=1006.4599999999999s)]
*  in the interest of transparency, I find JD Vance to be the least appealing person in [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=1009.66s)]
*  all of public life. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=1014.86s)]
*  Like if I had to spend the rest of my life with Ted Cruz living in an apartment, [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=1015.9s)]
*  I'd rather do that than have to go on like a single road trip with JD Vance. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=1021.98s)]
*  I think it's all bullshit. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=1027.58s)]
*  I was interested in your piece. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=1029.58s)]
*  I read it. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=1031.26s)]
*  I've watched him and I think he's a sociopath and I think he's mean. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=1032.86s)]
*  And he's very condescending. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=1039.02s)]
*  And I listened to that little trajectory that you laid out and I'm like, [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=1041.02s)]
*  who doesn't want to be a cunt? [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=1045.98s)]
*  I mean, I say that in the British sense. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=1047.5800000000002s)]
*  Who doesn't want to be Liam Gallagher from Oasis and just say whatever the fuck you [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=1049.5s)]
*  want and make fun of people and be a star? [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=1053.26s)]
*  Everybody does. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=1056.14s)]
*  Wouldn't that be satisfying for... [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=1057.18s)]
*  Doesn't everyone have that inside them a little bit? [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=1058.5400000000002s)]
*  Yeah, but my super ego would be crushing me at every step of the way. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=1061.98s)]
*  Okay. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=1065.18s)]
*  So maybe not everybody. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=1065.5s)]
*  So maybe this is why my JD Vance feelings is because I have that. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=1067.26s)]
*  I have that little strain inside of me. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=1072.94s)]
*  I also like, again, everything JD Vance wrote in 2015 could have been me. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=1076.7s)]
*  He is a little bit better of a writer than me, so not quite. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=1082.6200000000001s)]
*  He has a little more fake formal than me, so it wouldn't be exactly the same, [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=1085.66s)]
*  but mostly it would have been similar. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=1088.7s)]
*  And so maybe there's a personal feeling to it, but I don't... [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=1090.46s)]
*  You have an obligation when you hit the lottery like he did and become vice president of the [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=1097.5s)]
*  United States to not let your inner hillbilly, not let your worst instincts take over. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=1104.54s)]
*  Okay, I have to stop you. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=1110.7s)]
*  I have to stop you. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=1111.98s)]
*  Do not imagine I'm excusing it. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=1113.34s)]
*  I don't imagine you're excusing it at all. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=1115.42s)]
*  Do not imagine I find it anything but repulsive and morally cretinous because he is the vice [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=1116.86s)]
*  president of all of us and he acts like the vice president of the little Trump circle who have [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=1123.98s)]
*  helped him and might continue to help him. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=1130.78s)]
*  And that is unpatriotic. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=1133.1s)]
*  It's... [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=1136.3s)]
*  Well, Seth Moulton called him a POG. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=1137.82s)]
*  Do you know what a POG is? [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=1141.02s)]
*  I know the band, the POGs. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=1142.94s)]
*  No, it's... [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=1144.22s)]
*  I wouldn't call him that because I didn't serve in the Marine Corps. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=1145.8999999999999s)]
*  Seth Moulton did. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=1148.62s)]
*  It's personnel other than grunt. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=1149.98s)]
*  And it basically means someone who served but didn't see combat. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=1153.82s)]
*  It's kind of an insult coming from a fellow Marine. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=1158.3000000000002s)]
*  And Moulton called him that after Vance went after Zelensky in the Oval Office. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=1162.46s)]
*  It was such an offensive thing to do. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=1168.5400000000002s)]
*  Here is the president of a country under siege from an imperialist power next door. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=1170.94s)]
*  He has been physically brave. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=1176.78s)]
*  He has been morally brave. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=1178.46s)]
*  And Vance, who is JD Vance to feel superior to Volodymyr Zelensky? [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=1179.9s)]
*  If anything, his own sense, perhaps, of inferiority might have driven him to get aggressive with [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=1185.66s)]
*  Zelensky. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=1193.66s)]
*  Or there's something going on with Maga and Zelensky. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=1194.22s)]
*  Maybe you can explain it. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=1196.94s)]
*  Why do they hate him? [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=1198.0600000000002s)]
*  It's not just that they don't want to send weapons to Ukraine. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=1199.1000000000001s)]
*  They hate Zelensky. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=1202.22s)]
*  Why? [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=1203.42s)]
*  Well, he's revealing to them. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=1205.5800000000002s)]
*  I mean, he is doing the type of thing, demonstrating the type of courage that they [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=1208.7s)]
*  haven't in the face of Trump. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=1214.78s)]
*  That's partly it. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=1216.06s)]
*  You have to also, I think I go back to the rationalization you were talking about with [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=1217.66s)]
*  JD earlier, how he's convinced himself that he believes all this stuff. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=1220.78s)]
*  And I do agree with you on that. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=1224.62s)]
*  And I think you have to, if you're going to ostensibly side with Russia, you have to kind [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=1226.3s)]
*  of tell yourself a story for why you have that position when it would not have been the natural [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=1231.5s)]
*  position of most of these Republicans. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=1240.06s)]
*  And so I kind of painting Zelensky as a bad guy helps you tell that story, I guess. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=1242.6200000000001s)]
*  Just one more thing, just back in the JD. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=1248.06s)]
*  I guess I'm trying to make a finer point on what I was trying to say. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=1249.9s)]
*  I just don't like the thing of like he has this inner inferiority complex. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=1252.78s)]
*  He is a hillbilly. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=1260.38s)]
*  And so that kind of explains why he does this, why he lashes out, why he's such a prick. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=1262.14s)]
*  Like that's the part that I just, I'm like, I just, it feels like an excuse. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=1270.8600000000001s)]
*  It feels like an excuse. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=1275.5800000000002s)]
*  And there are a lot of people who were raised in as challenging situations as JD, who overcame it [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=1276.94s)]
*  and did not then use their new power to be as mean to people as possible. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=1285.18s)]
*  He's nasty. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=1291.74s)]
*  He's nasty. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=1293.18s)]
*  I agree. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=1294.22s)]
*  And I think that's- [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=1294.5400000000002s)]
*  That suggests that there's a sort of hollow moral core. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=1295.5s)]
*  Where power, ambition, he's traded one group of elites for another. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=1299.98s)]
*  He basically swapped David from and the reformer cons and I don't know, maybe Tim Miller, [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=1306.0600000000002s)]
*  but certainly CEOs who went to his events at Aspen and Sun Valley for another group of elites. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=1312.8600000000001s)]
*  Ron Howard. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=1318.22s)]
*  Ron Howard would be one. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=1319.5s)]
*  For another group, Peter Thiel, Tucker Carlson, Donald Trump Jr. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=1320.94s)]
*  David Sachs, who have elevated him way beyond what those CEOs at Sun Valley could do for him. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=1327.02s)]
*  And he, it doesn't strike me as having anything to do with the white working class or any working [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=1336.54s)]
*  class. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=1346.06s)]
*  He justifies every policy, every lie, every cruelty, including cruelty to immigrants who [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=1346.3799999999999s)]
*  are being sent to gulags on the basis of, well, why don't you care about my people? [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=1353.82s)]
*  Why should I listen to you complain about due process when you didn't care about my people, [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=1359.02s)]
*  when our neighborhoods are being flooded with immigrants? [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=1364.22s)]
*  So it's all in the name of his people, the working class. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=1366.9399999999998s)]
*  And I find that to be every bit as fake a justification as what you're describing. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=1371.1799999999998s)]
*  He left them. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=1378.7s)]
*  He abandoned them. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=1379.8999999999999s)]
*  Honestly, like let's just be honest. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=1380.62s)]
*  If Hillbilly Elegy, the movie had been a massive hit and he got recruited to run as a Sherrod Brown [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=1383.4199999999998s)]
*  style Democrat in Ohio, and that was a path, and he saw that as a path toward success, [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=1393.9799999999998s)]
*  I think he would have done that. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=1398.9399999999998s)]
*  Right? [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=1400.3799999999999s)]
*  No, I go. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=1400.62s)]
*  I had a buddy that was- [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=1401.4199999999998s)]
*  I'll tell you why. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=1402.78s)]
*  I did follow the path very carefully. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=1403.4199999999998s)]
*  By that time, by the time the movie came out, he had taken a few small steps [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=1406.3s)]
*  that were about to become one giant leap into Magadam, and there was no going back. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=1412.86s)]
*  He was a Republican. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=1418.86s)]
*  He was never going to be a Democrat. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=1420.06s)]
*  He had committed himself to the Republican Party to Ohio, which was becoming a more and more red [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=1422.06s)]
*  state. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=1427.8999999999999s)]
*  He had to run as a MAGA candidate. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=1428.78s)]
*  And so by the time that movie came out, by the way, the reaction of the movie was interesting [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=1432.6999999999998s)]
*  because the book was popular, including among liberals. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=1438.1399999999999s)]
*  Right. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=1441.58s)]
*  The movie was hated, but it was really, there's no reason for the movie to be hated. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=1442.3s)]
*  It wasn't- [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=1447.98s)]
*  It was bad. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=1449.1s)]
*  It wasn't terrible. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=1450.06s)]
*  It was just another movie, and it was the same story. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=1451.18s)]
*  Basically, the same JD Vance is in the book, except from the exterior. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=1454.7s)]
*  The reason it was hated was because he was hated, because by that time, there had been [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=1459.34s)]
*  four years of Donald Trump, and it was clear that this guy was moving in that direction. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=1463.58s)]
*  Although you can change your mind about tariffs and not go on the Jack Murphy show, who's this [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=1468.3s)]
*  alt-right rape apologist, and spend 90 minutes talking about getting rid of the civil service [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=1476.78s)]
*  and telling judges to enforce their order or get out of the way. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=1482.14s)]
*  You don't have to become that kind of politician and be for tariffs. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=1486.94s)]
*  I mean, Sherrod Brown, I don't know for sure, but my guess is he isn't completely against [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=1492.38s)]
*  tariffs, but Sherrod Brown is a decent person. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=1496.78s)]
*  JD Vance, I do think there is a hollow moral core, which may be what you're getting at. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=1500.06s)]
*  Yeah. I think that's right. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=1505.26s)]
*  Well, anyway, he has been consistent. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=1509.02s)]
*  You wrote an article, and I should acknowledge the one thing that he has been consistent [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=1511.02s)]
*  is on the wars, and that really did play into the MAGA pivot. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=1514.06s)]
*  That went longer than I thought, but it's worth doing, because it's important. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=1519.66s)]
*  It's important trying to... Because at some level, maybe if he's completely a hollow man, [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=1523.42s)]
*  and he's young, maybe the incentives in some way in the future will move his hollowness [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=1530.7s)]
*  back towards some kind of decency. I don't know. Maybe that's the best hope. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=1537.5s)]
*  But I suffered through the entire podcast he did with Ross Douthat for about an hour. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=1540.06s)]
*  He was talking about his Catholicism. He changed his religion a couple of years ago, too. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=1546.22s)]
*  Nothing wrong with converts, but changing his name, changing his religion, [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=1551.5s)]
*  all of it as a mid-adult. It's intriguing. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=1555.1799999999998s)]
*  Changing his politics. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=1558.62s)]
*  Changing his politics all in his late 30s. It's intriguing. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=1559.98s)]
*  What did you make of it, his conversation with Ross? [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=1565.34s)]
*  Well, I was highly annoyed by it. I thought Ross Douthat knows him well. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=1568.3s)]
*  I think they're old friends. He has a lot of access to him. He did press him [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=1576.06s)]
*  on immigration, on due process. He asked the same questions that I think you or I would ask. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=1580.78s)]
*  He got to talk to him. I didn't get to talk to him. They never even replied to my request for [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=1589.02s)]
*  an interview. But I thought, at least say no. But that aside, I find the whole phenomenon of this [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=1593.02s)]
*  conservative Catholic resurgence, which is going on and which Vance's conversion is part of. In [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=1607.58s)]
*  fact, his essay about his conversion is called How I Joined the Resistance. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=1613.98s)]
*  What is the resistance? Well, it's obviously the resistance to globalism, to liberalism, [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=1620.62s)]
*  classical liberalism. It's the embrace of post-liberalism, of Patrick Deneen, of that [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=1627.02s)]
*  whole philosophical school, which Vance is very much a part of and consciously, openly a part of. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=1633.1s)]
*  I find it highly annoying because they are talking about a new approach to [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=1640.54s)]
*  Western governance, let's say, that doesn't acknowledge the incredible gifts we've gotten [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=1652.1399999999999s)]
*  from two centuries of liberalism and from 80 years of American global leadership. Of course, [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=1658.6999999999998s)]
*  lots to complain about, including some horrors, Iraq and Vietnam. But to just suddenly say it's [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=1666.9399999999998s)]
*  run its course, we're a decadent society, I've been disappointed by technology, and therefore, [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=1674.78s)]
*  maybe the Constitution, this isn't Ross Douthat talking, this is more JD Vance talking. Maybe the [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=1683.58s)]
*  Constitution is hemming in the executive and we need to reinterpret the second article as if it [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=1689.1799999999998s)]
*  pretty much creates a monarch because the rest of it isn't working and it's in fact getting in our [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=1696.78s)]
*  way. I find this dangerous, disingenuous, and the Catholicism is not just a private faith. If it were [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=1702.06s)]
*  kept as a private faith, I would say that's your business. But it's a justification, a kind of moral [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=1711.1s)]
*  and religious justification for throwing out philosophical liberalism, which is the basis [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=1716.54s)]
*  of this republic. So I have a problem with that conversation. [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=1723.5s)]
*  That was annoying. I agree with that. But that's totally different than the thing that annoyed me [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=1728.6999999999998s)]
*  about it, which speaks to the challenges of processing JD in a fair way. The thing that annoyed [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=1733.26s)]
*  me about it was he just left to meet with Pope Leo, and then he sits down with Ross, and he just [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=1740.46s)]
*  lies to Ross's face, and he pretends to say, like I was struggling, particularly on the immigration [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=1748.7s)]
*  stuff, he pretends to say, I have struggled with this, because Ross, again, to his credit, pushes him [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=1754.3s)]
*  on, you know, maybe aren't you being tempted by political interests here, not by what your faith [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=1759.3400000000001s)]
*  would dictate when it comes to treatment of immigrants. And JD says to him, he says, [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=1766.62s)]
*  I have struggled with that. But he says it just without any evidence that that's actually true. [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=1772.3s)]
*  And then the next thing he says is, and you know what, your readers of the New York Times, [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=1778.78s)]
*  where were they when the border was open and immigrants? So if they had nothing to say about [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=1786.3s)]
*  that, why should I listen to them about that? So suddenly he's divided the country into the people [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=1791.5s)]
*  who agree with him and then the readers of New York Times who he doesn't need to listen to because [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=1797.5s)]
*  they disagreed with him about the border. And then the next thing after the New York Times, [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=1801.42s)]
*  he goes on and says, on some of these cases that have gone viral with the New York Times and these [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=1805.5800000000002s)]
*  liberal elites, I've looked into them, and I'm sure that they're terrorists. And then he goes on to [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=1810.3000000000002s)]
*  just give the example of Kilmar Briego Garcia. And I just I watched it. I was like, I don't believe [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=1815.5s)]
*  you. I don't think that that's true. There's not there is a ton of evidence publicly that [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=1820.14s)]
*  that several people have been sent to El Salvador wrongly, at least. And and you haven't provided [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=1824.94s)]
*  any evidence. No, because it's classified, Tim. It's classified. Right. So it's a lie. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=1831.18s)]
*  And then there was the other bit, the other bit, which I think he also said, I'm not sure, [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=1836.7800000000002s)]
*  but I think he said was classified about the level of violence in these immigrant communities [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=1840.3000000000002s)]
*  and how it's so violent. Shouldn't you go check out those communities? [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=1845.5800000000002s)]
*  Probably journalists do have a presence there. I'm sure some reporting's been done, [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=1849.58s)]
*  but he made it sound as if it is at the level of like in one of the Mexican provinces at the [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=1854.06s)]
*  height of the cartel killings, a kind of bloodbath going on in American towns along the border. [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=1862.1399999999999s)]
*  That's unreported. Show me the evidence. Right. It's unreported. So he's basically saying. [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=1869.1799999999998s)]
*  Ross follows up and says, show me the evidence. He's like, well, some of these things, they [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=1873.4199999999998s)]
*  don't get reported because these are vulnerable communities. Like, oh, right. Yeah. There's all [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=1876.7s)]
*  these secret murders happening in the border that nobody reports. Right. I that annoyed me, too. [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=1879.98s)]
*  I've gotten how annoyed I was by that. I was thinking a little bit more intellectually, [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=1886.06s)]
*  but let's let's get down to the level of lies. And yeah, very not yet. Well, it's all justified [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=1890.7s)]
*  in his mind and his rhetoric by who his people, because you and I don't care about Middletown, [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=1896.06s)]
*  Ohio. We only care about Abrego Garcia. That's the his contempt for due process and these [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=1903.9s)]
*  nitpickers who keep pointing to the Constitution. Yeah. I got to tell you, if AOC kidnaps a guy who [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=1911.8200000000002s)]
*  had a heroin addict mom from Middletown, Ohio, just a normal white guy named Donald Bowman and [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=1919.02s)]
*  sends him to an El Salvador gulag, I will I will be I will be as righteously fucking pissed about [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=1924.6200000000001s)]

*  All right. Undoubt that. You wrote a review of his book. We don't need to do a whole thing on that, [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=2045.18s)]
*  but I was interested in it. So I'm just curious of a quick side. The book's called Believe. It's [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=2051.5s)]
*  about religion. I have not read the book. I suffered through the podcast. I don't think I [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=2055.82s)]
*  can do Ross's book, but it seemed to me that it's basically a middle version of Pascal's Wager. [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=2059.82s)]
*  There is, yeah, with a fair amount of neuroscience and physics and cosmology thrown in. [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=2069.1800000000003s)]
*  Look, I should say I read Doubt That, I listen to Doubt That, I admire and am irritated by him [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=2076.46s)]
*  almost simultaneously. So there's a kind of irresistible pull that I always kind of wonder [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=2085.1s)]
*  why did I just spend that hour, but I also, I see he's incredibly- [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=2093.42s)]
*  So were you a Catholic? Were you raised Catholic? [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=2098.38s)]
*  I was raised atheist, Tim. [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=2101.02s)]
*  Raised atheist, okay. So I was going to say that that's the Catholic guilt that made you feel like [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=2102.7s)]
*  you needed to spend the hour. [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=2107.42s)]
*  It's the liberal guilt. It's the liberal guilt. So I need to understand how someone who's kind of [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=2108.54s)]
*  sympathetic to Vance and maybe even Trump a little bit thinks. I got to understand that. [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=2114.86s)]
*  It's also the journalistic instinct. And I also recognize a thoughtful, smart, well-read, [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=2119.34s)]
*  interesting writer when I see one. And so I have to follow up with that too. But this book was [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=2125.1800000000003s)]
*  designed to piss me off because the title and subtitle are Believe Why Everyone Should Be [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=2131.82s)]
*  Religious. And my answer is to write a book called Nope, Why You Should Leave Everyone Alone. [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=2137.98s)]
*  For me, religion is I understand the impulse. I felt it. I've sought to believe at hard moments [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=2145.82s)]
*  of my life, including one extremely hard moment when I was desperate to believe. It never took. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=2156.54s)]
*  The sky remained empty. The universe remained dark, cold, and random. Our life here is all we [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=2163.02s)]
*  have. And then it ends. And so what do we do? We live it. We love. We make the most of it. We do [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=2170.86s)]
*  not expect more. We don't look for the bribe of heaven to justify our conduct on earth. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=2177.2599999999998s)]
*  But Ross's book says unbelievers like me are shallow, just want social acceptance in elite [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=2184.86s)]
*  circles, are too busy to look up and realize that there's a design to the universe and a designer [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=2193.9s)]
*  to the universe. So he brings a lot of reading because he's a very serious guy. He's read a lot [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=2199.9s)]
*  of new science about the mind and about the universe. And his argument is all of this [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=2207.9s)]
*  science shows it's more likely than you thought that there is a design and a designer. [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=2213.18s)]
*  And to which my answers, I read all of the evidence he brought to which my answer is, [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=2219.8999999999996s)]
*  what about the leap of faith? None of this seems to me to have anything to do with religion. It's [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=2224.7s)]
*  not a rational matter. It's not about probability and possibility and weighing the odds. It's about, [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=2230.14s)]
*  do I believe? How does that happen? It's a leap into the dark and I can't make that leap. And [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=2237.5800000000004s)]
*  I accept that other people will. My main concern is that they not make it the basis [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=2244.86s)]
*  for a political ideology that is trashing liberal democracy. That's my main concern. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=2252.78s)]
*  I don't want them doing that. And I see a bit of that going on. And that's why I got my backup [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=2260.86s)]
*  a bit when I saw Ross's book. Yeah. And it's just annoying. The idea that, oh, you're doing [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=2266.62s)]
*  what you're doing because of social positioning. And do you want to fit in with the other godless [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=2273.1s)]
*  New York elites? And I'm not doing what I'm doing for social positioning, even though [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=2279.1s)]
*  when I last interviewed Ross, he explicitly said to me, he's like, well, I'm the conservative [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=2285.18s)]
*  Christian columnist at the New York Times. What would you want me to write about? When I pushed [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=2291.74s)]
*  him on why he wasn't being more critical of Trump. So I think, look, he's very conscious. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=2295.42s)]
*  I don't know. His faith could be legit. His faith is legit. He's also very conscious of his social [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=2299.9s)]
*  positioning. It is legit. And as with Vance, I want to extend him a modicum of good faith. [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=2305.1s)]
*  However, do not use it to chip away. He's not trashing anything. Vance is the one doing the [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=2315.02s)]
*  trashing, but don't use it to chip away at the basis of liberal democracy because that is my [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=2323.74s)]
*  religion. You're taking away my faith, which is this thing we have here. So yeah, it annoyed me, [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=2329.18s)]
*  maybe even more than the interview with Vance annoyed me. Okay. Well, then I'm not going to be [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=2339.4199999999996s)]
*  reading the book. That's not a great endorsement. Sorry, Ross. I don't know if we sold any books. [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=2343.18s)]
*  You guys should subscribe to the Atlantic though. I'm always pitching Atlantic subscriptions. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=2346.8599999999997s)]
*  Last topic, your other Atlantic article recently was called Be a Patriot. And it was a kind and [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=2350.62s)]
*  considered reply to Tim Snyder, Marcy Shore, and Jason Stanley, who wrote that New York Times piece [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=2357.98s)]
*  about how they were leaving for Toronto because fascism is imminent. I want to hear your reply [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=2363.2599999999998s)]
*  to this, but in particular in the context of I've had, I'm just a little concerned. Like I've had [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=2370.14s)]
*  several different strangers come up to me at restaurants, at jazz fest, like on the street [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=2377.02s)]
*  and say, Hey, I'm really worried. I'm thinking about leaving the country. And I just, and I think [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=2384.22s)]
*  that there are certain cases. And I've said this, like if you have a, if you have, if your [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=2390.94s)]
*  immigration status is questionable, if you're a student visa, I think, you know, there are a lot [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=2395.2599999999998s)]
*  of people that have very legitimate concerns, but the folks I was talking to were mostly [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=2400.06s)]
*  just a stereotype, college educated American citizen, bulwark listeners. And I just, I haven't said [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=2404.22s)]
*  to all of them, I was like, no, like we do, like you need to stay. We are not there yet. We should [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=2410.2999999999997s)]
*  not give in. You should not be made to be afraid by these people. And, and, and we, and it's, [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=2416.3799999999997s)]
*  it's early in the game here still. It's later than we'd wish, but it's earlier in the game. [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=2422.62s)]
*  And so that's my view. I just wanted to hear you expand on your piece. [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=2427.58s)]
*  Well, that's my view as well. When I heard that Schneider, Schor and Stanley were leaving, [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=2431.9s)]
*  Schor and Stanley made it clear they were leaving as if this was Germany in 1933. In fact, Stanley [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=2440.54s)]
*  made that comparison explicit. Schneider has said his reasons are, are personal, [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=2447.02s)]
*  they're professional. They have, he's not fleeing Trump, but he's leaving and he's leaving after [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=2453.26s)]
*  writing a very important and widely read book called On Tyranny that has a list of [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=2460.7799999999997s)]
*  recommendations, instructions, really. It's a manual on how to fight tyranny. Don't obey in [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=2469.8199999999997s)]
*  advance. Be courageous, be patriotic, be a patriot. And I felt, how can I take those [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=2476.7s)]
*  quite as seriously as I did yesterday now that I know that these rather prominent voices against [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=2488.54s)]
*  the American fascism they see are going to Canada because America's gotten dark and ugly. [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=2497.98s)]
*  So it was a little bit of a holding them intellectually responsible for their own [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=2505.82s)]
*  ideas. But it was also, as you say, Tim, kind of a plea with people I know, because I hear the same [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=2512.62s)]
*  thing. Should we leave? Maybe we're fools to think it's not too late. Maybe it's already too late. [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=2520.2200000000003s)]
*  Maybe we should get out while we can. I don't know where to go, but I need to get out. Well, [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=2526.38s)]
*  two things. One, it's not too late. The secret police are not coming after you and me and [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=2531.6600000000003s)]
*  Snyder and Schor and Stanley. They may be coming after a Turkish student in Boston who has just [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=2539.42s)]
*  published an op-ed, which is a horror. That image of her being pulled off the street by mass police [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=2548.06s)]
*  was for me the signal that we're in a new and more authoritarian world. Is it authoritarianism [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=2556.14s)]
*  pure and simple or are we still in some hybrid where the Atlantic can call Trump names and write [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=2564.7s)]
*  critical pieces about JD Vance and no one's raiding our offices? And still, if you have the wrong [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=2571.8999999999996s)]
*  characteristics, the wrong biography, you can be pulled off the street. That's where we are. [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=2579.58s)]
*  What do you do? Do you then run away? Do you say, I'm going to go to New Zealand or Iceland? Or do [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=2584.7799999999997s)]
*  you say, this has to be fought in our own little way. You have a podcast. I'm a journalist. We're [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=2590.62s)]
*  not changing the world. We're just trying to do a little bit every day to resist this and to do it, [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=2598.22s)]
*  in my case at least, not as the resistance, but as someone who cares about democracy and is [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=2606.38s)]
*  trying to hold them to what I think are the values of this country. If I go away, if you go away, [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=2612.94s)]
*  if everyone who is horrified by this goes away, the country's theirs. So be a patriot. [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=2620.62s)]
*  Be a patriot. When have we crossed the line? What is the alarm? What is the signal that it's now [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=2627.74s)]
*  it's over? I don't know. I honestly don't know. Do you have an image in your mind? [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=2637.5s)]
*  Well, I'll tell you this. I always say, if I'm the first podcaster, they send us a coat, [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=2642.62s)]
*  then I guess I'm willing to be the first podcaster. They send us a coat. There'll [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=2652.46s)]
*  maybe be a poster about me on the street corners in New Orleans. That will be bad, [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=2657.5s)]
*  but I'm willing to be that because I think we're far from that. [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=2664.54s)]
*  So to that point, if American citizens start getting taken off the street and put in detention [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=2672.94s)]
*  without access to due process and they're left there and the Supreme Court is unable to stop it, [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=2682.54s)]
*  then we're in a new world. But we're very far from that world. They have been stopped. [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=2689.5s)]
*  Again, with the horrors of Andre and Neri and the people that are in a coat right now, [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=2695.74s)]
*  I get it's an unimaginable horror and I hope these guys never live it down and I hope that [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmn1Pgy4NAQ&t=2701.5s)]
