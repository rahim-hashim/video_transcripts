Video Description: In contrast to the saddest military junta parade in history, millions of patriotic people took to the streets on Saturday to defend American values and principles against Trump. But the deflated birthday boy now wants to ramp up the militarization of our largest cities on a completely partisan basis to achieve his mass deportation. Meanwhile, folks on the right are showing a vicious irresponsibility about the assassination in Minnesotaâ€”Mike Lee in particular should have his head examined since he's showing a complete disregard for the truth. Bill Kristol joins Tim Miller.

# Mike Lee has LOST IT! (w/ Bill Kristol)
**The Bulwark Podcast:** [June 16, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90)
*  US senators, richest man in the world, very prominent right-wing media figures, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=0.0s)]
*  immediately spun up a total fake narrative that the assassin was left-wing [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=6.32s)]
*  as part of an effort to radicalize people more. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=13.68s)]
*  Hello and welcome to the Bulwark podcast. I'm your host, Tim Miller. He's editor-at-large [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=24.72s)]
*  of the Bulwark. It's Bill Kristol. What's up, Bill? [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=28.48s)]
*  It's good that the suits at the Bulwark are fine with hard truths about Stephen Miller. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=30.32s)]
*  I'm worried that the suits at the Bulwark don't know about everything you've said on this [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=36.24s)]
*  conversation with Terry. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=40.24s)]
*  I think that's probably true. The suits at the Bulwark are definitely not monitoring the FY pod [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=42.480000000000004s)]
*  for starters. So who knows what I'm saying over there. We got so much to talk about. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=46.400000000000006s)]
*  There were the No Kings parades over the weekend and the saddest military junta parade in history. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=51.519999999999996s)]
*  Some political assassinations of Minnesota, Israel, Iran war. It's the 10-year anniversary [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=58.0s)]
*  of the escalator to our current hell. So I'm tapped from just talking to Terry. Why don't [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=62.800000000000004s)]
*  you pick? Which one of those things do you want to start with? [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=69.52s)]
*  I think No Kings was a bigger moment than I would have expected. Both bigger just quantitatively, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=72.0s)]
*  but also maybe in terms of the spirit of us and maybe the spirit of the country. I don't know. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=77.44s)]
*  Well, how was yours? You went to New Orleans, right? [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=82.8s)]
*  Yeah. I have a thought about it that cuts both ways. On the positive side, just the view from [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=85.04s)]
*  the whole country was really astonishing. I mean, you just look at the aerial views of the San [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=92.64s)]
*  Diego protests in Chicago, the total number of people that were showing up in contrast to [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=98.80000000000001s)]
*  the really limp military parade, birthday boy parade in DC, I think was pretty striking. We [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=106.4s)]
*  were talking about that all last week. There is a power in these demonstrations of public support. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=112.56s)]
*  JVL has written about that for the triad. And that influences things. It influences people. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=119.36s)]
*  It influences institutions like ABC when they decide whether they need to fire Terry Moran. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=126.16s)]
*  All that stuff matters as far as countering aspiring authoritarianism. So I thought that [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=130.32s)]
*  was good. The spirit in New Orleans was great. I mean, it's New Orleans, so everybody was so kind [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=134.88s)]
*  to me. People were maybe a little hungover. It was hot 10 in the morning. So there was some [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=139.76s)]
*  sweating happening out there, but there was a lot of excited people. My only one comment about [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=144.07999999999998s)]
*  coming the other way is in New Orleans and hearing from friends in other places, it does feel very [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=149.44s)]
*  much like a kind of college educated crowd, like a more upper middle class crowd and a whiter crowd, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=158.39999999999998s)]
*  frankly, even in New Orleans. And there's nothing wrong with that. It makes sense. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=167.6s)]
*  Working class people have a lot of fucking things to do. Besides show up to protests, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=172.79999999999998s)]
*  there's an element of who has free time in the world to these sorts of things. I mean, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=176.56s)]
*  the types of people that show up to volunteer at any campaign headquarters, there tend to be [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=181.12s)]
*  demographic differences. But I still worry about that a little bit with the Democrats and with [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=185.68s)]
*  the resistance, whatever you want to call it, this broad pro-democracy coalition that we are kind of [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=191.51999999999998s)]
*  reaching the people who listen to podcasts and go on subsec and are really engaged. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=197.44s)]
*  And it does feel a little bit like there's a gap still in reaching folks that are more disengaged. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=204.0s)]
*  And I guess that would be my only note of caution from what was otherwise really, I think, a nice [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=210.4s)]
*  and important weekend. I don't know what you make of all that. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=217.52s)]
*  No, that's a fair note of caution. I point out as you know that, I mean, you can't get disengaged [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=220.24s)]
*  people unless it's easy to get disengaged people, the more engaged people you have. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=225.6s)]
*  I'm almost by definition, right? They know more people, they have spillover effects, so to speak. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=228.88s)]
*  And I think in that- I guess the Black Lives Matter parade demographics and the No King's [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=232.79999999999998s)]
*  parade demographics were notably different. I think we should just be able to acknowledge [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=238.4s)]
*  that that is a thing and think about that. But you need both. And I think I was struck by [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=242.64s)]
*  a few things. I mean, the spirit, at least here in Northern Virginia, was a combination of anger [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=249.92s)]
*  and genuine indignation, obviously, at what Trump has done and said, that's almost about what he's [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=255.44s)]
*  done to the country. This is Northern Virginia, lots of government workers, lots of people who [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=259.84s)]
*  involved, semi-involved in politics and so forth. But also kind of an upbeat spirit, I mean, given [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=263.52s)]
*  that it was kind of a grim week with the mobilization in Los Angeles of the troops and [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=269.91999999999996s)]
*  Trump's speech on Tuesday and the kind of what was then the soon to happen military parade and [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=274.56s)]
*  then a war breaking out, people were upbeat and people were really happy to see each other. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=281.04s)]
*  I mean, it's McLean, Virginia, I'm not going to pretend it's a wildly diverse crowd. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=285.92s)]
*  Before McLean, it was somewhat diverse. It was diverse in the sense that there were [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=288.96000000000004s)]
*  several ex-Republicans there whom I knew. And I was slightly surprised to see a couple of them [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=292.8s)]
*  there. They were not never Trumpers last time. They're not close friends, so I'm not intimately [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=298.32s)]
*  involved in their trajectories politically, but I would say they were Trump, maybe adjacent or [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=302.8s)]
*  sort of acquiescent or neutral as late as 2020 or something. And they were there. And then there [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=309.12s)]
*  were plenty of liberals and upper middle class types and so forth. Kind of a nice combination, [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=314.8s)]
*  though, as I say, of being angry about what Trump is doing to the country in a sense of humor. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=321.68s)]
*  There was this couple of witty handmade posters, placards, I like the word about what women have, [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=325.36s)]
*  we were laughing about it. If only Kamala had won, we'd be at brunch now, which is a very [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=333.76s)]
*  McLean specific, I believe, or at least upscale suburb specific. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=339.6s)]
*  I guess that speaks to my point about the... [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=344.48s)]
*  Very much speaks to your point, but it's also a certain amount of self, I would say, self [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=346.0s)]
*  mocking or irony in it. And I think people understand they need the broadest possible [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=350.32s)]
*  coalition. That part I found, I was on various calls of people, some of them organizing this, [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=355.12s)]
*  these helping organize and organizing these, the no-kings rallies. And there's a lot of concern [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=360.15999999999997s)]
*  beforehand about this coalition is very broad, will people get arguments or fights? I really [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=365.59999999999997s)]
*  saw none of that, at least here. And I didn't hear about it from anyone I talked to at different [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=370.56s)]
*  events. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=374.8s)]
*  The ideological breadth is important and I think was reflected through everywhere. And we had [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=375.59999999999997s)]
*  what felt like probably what would be the equivalent of the New Orleans DSA folks speaking, [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=381.52s)]
*  as well as never Trumper types, Republican types, Southern kind of suburban, former Republican [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=387.84s)]
*  types, for sure. And everybody is aligned, I think, about what the message is. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=394.79999999999995s)]
*  And I felt this, I mean, again, we'll get discounted, obviously, we know what side we're [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=400.64s)]
*  on in this, but I felt the feeling was patriotic. I mean, partly because there were a lot of American [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=405.35999999999996s)]
*  flags, but people really felt they were defending American values, American principles, American [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=409.84s)]
*  history almost against Trump. And again, particularly in this fight, a little stronger [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=417.28s)]
*  here in Northern Virginia, but a fair number of ex-military, military vets there. Act of Duty [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=421.52s)]
*  probably wouldn't identify themselves as such, so I don't know about that. But a lot of vets [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=427.76s)]
*  settled, obviously, in this area. And so it's, again, the patriotism I thought was authentic. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=432.64s)]
*  And I guess I thought generally that reading about it all Saturday night and Sunday, [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=438.96s)]
*  yesterday, I feel like it conveyed a kind of, I feel like that was the more patriotic of the two [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=443.76s)]
*  events Saturday. Now, I'm so biased, I don't trust my judgment, that everyone agrees with this, [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=449.84000000000003s)]
*  but I maybe think a little more than 49% of the country would have that perception just from [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=454.48s)]
*  looking at the events, looking at the actual, the people and, you know, millions of people waving [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=459.92s)]
*  American flags against soldiers kind of looking kind of unhappy to be walking down Constitution [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=465.52s)]
*  Avenue with Trump up there trying to make it look like it was a big deal and kind of lame, [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=471.6s)]
*  don't you think? I didn't watch the parade. Did you actually? [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=476.56s)]
*  The military parade sponsored by Coinbase. You don't think that had the tradition, [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=478.48s)]
*  the American traditions on its side? I agree with that. I thought I saw a funny post from [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=483.76000000000005s)]
*  some far left person who was trying to be critical of the No Kings Parade, and they [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=488.64000000000004s)]
*  posted that they went to their local one and there were so many American flags, they thought it was a [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=492.72s)]
*  Trump rally. And I was like, great. That's a good critique. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=496.72s)]
*  The best thing I've heard, that's great. I hadn't seen that. That's terrific. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=501.04s)]
*  Yeah. So no, there definitely is a spirit. And I think that ties into the immigration element and [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=504.56s)]
*  it ties into kind of what the country's about, you know, and I think the overlap between that [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=510.16s)]
*  and the anti-ice parades naturally lends to kind of something about the American spirit and pluralism [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=514.24s)]
*  in the way that what the country's supposed to be. So I agree with you. That was nice. Some of [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=520.88s)]
*  my friend's kids had some of the best signs, but I don't want to out them. Some of the [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=524.72s)]
*  guillotine theme sign from a child really jumped out to me. You know, we're inspiring the people's [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=528.32s)]
*  youthful imagination. Where was I? Oh yeah. The military parade, so to speak. It was really sad. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=535.76s)]
*  This is not like hyperbole. I guess it was on the next level last week we were talking about this. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=544.08s)]
*  I was like, I'm kind of prepared for anything. I'm prepared for like a total Mussolini [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=548.88s)]
*  style thing where Trump comes out in a costume. Like that being the one end, I wasn't thinking [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=553.92s)]
*  that was likely, but I was like, that was like on the most extreme on one end to like on the other [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=560.64s)]
*  end, it being just a total zero flop and be shambolic to like anything in between. And it was [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=565.04s)]
*  really the latter. I mean, it was pathetic. And like the videos of, you know, kind of the silent [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=573.52s)]
*  crowd with the wheels squeaking on the tanks. And I can't get in the mind of the military folks [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=581.2s)]
*  who participated, but it just didn't really feel like, seemed like everybody's heart was in it. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=587.76s)]
*  And, you know, people holding up the drones, like, because they didn't want to perform them. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=592.32s)]
*  It just, it didn't feel impressive. If any, anything made me kind of sad. Like I was worried [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=598.96s)]
*  that it was going to make me a little scared, but it made me kind of sad about the state of the [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=604.6400000000001s)]
*  country and this sort of like, there's obviously the split screen with the no Kings protest, but I [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=608.8s)]
*  was struck thinking about the split screen with what's happening in the Middle East. And you have [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=613.92s)]
*  like Israel using these precision strikes to take out the Iranian National Guard. And here we have [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=618.0s)]
*  this kind of pathetic parade that like people, nobody's even the people there don't look like [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=625.92s)]
*  they're enjoying that much that didn't look particularly impressive. At the end, I almost [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=631.1999999999999s)]
*  was kind of like, if you're going to do it, I wish it was a little bit more fashion. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=636.16s)]
*  It looked weak and embarrassing and sad. That was my main take away from it. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=642.0s)]
*  Yeah. I felt bad for the people in the military drag wound into participating ranging from those [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=646.7199999999999s)]
*  junior listed guys to the, some of the senior officers hold it equally from the clips. I saw, [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=651.6s)]
*  at least they look on it, not very happy to be there. And I've talked to people ranging [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=657.4399999999999s)]
*  from Seth Moulton, the conversation with him. It was a good interview. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=662.08s)]
*  Thanks. Yesterday on YouTube and a Marine veteran, four tours in Iraq, Michael Wood, [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=665.44s)]
*  our friend, another Marine veteran who's in Texas, went to his local no thing, but then no Kings, [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=671.84s)]
*  but then to other, lots of other people directly and indirectly who were talking to people in the [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=676.48s)]
*  military currently on active duty. And they did report, again, it's slightly self-selected here, [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=679.84s)]
*  obviously, but they reported just general unhappiness in the military. Either unhappiness [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=684.88s)]
*  or just not interested in it. If they were far from DC and didn't get drag wound into [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=689.84s)]
*  participating, you know, they were, this was not a big moment for them. I mean, in that respect, [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=694.8000000000001s)]
*  Trump's, in some ways this is part of a more serious effort by Trump to politicize and corrupt [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=698.5600000000001s)]
*  the military, which I think it is, you know, the support for just the idiotic self-aggrandizement [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=703.36s)]
*  and giving yourself a big birthday party and the performative side of it. But in so far as part of [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=708.64s)]
*  an agenda, I can't believe it worked. And I would say maybe a little bit of a backlash. I wonder if [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=714.1600000000001s)]
*  you're a normal, you know, a sergeant or major or one star general and you think, God, is that what [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=719.68s)]
*  we want? You know, I mean, of course we'll go along with orders. Of course we're part of the military. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=726.4s)]
*  We're not going to, you know, launch some kind of military rebellion or should they? But I don't know, [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=730.0799999999999s)]
*  I felt to the degree he wants to politicize the military in his direction. I wonder if it had a, [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=734.0799999999999s)]
*  if it had a bit of a reverse effect and maybe firm dapp a sense that we shouldn't be doing that. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=737.68s)]
*  And I thought also General Cain's testimony on the Hill this week, which didn't get much attention. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=742.56s)]
*  I don't think Hexeth got more of us. He was so clounders in certain ways. Cain, I didn't see [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=747.68s)]
*  enough to make a firm judgment of this. My set, well certainly the clips I saw came as pretty firm [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=752.4s)]
*  in rejecting politicization and not confirming that there was an invasion going on in a kind of [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=758.0s)]
*  mild way. He didn't go to MAGA land. I didn't see enough of it to know how much more there was of [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=763.76s)]
*  that or how, but I got the general sense that he probably quietly went out of his way not to seem [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=770.64s)]
*  like Pete Hexeth's sidekick and best buddy. Yeah. I guess one more point on this, the thing that is [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=776.08s)]
*  mildly encouraging, I guess it just kind of depends on what your prior worries or assumptions were, [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=783.5200000000001s)]
*  whether this is going to be an encouraging observation, but the Fox coverage of it seems [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=788.88s)]
*  so forced. You can just tell, you know, in politics or in anything, you can tell when the side that's [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=794.88s)]
*  trying to cheer lead for something is really stretching. And you know, I watched like Brett [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=801.36s)]
*  Bear, I kind of chastise people about how this was really about the army. And some people tried to [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=807.36s)]
*  make this about President Trump's birthday. And it's like, you watch the Fox coverage, they showed [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=812.64s)]
*  Trump over and over again. It was about Trump. And it felt really strange, like the efforts to [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=817.2s)]
*  try to make it into something bigger than it just was. And if your worry, and my worry last week, [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=822.8000000000001s)]
*  I think a lot of people shared this with Trump at Fort Bragg, and watching everybody cheer him on. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=830.4s)]
*  And you know, especially before we learned that they'd really screened people for coming there, [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=836.0s)]
*  you know, there's this worry of like, man, if you're concerned about an authoritarian takeover, [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=839.92s)]
*  the military going along with a campaign rally, and then holding a birthday parade for the [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=846.16s)]
*  president are two pretty concerning data points. And I think now we can look back on the week and [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=852.3199999999999s)]
*  think, well, Trump still has aspirations in this direction. But it's not like it doesn't feel like [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=858.88s)]
*  people are as gung ho about it as as I might have been concerned about. And so I think that that's [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=866.0s)]
*  my minor silver lining. No, I think that's very much the case. I mean, Hexeth has, on the other [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=872.88s)]
*  hand, I mean, Hexeth's secretary of defense, he's fired eight generals, and God knows what the [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=877.04s)]
*  promotion boards are going to be like. Tons of things to be worried about. Plenty of things to [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=880.08s)]
*  be worried about the the authoritarian agenda is alive and well, sadly, because Trump is president [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=883.92s)]
*  and controls the executive branch, and Congress, but but I'm where you are. I mean, I if you'd asked [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=889.68s)]
*  me when we talked to week ago, I was worried this week would be a week of decline towards [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=894.9599999999999s)]
*  authoritarianism. And I don't think it was and I think if anything, it might have been a bit of a [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=898.9599999999999s)]
*  couple of healthy steps away from it. Yeah, pushback. I agree with that. Just on balance. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=903.4399999999999s)]
*  So plenty of other things to still be worried about. Deciding which one to talk about first, [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=908.64s)]
*  I guess let's do this because it's on the topic. Let's do the ice and the kind of military raids [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=913.44s)]
*  because this is something where Trump sent out a bleep this morning, basically, or was it last [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=919.6s)]
*  night, whatever, basically saying, you know, those conversations about how, you know, we want to dial [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=925.84s)]
*  it back at farms and hotels, like, ignore that, like we ice officers are ordered to do all in their [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=935.12s)]
*  power to deliver the single largest mass deportation program in history, and we're [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=942.0s)]
*  going to do it in the democratic cities in Los Angeles, Chicago, New York, and others, where these [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=946.32s)]
*  folks live. And as someone else talking to Terry, that really struck him just about this notion [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=951.36s)]
*  about the militarization of our cities, sending these ice thugs in to democratic areas to really [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=958.32s)]
*  wreak havoc on these communities. And I think that this is maybe the inverse of what we were [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=968.72s)]
*  just talking about. There was maybe a moment where some, I didn't really think this, but some were [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=973.76s)]
*  saying that because Trump was tacoing a little bit on this, on immigration, because of the pushback [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=977.2s)]
*  from Big Ag and his hotel buddies. But to me, I think that was rhetorical. And like he's not, [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=983.2s)]
*  and that, and this is going to continue to level up and might be a really dangerous inflection point. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=990.48s)]
*  I'm not sure it's entirely rhetorical. I basically agree with you and the ice thing remains [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=996.64s)]
*  horrible and horrifying. I mean, I do think they've changed the orders for ice. At least [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=1001.04s)]
*  there was some reporting of this, not to go into the fields and, you know, chase and arrest the, [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=1006.24s)]
*  detain and deport the agricultural workers the way they were doing in parts of California. I think [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=1011.92s)]
*  on the middle of that last week, there was video of that. Hotel workers, I don't know how you know [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=1016.16s)]
*  exactly ahead of time who are hotel workers, but anyway, they, maybe if you say you're a hotel [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=1020.96s)]
*  worker, they say, okay, you know, at least they don't bust hotels. They won't raid the hotels. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=1024.8s)]
*  I do think it's safe. They're not going to be raiding the four seasons. I don't think the four [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=1028.96s)]
*  seasons should be worried. There wasn't a lot of that going on anyway, but you're right since they [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=1031.9199999999998s)]
*  try not to dis inconvenience to any rich people basically, and who might be Trump, especially if [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=1035.84s)]
*  they're in areas where they're a Trump supporter. So, and I do think the tacoing, the fact that he [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=1040.32s)]
*  had to put out that stupid tweet probably changed policy a little bit. Now he's invited and selling, [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=1044.8s)]
*  now that he said the hotels are, and Ag, we shouldn't bother them. I mean, everyone who's [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=1049.76s)]
*  obviously knows Trump and is in the construction business saying, hey, you know what, we have [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=1053.68s)]
*  problems too. Maybe you could stop hiring people who are assembling to work in construction jobs [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=1057.92s)]
*  at the Home Depot Shopping Center, you know? And so I think it opens the door to a little bit, [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=1062.64s)]
*  sort of like tariffs. It opens the door a little bit to kind of pressuring Trump. Once you see it [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=1066.8s)]
*  works a little bit in one case, there'll be a little more of it. It sort of takes away a little [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=1071.44s)]
*  bit that kind of, you know, mass deportation, no matter what, it's a matter of firm principle. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=1076.0s)]
*  Obviously for Trump, it's all, who knows what it is for Trump. I mean, it's a mixture of bigotry [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=1081.44s)]
*  and some sense that this is what he campaigned on, but he doesn't really want inconveniences, [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=1085.44s)]
*  rich buddies. He's very different. I think Trump is different from Stephen Miller in this respect. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=1089.52s)]
*  He probably would be happy to inconvenience all the rich buddies. So we'll see what happens in [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=1093.52s)]
*  practice. And it's still awful to have what's happening and a lot of awful stuff will continue [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=1097.1200000000001s)]
*  to happen. Does it not think of the fact that people, we've sort of forgotten that Andre has [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=1101.68s)]
*  been in detention in El Salvador for 90 days, a totally innocent man hasn't had a chance to call [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=1106.88s)]
*  his family. I mean, so there's a huge amount to be indignant and outraged and very concerned about, [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=1113.68s)]
*  I don't know, minimize that. But I guess I'm slightly more optimistic maybe than you that [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=1118.88s)]
*  a little chink appeared there in the armor of mass deportation. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=1122.5600000000002s)]
*  Pete Slauson I think it'll be interesting to see how it plays out. Because my counterpoint to that, [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=1127.3600000000001s)]
*  we'll see, is that we're not yet an authoritarian country, actually. So Trump's dick tots then get [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=1133.6s)]
*  kind of filtered through the system, you know, and people within the system have their own incentives. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=1141.84s)]
*  And I'm just like, I'm here in Louisiana. And I was talking to folks this weekend, I've got [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=1147.6799999999998s)]
*  lawyer friends I've been talking to and politician friends in town. And, you know, if you are the [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=1152.3999999999999s)]
*  US attorney for one of the districts here in Louisiana, you're the governor, you're the [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=1160.72s)]
*  attorney general, your incentives are to get your deportation numbers up. Like you don't want to [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=1165.52s)]
*  seem like you're the weak link here. And so yeah, at the same time, you also don't want to bug your [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=1172.32s)]
*  donors, right? So there's these cross pressures, right? And, you know, the US attorneys and the [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=1177.12s)]
*  ICE officials and whoever oversees the LA area and the Chicago area, right? Like, [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=1182.4s)]
*  that is where there's going to be total wheels off. And, you know, they want to maximize the [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=1189.3600000000001s)]
*  number of detentions. But the incentives across all these other places are too, as well. And so [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=1193.92s)]
*  unless they're giving like very clear stand down orders, I don't know, I just I think it's going [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=1198.56s)]
*  to get worse before it gets. No, that's, it's terrible. I mean, the mass deportation thing, I, [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=1204.64s)]
*  of course, I was never for it or in any way well disposed to it. But in practice is more, [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=1209.76s)]
*  because they pushed it so hard, I suppose, maybe one should have expected it. But it's just more [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=1216.08s)]
*  appalling, even than I thought. I mean, just what it's what it signals, how people are behaving, [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=1220.8s)]
*  the ICE agents, the counterattack, when someone points out that what are they doing here, [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=1226.8s)]
*  you know, some of the people they're picking up are innocent, some of them are American citizens, [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=1231.2s)]
*  and they're treating everyone in a kind of such a bad way, unnecessarily kind of cruel and brutal [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=1234.56s)]
*  way. And the counterattack is just that's great. You know, they deserve it. They're here illegally, [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=1242.48s)]
*  they're all illegal. I mean, it's really grotesque. I've so that part of it, I'm very much on the kind [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=1247.1200000000001s)]
*  of both alarmed and disgusted side. And as you say, that part's not most of that's not stopping. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=1252.4s)]
*  Maybe there are some signs that there isn't quite as much support for it. As Trump thought, [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=1259.04s)]
*  the issue is interesting. One poster this morning, last couple days, asked what is [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=1265.2s)]
*  interesting questions. It's not 100% reliable in terms of as much as a real poll, but it's [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=1270.88s)]
*  qualitative a little bit. And you have to divide the sample to two and all this. But it's sort of, [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=1276.8000000000002s)]
*  are you happier with the Democrats message on the economy, more respected, more responsive to it, [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=1280.88s)]
*  or on immigration? I mean, which are you sort of and they were about they were the same. The [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=1286.24s)]
*  poll was like 4256 approval of Trump. So if you're inclined to disapprove of Trump, you can [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=1290.3200000000002s)]
*  disapprove it's there's as much disapproval on immigration or deportation, at least, [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=1295.5200000000002s)]
*  as there is on the economy, perhaps. And so I think that will encourage Democrats in a good way [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=1300.32s)]
*  to focus on that. Incidentally, I did find that our Know Things event, at least here in North [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=1305.52s)]
*  Virginia, there was a lot of just talking to people, a lot of talk about immigration, [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=1310.32s)]
*  much more than about the economy, which is okay for now, tariffs, you know, all that other, I mean, [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=1315.28s)]
*  it is a real issue, I think, at least for the people who don't like Trump, that question is, [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=1321.36s)]
*  you know, swing voters and then Trump supporters. But I think even amongst big voters and some Trump [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=1326.08s)]
*  supporters, I think the deportation stuff is just, I hope it's just a bridge too far. I don't know. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=1330.16s)]
*  We couldn't be more aligned on that part of it. I just I'd love the whole notion of [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=1336.4s)]
*  people only talk about their bills at the kitchen table. It's just this totally ridiculous thing I [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=1340.8s)]
*  can't even take. Okay, I want to talk about Minnesota, just the horrible assassination attempts. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=1346.16s)]
*  For anybody that missed it, there was a state house Democratic leader, Melissa Hortman, [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=1352.8000000000002s)]
*  was killed, as well as her husband Mark. State Senator John Hoffman and his wife, a vet, [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=1358.8000000000002s)]
*  were wounded. The suspect is a guy named Vance Bolter, who his roommate says he voted for [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=1366.0s)]
*  President Trump was against abortion, old friend said similar. And this guy went to their houses, [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=1374.0800000000002s)]
*  dressed as a police officer with a car that had like fake sirens on, I guess, real sirens, [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=1382.88s)]
*  with fake police sirens on it, and, and assassinated them in their homes. And, and he was finally [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=1388.48s)]
*  caught just a few hours ago, which is good. He'd been on he'd been on the loose. He had a list of [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=1395.52s)]
*  other Democrats he was going to target and other left wing groups organizations. So I don't know, [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=1402.0s)]
*  I have a few thoughts on it. But Bill, I guess what was your top? What's your top takeaway? [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=1410.8s)]
*  It's obviously horrible and should be denounced. And the good news is it was denounced by, you know, [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=1414.6399999999999s)]
*  Republicans and Democrats, pretty much. But you had a point you really noticed and looked more [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=1419.76s)]
*  closely than I did, at the immediate the degree to which the MAGA right was was willing to spin [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=1425.6s)]
*  this on social media based on either fake, you know, or fragmentary accounts of who the guy was [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=1432.8799999999999s)]
*  as a left wing Marxist shooting endorsed by people as serious as your great buddy, Senator [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=1439.36s)]
*  Mike Lee and Elon Musk. And I mean, that really is the degree of irresponsibility and cavalier [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=1444.8799999999999s)]
*  disregard for the truth and just wanting to establish your narrative, even knowing that it [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=1453.12s)]
*  could well be totally falsified as it has been 24 hours later. I don't know, you've thought a lot [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=1458.24s)]
*  about that. And you spoke eloquently about it. Yeah, I just I got to I've been discouraged by [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=1463.4399999999998s)]
*  pretty much all of it. I like. And I mean, assassinations, I like there's a moment in the [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=1467.6s)]
*  country where this was this happened, like people got assassinated politically, you know, before I [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=1474.0s)]
*  was born, not too long before I was born, but there was a spate of it. And then some other, [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=1479.12s)]
*  you know, kind of assassinations attempts and we had the Gabby Giffords issue and then Steve [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=1485.12s)]
*  Scalise at the baseball field. So like, it happens, but an actual murder of a politician, [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=1489.1999999999998s)]
*  like, you know, you would think that that would just call for an immediate [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=1496.56s)]
*  outpouring from all leaders. That is just no, like we have to be opposed to this, we have to [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=1504.0s)]
*  be like demonstrate how much we are, you know, all kind of in this together in a messy democracy, [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=1512.8799999999999s)]
*  no matter what our views are, like they're all like this, this kind of you would expect like this [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=1520.88s)]
*  overwhelming response. And it's just not what happened. I like, you know, I mean, Trump put [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=1526.0800000000002s)]
*  out a statement about it, but then was asked if he's going to see Tim Walls, who was very emotional [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=1532.0800000000002s)]
*  with this out of the governor walls, he knew, you know, the victims, and he kind of was dismissive [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=1536.96s)]
*  of that and then attacked walls and made fun of them. And, you know, and then I talked on that [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=1542.48s)]
*  video you mentioned I talked about about Senator Mike Lee has been on a tweeting spree about how [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=1547.04s)]
*  this guy is a Marxist based on nothing. Bernie Moreno, Senator from Ohio, posted the degree to [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=1551.92s)]
*  which the extreme left has become radical, violent and intolerant as well stunning and terrifying. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=1559.36s)]
*  Elon Musk tweeted the similar. So this is not like I'm not just picking random, like crazy magas off [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=1564.0s)]
*  the internet, like US senators, richest man in the world, like very prominent right wing media figures, [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=1570.08s)]
*  immediately spun up a total fake narrative that the assassin was left wing, as part of an effort [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=1577.2s)]
*  to radicalize people more against the left, right? I mean, in a moment where somebody had, [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=1586.0s)]
*  we don't exactly know what radicalizes guy, but where somebody felt was radicalized enough to go [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=1592.1599999999999s)]
*  kill Democrats, to take that moment to try to radicalize people more against folks on the left [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=1596.24s)]
*  is just unbelievably, like unconscionable and irresponsible and crazy. And so like that part of [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=1603.44s)]
*  it was, as to me very horrifying, and I think augurs poorly for the future. And then I got a [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=1611.52s)]
*  thing I did talk about the video is I just kind of hate this. I hate that after one of these things, [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=1618.24s)]
*  everybody immediately like retreats to like, is this murder going to help my team? Or not? Like, [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=1621.76s)]
*  it's a deeply unhealthy way to think about all of this, no matter what your political alliance is. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=1627.68s)]
*  And all you have to do is just look at social media to see that that's a pretty broad sentiment [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=1633.92s)]
*  for people that are political posters, at least. And that's so anyway, across the board, I was just, [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=1639.6000000000001s)]
*  I felt like it was all pretty disheartening. I totally agree. But I would just add, I'll be [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=1645.68s)]
*  maybe a little more partisan than you or something like that, but I'm not partisan. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=1650.72s)]
*  I mean, it was clear within two hours, I'm going to say it was certainly very, very clear who, [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=1654.56s)]
*  what side this guy was coming from. Doesn't mean you blame the other side. He's maybe he's crazy, [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=1658.56s)]
*  maybe I meant to break down. I'm just saying, but his actual affiliations, the actual list of people [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=1662.96s)]
*  he was going after, it was an anti democratic or anti left, if you want to call it that, you know, [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=1668.1599999999999s)]
*  assassination. I mean, and that doesn't mean that everyone there's assassinations from both sides and [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=1674.56s)]
*  one individual in a country of 330 million, etc. etc. Still, if you're on the if you are on that [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=1679.52s)]
*  side, you have a particular responsibility to denounce it, in my opinion, and even a few people [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=1685.2s)]
*  might have said, gee, to the degree that he seems to be a guy who, you know, kind of agreed with us [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=1689.92s)]
*  on some things, who was strongly pro life, who was a Christian minister who denounced the left denounced [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=1696.4s)]
*  gay people, I think in this speech in Africa that we got video of again, this video came out pretty [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=1704.24s)]
*  quickly. I don't know if anyone has even gone to that that next step, which is the right thing to [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=1708.48s)]
*  do and the decent thing to do, and which people have done in the past, if someone quote on their [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=1713.28s)]
*  side, went over the line to heart horrific violence, you sort of felt a special need to say, [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=1717.92s)]
*  you know, I just want to say that we on in the responsible and in the huge majority of the [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=1724.0s)]
*  responsible community on this side denounce it. So it didn't even I mean, not only didn't they do [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=1730.8799999999999s)]
*  that, of course, as you said, they spun up this these fake conspiracy theories and fake biographies, [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=1735.92s)]
*  basically the guy and then stuck with them for hours, maybe for a day. I know that that last [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=1741.28s)]
*  Mike Lee tweet was not just minutes, I don't believe after the shooting, it's totally responsible to do [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=1745.12s)]
*  it minutes after the shooting when you don't know, it's even worse to do it hours afterwards [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=1749.84s)]
*  when you kind of do know. And the degree to which the right to the top of his feed, that was his [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=1753.84s)]
*  response to the pushback. He's like, you can change to choose a particular tweet and like, [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=1758.8799999999999s)]
*  and make sure it stays. That's all right. No, I mean, this is a US Senator, and one who once was [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=1762.8s)]
*  thought to be a little eccentric, maybe but kind of mild mannered and responsible, Utah, you know, [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=1768.0s)]
*  and all this. I mean, in that respect, the the just the incredible irresponsibility and viciousness, [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=1774.16s)]
*  really, of parts of the right, I think and then the social media question and how they are organized [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=1781.28s)]
*  to really push this stuff out immediately and really echo each other in a way that the left is [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=1787.6s)]
*  often jealous of because it could be politically quite effective, but also is humanly so corrosive. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=1793.92s)]
*  So corrosive, right? Because it's like true facts don't matter, true reality doesn't matter. And [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=1799.44s)]
*  you train people to believe that. And so what happens like when you train all of your followers [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=1804.3200000000002s)]
*  to think the reality of the situation is irrelevant. Every event is part of this imaginary war that we [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=1809.8400000000001s)]
*  have with our domestic political foes. And we can say or do anything we want to rationalize anything [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=1817.3600000000001s)]
*  that hurts them like that. That's basically that what is underpinning their their behavior. And [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=1823.92s)]
*  that's deep. That takes you to a deeply dark place. Yeah, the imaginary war becomes a real killing. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=1831.28s)]
*  And it doesn't even cause well, maybe it caused some people who were not posting and some people [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=1836.0800000000002s)]
*  who are not United States senators to rethink. But again, these are United States senators. I want to [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=1840.88s)]
*  come back. You did not pick in your would you discuss this in the video and we're not focusing [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=1844.8000000000002s)]
*  now on random people obviously online who are idiots and who say totally irresponsible things [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=1849.12s)]
*  and want to get followers rev that we're talking about United States senators, and Elon Musk who is [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=1854.3999999999999s)]
*  totally irresponsible human but also was the closest advisor to the president United States for [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=1860.0s)]
*  the first few months of his administration. Yeah, just one more thing unlikely. Like again, [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=1864.3999999999999s)]
*  there are only two options here. Either he's so mentally ill and deranged that he's convinced [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=1869.1999999999998s)]
*  himself that this person is a Marxist, I guess, and that Tim walls is responsible for the death [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=1874.24s)]
*  of his friends, like either he's so mentally ill that he that he believes that, or he knows it's a [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=1882.4s)]
*  lie. And he's advancing it. To what end like to because he wants to get retweets or because he [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=1890.08s)]
*  wants the left to be punished or he wants to, you know, he thinks that is a path to more power to [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=1897.04s)]
*  more political power. And like either one of those options, like makes him totally, you know, [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=1903.52s)]
*  unacceptable as a public as a person in public trust, right? Like you cannot have somebody [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=1910.08s)]
*  in in a place of public responsibility, who's like either that, like mentally ill or that [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=1917.04s)]
*  sociopathic, I guess, is just a different type of mental illness, but like that confused about reality, [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=1923.68s)]
*  or that willing to lie about dead fellow politicians, I just, you know, for some social [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=1928.64s)]
*  media purpose, I and it's, I, it's really beyond the pale. Okay. Andrew Egger wrote this and he [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=1939.2s)]
*  guilt-surfed to me this morning in your newsletter. And so I do want to mention it. John Hoffman's [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=1948.5600000000002s)]
*  wife, Yvette jumped on their daughter and protected her during the attack and saved the [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=1954.08s)]
*  save their kid. I mean, and Yvette is also probably going to survive. It seems like it, [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=1963.12s)]
*  but it was shot eight times or something. And so, you know, in these moments, you talk about how [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=1967.12s)]
*  fucking awful Mike Lee is, but maybe a word for, for Yvette Hoffman. One last thing is kind of [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=1972.6399999999999s)]
*  related. But Edward Isaac Devore posted this. I mentioned this in video. I just want to mention [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=1981.84s)]
*  it one more time because it cuts against my earlier point about the silver lining. In the last week, [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=1985.84s)]
*  Marines were deployed in American city. The president called for the governor of the state [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=1992.6399999999999s)]
*  to be arrested. The speaker of the house has called for that gov to be tarted. Father to senator has [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=1995.6s)]
*  been pinned and handcuffed to the ground. And two state legislators have been shot in their homes. [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=1999.04s)]
*  I mean, that is a pretty alarming week in the grand scheme of things. And just because the parade [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=2004.8s)]
*  was sad doesn't mean that that trend is not concerning. And that was recent or one of the [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=2009.84s)]
*  most recent Trump tweets, that long one that I think you've already quoted a bit from, I mean, [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=2016.56s)]
*  is pretty amazing. It's a flat out statement that we're going into reds into blue cities, [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=2021.4399999999998s)]
*  and they're very badly governed by Democrats. And that's where I want ice to focus. [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=2027.4399999999998s)]
*  So I mean, that's pretty astonishing, isn't it? The law enforcement is now dictated by the city, [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=2031.9199999999998s)]
*  by the what kind of government, what kind of politics these cities have, not where the highest [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=2037.76s)]
*  crime, making this up, but not where the highest crime rates of undocumented immigrants are, not [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=2043.36s)]
*  where the highest disturbances are, you know, that you can imagine real metrics that might lead ice [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=2048.48s)]
*  to go focus on city A rather than city B, obviously, right? Numbers and numbers of criminals [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=2055.2s)]
*  and stuff. We're not we're beyond pretending that's the case. It's just these are states that are run [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=2060.56s)]
*  by cities that are run by Democrats. And I'm going to go focus on them, even though the people [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=2066.48s)]
*  elected in those cities and states don't want them doing this incidentally, right? So I mean, [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=2071.84s)]
*  it's the war of red America against blue America. I was texting with Ron Brown students been very [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=2077.68s)]
*  obsessed with this. And you've had them on and I've had them on over the weekend, but obsessed in a [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=2082.2400000000002s)]
*  correct way. The kind of degree to which Trump thinks of himself as the president of red America [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=2086.64s)]
*  on a crusade to get much more against blue America than against any foreign [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=2092.64s)]
*  dictators, obviously, or enemies. I've kind of never quite believed you could pull that off in [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=2097.2s)]
*  this country of ours where so many people, you know, move around and know people who are different [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=2103.2s)]
*  from them and so forth. And there are blue cities and red states and red areas and blue states. [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=2108.72s)]
*  I've always kind of assumed that would, I don't know, mitigate that attempt to create basically [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=2113.6s)]
*  a civil war. But that part, they are just Trump and Miller, but all of them, and Mike Lee and [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=2119.6s)]
*  Bernie Moreno and all these guys are just, they're just 100% invested that, don't you think, on board [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=2126.48s)]
*  for that? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's not really even close, like the degree to which they consider the [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=2132.16s)]
*  domestic foes, the real foes of the country over the foreign foes. I mean, like, I wouldn't even [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=2138.96s)]
*  know who they would say is the second most dangerous threat to the country. They might [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=2145.12s)]
*  give lip service to China, but they don't actually do anything about it. [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=2149.12s)]
*  Military parades. Guys getting fired from their job for speaking the truth. There's a lot of [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=2158.0s)]
*  uncertainty out there in the world. And so when that's the case, it's good to look for things you [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=2162.7999999999997s)]
*  can control and take back control of. And one of those things is by getting yourself some life [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=2169.8399999999997s)]
*  insurance with today's sponsor, SelectQuote. For over 40 years, SelectQuote has been one of the most [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=2175.04s)]

*  million without needing to visit the doctor. Have high blood pressure, diabetes, heart disease, [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=2207.7599999999998s)]

*  Which kind of relates to the last topic I want to get to, which is Israel and Iran. [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=2243.7599999999998s)]
*  That Israel attacks from inside Iran have made me start to rethink some of the China [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=2247.2s)]
*  threat a little bit and Ukraine's attacks from inside Russia. Anyway, maybe a topic for another [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=2251.9199999999996s)]
*  day with you or a China expert, but there are just two elements of this I want to talk about [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=2257.6s)]
*  before we lose. One, just the actual nature of the attacks and this success, at least short term. [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=2262.64s)]
*  Then I will talk about our domestic political side of it. Do you have any thoughts about [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=2270.64s)]
*  just what we've seen over the last few days just from the war side? [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=2275.2799999999997s)]
*  It's pretty extraordinary. As with the Hezbollah attacks a year ago when they had a long-term plan [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=2278.48s)]
*  to penetrate the company or create a fake company that sold the pagers to Hezbollah, [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=2286.24s)]
*  which then blew up and so forth. I mean, that plus Iran, it's related, of course, [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=2291.6s)]
*  because they couldn't have done that. One reason they were deterred from this level of activity [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=2295.6s)]
*  against Iran was that they thought that Hezbollah would come down, you know, rain tens of thousands [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=2299.2s)]
*  of rockets down on them from sanctuaries in Lebanon, to some degree in Syria, which are [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=2303.7599999999998s)]
*  mostly gone now. So it's very impressive. I'm not a fan of Dizignahu and I think the Gaza war is [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=2309.68s)]
*  been a lot of critical things one can legitimately say about that. But this, just the imagination, the [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=2316.0s)]
*  competence of the execution of this attack has been awfully impressive. And look, if it degrades [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=2325.2s)]
*  Iran's nuclear program, even for a couple of years, that's good. And it could lead to more. [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=2330.96s)]
*  And I am not, I know we're all supposed to be scared of saying the word regime change and all [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=2334.72s)]
*  that, but I'm not. And I hope the people of Iran could take advantage of this moment. They've tried [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=2339.76s)]
*  in 2009, they tried in 2022. We're losing here some of our new friends, you know, who might be [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=2344.48s)]
*  watching this podcast and as part of the board coalition. But they deserve to be free, just like [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=2349.44s)]
*  everyone else, you know, and they want to be free. I mean, unlike some of these other countries where [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=2357.52s)]
*  it's fair to say, oh, well, do the people even want to, you know, maybe they like the kind of [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=2360.72s)]
*  government dictatorial and intolerant and abusive government they have. There's just a lot of evidence [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=2363.76s)]
*  the Iranian people don't want that. And I hope Israel can create the circumstances and if we could [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=2368.4s)]
*  make it up a little bit to where that might come to fruition. I agree. I hope we're not losing [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=2373.36s)]
*  anybody. The Iranians deserve to be free. It's a pretty, I think, universal sentiment. [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=2379.28s)]
*  I just want to, the Trump thing, I just want one point on this that I just wanted to get your take on. [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=2386.48s)]
*  It's like, I hate to hand it to Trump on anything, but like his total incoherence [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=2395.52s)]
*  on all this has really worked in his benefit. And that's not political advice you ever usually [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=2402.08s)]
*  give to politicians is you should try to be as incoherent as possible and then let everybody on [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=2406.7999999999997s)]
*  all sides give you credit for things. But for some reason, it works for him. Michael Shearer called [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=2410.88s)]
*  him and asked him about Tucker's criticism. Tucker's really been the one that has been [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=2416.72s)]
*  criticizing him. And Trump basically says that getting rid of Iranian nukes is America first and [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=2420.72s)]
*  whatever he says is America first. And then he dropped the call from Shearer to take a happy [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=2426.16s)]
*  birthday call from Putin, which was some thick irony there. He was defending the notion of [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=2431.36s)]
*  America, of him representing America first. He's like, sorry, sir, I got to really take a quick, [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=2436.4s)]
*  take a happy birthday call from Vladimir Putin. But watching the response, you have the kind of [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=2440.96s)]
*  neocon remaining wing, the militaristic wing of MAGA, the Ben Shapiro's, Scott Jennings, Eric [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=2447.44s)]
*  Erickson's. They all are congratulating Trump on the strategic brilliance of like pretending to [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=2454.0s)]
*  be against the Israel attacks while really letting them do it. Meanwhile, you have like the [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=2458.64s)]
*  Breitbart's, the nationalist side of them, giving Trump credit for like opposing escalation and not [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=2463.12s)]
*  being as hot on going to war as all the others want. And like, at least for now, he's getting [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=2468.7999999999997s)]
*  away with it. It probably won't work if the war escalates significantly, but I don't know. Do you [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=2474.72s)]
*  have any thoughts on how he manages to pull that off? One reason he's getting away with it [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=2484.24s)]
*  is that the Israeli government is helping him get away with it by, correctly, from their point of [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=2490.56s)]
*  view, they want Trump on board. And if he wants to take a little credit, he doesn't deserve probably [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=2495.6s)]
*  for helping out or kind of quietly encouraging this and Yahoo to do it or giving him a yellow light. [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=2500.64s)]
*  My impression is Trump, if the thing had gone very badly, the attack on Thursday night, Friday [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=2506.56s)]
*  morning, Trump would be saying, I warned them not to do it. I mean, this is what happens when you [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=2511.28s)]
*  don't listen to me. They should have stayed at the peace table. You know, he was willing to go both [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=2514.88s)]
*  ways. It's very Trump like and in a certain way, once I think the Israelis realize that they could [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=2517.84s)]
*  flatter him, they've certainly went all out doing it. And people who talk to the Israeli government, [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=2523.36s)]
*  I believe have been echoing that and people who are pro-Israel just feel like, you know what, it's, [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=2528.6400000000003s)]
*  you know, if it makes Trump more likely to do the right thing, we'll say excessively nice things [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=2533.2000000000003s)]
*  about Trump. I think the war within, let's call it the Republican Party more broadly, but somewhat [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=2538.4s)]
*  in the world too, is pretty interesting. The I'd say I hadn't realized how this sounds stupid for [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=2543.52s)]
*  me to say, but how much being anti neo con was so central to a large some part of Mott Maga. I [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=2550.7200000000003s)]
*  thought, of course, they were neocon. Don't get me wrong, for many reasons, and many meetings of [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=2557.2000000000003s)]
*  neocon there. But, you know, I still thought immigration, there are other issues, the first, [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=2562.1600000000003s)]
*  second, third, the neocon stuff's sort of a cute, you know, like an additional little thing they, [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=2566.08s)]
*  you know, bug they have to itch they have to scratch. I think it's more central than I realized [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=2570.16s)]
*  and it's gone pretty deep into Maga and it's deep in the Trump administration. [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=2574.96s)]
*  J.D. Vance, Rich Colby, the number three person at defense, Colby's deputies, the National Security [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=2580.48s)]
*  Council, Senior Director for the Middle East, as I say, Vance himself, Tulsi obviously. There are a [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=2587.52s)]
*  lot of people in the Trump administration who are really, really are going to try to flatter Trump [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=2593.36s)]
*  by saying he was strong, but he's kept us out of the war. That's his achievement. Right. And then, [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=2598.88s)]
*  of course, there's some others in the administration, not unfortunately, as many as there might have been. [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=2602.88s)]
*  But actually, here, I'd say the Republicans on the Hill are more inclined to flatter him the other [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=2606.6400000000003s)]
*  way. I was told last night that a couple of very senior Republican senators, pretty close to Trump, [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=2611.44s)]
*  had a conversation in the last 48 hours in which they explicitly discussed how do we help? They [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=2617.1200000000003s)]
*  want the U.S. to help Israel, basically, and they would like the U.S. even to finish the job if it [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=2622.64s)]
*  can be done on Fordow and on the nuclear stuff. Obviously, it depends on the risks and rewards and [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=2627.44s)]
*  so forth, but they're inclined. They don't want to rule that out. And they had an explicit discussion [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=2632.8799999999997s)]
*  of how do we get Trump to at least be open to this and override Vance and people who are going to [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=2636.4s)]
*  object. And their conclusion was, and so I said to the person who's telling me this story, well, [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=2641.2s)]
*  will they publicly, will I hear from them? No. Their sense is privately flatter Trump, tell him [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=2645.3599999999997s)]
*  this could help his reputation even more if he would very carefully and cleverly at the last minute [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=2651.76s)]
*  weighs in. So it's all about flattering Trump on all sides, which means you can't trust anyone. [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=2657.5200000000004s)]
*  No one is telling you the truth. I mean, no one is telling you what they really believe at this point [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=2663.0400000000004s)]
*  because they're all maneuvering in maga world and even Republican world to handle Trump, which, [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=2667.6800000000003s)]
*  again, is I don't criticize them for it. If I were a senator, I might be doing the same thing. [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=2674.2400000000002s)]
*  If you really think the outcome is important. I don't know. I'd probably just say what I think. [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=2678.32s)]
*  Well, I mean, there's some case in general, that's a healthier politics. I will agree with that. [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=2681.92s)]
*  But you know, at a moment of great crisis, maybe you think, I don't know. Anyway, I'm struck by how [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=2687.1200000000003s)]
*  much this one person I was talking to was just matter of fact, he told me this and said, he [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=2691.6000000000004s)]
*  wasn't like telling me some big, we're just chatting. And he said, you happen to know what this one [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=2695.6800000000003s)]
*  conversation in this incident, and he just, this is the way it works. I mean, this is what it is [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=2699.92s)]
*  like to be in Trump's Republican party. You never say what you believe. I mean, some people say what [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=2705.1200000000003s)]
*  they believe, especially the lunatics, but an awful lot of other people just take it for granted [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=2710.88s)]
*  that they have to maneuver and flatter. And as you say, I'm not in any one instance, you can see why [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=2714.88s)]
*  maybe it's they do it and why maybe conceivably, it's even the right thing to do. But of course, [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=2720.88s)]
*  as a general mode of politics, it's deeply corrupting and bad for the country. [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=2726.56s)]
*  Soterios Johnson 13th, 2020 [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=2731.36s)]
*  Indeed. Yeah, no, but I saw that as like, also, the anti neocon sentiment is particularly strong [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=2732.56s)]
*  among the younger magas and the people that are influential online. And so that's another reason [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=2738.72s)]
*  for that crowd that you're talking about those centers to not speak out, right? Because it could [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=2744.08s)]
*  have a backlash effect. And you know, when I go to the TP USA thing, my favorite question to ask the [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=2748.56s)]
*  random, you know, Maggie youth is, what is it about Trump? You like the best, like, what are the issues [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=2753.52s)]
*  that you care about the most to get you here? I'm like, almost all of them say no worse. Like, [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=2759.68s)]
*  almost all of them. It's a very, it's a very different kind of mindset than back in my day. [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=2765.68s)]
*  So what that what the impact of that will be, we'll see. But that is their political reality. [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=2771.68s)]
*  Okay, Bill Crystal, thank you so much. We'll see you back here next Monday. [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_uddehpc90&t=2776.48s)]
