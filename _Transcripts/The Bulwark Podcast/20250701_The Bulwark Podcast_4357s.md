**The Bulwark Podcast:** [July 01, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI)
*  the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=0.0s)]
*  Alright, we are live. We're [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=4.5s)]
*  doing things a little bit [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=6.0s)]
*  differently today. We're doing [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=7.0s)]
*  a Bulwark Pod segment live on [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=8.5s)]
*  YouTube because there's so much [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=10.0s)]
*  news happening on the hill. I'm [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=11.5s)]
*  Tim Miller. I've got the [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=13.0s)]
*  publisher of this year, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=15.0s)]
*  Bulwark, Sarah Longwell along [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=16.0s)]
*  with me. How you doing, Sarah? [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=18.0s)]
*  I'm great, buddy. How are you? [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=19.0s)]
*  I am good. Um I just did. Did [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=21.0s)]
*  you stay up all night? Did you [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=23.0s)]
*  stay up all night and follow [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=24.0s)]
*  the various machinations of the [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=26.0s)]
*  Pod? I'm just going to start [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=28.0s)]
*  with a couple briefings from [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=29.0s)]
*  our friends, Joe Pertica and [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=31.0s)]
*  Andrew Egger here and the [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=33.0s)]
*  Punchbowl guys this morning. I [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=34.0s)]
*  was reading E. Jean Carroll's [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=36.0s)]
*  book last night because we had [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=37.0s)]
*  a kind of sultry conversation [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=38.0s)]
*  for the Pod today. So anyway, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=41.0s)]
*  that's a little break for [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=42.0s)]
*  people from the from the [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=43.0s)]
*  Medicaid rate cuts combo. Um I [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=44.0s)]
*  want to just lay the groundwork [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=46.0s)]
*  for where we are. As we sit [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=48.0s)]
*  here right now talking, um [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=50.0s)]
*  there is I guess they were [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=52.0s)]
*  supposed to start voting like [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=54.0s)]
*  this. I think the Republicans [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=56.0s)]
*  are indicating that they have [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=57.0s)]
*  the votes for this. There were [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=59.0s)]
*  four Republican senators that [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=60.0s)]
*  were iffy, Rand Paul, concerned [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=62.0s)]
*  about uh debt, Tom Tillis, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=64.0s)]
*  Murkowski and Collins on [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=66.0s)]
*  Medicaid and and some of those [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=68.0s)]
*  other issues. It seems like [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=69.0s)]
*  Murkowski has cut a deal and [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=71.0s)]
*  uh and so she would be the 50th [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=74.0s)]
*  vote and then JD Vance would be [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=76.0s)]
*  a tiebreaker as stuff develops [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=77.0s)]
*  as we're talking here. We'll [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=79.0s)]
*  keep people posted but I just [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=80.0s)]
*  want to talk to you first just [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=81.0s)]
*  about the biggest picture state [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=82.0s)]
*  of play. This is a ridiculous [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=83.0s)]
*  bill. Andrew wrote about this [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=85.0s)]
*  this morning. Senate Republicans [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=87.0s)]
*  are trying to pass this law [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=89.0s)]
*  this morning even though they [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=91.0s)]
*  were still writing it overnight. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=93.0s)]
*  Brian Schatz, Senator from [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=95.0s)]
*  Hawaii summed up the state of [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=96.0s)]
*  play this way. One of the world's [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=97.0s)]
*  worst legislative processes I've [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=99.0s)]
*  ever seen. No bill text still, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=100.0s)]
*  almost a trillion out of [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=102.0s)]
*  Medicaid. A subsidy to move a [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=104.0s)]
*  state space shuttle to Texas, a [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=106.0s)]
*  statue garden, four trillion in [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=108.0s)]
*  debt. Uh hospitals will close [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=110.0s)]
*  their doors. Uh trash. What what [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=112.0s)]
*  what is happening with the [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=117.0s)]
*  process here? Well, it's called [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=118.0s)]
*  reconciliation and we could [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=120.0s)]
*  really use a reconciliation on [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=121.0s)]
*  reconciliation because this is a [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=123.0s)]
*  little procedure that's been [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=125.0s)]
*  around since the 70s. Uh I [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=126.0s)]
*  think sometimes people call it [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=127.0s)]
*  like the bird rule because I [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=128.0s)]
*  think he was the one who came [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=129.0s)]
*  up with it. Robert Bird, former, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=130.0s)]
*  he was a one of the guy who was [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=133.0s)]
*  in the clans, the clan. That [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=134.0s)]
*  bird was Musker, is that right [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=136.0s)]
*  though? There's another bird. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=137.0s)]
*  There's Henry Bird. We gotta [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=138.0s)]
*  figure that out. You keep [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=139.0s)]
*  talking while I figure out the [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=140.0s)]
*  bird rule. I'm gonna just lay [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=141.0s)]
*  my hand on Robert. You're right. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=142.0s)]
*  It was Robert Bird. Yeah, there [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=143.0s)]
*  we go. Uh the thing is, is it [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=144.0s)]
*  isn't until really modern times [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=146.0s)]
*  here, right? To get it, it's [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=148.0s)]
*  basically a maneuver to get [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=149.0s)]
*  around the filibuster, which I [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=150.0s)]
*  would just say as somebody who's [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=152.0s)]
*  like has been in the past, a bit [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=153.0s)]
*  of a traditionalist, somebody [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=155.0s)]
*  who likes, you know, to force [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=157.0s)]
*  bipartisanship out of people, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=158.0s)]
*  which is what the filibuster is [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=160.0s)]
*  supposed to do, right? It's [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=161.0s)]
*  supposed to make you get uh some [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=162.0s)]
*  consensus. Instead, everybody, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=164.0s)]
*  like you might as well just get [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=166.0s)]
*  rid of the filibuster. Like why [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=167.0s)]
*  have it? If people are just [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=168.0s)]
*  gonna use this reconciliation, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=170.0s)]
*  which is a budgetary process, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=171.0s)]
*  it's like a budgetary process [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=173.0s)]
*  that they use. And then what [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=174.0s)]
*  they do is they pass these, they [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=176.0s)]
*  jam everything in to one bill. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=178.0s)]
*  It's the reason that Trump has [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=180.0s)]
*  called it the big, beautiful [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=181.0s)]
*  bill is because it's like, yeah, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=183.0s)]
*  we took literally everything we [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=185.0s)]
*  wanna do and we put it all in [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=187.0s)]
*  one place and now we're gonna, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=188.0s)]
*  we're gonna jam it through with [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=189.0s)]
*  this little maneuver on this [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=191.0s)]
*  budget. And it's a terrible way [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=192.0s)]
*  to live because they are still [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=194.0s)]
*  right now. They are writing the [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=196.0s)]
*  bill as they go. It's not like [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=198.0s)]
*  horse trading the way they used [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=199.0s)]
*  to do it to kind of get to [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=201.0s)]
*  consensus. It's just pure bribes [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=202.0s)]
*  and carve outs uh for people so [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=205.0s)]
*  that they will go ahead and jam [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=208.0s)]
*  this thing through with them. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=209.0s)]
*  Yeah. Speaking of just how like [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=211.0s)]
*  just absurd this process is, I [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=213.0s)]
*  just have this coming across the [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=215.0s)]
*  wire. Senator Jim Justice says [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=216.0s)]
*  that the delay here is because [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=218.0s)]
*  senators are haggling with the [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=220.0s)]
*  parliamentarian over last minute [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=222.0s)]
*  handwritten legislative text. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=225.0s)]
*  Like they're looking like right [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=228.0s)]
*  on the margins. It's like the [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=230.0s)]
*  original deal that Murkowski had [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=232.0s)]
*  gotten to get when and it seems [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=234.0s)]
*  like she was gonna be for this [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=236.0s)]
*  originally before that kind of [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=237.0s)]
*  unraveled last night uh was a [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=239.0s)]
*  Medicaid and snap carve out for [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=242.0s)]
*  non-contiguous states uh so just [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=244.0s)]
*  Alaska and Hawaii. Things are [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=247.0s)]
*  really different when you're out [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=248.0s)]
*  there. It's a whole different [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=249.0s)]
*  ball game. Um and then that [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=251.0s)]
*  didn't pass the parliamentarian's [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=254.0s)]
*  muster so it ends up doing this [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=255.0s)]
*  thing where um or the Alaska [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=257.0s)]
*  doesn't get the Medicaid carve [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=260.0s)]
*  out but they do get a snap carve [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=261.0s)]
*  out but now it's a bunch of [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=263.0s)]
*  other states and it's based on [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=264.0s)]
*  like their error rate. So the [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=266.0s)]
*  people that are claiming that [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=268.0s)]
*  they want to get rid of uh [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=270.0s)]
*  waste fraud and abuse are now [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=272.0s)]
*  rewarding the states that have [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=274.0s)]
*  the biggest error rate and snap [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=276.0s)]
*  because you know there's some [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=278.0s)]
*  pretense then that they can't [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=279.0s)]
*  figure out how to get the food [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=280.0s)]
*  test. Like the whole thing is [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=281.0s)]
*  it's a preposterous Frankenstein [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=283.0s)]
*  joke and like Lisa Murkowski I [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=285.0s)]
*  guess is going along with this [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=287.0s)]
*  because she just is focused on [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=288.0s)]
*  getting stuff for Alaska. Yeah [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=290.0s)]
*  so let me let's talk about [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=294.0s)]
*  Murkowski for just one second. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=296.0s)]
*  Um there's a lot of ways that [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=298.0s)]
*  Trumpism corrupts people. Uh [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=300.0s)]
*  there's you know it is obviously [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=302.0s)]
*  it's it's it's it's sometimes [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=305.0s)]
*  people are like Trumpism is not [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=306.0s)]
*  a thing because Trump has no [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=307.0s)]
*  real guiding ideology. That's [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=310.0s)]
*  true. Like it's not like what [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=313.0s)]
*  people people say Trump is and [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=314.0s)]
*  they're like and this is the [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=315.0s)]
*  philosophy that we all you know [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=317.0s)]
*  agree on. Trumpism though like [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=319.0s)]
*  it's forces he unleashed on our [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=321.0s)]
*  politics uh and one of them is [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=323.0s)]
*  I'm gonna get mine and the rest [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=326.0s)]
*  of you be damned. And so I think [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=328.0s)]
*  that Lisa Murkowski might be [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=330.0s)]
*  telling herself because a lot of [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=332.0s)]
*  people tell her this like I've [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=333.0s)]
*  met Lisa Murkowski number of [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=335.0s)]
*  times she's been one of the [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=336.0s)]
*  moderates. She's often who you [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=337.0s)]
*  turn to in moments of Republicans [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=339.0s)]
*  really doing something insane [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=342.0s)]
*  like you look at Collins, you [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=343.0s)]
*  look at Murkowski, you look at [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=344.0s)]
*  Tillis, maybe you look at [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=346.0s)]
*  Cassidy and you say you guys are [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=347.0s)]
*  normal. You know this is wrong [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=349.0s)]
*  uh and they do which is why they [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=351.0s)]
*  seek carve outs. Why is she [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=353.0s)]
*  seeking a carve out for her own [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=355.0s)]
*  state? But I want to tell Lisa [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=356.0s)]
*  Murkowski something as somebody [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=358.0s)]
*  who's admired her, defended her, [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=359.0s)]
*  really um been somebody who who [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=362.0s)]
*  pushes for the need for there to [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=364.0s)]
*  be moderates still in the Senate [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=366.0s)]
*  and the House. What is the point [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=368.0s)]
*  of you being a moderate if [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=371.0s)]
*  you're going to vote for RFK, if [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=374.0s)]
*  you're going to take carve outs [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=377.0s)]
*  as a bribe just for your people, [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=379.0s)]
*  if you're going to sell out the [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=380.0s)]
*  rest of the country, for the [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=381.0s)]
*  people who think the moderates [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=383.0s)]
*  are going to save us and and me [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=385.0s)]
*  as somebody who's who's long [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=386.0s)]
*  believed that they were [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=387.0s)]
*  important. If all it takes is a [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=388.0s)]
*  carve out for your own state [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=391.0s)]
*  like you don't understand your [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=392.0s)]
*  full job and you too have been [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=394.0s)]
*  corrupted by Trumpism. You too [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=397.0s)]
*  have drank this particular [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=399.0s)]
*  Kool-Aid of as long as I get [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=400.0s)]
*  what I need for my people, then [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=402.0s)]
*  everyone else can go screw off [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=405.0s)]
*  and it is deeply disappointing [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=407.0s)]
*  if that's what happens. Yeah, [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=409.0s)]
*  it's um the Murkowski thing it's [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=411.0s)]
*  like uh she's I guess she still [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=413.0s)]
*  has an opportunity to be the [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=415.0s)]
*  John McCain. We're sitting here [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=416.0s)]
*  we're waiting for the [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=417.0s)]
*  parliamentarian and and the [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=418.0s)]
*  rules and we've had dramatic [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=419.0s)]
*  moments in the past where a [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=420.0s)]
*  moderate has given the thumbs [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=422.0s)]
*  down. So you know folks uh may [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=423.0s)]
*  folks call Lisa Murkowski and [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=426.0s)]
*  office right now or send them [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=427.0s)]

*  try to encourage her to do the [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=429.0s)]
*  right thing but I just you know [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=430.0s)]
*  I mean it also is a there's [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=433.0s)]
*  another element of this that I [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=435.0s)]
*  think is at play which is like [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=437.0s)]
*  the interpersonal I always go [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=439.0s)]

*  cafeteria explanation of all [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=442.0s)]
*  this. Yeah, just like when John [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=443.0s)]
*  Thune gets the leadership uh you [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=445.0s)]
*  know gets in a majority leader [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=447.0s)]

*  right like they have worked [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=452.0s)]
*  together on bills you see the [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=453.0s)]
*  Senate floor here now so you [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=455.0s)]
*  can see kind of what's [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=456.0s)]
*  happening there though. I'm [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=457.0s)]
*  very if you can mute that um [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=458.0s)]
*  and uh and it feels like there's [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=460.0s)]
*  almost it's favor traving on two [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=463.0s)]

*  what's happening with this bill [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=476.0s)]
*  and takes out the bigger picture [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=477.0s)]
*  of the damage whether it uses [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=479.0s)]
*  the money or the money that's [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=481.0s)]
*  being spent on it. So it's [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=482.0s)]
*  kind of like you're concerned [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=484.0s)]
*  about the damage whether you [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=485.0s)]

*  I don't know where it came from [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=526.0s)]
*  like that is how haphazard [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=528.0s)]
*  this process is like even if [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=530.0s)]
*  you thought it was a good bill [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=531.0s)]
*  but it doesn't seem like [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=532.0s)]
*  anybody really does like it's [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=533.0s)]
*  like they're just doing this by [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=535.0s)]
*  the seat of their pants to such [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=538.0s)]
*  a degree they don't know where [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=539.0s)]
*  some of this stuff is from. And [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=540.0s)]
*  infrastructure, they would just be like ending it. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=542.0s)]
*  And here, I don't know if it is a anti-Elon thing [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=544.4s)]
*  that Trump wanted stuck in there, [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=549.4s)]
*  because yeah, everybody's like, [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=551.08s)]
*  I have no idea where this came from. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=551.92s)]
*  And think about, that is one example, [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=553.24s)]
*  amid, I don't know, 3,000 things that are in there. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=556.84s)]
*  Where there's just- [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=561.84s)]
*  As we're talking right now, six minutes ago, [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=562.68s)]
*  they're saying that they removed that excess tax. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=563.52s)]
*  But like, this is what we're doing. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=565.2s)]
*  Like, we're just doing this live. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=566.6s)]
*  Like, we're coming to the floor, [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=567.96s)]
*  the parliamentarian's working on stuff on a napkin. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=568.88s)]
*  We're putting taxes in and taking them out. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=571.28s)]
*  It's ridiculous. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=573.6s)]
*  I mean, like, they haven't even read the bill. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=574.44s)]
*  They have no idea what's in it. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=578.64s)]
*  And this is, what's interesting is, [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=579.6s)]
*  you know, as well as I do, [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=580.72s)]
*  that one of the biggest attack ads [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=581.92s)]
*  ever levied on Nancy Pelosi from the Republicans [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=584.14s)]
*  was we're gonna have to read it [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=587.76s)]
*  to find out what's in it about the ACA. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=589.52s)]
*  But the thing about reconciliation too, [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=592.76s)]
*  that it really robs the American people, [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=594.8s)]
*  speaking of the ACA, [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=597.0s)]
*  that bill had to be debated for such a long time, right? [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=599.26s)]
*  And they went through different provisions and like- [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=603.86s)]
*  Hearings. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=606.58s)]
*  Yeah, and they held hearings. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=607.42s)]
*  There was like the death panel thing. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=609.3s)]
*  So the American people actually had time [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=611.02s)]
*  to give it some due consideration. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=613.58s)]
*  And they acted like serious grownups [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=616.06s)]
*  who had difference of opinions [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=618.42s)]
*  and they heard from industry and whatever. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=619.78s)]
*  None of that's happening here. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=621.82s)]
*  Like, unless somebody has the ability to call somebody, [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=623.74s)]
*  somebody over at the Wind and Solar Association [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=626.62s)]
*  had to call up and be like, [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=629.7s)]
*  are you gonna crater our whole industry? [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=631.06s)]
*  And they had to go find, I don't know, [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=633.62s)]
*  Joni Ernst in a state where they have a lot of wind. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=635.9s)]
*  Like say, do something, get it out of there. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=639.42s)]
*  And that's how the whole thing is being crafted [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=642.62s)]
*  across a million different issues. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=644.58s)]
*  Elon's kind of right. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=648.66s)]
*  Elon is right about this. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=649.98s)]
*  I wanna get to whether how uncomfortable [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=651.08s)]
*  it makes you feel with Elon in a minute. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=653.26s)]
*  I have two other things I wanna get to. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=654.46s)]
*  So, JD Vance first is just the most unbearable person [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=657.0600000000001s)]
*  in all of public life. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=662.0600000000001s)]
*  He did this tweet thread last night [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=665.3000000000001s)]
*  that says this about the bill. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=668.34s)]
*  It's not really a great sign [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=669.94s)]
*  when the vice president of the United States [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=671.3000000000001s)]
*  has to offer this level of caveat [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=673.74s)]
*  about why people should pass a bill. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=676.1s)]
*  You would think that the VP would be a cheerleader [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=678.46s)]
*  for like the one piece of legislation [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=681.6600000000001s)]
*  they're actually gonna pass this year. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=683.74s)]
*  No, this is his argument for the bill. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=684.78s)]
*  The thing that will bankrupt this country [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=687.14s)]
*  more than any other policy is flooding the country [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=688.8199999999999s)]
*  with illegal immigrants [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=690.98s)]
*  and then giving those migrants generous benefits. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=692.38s)]
*  The OBBB fixes this problem and therefore it must pass. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=695.26s)]
*  Everything else, the CBO score, the proper baseline, [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=700.14s)]
*  the minutia of the Medicaid policy is immaterial [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=703.62s)]
*  compared to the ICE money [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=707.18s)]
*  and immigration enforcement provisions. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=708.98s)]
*  Could there be a possibly a more cynical argument [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=711.66s)]
*  for passing this bill than what the vice president offered? [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=715.5s)]
*  No, because dude, so do a standalone bill to fund ICE. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=718.3s)]
*  Like this is actually isn't hard. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=723.38s)]
*  People opposed that actually back in January. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=726.18s)]
*  Some of the immigration hardliners said they should do that. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=728.3399999999999s)]
*  Yeah, so this is when you say like, [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=730.86s)]
*  this is no way to make law. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=734.54s)]
*  It's not just cynical. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=736.5s)]
*  Like here's what I hate. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=737.38s)]
*  I hate when people who are pretty smart [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=738.66s)]
*  act really, really stupid to do this. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=740.94s)]
*  Like he knows perfectly well the idea [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=743.74s)]
*  that you have to pass a gajillion trillion dollars [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=746.7800000000001s)]
*  in new debt on a bill that nobody's read [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=750.1400000000001s)]
*  that is about giveaways to rich people [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=753.3800000000001s)]
*  and hurting people that Trump doesn't like [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=756.0200000000001s)]
*  and that we have to do it all [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=758.3000000000001s)]
*  because there's one provision around funding ICE [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=760.46s)]
*  and that's the only way it can get passed. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=763.4200000000001s)]
*  It's just, it's preposterous. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=765.34s)]
*  It's like, it's the silliest thing I've ever heard. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=767.1s)]
*  It is preposterous and I'm seeing this from, [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=769.38s)]
*  seeing multiple things from Andrew Ager today. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=771.58s)]
*  So people should sign up for his newsletter [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=773.62s)]
*  if they haven't morning shots with Bill Kristol. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=775.02s)]
*  But he sent this funny tweet that's like, wait a minute. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=777.42s)]
*  So the 3 trillion that we're adding to the debt is immaterial [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=780.34s)]
*  but the 8 billion that is going to ICE [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=785.86s)]
*  is the thing that matters? [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=789.02s)]
*  Like it doesn't, it's stupid on its face [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=790.42s)]
*  and it's condescending and it's also hateful [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=793.5s)]
*  and the actual substance of the ICE policy is also terrible. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=796.74s)]
*  They're funding, they're putting a ton of money into jails. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=799.86s)]
*  So great news for the private prison industry [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=804.0200000000001s)]
*  for ICE prisons and they are not giving any money [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=807.5400000000001s)]
*  for new judges. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=812.9000000000001s)]
*  So if you look at the whole context of this, [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=814.1800000000001s)]
*  like what they're gonna do is they just want to have [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=816.0200000000001s)]
*  the money in the budget to advance [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=817.7800000000001s)]
*  their no-do process agenda where they just nab people [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=819.4200000000001s)]
*  off the street and hold them in cells. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=822.22s)]
*  So like that is the part of the bill that JD Vance is like, [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=824.1s)]
*  it's so important that we are able to nab people [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=826.54s)]
*  off the street and hold them in cells [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=828.9399999999999s)]
*  that we should not care about the debt busting part [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=830.8199999999999s)]
*  of the bill or the cuts to Medicaid and food stamps. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=835.14s)]
*  I love the term immaterial. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=838.3399999999999s)]
*  Like the idea that you're saying it's immaterial. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=840.9399999999999s)]
*  Don't be silly and pay attention to all of these other things. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=844.3399999999999s)]
*  The rest of it is immaterial. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=848.0999999999999s)]
*  Okay, well, if it's immaterial, take it out. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=849.78s)]
*  Do the other thing. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=851.9s)]
*  It's no big. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=853.4599999999999s)]
*  Here's the thing about the judges. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=854.9399999999999s)]
*  We don't have to go like down a huge rabbit hole [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=857.46s)]
*  in immigration, but I'll tell you even in Trump 1.0, [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=858.66s)]
*  they understood that to deal with the border, [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=862.94s)]
*  the number one thing you needed was a lot more [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=866.1s)]
*  immigration judges to process people in and out. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=868.9s)]
*  Like to be able to handle the reason, [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=873.22s)]
*  one of the reasons that people sort of disappear, [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=875.58s)]
*  sorry, there's a siren going by. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=877.7s)]
*  One of the reasons that people end up doing like [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=879.78s)]
*  the no show and you know, just kind of like, [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=881.9s)]
*  is because their court dates are so far away. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=885.18s)]
*  Like it's impossible to get in front of a judge. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=888.58s)]
*  And so like, by the time they get in front of a judge, [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=890.54s)]
*  they've been here for a very long time. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=892.1s)]
*  And so like a sensible policy, [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=894.46s)]
*  just like one that made sense, [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=897.74s)]
*  like a common sense one would be that you would fund [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=898.9s)]
*  a ton of new judges, but no, you're right. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=900.74s)]
*  What they want is to fund a bunch of places [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=902.58s)]
*  to just store people without due process. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=905.46s)]
*  One more thing on JD the prick is, [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=909.78s)]
*  he tells this story, like he tries to make it seem [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=912.9s)]
*  like there is a coherent narrative for how he went maga. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=916.42s)]
*  Like the scales fell from his eyes [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=919.94s)]
*  and he saw that nationalist populism was better [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=921.74s)]
*  than the old corporate Republicanism [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=924.02s)]
*  and the neocon Republicanism. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=925.98s)]
*  So that's why he started to care more about immigration [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=927.9s)]
*  and about working class Americans. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=930.94s)]
*  But here's the thing, in 2017 that aforementioned [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=933.7s)]
*  John McCain thumbs down vote, JD was on John McCain side. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=935.94s)]
*  This was in 2017 after Trump was president, [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=940.42s)]
*  after he suggested he might be Hitler. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=942.74s)]
*  And he wrote this, the Senate bill offers a bit more [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=944.82s)]
*  to the needy, but still leaves many unable to pay [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=948.9399999999999s)]
*  for basic services and the rosiest projections [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=951.42s)]
*  of each version, millions will be unable to pay [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=953.98s)]
*  for basic healthcare. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=957.32s)]
*  This should not be acceptable. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=959.14s)]
*  So it's like during his populist conversion [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=961.1s)]
*  between 2017 and now, he also somehow has decided [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=964.54s)]
*  that he cares less about healthcare for poor people. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=969.18s)]
*  Like the whole thing, you know what I mean? [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=972.6999999999999s)]
*  It belies the narrative that he wants to tell [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=974.42s)]
*  about his conversion in a major way. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=978.9s)]
*  This is where there's a bunch to unpack here [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=980.9399999999999s)]
*  in terms of both Republicans having to come to terms [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=983.9s)]
*  with the fact that their new voters rely [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=988.18s)]
*  on these social services, right? [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=991.9399999999999s)]
*  When you, the previous Republican party [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=993.42s)]
*  was all about fiscal discipline in a way [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=996.5799999999999s)]
*  where they were like, look, we're gonna be clear-eyed [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=998.66s)]
*  which meant somewhat cold about things [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1001.38s)]
*  in order to try to make these programs, solve it. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1003.66s)]
*  There were these academic conversations. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1007.02s)]
*  This was part of the Republican party [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1009.3s)]
*  when we talked about it. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1010.58s)]
*  But now, the Republican party, their voters, [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1011.7s)]
*  and I've heard this a ton in focus groups [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1016.62s)]
*  where people are like, I don't wanna lose my stuff. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1019.98s)]
*  I'm glad Trump's doing things, taking on trans things [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1022.9s)]
*  and saying there's two genders, [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1026.32s)]
*  but I don't want giveaways to rich people [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1027.74s)]
*  that are gonna cut my benefits. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1031.18s)]
*  I rely on those benefits [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1032.46s)]
*  and actually I'll play some focus groups [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1033.3s)]
*  out for you in a minute. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1034.74s)]
*  And so part of this is, and this is where Trump [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1036.94s)]
*  is such a weird animal because he talks like a populist, [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1039.54s)]
*  but he still governs in some ways [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1045.16s)]
*  like the worst version of the old Republican party, right? [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1048.26s)]
*  Which is I'm gonna give total tax cuts [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1053.1000000000001s)]
*  only to my wealthy friends. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1056.54s)]
*  This is true. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1057.82s)]
*  The Democrats' critique of this is absolutely true [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1058.6399999999999s)]
*  that there is, the thing that Republicans [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1061.18s)]
*  are panicked about right now, [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1063.1399999999999s)]
*  the reason they are jamming this thing through [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1064.62s)]
*  is that if they think if these tax cuts expire [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1066.78s)]
*  on their watch and their tax rates go up for their voters, [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1070.02s)]
*  that that's the only failure, right? [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1074.0s)]
*  But that's what they don't seem to be thinking [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1077.3799999999999s)]
*  is that it's gonna be a massive failure for them [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1079.3799999999999s)]
*  when so many of their voters [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1081.02s)]
*  lose snap and Medicaid benefits. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1082.6599999999999s)]
*  And also I wanna just talk about JD Vance's, [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1086.02s)]
*  I don't know that it's a, what did you call it? [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1088.34s)]
*  I would like to call it- [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1090.98s)]
*  Conversion story, I call it the Saul Tamar Lago journey. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1092.1s)]
*  Okay, I would like to call it his transition. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1095.02s)]
*  Because- Gender affirming care. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1097.9s)]
*  Yeah, I think and that's what he's getting right now. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1100.34s)]
*  He's getting his transition care [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1102.3799999999999s)]
*  where he basically literally, [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1105.02s)]
*  look, the thing is it's not a new story [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1107.18s)]
*  that JD Vance was a different person. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1108.9s)]
*  He was one of us, one of us back in the day. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1110.4s)]
*  Literally, he was like never Trump blogger. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1113.54s)]
*  And he was literally one of us. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1116.6599999999999s)]
*  Yeah, Trump was Hitler, you know, the whole, [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1117.82s)]
*  but this idea, right, of his transition [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1121.3799999999999s)]
*  was that he really cared about poor people. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1124.06s)]
*  This is not a bill that supports poor people. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1126.26s)]
*  It's just not. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1128.86s)]
*  I wanna play your aforementioned focus group audio [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1130.3s)]
*  and then kind of talk about on the other side, [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1134.86s)]
*  but what you think the political implications of this [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1137.34s)]
*  are gonna be if it continues on this trajectory [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1139.7s)]
*  and they jam this through on a 50-50 vote. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1142.5s)]
*  Let's listen. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1144.46s)]
*  It's not gonna affect me today, but it's gonna affect, [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1145.98s)]
*  you know what I mean, a lot of people [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1147.94s)]
*  in four to eight years from now. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1148.8600000000001s)]
*  I think there's good and bad in it, but I think all bills, [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1150.38s)]
*  you're never gonna see a bill where it's just good in there. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1153.02s)]
*  If you sit there and once you read into something [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1155.26s)]
*  that's going on, you're gonna see eight things you like [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1156.94s)]
*  and four things you don't like in it. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1159.0600000000002s)]
*  At the end of the day, I'm not giving Trump a million dollars [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1160.9s)]
*  or $10 million, someone else is, [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1163.94s)]
*  and when they ask him for a favor to do something, [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1165.74s)]
*  he's gonna have to do that. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1167.8200000000002s)]
*  I don't have the money to be a lobbyist like that. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1168.64s)]
*  So at the end of the day, I just, you know what I mean, [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1170.5s)]
*  I just hope that they take some of the things out of it [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1172.8600000000001s)]
*  and I hope, you know what I mean, [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1174.66s)]
*  that they think about the everyday American in it. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1175.7s)]
*  One thing I like is if you do some gig work, [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1177.5400000000002s)]
*  the 1099K is gonna be reversed. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1180.6200000000001s)]
*  Right now, when Biden was $600, you had a report, [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1183.46s)]
*  they're gonna bring it back to 220,000 with this bill. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1186.66s)]
*  The one thing I'm concerned about is my father [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1190.46s)]
*  and my mother and my uncle, they're all in their 80s. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1192.94s)]
*  They count on that Medicaid and if they end up [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1196.18s)]
*  in a nursing home, the Medicaid usually pays [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1199.1000000000001s)]
*  for that service. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1201.02s)]
*  If they cut that, that could be a problem in the future. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1203.18s)]
*  It's not gonna affect me today but... [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1206.98s)]
*  Those were the wrong clips, Bear. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1210.18s)]
*  Those are fine clips, but those aren't the ones I sent you. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1212.74s)]
*  So could you play the ones I sent you, please? [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1215.8600000000001s)]
*  Who are we trying to listen to? [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1219.0600000000002s)]
*  Sarah, which focus groups? [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1221.18s)]
*  Tell us about which focus groups we're listening to. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1222.66s)]
*  So these are all Biden to Trump voters, right? [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1224.8200000000002s)]
*  Which, so these kind of swingier voters. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1229.22s)]
*  And the clips I wanted to have Barry listen to, [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1232.34s)]
*  which if he's got them, I want him to play them. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1237.4199999999998s)]
*  Do you have them, Bear? [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1241.34s)]
*  All right. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1244.82s)]
*  This is just like live TV where you... [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1246.8999999999999s)]
*  Sarah, just tell us about it. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1249.4599999999998s)]
*  You just maybe do the voice. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1250.54s)]
*  Maybe do the voice. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1252.22s)]
*  There's a woman who I really, [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1254.1399999999999s)]
*  it's important for people to hear her [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1256.62s)]
*  because she is somebody who talks about raising her kids [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1258.06s)]
*  on the $900 she gets from the government. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1261.38s)]
*  And she is very clear that the cuts to SNAP and Medicaid, [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1264.3000000000002s)]
*  like she is glued to her TV right now, this woman. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1270.42s)]
*  She has been, she has read absolutely everything [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1273.3000000000002s)]
*  about this bill because she's so scared [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1276.5400000000002s)]
*  about what's gonna happen if these cuts go through. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1280.74s)]
*  And she voted for Trump this last time [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1283.18s)]
*  and she was the one who actually was saying, [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1285.42s)]
*  I got the idea. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1287.3400000000001s)]
*  I like what Trump's done on a couple of places, [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1289.1000000000001s)]
*  but on the trans stuff. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1291.46s)]
*  And JVL actually has made real mincemeat out of this woman. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1294.78s)]
*  But the other clips that are in there were indicated. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1298.1000000000001s)]
*  I have the audio. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1301.3400000000001s)]
*  Go ahead. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1302.54s)]
*  Okay. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1303.38s)]
*  Draw SSI disability, I get Medicaid and I get food stamps [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1304.98s)]
*  and I don't draw money for my kids, okay. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1308.5800000000002s)]
*  But I'm supposed to live off $900 a month [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1311.3400000000001s)]
*  from the government. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1314.3400000000001s)]
*  And with them turning around and cutting Medicaid, [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1315.6599999999999s)]
*  I'm already struggling to pay for medications. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1318.82s)]
*  They're gonna take and take and take [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1322.82s)]
*  until there's nothing left. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1324.3s)]
*  More requirements for Medicaid I think was good. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1325.6999999999998s)]
*  And also the overtime, the taxes on overtime [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1328.3s)]
*  and tips I thought was good too. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1331.1399999999999s)]
*  I know it increases the national debt, [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1332.78s)]
*  but I think if we get some of these programs [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1335.1s)]
*  like under control, that'll eventually even out. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1337.58s)]
*  I'm not quite sure about the budget increases [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1340.9799999999998s)]
*  and the debt ceiling, putting everything into one bill. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1344.94s)]
*  It seems kind of crazy to try to push all these things [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1348.8200000000002s)]
*  through at the same time without people picking [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1353.6200000000001s)]
*  and choosing what they think is not good. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1356.78s)]
*  I draw SSI disability, I get Medicaid. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1360.42s)]
*  So the first woman was the one I really wanted to play [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1364.46s)]
*  because I think that she's a really good example [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1367.6200000000001s)]
*  of people who are part of the Trump coalition now, right. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1370.54s)]
*  And there's a lot of people like her. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1373.6599999999999s)]
*  But the other clips are also people, [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1375.82s)]
*  you kind of have, it's an interesting, [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1378.34s)]
*  you've sort of got the Elon wing of the Republican party [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1381.2199999999998s)]
*  where people are concerned about it adding to the debt. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1383.82s)]
*  And then you've got the personal consequences wing [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1386.78s)]
*  of the Republican party who are like, [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1389.4599999999998s)]
*  no, this is gonna impact me. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1391.02s)]
*  I don't like it, I don't care about it. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1393.4599999999998s)]
*  Then there's also the sort of third category of people [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1395.5s)]
*  who I would be like, I don't know, I kind of trust Trump. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1397.62s)]
*  I think it's gonna be fine. [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1401.5s)]
*  I hope it's gonna be fine, like fingers crossed, [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1403.78s)]
*  but my parents are old and so I hope that, [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1405.66s)]
*  they don't get kicked off Medicaid. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1409.22s)]
*  But the overall thing is the voters don't like this bill. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1412.38s)]
*  Trump voters don't like this bill. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1415.54s)]
*  He doesn't have a cheerleading section on this. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1417.58s)]
*  The people who are voting right now to pass it [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1420.42s)]
*  are not listening to their voters. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1423.38s)]
*  The bill is so unpopular and people, [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1427.9s)]
*  and it's unpopular basically based on what people [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1432.7s)]
*  know about it, which is they're still like, [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1434.74s)]
*  I don't know everything that's in it, so I'm worried. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1436.98s)]
*  They know it cuts Medicare and Medicaid. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1439.46s)]
*  They know it gives tax cuts to rich people. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1441.9399999999998s)]
*  And there's nobody who's there saying, [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1445.46s)]
*  and they know how much it costs. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1449.1s)]
*  And they're against this kind of reconciliation, [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1450.5s)]
*  these big bills. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1454.34s)]
*  I've heard this a lot in focus groups [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1455.54s)]
*  where people are saying, why do we do it this way? [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1456.98s)]
*  This is crazy. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1460.86s)]
*  I can't think of a time when you've had something [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1465.22s)]
*  that is like this much of a unpopular thing [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1467.6599999999999s)]
*  that these guys are gonna jam through. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1471.58s)]
*  They know this is gonna be actual nightmare fuel [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1474.78s)]
*  for them in 2026. [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1477.4199999999998s)]
*  This gives Democrats just a perfect position going into 26. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1479.3799999999999s)]
*  How do you square that, [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1484.06s)]
*  what you're hearing the focus groups from? [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1485.78s)]
*  The top line numbers on this bill are bad, [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1487.6200000000001s)]
*  but there's some other polls came out recently [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1491.38s)]
*  that show that people really also don't know [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1493.5s)]
*  a lot about it yet. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1495.22s)]
*  I don't know, maybe that's what Republicans are banking on. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1498.14s)]
*  On the one hand, maybe that they can sell it better. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1501.02s)]
*  They do have ads running on this right now. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1503.78s)]
*  I've been seeing some of them done in Louisiana, [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1505.26s)]
*  but at the same time, they're jamming it through [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1506.8200000000002s)]
*  because they also seem conscious of the fact [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1509.8200000000002s)]
*  that the more people learn about it, [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1511.46s)]
*  the more they're gonna dislike it. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1512.54s)]
*  So I don't know, how do you kind of square all that? [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1513.74s)]
*  I said this on TNL, but there's like one of the, [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1517.02s)]
*  I can't remember who the legislator was who said this, [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1520.9399999999998s)]
*  but he was like, you gotta get these things passed fast [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1523.54s)]
*  because otherwise they're like a dead cat on a front porch [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1526.34s)]
*  or a dead cat on the steps. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1530.1399999999999s)]
*  The longer it sits out there, the more it stinks. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1531.74s)]
*  And so, yeah, this is the more voters learn about it. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1535.1799999999998s)]
*  This is why Trump has really tried to focus [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1539.78s)]
*  on the kajillion things that are in there. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1541.6599999999999s)]
*  There's only a few things people really know. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1543.62s)]
*  Cuts Medicaid, tax cuts for the rich [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1545.82s)]
*  and the no tax on tips stuff. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1549.1399999999999s)]
*  You heard some people say that like, [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1552.1s)]
*  oh, it's good for gig workers. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1553.58s)]
*  That's the main thing. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1555.5s)]
*  This bill does a lot of things. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1556.74s)]
*  And it's going so fast that I think even people [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1560.02s)]
*  who are really experts in this, [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1562.22s)]
*  we've got some very smart experts in healthcare [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1564.06s)]
*  and John Cohn, I mean, we're all in our slack. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1567.4199999999998s)]
*  And he is, I'm not sure there's anybody [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1570.74s)]
*  who knows more than John Cohn. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1572.86s)]
*  And like Joe Perticone's basically sleeping up [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1574.7s)]
*  at the Capitol. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1576.62s)]
*  And we're all in slack right now being like, [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1577.46s)]
*  what does it say? [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1579.78s)]
*  What's in there? [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1580.86s)]
*  Like, because not only it was unclear always [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1581.7s)]
*  and now it's more unclear because they're changing things [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1585.9s)]
*  while it's going through. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1589.02s)]
*  Yeah, one thing I did, I just wanna follow up on [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1591.26s)]
*  because I mentioned yesterday on the pod, [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1593.18s)]
*  speaking of like all of these changes [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1594.74s)]
*  that are just happening like overnight was, [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1596.02s)]
*  there was this horrible provision that was going to ban [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1599.3s)]
*  the states from regulating AI for a certain number of years [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1602.62s)]
*  or else they weren't gonna be able to get any money [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1605.6999999999998s)]
*  from the federal government. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1607.06s)]
*  That did get stripped last night, 99 to one. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1607.8999999999999s)]
*  It was a Ted Cruz provision. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1611.54s)]
*  So I guess people don't really, [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1615.02s)]
*  it sounds like people like Ted Cruz that much, [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1617.34s)]
*  99 to one again. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1619.58s)]
*  So that was a pleasant change. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1620.74s)]
*  All right, we're still waiting to kind of see [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1623.34s)]
*  if there's any additional developments [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1625.1399999999999s)]
*  on the actual vote here. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1628.9399999999998s)]
*  But in the meantime, the Trump-Elon feud [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1630.58s)]
*  reignited this morning. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1633.6999999999998s)]
*  Bannon suggested that they need to nationalize SpaceX. [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1637.06s)]
*  Again, that's something he's been asking for for a while. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1642.8999999999999s)]
*  Elon replied to Bannon that Bannon needs to go back [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1644.86s)]
*  to prison for a long time. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1647.62s)]
*  So they're still at it. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1650.58s)]
*  And then Trump was asked about deporting Elon [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1651.86s)]
*  outside the White House this morning [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1656.9399999999998s)]
*  and we're gonna break our No Trump Audio rule [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1658.58s)]
*  just because this is too delicious to miss. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1660.82s)]
*  Let's listen. [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1662.94s)]
*  The rest, we got a lot of hostages back. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1664.86s)]
*  So we're gonna discuss it with you. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1667.22s)]
*  Is there any way to get on the opposite side [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1668.86s)]
*  of the board for Elon Musk? [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1670.7s)]
*  I don't know, I think we'll have to think it over. [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1673.3s)]
*  We might have to put Doge on Elon. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1675.94s)]
*  You know what Doge is? [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1679.1s)]
*  Doge is the monster that might have to go back [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1680.98s)]
*  and eat Elon, he'll never be there. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1683.94s)]
*  He gets a lot of subsidies, Peter. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1686.6599999999999s)]
*  But Elon's very upset that the EV mandate [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1689.3s)]
*  is gonna be terminated. [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1693.3799999999999s)]
*  And you know what, when you look at it, [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1694.62s)]
*  who wants, not everybody wants an electric car. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1696.46s)]
*  I don't want an electric car, I wanna have maybe gasoline, [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1700.4199999999998s)]
*  maybe electric, maybe a hybrid, [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1702.6999999999998s)]
*  maybe someday a hydrogen, if you have a hydrogen car. [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1705.34s)]
*  The dentures are out. [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1709.6999999999998s)]
*  Really sorry, he's sounding more and more like the SNL [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1711.22s)]
*  version of himself, I think, with the dentures there. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1714.66s)]
*  But I thought it was interesting, [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1718.98s)]
*  there are a couple of interesting things I noticed there. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1721.18s)]
*  Doge is a monster in Trump's view. [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1724.46s)]
*  And the monster he wants to go back and maybe eat Elon [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1729.18s)]
*  and go after his subsidies. [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1732.26s)]
*  I think that was kind of revealing, I don't know. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1734.98s)]
*  What do you think? [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1737.02s)]
*  I mean, I like it when he asks the reporters, [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1739.78s)]
*  you've heard of Doge? [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1742.9s)]
*  Do you know what Doge is? [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1744.58s)]
*  And then he completely, then he says something [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1745.42s)]
*  that maybe makes it seem like he doesn't know what Doge is. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1747.46s)]
*  It was unclear exactly what he defined. [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1752.66s)]
*  It's a monster that could eat Elon. [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1754.54s)]
*  I mean, I guess what he means, I mean, [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1756.22s)]
*  it's just a threat to take away the subsidies. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1758.06s)]
*  And when you say it's revealing, [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1761.18s)]
*  I think what's never been clear is when Elon had his hands [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1764.18s)]
*  all over the federal government, what did he do? [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1768.3s)]
*  What did he do in there? [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1772.1s)]
*  And I think that Trump's, Trump has spent, [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1774.22s)]
*  I mean, he's only been there for five months [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1779.02s)]
*  and Doge is like central to what he did [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1780.66s)]
*  for the first few things, right? [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1783.58s)]
*  Kept putting Elon in the White House. [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1784.6200000000001s)]
*  And now Doge is, I guess something he's gonna wield [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1786.54s)]
*  against Elon or it's a bad thing. [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1791.34s)]
*  It was unclear to me. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1794.06s)]
*  What do you think he was talking about? [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1794.9s)]
*  I just, yeah. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1796.78s)]
*  I think Trump sees Doge as something that caused him pain [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1799.46s)]
*  and that he wasn't really that bought in on. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1802.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1804.98s)]
*  Honestly, I think that he, Trump kind of saw it [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1806.02s)]
*  as Elon is a really rich guy that helped me win. [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1810.6200000000001s)]
*  And he's sucking up to me and talking about [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1815.18s)]
*  how I'm the greatest and he got us into the outer space. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1816.82s)]
*  And he's like a real successful guy, right? [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1822.5s)]
*  And people respect him. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1824.66s)]
*  And so Trump is susceptible to that kind of flattery [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1825.5s)]
*  as we know, right? [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1828.1s)]
*  And so I think that it's like, he felt like, okay, [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1829.18s)]
*  well, I got this really smart guy that wants to come [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1833.7s)]
*  and be my shadow president. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1837.42s)]
*  And he thinks that there's a lot of fraud and waste [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1839.38s)]
*  and I don't really like these deep state officials anyway. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1842.74s)]
*  So if he wants to cause them trouble, who cares? [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1846.8600000000001s)]
*  And I'll just let him loose. [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1848.94s)]
*  But that like, it was never really part, [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1851.74s)]
*  like that wasn't part of Trump's agenda. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1854.06s)]
*  Like when you hear Trump talking on the campaign trail [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1856.02s)]
*  about deportations and tariffs and revenge [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1858.1000000000001s)]
*  in the 2020 election, [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1861.02s)]
*  he might've mentioned cutting spending before. [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1862.3000000000002s)]
*  It's not like he never mentioned it, [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1864.38s)]
*  but that was not what Trump cared about. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1865.22s)]
*  And I think that Elon got in there [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1867.74s)]
*  and it became a fucking hassle for him. [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1870.1000000000001s)]
*  People were mad at him, people were asking, he's like, why? [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1872.8200000000002s)]
*  And then all of a sudden, Elon's calling him a pedophile. [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1876.3000000000002s)]
*  And then it's like, wait a minute. [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1879.0200000000002s)]
*  And so to me, it seems like he's flipped [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1880.8200000000002s)]
*  on the whole thing, right? [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1883.22s)]
*  Like now the whole thing is kind of tainted [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1884.3400000000001s)]
*  and he sees it as a political loser for him [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1886.94s)]
*  and he's mad at Elon over it. [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1889.3000000000002s)]
*  Anyway, that's my psychotherapy for Donald Trump [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1891.34s)]
*  for the day. [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1893.4199999999998s)]
*  Yeah, I think that's pretty good. [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1894.78s)]
*  I do think it's interesting the way that, [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1896.78s)]
*  I mean, the mafia stuff, right? [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1899.58s)]
*  The way he's gonna wield the federal government [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1902.26s)]
*  against Elon and to be clear, he backed Elon off [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1904.6599999999999s)]
*  the first time they had one of these fights [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1908.3s)]
*  with these threats. [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1910.78s)]
*  Elon kind of did a, shouldn't have gone there. [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1912.5s)]
*  It was too much, I went too far. [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1915.78s)]
*  And I don't know if he just like started hitting [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1918.34s)]
*  the ketamine pipe. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1920.1s)]
*  Is ketamine something you take out of a pipe? [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1920.8999999999999s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1922.82s)]
*  It's snort usually, I think. [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1923.6599999999999s)]
*  Not an expert, but my understanding is snorting, yeah. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1924.82s)]
*  So I don't know if he's back on the ketamine [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1928.54s)]
*  or like, if this is actually a deeply held principle, [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1930.8999999999999s)]
*  but part of what Elon is doing right now [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1933.82s)]
*  is he's back in the like, I will primary [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1936.3799999999999s)]
*  every Republican who votes for this bill. [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1939.46s)]
*  And it was like, if it's the last thing I do on this earth, [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1942.02s)]
*  which is very intense, Elon feels. [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1945.82s)]
*  But I'm like rooting for you, buddy. [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1948.7s)]
*  You should do that. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1953.54s)]
*  Do you feel any, this is what I wanted to get out of you. [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1954.74s)]
*  Do you feel any mixed emotions about Elon now at all? [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1957.74s)]
*  And you really turned on him very harshly, [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1960.7s)]
*  but now he's kind of speaking your language [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1962.74s)]
*  in a lot of ways. [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1964.66s)]
*  Elon is concerned about the deficit. [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1965.5s)]
*  Elon thinks maybe we need a centrist third party. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1968.02s)]
*  Elon thinks Donald Trump's a pedophile. [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1971.6200000000001s)]
*  You and Elon are starting to come into alignment [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1973.98s)]
*  in a few areas. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1976.5800000000002s)]
*  Does that make you at all? [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1977.46s)]
*  Yeah, this is like that onion thing, [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1978.94s)]
*  like worst person in the world makes a decent point. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1982.46s)]
*  Makes a great point. [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1985.26s)]
*  And so like, I think he's right about the fact that, [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1986.66s)]
*  and I do, I am enjoying watching him exact pain from them [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1990.66s)]
*  because the fact that he has elevated [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1995.42s)]
*  how much spending there is in this bill, [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1997.6200000000001s)]
*  what it's gonna do to the debt and deficit. [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=1999.82s)]
*  You're right. [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2001.58s)]
*  I was a super moderate Republican, [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2002.98s)]
*  but one thing I care a lot about is the debt and the deficit. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2004.5s)]
*  And I think that Republicans should be shamed constantly [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2008.1399999999999s)]
*  by their former comrade in arms [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2013.46s)]
*  for the way that they're blowing up the debt and deficit. [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2016.18s)]
*  Because people should know that it's all talk with them. [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2019.1399999999999s)]
*  It's all talk, the Doge stuff, all of it. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2021.62s)]
*  I think that similarly, [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2024.18s)]
*  there's some emotional stuff on Elon's side though, [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2025.34s)]
*  where he felt like he was trying to do something on Doge [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2027.3799999999999s)]
*  and like he got embarrassed by it. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2031.78s)]
*  Like he went in there [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2035.02s)]
*  and actually couldn't do any of the things that he said. [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2035.86s)]
*  Then the administration, Trump hung him out to dry on it. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2038.3s)]
*  And so now he's like back coming for Trump. [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2041.4599999999998s)]
*  So I do think they are taking it personally, [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2044.02s)]
*  but I also think Elon has realized that Trump holds, [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2045.74s)]
*  and I think actually maybe I have too, slightly. [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2048.5s)]
*  Trump holds more cards than Elon. [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2051.66s)]
*  Like I always sort of think, man, Elon's got a lot. [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2053.42s)]
*  He's got a lot of money. [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2055.42s)]
*  He's threatened to primary people. [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2056.2599999999998s)]
*  He basically bought Trump out this last go round, [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2059.62s)]
*  I mean, just so much money on the election. [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2063.62s)]
*  Wouldn't that be scary? [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2068.2599999999998s)]
*  But like Trump does have a lot of leverage [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2069.58s)]
*  because Trump no longer, [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2073.14s)]
*  it's not like Trump cares about Congress. [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2074.42s)]
*  And so like he can just go in there and snip, snap, snip, [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2075.86s)]
*  Elon's contracts, those things. [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2079.14s)]
*  Remember when Trump was doing though, [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2081.06s)]
*  everyone should have a Tesla. [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2082.74s)]
*  They had Teslas out on the front lawn of the White House. [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2084.2599999999998s)]
*  And I was like, this is absurd. [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2088.02s)]
*  And now Trump's like, I don't want an electric car. [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2090.46s)]
*  I want an electric car, that's garbage. [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2092.42s)]
*  Onto your point about the Republicans claim [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2095.34s)]
*  to care about the debt being shamed. [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2096.98s)]
*  I think we should just take a moment [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2098.2200000000003s)]
*  to specifically shame Ron Johnson. [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2099.34s)]
*  Ron Johnson got out on his high horse [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2101.6s)]
*  talking about how this bill is a debt bomb [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2103.56s)]
*  and how he could never support it [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2105.7400000000002s)]
*  and how he got into Congress [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2107.02s)]
*  because he was worried about irresponsible budgeting. [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2108.2200000000003s)]
*  And he went on the All In podcast with Elon's pals [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2111.42s)]
*  and they all buttered him up and washed his balls. [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2114.38s)]
*  And was like, Ron, you're the one's real guy. [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2116.86s)]
*  You're the one straight talker in Washington. [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2119.2200000000003s)]
*  Where's Ron today? [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2121.82s)]
*  Voting for the bill. [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2122.78s)]
*  Voting for the bill. [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2124.1800000000003s)]
*  So he learned the lesson about, I guess, [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2125.54s)]
*  he watched the Elon Trump feud. [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2127.1000000000004s)]
*  So no principled hawks, fiscal hawks to be had. [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2130.02s)]
*  Even though I guess if this bill does pass, [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2134.1800000000003s)]
*  it'll go back to the House [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2135.5800000000004s)]
*  and we'll have a chance to be disappointed again [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2137.1000000000004s)]
*  by the remaining three people [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2139.42s)]
*  who claim to be fiscal hawks in the House, like Chip Roy. [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2141.2200000000003s)]
*  I guess, but we'll see. [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2144.46s)]
*  So here, let's talk about the House for just one second. [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2147.06s)]
*  Because part of what's interesting is [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2149.38s)]
*  there's a bunch of people who've already said no. [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2151.34s)]
*  I mean, a bunch like Chip Roy. [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2153.6200000000003s)]
*  So they say like they're already nos [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2155.1000000000004s)]
*  on the Senate version of the bill. [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2157.78s)]
*  Right? [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2159.26s)]
*  And so they don't have a lot of room. [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2160.1000000000004s)]
*  But what's interesting is the dynamic is kind of flipped [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2165.46s)]
*  in the House versus the Senate. [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2168.86s)]
*  In the Senate, there are people [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2171.3s)]
*  that we think of as moderates [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2172.7400000000002s)]
*  that we think could have pulled the John McCain [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2174.54s)]
*  and, you know, knock this bill out. [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2176.9s)]
*  On the House side though, [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2179.7400000000002s)]
*  it is like the genuine fiscal hawks. [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2182.78s)]
*  It's Massey, you know, whatever. [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2185.58s)]
*  And like, yeah, genuine. [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2187.06s)]
*  But some of them hold out. [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2189.58s)]
*  Like they will create trouble. [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2190.54s)]
*  Yeah, Massey will for sure. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2192.78s)]
*  We'll see if anyone else. [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2194.62s)]
*  Massey will for sure. [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2195.46s)]
*  So I think that this is not the last time [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2197.38s)]
*  we're gonna have to do a live stream [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2200.98s)]
*  watching people vote because it will be, you know, [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2202.54s)]
*  the wing of a hair's breath of whether or not [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2207.3s)]
*  this thing passes the House. [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2211.1400000000003s)]
*  And it's gonna change again. [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2212.38s)]
*  Yeah, it won't be the last time today. [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2214.0600000000004s)]
*  So once again, for folks who are just tuned in on the live, [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2215.3s)]
*  this is a part of the Bulwark podcast for today. [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2217.34s)]
*  We're gonna continue to live stream here in a little bit [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2219.9s)]
*  once I have to hop off with some of our other friends, [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2222.6200000000003s)]
*  JVL, Jonathan Cohn, who's kind of an expert on the bill. [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2226.5s)]
*  Sam Stein might pop on. [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2229.38s)]
*  Sarah's gonna hang out. [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2230.86s)]
*  I might come back. [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2231.7000000000003s)]
*  We'll see how things go. [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2232.5400000000004s)]
*  But the latest thing we have right here [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2233.38s)]
*  is the Senate parliamentarian knocked down [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2236.22s)]
*  a handwritten parenthetical notation [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2240.2599999999998s)]
*  in the Murkowski-focused Medicaid provision [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2242.7s)]
*  that created a special preference [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2245.2999999999997s)]
*  for an Alaskan Medicaid fund, according to some Democrats. [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2247.1s)]
*  So, you know, I don't know what Lucy [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2251.74s)]
*  would have football around here, [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2253.68s)]
*  but interesting that Murkowski hasn't gotten everything [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2255.9s)]
*  that she wanted as far as the carve-outs are concerned. [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2260.62s)]
*  And they need her vote. [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2264.66s)]
*  I mean, they either need her or Collins, it seems like, [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2267.3399999999997s)]
*  or I guess Tom Tillis or Rand Pollack. [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2272.02s)]
*  That's the four. [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2274.7799999999997s)]
*  They need one of those four. [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2275.62s)]
*  And Murkowski was the one that, [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2277.2999999999997s)]
*  at least at the time of we're taping this, [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2279.58s)]
*  looked the most optimistic. [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2281.1s)]
*  So we'll see. [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2282.22s)]
*  Sarah, before we sign off here, [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2283.66s)]
*  I've got two real quick questions for you. [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2286.6s)]
*  And then we'll continue kind of live coverage [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2288.46s)]
*  with the different group in a minute to stick around. [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2291.16s)]
*  But does this make you at all less worried [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2292.94s)]
*  about the fascism? [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2297.58s)]
*  It's the only green line I have, [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2299.02s)]
*  green chute I have about this whole thing. [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2301.18s)]
*  The only silver lining is like, [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2302.66s)]
*  these people don't seem [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2304.7000000000003s)]
*  like very effective authoritarians right now. [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2305.54s)]
*  I mean, Congress, though, what it is is, no, no, no. [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2310.32s)]
*  Trump is the authoritarian. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2314.86s)]
*  And what Congress has done is assume a supine position [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2316.26s)]
*  so that his authoritarianism can run right over them. [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2320.82s)]
*  They basically don't do their jobs. [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2323.34s)]
*  If they stood up and killed his bill [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2324.6800000000003s)]
*  and said, we're not gonna give this to you, [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2327.6200000000003s)]
*  I would feel like, hey, that's good. [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2329.44s)]
*  That is a green chute. [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2334.2200000000003s)]
*  But the Senate moderates, here's the thing. [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2335.82s)]
*  The Senate moderates roll over for this [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2338.78s)]
*  and Murkowski votes for it. [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2340.86s)]
*  And there's other Senate moderates [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2343.34s)]
*  that have already rolled, like Cassidy. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2346.94s)]
*  Hey, hey, Cassidy. [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2349.7s)]
*  Former doctor. [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2351.54s)]
*  How's it going with the vaccines? [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2352.7799999999997s)]
*  Are we happy with, did Maha keep their promise here [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2354.5s)]
*  about how they're gonna take vaccines seriously? [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2357.8599999999997s)]
*  No. [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2360.2599999999998s)]
*  The moderates go elect Democrats. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2362.18s)]
*  Like there is no point to the moderates. [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2366.14s)]
*  They do not do anything to stop the authoritarianism. [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2368.58s)]
*  So no, I'm not sanguine about that at all. [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2372.54s)]
*  Final topic. [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2376.02s)]
*  Bill Kristol made me mention this to you. [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2377.44s)]
*  He sent me a message and he said, [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2379.32s)]
*  you have to ask Sarah to close the pot [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2380.84s)]
*  about the Trump fragrances. [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2382.4s)]
*  Bill quoted the Mary wives of Windsor [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2384.7200000000003s)]
*  and saying it must be the rankest compound [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2387.52s)]
*  of villainous smell that ever offended the nostril. [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2390.04s)]
*  I thought that was a very Bill Kristol poll right there. [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2393.6s)]
*  Trump is now selling Chanel, selling, [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2396.7200000000003s)]
*  not Chanel smelling, but Chanel priced fragrances. [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2399.84s)]
*  And I don't know. [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2404.68s)]
*  Does that like fill you with despair or laughter? [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2405.6s)]
*  The idea that the president is such a fucking hack grifter, [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2410.64s)]
*  late night salesman? [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2415.2799999999997s)]
*  Well, this is always the tough thing about Trump [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2417.96s)]
*  is he gives you something that you wanna laugh at. [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2420.16s)]
*  But if you think about it for a second, [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2422.52s)]
*  you're like, like it's too embarrassing to contemplate. [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2424.12s)]
*  The president of the United States, [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2428.96s)]
*  phones, shoes, fragrances. [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2431.44s)]
*  And it's like Trump 45 and 47. [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2434.16s)]
*  It's like, it smells like winning. [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2436.6s)]
*  Like I am embarrassed to live in a country [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2438.2799999999997s)]
*  where there are people who would buy that. [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2441.96s)]
*  You should feel ashamed. [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2444.0s)]
*  I don't care what it smells like. [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2445.04s)]
*  Maybe it does smell like winning. [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2446.3999999999996s)]
*  Maybe it's really good. [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2447.64s)]
*  The fact that you would purchase something from this guy, [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2449.2799999999997s)]
*  like that's the least American thing I can think of. [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2453.08s)]
*  Americans should mock this kind of stuff. [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2455.3999999999996s)]
*  Imagine what JD Vance would say [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2458.52s)]
*  about a third world country's leader selling a fragrance. [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2462.76s)]
*  Think we all just know what would happen there [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2467.8s)]
*  and how they would treat those folks. [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2470.32s)]
*  But that's what it is in ours. [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2471.88s)]
*  We have our own Banana Republic, a Magga Banana Republic. [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2473.2000000000003s)]
*  Everybody on YouTube, stick around. [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2476.32s)]
*  We've got more people coming in. [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2478.2000000000003s)]
*  I've got to go pop off. [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2479.6400000000003s)]
*  And for the podcast listeners, appreciate you. [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2481.92s)]
*  We'll see you back here tomorrow. [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2484.1600000000003s)]
*  YouTube folks, stick around. [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2485.84s)]
*  We're gonna keep going. [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2486.76s)]
*  Hey, best friend. [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2487.96s)]
*  Oh, look who's here. [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2489.76s)]
*  I have been watching you guys chomping at the bit, [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2491.2400000000002s)]
*  trying to, I've been trolling you in the comments on YouTube. [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2494.52s)]
*  You are. [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2497.56s)]
*  You're trying to send me in. [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2498.4s)]
*  I don't know how to read the comments. [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2499.88s)]
*  Like, send me in, bring me in, bring me in. [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2500.7200000000003s)]
*  Very disappointed you didn't do the voice, Sarah. [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2503.16s)]
*  Which voice is that? [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2506.2400000000002s)]
*  The cletus voice. [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2507.76s)]
*  Why would I do that voice? [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2509.56s)]
*  Jonathan, because you had that, [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2511.4s)]
*  when you couldn't find the audio. [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2513.2400000000002s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2515.88s)]
*  I could see how you would go there. [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2516.72s)]
*  Can you just do the voice and recreate her? [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2518.44s)]
*  No. [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2520.72s)]
*  Jonathan Cohn, it's all happening right now. [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2521.56s)]
*  JD Vance, it still amazes me that that tub of evil and lard [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2524.12s)]
*  is the vice president of the United States. [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2532.6s)]
*  That's a wild thing to contemplate. [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2534.44s)]
*  So he's breaking the tie and we are getting over the hump. [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2537.44s)]
*  And we're gonna be talking about the next episode [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2541.44s)]
*  over the hump. [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2543.92s)]
*  And I guess here's my question to both of you. [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2545.6000000000004s)]
*  Are they, clearly what they all panicked about today was, [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2552.76s)]
*  oh, short, is there anything we can do to make sure [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2557.1200000000003s)]
*  that we only cut Medicaid for the bad people? [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2561.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2564.36s)]
*  And so, is, you know, like, well, [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2565.2000000000003s)]
*  see if we can carve things out for non-contiguous states [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2566.6800000000003s)]
*  or we'll do a special bailout fund for rural hospitals. [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2571.0s)]
*  Huh, huh, right? [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2578.12s)]
*  And I kind of joked in our slack this morning. [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2580.04s)]
*  Why not just say that, you know, [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2582.68s)]
*  if you're a registered Republican [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2585.7200000000003s)]
*  and you can prove that you're a registered Republican [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2588.2s)]
*  in good standing, then your Medicaid doesn't get cut. [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2589.88s)]
*  Like, why don't you just go to, [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2592.4s)]
*  because that's what this is really about. [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2593.2400000000002s)]
*  And this is, I guess, a reconciliation problem, Jonathan. [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2595.52s)]
*  Their hands are a little bit tied in what they can do, [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2599.96s)]
*  but they've been working pretty hard to make sure [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2604.64s)]
*  that they can try to bail out their voters. [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2607.52s)]
*  Are they gonna succeed? [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2612.84s)]
*  Well, so, you know, as you say, [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2615.32s)]
*  the rules of reconciliation say [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2618.28s)]
*  you can't just give a state a favor [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2619.44s)]
*  and you certainly can't just give a favor to voters, [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2621.2400000000002s)]
*  you know, people with certain voters. [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2624.64s)]
*  You have to have some category, right? [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2625.88s)]
*  That's why this was gonna be non-contiguous states. [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2627.28s)]
*  And the parliamentarian said, no, no, [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2632.7200000000003s)]
*  I can see you're just trying to help Alaska here. [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2634.1600000000003s)]
*  Now, I will tell you, this is like breaking news, [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2636.5600000000004s)]
*  like literally five minutes ago as I was logging on, [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2638.8s)]
*  the word came that they had come up with some weird, [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2641.7200000000003s)]
*  and they'd come up with some new version of this [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2645.1600000000003s)]
*  that was somehow gonna help Alaska [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2647.52s)]
*  and I guess a few other states. [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2649.0400000000004s)]
*  And we don't know what it is because, [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2651.7200000000003s)]
*  again, I'm sure you all have been talking about this [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2653.96s)]
*  and this insane process for passing this bill. [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2656.32s)]
*  Stuff is getting put together at the last minute. [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2661.04s)]
*  Literally, they were passing out, [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2663.88s)]
*  they were passing back and forth handwritten notes [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2666.1600000000003s)]
*  on the floor with the parliamentarian going back and forth [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2668.44s)]
*  and there were some people [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2672.04s)]
*  couldn't read each other's handwriting. [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2673.0800000000004s)]
*  I mean, this is how we now pass a bill that, you know, [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2674.7200000000003s)]
*  will have effect in millions of peoples of health insurance, [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2677.1200000000003s)]
*  blow up the deficit, yada, yada, yada. [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2679.4s)]
*  Anyway, apparently, whatever they came up with for Alaska [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2680.88s)]
*  and whatever other states would have gotten grouped in it [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2686.1600000000003s)]
*  so it didn't look like it was for Alaska, [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2688.1600000000003s)]
*  apparently the parliamentarian threw that out too. [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2690.2400000000002s)]
*  So I don't even know where we're going with this. [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2692.92s)]
*  I mean, there was the big wraparound amendment, [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2696.7200000000003s)]
*  which is supposed to be the final thing you put in, [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2699.2000000000003s)]
*  you know, before you have to come up to final passage [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2701.04s)]
*  and I got C-span up in the corner here right now. [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2703.28s)]
*  Apparently passed, so I think we're now on the bill, [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2705.8s)]
*  but I guess maybe Murkowski is gonna vote yes anyway. [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2708.44s)]
*  I don't know, but they did get [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2711.28s)]
*  a rural hospital package in there. [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2713.44s)]
*  And that is one, you know, and that's one way [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2715.92s)]
*  to get some of these votes. [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2717.88s)]
*  But yeah, I mean, I think, you know, [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2719.28s)]
*  they're gonna do whatever they can [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2720.7200000000003s)]
*  and figure out whatever they have to do within the rules [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2724.08s)]
*  to sort of spare some of their voters [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2726.96s)]
*  what they wanna do to the rest of the country, [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2731.4s)]
*  which I guess is kind of part of the course now. [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2733.08s)]
*  But, you know, they're not, to your, [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2735.56s)]
*  this sort of theory that you have of like, [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2738.2000000000003s)]
*  they're only trying to hurt, you know, blue state, [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2740.52s)]
*  but like, not really. [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2743.28s)]
*  Like the Medicaid cuts are going right at Trump voters, [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2744.72s)]
*  like, which is why I played that clip from that woman. [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2749.24s)]
*  Like she's a Trump voter, she relies on SNAP benefits. [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2751.48s)]
*  Like, and I'm gonna, for people who are, you know, [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2754.92s)]
*  just jumped on, I wanna reiterate a point. [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2758.96s)]
*  If Murkowski does this, there are a lot of ways [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2762.4s)]
*  you can be poisoned by Trumpism, a lot of different ways. [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2764.88s)]
*  And one of them is to decide [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2768.24s)]
*  that the rest of the country can go screw itself [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2770.8399999999997s)]
*  while you say, but I took care of my people. [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2774.08s)]
*  Like that is a very Trump thing to do, right? [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2777.68s)]
*  And that's what Murkowski's doing right now. [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2779.8399999999997s)]
*  But I think that this idea [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2782.4799999999996s)]
*  that it won't impact Trump voters, yes, it will. [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2783.9199999999996s)]
*  Like it goes right at the new part of the coalition, [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2786.7599999999998s)]
*  which is why you get so mad about that woman [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2790.08s)]
*  and why I like her so much as an example [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2791.8399999999997s)]
*  of the sort of way of, I'm so afraid of this passing, [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2796.7999999999997s)]
*  but like, and, and, [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2800.96s)]
*  cause it's gonna affect me so negatively, [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2801.88s)]
*  but I like what Trump's doing on trans people. [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2804.32s)]
*  Because I think that is a trade-off [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2807.12s)]
*  that they thought about in the voting booth [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2809.92s)]
*  that they are not gonna like when it goes into effect. [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2811.92s)]
*  Yeah, and so this is the question. [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2815.24s)]
*  I mean, so they can't stop this [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2816.52s)]
*  from hurting all of their people, right? [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2818.7599999999998s)]
*  So Jonathan, there are gonna be like 11 million people, [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2820.7599999999998s)]
*  give or take, who lose their coverage because of this. [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2823.08s)]
*  Of those, they are, we think predominantly [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2827.52s)]
*  Republican type voters, right? [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2830.48s)]
*  Cause I'm relying on your analysis of this. [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2832.04s)]
*  Can you give people the 30 second explanation [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2833.8s)]
*  of why we think that? [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2836.12s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, you know, it's hard to tell for sure, [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2837.48s)]
*  but it looks like there was a poll recently [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2839.4s)]
*  that Medicaid recipients as a whole [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2842.32s)]
*  actually slightly favored Trump [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2845.36s)]
*  in the last election over Harris. [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2847.24s)]
*  If you look at the, if you sort of break it down [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2849.48s)]
*  district by district, [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2851.64s)]
*  it tilts a little bit more towards the blue districts, [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2853.28s)]
*  but that's just the Medicaid part. [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2856.8799999999997s)]
*  If you look at the Affordable Care Act part, [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2858.4399999999996s)]
*  that definitely tilts more towards Trump voters. [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2860.3999999999996s)]
*  And a lot of this has to do with the fact [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2865.16s)]
*  that as we've been discussing here for weeks, [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2867.7599999999998s)]
*  the Republican coalition has changed [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2872.12s)]
*  and you have a lot more of these sort of [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2873.8799999999997s)]
*  working poor, working class voters [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2875.9199999999996s)]
*  who used to vote Democratic, [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2878.2799999999997s)]
*  who are now voting Republican, [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2879.64s)]
*  but these are the people who benefit from [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2880.72s)]
*  expanded Medicaid and from the Affordable Care Act subsidies. [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2882.8799999999997s)]
*  So if you cut those back, they're gonna feel it. [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2886.64s)]
*  Yeah, and so Sarah, they're trying to see [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2888.6800000000003s)]
*  if they can protect just enough of those people [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2891.88s)]
*  to not lose them, right? [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2896.08s)]
*  But here's the other thing, [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2898.6800000000003s)]
*  like Trump has realized that, [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2899.92s)]
*  and this is my theory, [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2902.44s)]
*  I don't think these people will ever blame Trump for this. [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2904.7200000000003s)]
*  I think they'll blame their Republican representatives. [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2907.52s)]
*  I think they are, you know, [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2912.2400000000002s)]
*  certainly they could lose it, [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2913.64s)]
*  but what does Trump care if a bunch of Republicans lose? [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2916.52s)]
*  He doesn't care about passing legislation anyway. [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2918.6s)]
*  He wants to rule by fiat. [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2921.24s)]
*  And so for him, it's like, yeah, whatever. [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2924.0s)]
*  Yeah, I do think this, I think this is very right. [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2927.4399999999996s)]
*  The idea that Trump doesn't care about Congress. [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2930.3999999999996s)]
*  He doesn't listen to Congress all he wants. [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2934.52s)]
*  The only reason he would care [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2936.8799999999997s)]
*  is that Democrats can make his life hard [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2939.9199999999996s)]
*  in a way that Republicans like to make his life easy. [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2943.18s)]
*  But also Trump kind of likes to have Democrats there [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2947.74s)]
*  as a foil. [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2951.2999999999997s)]
*  As a foil, right? [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2952.14s)]
*  Because for Trump, it's all just theater. [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2953.74s)]
*  It's not, like he wants to pass this one bill [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2955.74s)]
*  because he wants to fund his immigration priorities. [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2958.62s)]
*  And then mainly Trump wants to say, [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2961.5s)]
*  like, I passed a bunch of things. [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2963.7s)]
*  Like, look, we passed this. [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2965.14s)]
*  Oh, and it did all these wonderful things. [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2966.8199999999997s)]
*  But like, when they use it and they will, [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2969.74s)]
*  and it will be effective against the Republicans [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2972.14s)]
*  in races in 2026, I can't think of a better, [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2975.06s)]
*  I mean, healthcare is the one place [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2978.9s)]
*  and like protecting these benefits. [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2980.74s)]
*  Like that's what Democrats are there to do. [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2984.18s)]
*  That's like the one thing they still really can say, [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2986.2999999999997s)]
*  like, we do this. [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2989.02s)]
*  The bill is passed. [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2990.2599999999998s)]
*  It just passed. [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2991.8599999999997s)]
*  Do you guys wanna, do you wanna hear the audio? [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2992.94s)]
*  Do you care enough to hear that? [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2996.02s)]
*  Did Murkowski voted for it? [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2997.14s)]
*  She did. [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=2999.18s)]
*  What was the actual vote? [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3000.02s)]
*  Did JD Vance have to tie, break the tie? [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3000.86s)]
*  Yep. [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3002.58s)]
*  50-50. [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3003.7400000000002s)]
*  So who got off the hook and voted against it, Jonathan? [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3004.78s)]
*  Collins, Tillis, and Paul. [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3009.58s)]
*  Paul. [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3011.9s)]
*  Okay. [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3012.7400000000002s)]
*  Well, there you go. [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3013.58s)]
*  That's interesting. [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3014.5s)]
*  Have we ever had, I wonder, somebody will have to do this, [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3017.38s)]
*  just an actual head count of bills passed in a Congress. [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3020.94s)]
*  This is gonna wind up as one [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3026.34s)]
*  of the least productive Congresses, [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3027.9s)]
*  certainly in modern history. [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3031.1800000000003s)]
*  Normally Congress at least passes a whole bunch [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3032.62s)]
*  of meaningless, like, you know, [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3034.82s)]
*  sense of the Congress type bills. [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3036.2200000000003s)]
*  I think they had passed like five or seven pieces [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3039.58s)]
*  of legislation leading up to this. [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3042.34s)]
*  And there's this, and I suspect we'll get almost nothing [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3044.06s)]
*  before the midterm elections, [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3047.46s)]
*  which are still a year and a half out. [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3050.3s)]
*  Um, does this feel at all to you guys, [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3052.2999999999997s)]
*  like an empire sort of fraying at the seams? [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3058.2599999999998s)]
*  Like basic, again, just a, [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3062.06s)]
*  if this were a scene in a history book, right, [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3065.7s)]
*  that you're reading about, like, [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3068.8199999999997s)]
*  whatever the given is about the decline [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3070.3399999999997s)]
*  and fall of the American empire. [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3072.7799999999997s)]
*  And they talked about how, yeah, and they, you know, [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3074.06s)]
*  they're just scribbling notes back and forth [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3076.8199999999997s)]
*  on a piece of paper on a napkin in the chamber, [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3078.7s)]
*  trying to get through this bill that nobody had read [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3082.54s)]
*  that lards on another $3 trillion in debt [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3085.42s)]
*  and for the only thing they could pass. [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3088.94s)]
*  That is our, you know, potted view [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3092.02s)]
*  of how dysfunctional the American democracy had become [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3096.5s)]
*  and why it fell. [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3099.34s)]
*  Like it would fit, wouldn't it, as an anecdote? [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3101.6200000000003s)]
*  No, Sarah, you're giving me your grimace. [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3104.6600000000003s)]
*  Well, you just always have to, you have to be so maximalist. [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3106.82s)]
*  Like they passed this crappy bill [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3109.62s)]
*  in the most like janky way and it's an embarrassment [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3112.7s)]
*  and, but like the end of an empire. [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3117.5s)]
*  I don't know that I think this bill is that thing. [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3122.06s)]
*  I'm not saying that it is. [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3125.22s)]
*  I'm not saying this, I'm just saying, [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3126.58s)]
*  doesn't this feel like a scene from that, right? [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3127.7799999999997s)]
*  Like this is how democracies that can no longer function, [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3131.06s)]
*  this is how they operate in the waning days. [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3135.9s)]
*  I mean, I don't know, they still, [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3140.18s)]
*  look, I think that reconciliation is really bad. [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3144.02s)]
*  It's also how we've passed a lot of things. [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3146.9s)]
*  Like they did Biden's thing, the reconciliation, [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3148.66s)]
*  his build back better. [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3153.02s)]
*  And like, this is a dysfunction of trying to do an end round [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3154.74s)]
*  and run around the filibuster. [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3159.98s)]
*  And so like it is dysfunction to be sure, [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3161.94s)]
*  but they did just get a vote and they did it kind of [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3165.5s)]
*  in the horse trading way that they do it. [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3168.38s)]
*  It's more chaotic. [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3169.86s)]
*  It's with less deliberative debate for the American people. [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3171.1800000000003s)]
*  Like we did with the ACA, like there's all way, [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3174.46s)]
*  this is not me defending it whatsoever. [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3177.46s)]
*  I just, they're still passing laws. [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3179.42s)]
*  Like it's like on the slope down, but it's not the end point. [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3183.9s)]
*  Like I think there's, I don't think we're [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3188.42s)]
*  in the pitch black yet. [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3192.38s)]
*  I don't know, but Jonathan can tell, say what he thinks. [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3193.7400000000002s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I, so I'm, you know, [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3197.42s)]
*  I'm less bothered by the reconciliation part. [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3199.06s)]
*  I'm a lifelong hater of the filibuster [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3201.54s)]
*  and think the Senate should be majority ruled. [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3203.94s)]
*  Well, then just get rid of the filibuster instead of that. [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3205.9s)]
*  Yeah, no, no. [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3208.02s)]
*  Yeah, sorry, go ahead. [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3210.1s)]
*  For sure, for sure, for sure. [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3211.1800000000003s)]
*  And that's what I would do. [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3212.42s)]
*  I mean, this whole reconciliation, you know, [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3213.58s)]
*  let's just get rid of it for once and for all [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3215.26s)]
*  and have it be a majority chamber. [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3216.9s)]
*  The part about that, that it gets to me, I mean, [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3219.58s)]
*  it's just so obvious what's going on here, [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3221.7000000000003s)]
*  which is this thing is unpopular. [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3224.38s)]
*  We're just gonna ram it through as fast as we can. [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3226.22s)]
*  We're not even gonna show it to people, you know, [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3228.1s)]
*  we're voting on bills of enormous consequence [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3229.9399999999996s)]
*  five days after the language. [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3233.8199999999997s)]
*  Or in this case, we got the language. [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3235.1s)]
*  I mean, I popped in my social media feed, [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3238.06s)]
*  I think 45 seconds before the final, [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3240.1s)]
*  before the final vote. [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3244.06s)]
*  And, you know, it's just very clear. [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3246.4199999999996s)]
*  The MO here is we can't let people know what's in this. [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3249.14s)]
*  We can't let people focus on what's in this. [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3251.98s)]
*  So we're just gonna throw it all together, [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3254.22s)]
*  we're gonna negotiate it behind closed doors [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3256.22s)]
*  and then spring it on people [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3257.74s)]
*  and see if we can ram it through, [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3258.9799999999996s)]
*  which is this is the antithesis of deliberate democracy. [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3260.7799999999997s)]
*  So in that sense, I do think it's sort of a clip [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3264.74s)]
*  of a declining democracy. [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3267.3799999999997s)]
*  And also just substantively, [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3269.9399999999996s)]
*  so much of this feels so just needlessly self-destructive. [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3272.24s)]
*  I mean, forget about the sort of, you know, [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3276.06s)]
*  the sort of intelligence, you know, [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3277.8199999999997s)]
*  the sort of serious policy debates, [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3279.7s)]
*  governments should be bigger, should be smaller. [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3281.62s)]
*  I mean, things like, you know, cutting off manufacturing, [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3283.54s)]
*  you know, cutting off subsidies for factories [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3287.02s)]
*  that are being built, [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3289.66s)]
*  that is like our best chance to compete with China, [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3290.82s)]
*  for example, on, you know, the future of energy. [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3293.62s)]
*  And just cutting that out of spite. [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3296.38s)]
*  I mean, that to me, I mean, I think of any single, [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3297.94s)]
*  you know, I get worked up about the healthcare stuff, [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3300.74s)]
*  but I look 20 years down the road, 30 years down the road. [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3302.94s)]
*  And when we're not energy, you know, we're totally, [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3306.22s)]
*  you know, behind and dependent on other countries [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3308.5s)]
*  for all this new technology and energy [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3310.94s)]
*  that we can't do because we just undercut it [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3313.22s)]
*  when we had a chance to catch up. [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3316.66s)]
*  I mean, that to me is a sign of a kind of empire and decline. [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3318.18s)]
*  Yeah, we also, you know, we do have Q2 economic data [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3322.2599999999998s)]
*  coming down the pipe at us pretty soon. [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3326.3399999999997s)]
*  Pretty interesting to see if we get [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3328.98s)]
*  a second straight quarter of contraction, [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3329.98s)]
*  which would put us in an official recession, [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3332.14s)]
*  first like manmade recession, maybe ever. [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3333.9399999999996s)]
*  Sarah, can I ask you to put on your strategist hat? [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3337.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3339.74s)]
*  If I were the Democratic Party and I came to you [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3340.58s)]
*  and I said, Sarah, tell me how to attack this thing [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3346.46s)]
*  and how to make them pay, what would you tell me? [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3350.18s)]
*  Who would you say to target [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3354.46s)]
*  and how would you tell me to attack? [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3357.5s)]
*  Okay, well, this is why this is like the simplest [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3359.86s)]
*  down the middle pitch is they cut benefits for you [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3362.94s)]
*  to give tax cuts to rich people. [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3367.46s)]
*  And this is a thing that voters understand [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3369.82s)]
*  and that Trump doesn't really have a good response. [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3372.82s)]
*  That is exactly what they've done. [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3376.26s)]
*  I like tax cuts. [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3380.7000000000003s)]
*  I don't like tons and tons of taxes, [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3381.78s)]
*  but just as an objective matter, [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3384.38s)]
*  what they have done is to give, [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3386.9s)]
*  these are not tax cuts for low income people or tax cuts. [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3389.14s)]
*  It is tax cuts for wealthy people [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3392.1s)]
*  and they are paying for it [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3396.14s)]
*  on the backs of the poorest people. [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3398.4199999999996s)]
*  And I think you can ride that particular message [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3401.5s)]
*  all day long with Trump voters. [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3404.18s)]
*  And JBL, to your point about, [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3406.66s)]
*  do they not blame Trump [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3408.8599999999997s)]
*  and instead blame their local Republican? [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3410.1s)]
*  Maybe, I mean, the ads are certainly going to say, [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3412.7799999999997s)]
*  ex-Republican congressman and Senator voted for it. [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3417.66s)]
*  So, I mean, the one person, it's interesting, [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3423.1s)]
*  Tillis stepping down, [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3426.66s)]
*  one of the things that whoever replaces him [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3428.9s)]
*  will have going for them [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3430.86s)]
*  is that they didn't vote for this [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3432.42s)]
*  because they weren't in the chamber. [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3433.94s)]
*  Right, so they can say they liked it and they love Trump, [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3435.7799999999997s)]
*  but they don't actually have the vote hanging around them. [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3438.58s)]
*  And can I just say, I'm like obsessed, [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3440.42s)]
*  just like John is obsessed with [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3442.14s)]
*  like the healthcare aspects of this, [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3444.98s)]
*  I'm obsessed with the moderate Republican aspect of this. [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3446.66s)]
*  So basically, Susan Collins is up, Lisa Murkowski is not. [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3450.8599999999997s)]
*  And so whatever deal just went into place [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3456.62s)]
*  was them saying, we're gonna let Collins off the hook [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3460.4199999999996s)]
*  because she won't be able to defend this when she's running. [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3463.3399999999997s)]
*  But Murkowski isn't up again, [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3467.4599999999996s)]
*  she just won in 2024. [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3471.14s)]
*  And so they're making her or not making her [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3474.4599999999996s)]
*  because you know what? [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3478.2599999999998s)]
*  They can't make her, she chooses. [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3479.54s)]
*  She chose this. [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3481.18s)]
*  I mean, they did all the things they could to buy her off. [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3482.34s)]
*  And I will, I'm trying not to like be an insane person [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3485.82s)]
*  on this live cast. [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3490.5s)]
*  I couldn't be angrier at Lisa Murkowski. [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3493.06s)]
*  And I mean like personally angry. [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3495.74s)]
*  Welcome to my world. [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3498.02s)]
*  Give into the hate young Jedi. [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3500.1s)]
*  It's not hate, it is, [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3503.18s)]
*  it is like the deepest of disappointment. [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3506.42s)]
*  Because here's the thing, like if you're Murkowski, [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3509.02s)]
*  you have fashioned yourself all this time [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3512.38s)]
*  as like a sensible person. [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3514.7799999999997s)]
*  And look, and she's good at bringing stuff home [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3517.06s)]
*  for her state and that's okay. [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3519.74s)]
*  Like you should be responsive to your constituents, [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3521.18s)]
*  but not at the expense of the entire country. [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3524.18s)]
*  And the fact that she has not stood up in this moment [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3528.1s)]
*  like these are like life defining moments for people. [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3534.06s)]
*  You know, I bet John McCain never once [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3536.98s)]
*  regretted his thumbs down. [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3539.5s)]
*  And Lisa Murkowski, I think will regret this [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3542.14s)]
*  because she knows it's a bad bill. [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3544.86s)]
*  And she knows what she did was take a payoff for herself. [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3547.8199999999997s)]
*  And it is just, it's a really sickening thing to watch. [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3553.58s)]
*  And this is a woman who was just a few weeks ago [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3558.8199999999997s)]
*  crying about how, you know, [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3560.7799999999997s)]
*  what a scary time it is to be elected [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3562.22s)]
*  because there are all these people out [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3563.9s)]
*  who want to do violence together. [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3565.18s)]
*  You know, which people is it? [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3567.34s)]
*  Is it the trans folks out to do violence [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3568.94s)]
*  against Lisa Murkowski? [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3571.2999999999997s)]
*  I don't think so. [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3572.14s)]
*  It's Republican voters, but that's okay. [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3572.98s)]
*  I have a question though. [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3574.94s)]
*  What do you guys think? [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3575.7799999999997s)]
*  Do you think this is enough to save Susan Collins? [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3576.9s)]
*  And is she gonna get it both ways? [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3581.86s)]
*  Is she gonna get it from a mob? [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3583.7s)]
*  Is she gonna get it from a MAGA primary vote, [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3586.18s)]
*  primary challenge and then a quality Democrat? [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3590.46s)]
*  Or do you think she avoids the primary challenge? [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3594.2999999999997s)]
*  I bet they, that's what they gave. [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3598.42s)]
*  I bet they, I bet, I bet they, well, I don't know. [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3601.7s)]
*  I mean, my guess is just like, there was some meeting. [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3607.22s)]
*  Like I assume there was a meeting with Thune, [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3610.14s)]
*  like that they horse traded with the moderates [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3613.02s)]
*  and then were like you three, like Tillis, [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3616.78s)]
*  Tillis is retiring now so he can vote no on it. [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3618.42s)]
*  Rand actually, I think is principled opposition. [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3623.26s)]
*  And I think for political reasons, they let her go [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3625.2200000000003s)]
*  and then they put all the force onto Murkowski. [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3627.78s)]
*  Is she gonna get to have it both ways? [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3631.02s)]
*  A little bit, a little bit. [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3632.58s)]
*  I think unless Trump calls for a primary against her [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3634.62s)]
*  because she voted no, but my guess is Thune [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3640.3s)]
*  has like greased the way on that. [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3642.9s)]
*  I don't know, John, what do you think? [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3648.62s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I don't know Maine politics well enough [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3649.82s)]
*  to know the sort of, I know a little bit about Maine politics. [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3654.14s)]
*  I mean, I would be, if I were Collins, I would be, [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3658.02s)]
*  I don't know, I feel like she's in danger [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3661.62s)]
*  even with this vote. [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3664.7000000000003s)]
*  I mean, maybe this vote helps her, [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3665.6600000000003s)]
*  but isn't she still in danger of getting [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3666.7000000000003s)]
*  this sort of stink of Trump on her [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3670.14s)]
*  and just this being tied to him in a year [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3672.7799999999997s)]
*  that could be really, really bad for the Republicans. [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3675.42s)]
*  I think one thing I suspect a lot of the Republicans [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3679.62s)]
*  are telling themselves, well, these cuts won't hit [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3683.14s)]
*  for a while, people won't see them, it'll be a slow burn. [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3686.38s)]
*  And I think this is one of the places where I suspect [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3691.14s)]
*  they're rushing the bill through is gonna come back [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3694.9s)]
*  to haunt them because some of this stuff is gonna hit [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3697.74s)]
*  the ACA stuff is gonna hit next year. [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3700.3799999999997s)]
*  People are gonna see higher premiums [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3702.5s)]
*  the way things are going. [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3704.2599999999998s)]
*  And take it from the Democrats from 2014 and 13, [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3705.7s)]
*  how that plays. [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3711.2599999999998s)]
*  And that is gonna, I think that will hurt. [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3713.1s)]
*  Some of this will be there, [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3716.4199999999996s)]
*  it'll be fresh in people's minds. [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3717.2999999999997s)]
*  So I think you're looking at a bad year for the Republicans. [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3718.62s)]
*  So for Collins, I mean, that to me, I mean, [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3721.02s)]
*  and Maine is a kind of whatever purple state, right? [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3723.5s)]
*  I mean, it's a weirdly purple state, but it's a purple state. [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3725.9399999999996s)]
*  So I imagine this helps her a little bit, but I don't know. [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3729.06s)]
*  I also think a lot of this gets shaped and driven in, [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3733.62s)]
*  the world is not Twitter, [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3738.42s)]
*  the world is not the online activists, [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3740.1s)]
*  but online activists do tend to play, I think, [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3742.22s)]
*  an outsized role in shaping the debate. [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3744.46s)]
*  And I think people are gonna call her to account [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3747.3s)]
*  for other things she's done to enable Trump. [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3749.66s)]
*  And I think that hurts her, but who knows? [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3752.14s)]
*  All right, last big question for you, Sarah. [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3755.26s)]
*  You are, as am I, somewhat obsessed with the idea [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3759.86s)]
*  of driving down Trump's numbers [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3763.54s)]
*  because everything becomes harder for him [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3765.98s)]
*  the more unpopular he is. [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3768.1400000000003s)]
*  Will he be able to duck this? [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3770.78s)]
*  Or is there a way to stick this to him? [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3772.82s)]
*  There's of course a way to stick it to him. [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3776.06s)]
*  And it is a matter of- [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3779.1400000000003s)]
*  I don't say it like it's so obvious. [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3780.62s)]
*  Well, you know, I gotta tell you, [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3782.46s)]
*  so I have been watching the ads on cable news right now. [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3784.6600000000003s)]
*  They are all from Republicans, [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3789.78s)]
*  or it is all pro-Trump stuff supporting the bill, [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3792.54s)]
*  talking about the good stuff that's in it. [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3795.98s)]
*  I'm seeing very little opposition spend against this, [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3798.1400000000003s)]
*  except for maybe some industry-specific stuff, [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3803.34s)]
*  but that's all targeted at the elites. [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3806.0600000000004s)]
*  Democrats, this is where you have to stick it to Trump. [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3809.62s)]
*  It doesn't always just organically happen. [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3815.46s)]
*  It's about Trump is going to say the whole time, [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3818.18s)]
*  we did this amazing things, and you know what? [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3821.1s)]
*  Look, I got it done, big win for me. [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3823.22s)]
*  I got it done, big win for me. [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3824.8599999999997s)]
*  And they gotta go through this bill. [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3826.14s)]
*  They gotta go through the bill [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3828.66s)]
*  and take out all the worst stuff and put it in ads [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3830.14s)]
*  and hang it on him all day long. [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3833.5s)]
*  And they've gotta hammer the red places, [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3835.3399999999997s)]
*  the places where they're gonna say, [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3838.5s)]
*  yeah, they gotta go to these voters. [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3840.38s)]
*  This is not a base turnout thing. [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3842.22s)]
*  This is a- And it's not a swing voter thing, [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3843.74s)]
*  because the swing voters are affluent [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3845.2599999999998s)]
*  and are glad for their tax cuts. [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3846.86s)]
*  Yes, so this is, again, [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3848.62s)]
*  and this is what I was really gonna try to drive at with you. [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3850.42s)]
*  Is it the case that if you were advising Democrats, [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3852.98s)]
*  you would say, hey, you should spend $100 million [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3855.14s)]
*  doing ads on Fox and NewsNation and OAN, [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3858.14s)]
*  because those are the people you can sour on Trump. [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3863.5s)]
*  Now, I'm not sure I would give those guys exactly my money. [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3868.7000000000003s)]
*  You could just use YouTube. [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3871.34s)]
*  Just use YouTube, just do digital advertising [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3872.7400000000002s)]
*  and geo-locate for all of the rural areas that are about to, [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3875.38s)]
*  because this is what the Republicans are gonna do. [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3880.54s)]
*  They're gonna be like, look at all the hospital money [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3881.9s)]
*  that we got to try to buy you guys off [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3883.7000000000003s)]
*  from the fact that millions of people in your state [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3885.54s)]
*  are gonna lose Medicaid and access to healthcare. [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3887.38s)]
*  Go right at that stuff. [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3890.1800000000003s)]
*  But those aren't the only things [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3891.58s)]
*  that are gonna be horrible for people in this bill. [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3894.4s)]
*  There's so much in this bill. [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3896.5s)]
*  And Democrats, because they did it through reconciliation. [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3898.5s)]
*  And unlike the ACA, where there was all this time to debate, [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3901.98s)]
*  all the various things, that was what led to death panels [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3905.62s)]
*  and people going back and forth on the specifics. [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3910.18s)]
*  Voters won't know what's in this unless somebody tells them. [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3913.34s)]
*  And they won't know how it's gonna hurt them potentially [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3917.76s)]
*  unless somebody tells them. [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3920.66s)]
*  And so that's the thing. [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3922.22s)]
*  And for Democrats, I think who have been searching [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3923.98s)]
*  and unsure and where's their offense, like, this is it. [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3926.98s)]
*  This is it. [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3930.94s)]
*  Go on offense on this. [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3932.22s)]
*  Between this and the Trump session, again, [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3934.62s)]
*  like the indicators don't look great for Q2. [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3936.98s)]
*  If you just look at like container ship traffic [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3941.34s)]
*  and stuff like that. [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3943.5s)]
*  I do think, I mean, it is possible [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3945.86s)]
*  that growth will be positive, [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3947.54s)]
*  but if so, it'll be very, very small. [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3948.9s)]
*  It's also possible it's gonna be negative. [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3950.58s)]
*  Could be in an actual recession by August. [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3952.42s)]
*  It seems like- [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3957.7400000000002s)]
*  We'll see, he keeps tacoing on the tariffs. [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3958.7000000000003s)]
*  So who knows? [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3960.62s)]
*  Yeah, I guess I- [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3961.46s)]
*  I think that was true when he was sticking to the tariffs, [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3963.78s)]
*  but now that he's not and he's just in- [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3966.1s)]
*  Well, but they've remained still quite high though, right? [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3968.62s)]
*  You know, it's like, oh, they're only 30%, right? [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3970.98s)]
*  And 30% is still a lot more [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3973.1800000000003s)]
*  than what the 4% average it was before. [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3974.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3976.66s)]
*  He is weirdly good at having it both ways with his base. [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3977.98s)]
*  I put in today's newsletter story from Mississippi [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3982.1400000000003s)]
*  about a foreign national from Scandinavia, [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3985.38s)]
*  who has been arrested by ICE [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3991.2200000000003s)]
*  and sent off to a detention center in Louisiana. [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3994.06s)]
*  It's a big MAGA fan, loves Trump. [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=3999.6200000000003s)]
*  You know who he blames for his arrest, Sarah? [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=4003.6200000000003s)]
*  Democrats? [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=4006.58s)]
*  Joe Biden. [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=4007.54s)]
*  Joe Biden, sure. [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=4008.38s)]
*  It's all Joe Biden's fault. [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=4009.22s)]
*  I just thought, I don't know, man, how do you fight that? [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=4013.4199999999996s)]
*  But like what- [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=4016.8199999999997s)]
*  Well, you don't fight it with that guy. [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=4018.3799999999997s)]
*  That guy's game- [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=4020.18s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I was gonna say, I mean, aren't there, [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=4021.02s)]
*  I mean, that guy's not, I mean, that guy's, [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=4022.2999999999997s)]
*  politically that guy's lost, right? [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=4024.98s)]
*  I mean, he sort of, you write him off. [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=4026.2999999999997s)]
*  I mean, you don't write him off as a person, [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=4027.98s)]
*  but politically, you know, not somebody you gain. [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=4029.22s)]
*  But I do feel, I mean, [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=4031.06s)]
*  I feel like there are people still persuaded. [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=4032.18s)]
*  I mean, you don't need that, right? [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=4034.2999999999997s)]
*  I mean, Sarah, you tell me, but I mean, [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=4035.4599999999996s)]
*  I feel like there's enough of an audience out there [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=4036.98s)]
*  that is open to some of these arguments, [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=4038.9s)]
*  and especially on healthcare. [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=4041.78s)]
*  And the other thing, I think, I mean, I am not an ad, [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=4042.86s)]
*  the last person in the world [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=4045.78s)]
*  should be sort of drawing up ads and slogans, [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=4046.62s)]
*  ask anyone who's worked with me on a headline at the Bulwark. [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=4049.2200000000003s)]
*  But it seems to me there are ample opportunities here [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=4051.9s)]
*  to run ads, digital ads, you know, [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=4056.2200000000003s)]
*  if not on the networks, with, you know, [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=4058.7400000000002s)]
*  you don't even have to have a politician in them. [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=4060.62s)]
*  You just put a real person on them. [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=4062.1800000000003s)]
*  This, you know, I've lost, I mean, I remember that, [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=4064.5s)]
*  I mean, you remember that Mitt Romney ad [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=4066.9s)]
*  that was so devastating in 2012, [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=4068.38s)]
*  and a lot of people thought it was unfair. [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=4069.7400000000002s)]
*  But what made it devastating was you heard from the person [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=4070.9s)]
*  who had this story to tell, [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=4073.54s)]
*  and there's gonna be, [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=4074.78s)]
*  there are a million of those stories to tell, [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=4075.62s)]
*  there are gonna be a million stories to tell. [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=4076.78s)]
*  I just feel like that can break through to people sometimes, [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=4079.2200000000003s)]
*  maybe, maybe not, I don't know. [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=4082.9s)]
*  Sarah, if only we knew someone [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=4083.98s)]
*  who could collect stories of people [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=4085.98s)]
*  who have become disillusioned with Trump [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=4088.6s)]
*  and get them out into the world, [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=4090.58s)]
*  can you find someone to do that for us, please? [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=4092.2200000000003s)]
*  Guys, this is why we've launched Home of the Brave. [[01:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=4094.78s)]
*  Home of the Brave is a place [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=4097.58s)]
*  where we are collecting stories [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=4098.74s)]
*  of the negative personal consequences of Trump's policies. [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=4099.86s)]
*  There's gonna be a lot of new negative personal consequences [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=4102.46s)]
*  as a result of this bill. [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=4105.3s)]
*  So go to ofthebrave.org and send my team your story, [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=4106.82s)]
*  and they are gonna help make sure that people hear it [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=4110.66s)]
*  so that people understand that this is hurting real people. [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=4113.46s)]
*  That was not a setup, by the way, that was just- [[01:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=4118.18s)]
*  No, it wasn't, that came about organically. [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=4119.74s)]
*  Yeah, well. My team would have been mad [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=4122.34s)]
*  if I had whiffed on that, because- [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=4123.64s)]
*  I was playing the long game, setting that up. [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=4125.18s)]
*  Yeah, thank you. [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=4128.02s)]
*  I knew where I was going the whole time. [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=4128.860000000001s)]
*  Professional transitions. [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=4130.06s)]
*  Guys, do you have any final thoughts [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=4132.06s)]
*  before we get out of here? [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=4134.3s)]
*  Will we get any more legislation? [[01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=4138.22s)]
*  Or is this Congress just done? [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=4140.54s)]
*  They're all set. [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=4143.900000000001s)]
*  Should we expect any defections? [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=4146.9800000000005s)]
*  I mean, this is, we were literally one week ago, Sarah, [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=4148.46s)]
*  you, Tim, and I, we're doing fantasy politics of like, [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=4151.02s)]
*  why couldn't Lisa Murkowski just become an independent [[01:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=4154.7s)]
*  with Susan Collins? [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=4157.0599999999995s)]
*  Well, it turns out, no. [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=4158.139999999999s)]
*  Well, that is off the table now. [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=4161.26s)]
*  Like, voting for this is, there's no more [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=4163.42s)]
*  West Wing fantasy politics about Lisa Murkowski. [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=4167.58s)]
*  And basically, Tim was talking about this earlier. [[01:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=4171.0199999999995s)]
*  She is what we thought she was, right? [[01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=4172.86s)]
*  Not me. [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=4176.22s)]
*  Not me. Me. [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=4177.42s)]
*  I've been an anti-Murkowskiite for years. [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=4180.139999999999s)]
*  You and I have fought about this going back [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=4184.22s)]
*  like six years in the secret. [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=4185.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=4187.9800000000005s)]
*  Well, there's just, there's no point to her anymore. [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=4190.54s)]
*  And, you know, that this is just the thing. [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=4193.78s)]
*  Like, I know there's a lot of people [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=4195.78s)]
*  who spent a lot of money [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=4197.820000000001s)]
*  so that there could be ranked choice voting in Alaska [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=4199.38s)]
*  because they thought it would help somebody like Murkowski [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=4202.62s)]
*  not lose to Sarah Palin, right? [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=4205.7s)]
*  And it did, I think. [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=4208.22s)]
*  I don't know if Murkowski would have won that primary outright [[01:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=4210.14s)]
*  without ranked choice voting. [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=4212.34s)]
*  I'm not sure. [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=4214.14s)]
*  Here's what I do know. [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=4214.9800000000005s)]
*  I know what's the difference [[01:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=4216.14s)]
*  between having Lisa Murkowski and Sarah Palin at this point. [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=4217.7s)]
*  Like, the thing about having Sarah Palin [[01:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=4221.3s)]
*  is that it would at least be a more honest expression [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=4225.14s)]
*  of who this party is. [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=4228.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=4231.860000000001s)]
*  I don't, and yet, weirdly, [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=4232.9800000000005s)]
*  I'm almost willing to take the other side of this [[01:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=4236.46s)]
*  because having a Sarah Palin type could create more damage. [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=4238.58s)]
*  Like, the votes would be the same, [[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=4243.34s)]
*  but the votes are the least important. [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=4244.38s)]
*  I have to believe that's not true. [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=4245.98s)]
*  The votes are only part of what they can do. [[01:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=4247.38s)]
*  I think having somebody who, [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=4250.66s)]
*  but on the other hand, there's the opportunity cost, [[01:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=4252.98s)]
*  as you say, which like provides respectable cover. [[01:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=4254.62s)]
*  Yes. [[01:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=4257.139999999999s)]
*  Like, the problem here is that there's a bunch of people [[01:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=4257.98s)]
*  being like, well, the bill can't be that bad. [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=4259.58s)]
*  Murkowski voted for it. [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=4260.9s)]
*  She's using her credibility as a moderate [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=4262.299999999999s)]
*  and conferring it on this bill, [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=4265.299999999999s)]
*  which is exactly what Cassidy did with RFK. [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=4267.299999999999s)]
*  And that, and now, [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=4270.9s)]
*  and he should be humiliated about this all day long. [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=4273.74s)]
*  And yet, he won't. [[01:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=4277.74s)]
*  No shame, no shame and no spite. [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=4279.98s)]
*  We were talking about this yesterday. [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=4281.86s)]
*  It's weird that none of these people feel spite. [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=4283.0199999999995s)]
*  Like, Tillis is not just gonna go scorched earth [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=4285.74s)]
*  on his way out the door. [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=4288.42s)]
*  He's not gonna start caucusing with Democrats. [[01:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=4289.62s)]
*  You know, Cassidy's not ashamed, the RFK thing. [[01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=4293.46s)]
*  He like, won't even like publicly criticize RFK. [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=4296.98s)]
*  I don't wanna characterize our conversation. [[01:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=4301.62s)]
*  No wonder these guys keep losing. [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=4305.7s)]
*  They're a bunch of losers. [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=4307.58s)]
*  They're really weak. [[01:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX-E7aUg5yI&t=4309.22s)]
