# Republicans Won’t Even Say Elon’s Name Anymore! (w/ Melanie Stansbury) | Bulwark Podcast
**The Bulwark Podcast:** [May 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI)
*  But the thing that's interesting to me is that because Elon Musk has become such a toxic figure [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=0.0s)]
*  for Republicans, that they won't even say his name or say Doge anymore, even though they have [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=5.68s)]
*  a committee dedicated to him. So it's like they flipped 180, even though he's back there pulling [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=10.96s)]
*  the strings, hanging out with Donald Trump still. All right. I am here with the Democratic [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=15.84s)]
*  Congresswoman from New Mexico in the first congressional district, which includes a bunch [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=27.44s)]
*  of Albuquerque. She's also the ranking member on the Doge subcommittee, which is apparently a thing. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=31.040000000000003s)]
*  It's Melanie Sandsberry. How are you doing? Welcome to the Bullock Podcast. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=36.88s)]
*  Morning. I'm good. Thanks so much for having me on. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=39.760000000000005s)]
*  I'm pumped to do it. I've been seeing clips of you pop up in hearings or on social media, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=42.8s)]
*  little selfie videos, and I was liking the cut of your jib, but I knew nothing about your backstory [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=48.64s)]
*  until I did some Googling before the podcast. But for listeners who are in my boat, why don't you [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=54.64s)]
*  give us a little quick speed dating? Tell us about you. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=59.68s)]
*  Oh, all right. Well, okay. Here's my speed dating spiel. So I'm Melanie Sandsberry. I am proud to [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=62.4s)]
*  represent New Mexico's first congressional district. I'm a native born New Mexican [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=68.72s)]
*  and a science nerd. I spent most of my career working in the sciences. I was a water resources [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=72.8s)]
*  manager and I started my career as a science teacher, working with middle schoolers and [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=77.52s)]
*  high schoolers, which I always say working with middle schoolers prepared me well for [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=82.4s)]
*  working in Congress. The middle schoolers are more well-behaved. I will say that. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=86.64s)]
*  But yeah, I never thought I'd go into politics. And then in 2016, I was working on the Hill as a [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=92.64s)]
*  water staffer in the Senate Energy Committee when Donald Trump won. And I think like many Americans, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=101.04s)]
*  I was really shaken by that election and what happened in the aftermath. And I [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=106.48s)]
*  moved home and literally the next day got recruited to run for the state house. I ran a very unlikely [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=111.28s)]
*  race in a very red district and won one of the biggest upsets in New Mexico that year. And [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=117.12s)]
*  that's how I ended up in politics. And in 2021, Deb Haaland was named the secretary of interior. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=123.12s)]
*  She was my Congresswoman. She's now running for governor. And I ran for her seat and came back to [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=131.12s)]
*  DC and here I am. Boy, being a high school science teacher in New Mexico, you got to be kind of [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=137.52s)]
*  tired of the Breaking Bad jokes at this point. Well, I'm probably older than I look. So Breaking [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=143.12s)]
*  Bad wasn't a thing back then. So in the post, you haven't had any no questions about... 25 years ago. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=149.36s)]
*  Got it. So you do look great. No questions about the blue meth or anything. That's not [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=156.24s)]
*  something that's been coming up for you. You know what? More people ask us about that from [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=161.52s)]
*  out of town. New Mexicans are deeply proud of our culture and our heritage. But it's [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=166.56s)]
*  Breaking Bad is just a TV show. That's a good point. I know I did drive by it. I love New [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=172.0s)]
*  Mexico. There's a good reason to be proud of your heritage. The green chili. The food is great. Taos, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=177.44s)]
*  beautiful. So a lot to love about New Mexico. All right. Well, we can do some... Actually, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=182.4s)]
*  do you have any New Mexico tourist tips for people? Why don't you do a little New Mexico [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=188.24s)]
*  business? Oh, my gosh. Well, I always say if this whole politics thing doesn't work out, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=191.76s)]
*  I'll definitely go be a tour guide. And in fact, after I did science for many years, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=196.96s)]
*  I went back to school and got a degree in sociology and spent much of my graduate [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=202.16s)]
*  years working on issues around land and water rights issues and the history of New Mexico. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=207.44s)]
*  So I love me some New Mexico history. But yeah, a lot of people probably don't know this if you're [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=212.16s)]
*  not from here. But for example, many of our tribal communities are welcoming for people who [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=217.92s)]
*  want to come visit. We have Pueblo communities that have been around for over a thousand years, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=223.44s)]
*  and you can actually go visit them. So I highly recommend that if anyone comes to New Mexico to [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=229.35999999999999s)]
*  go visit Taos Pueblo or Acoma Pueblo, you have to eat the chili. The chili is our staple. We put it [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=234.79999999999998s)]
*  on everything hot, sweet, savory. Here in Albuquerque, where I live, we have a tram that [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=240.96s)]
*  goes up to 10,000 feet and gorgeous hiking trails. Man, there's just so much to do. Whitewater rafting, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=247.52s)]
*  go in the Chama. Just come visit. People go to New Mexico. All right, we got to do less fun stuff, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=254.88s)]
*  though. The Doge subcommittee. So tell us about that. What's happening with that? Yeah, I thought [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=261.28000000000003s)]
*  your introduction was great. Apparently, it's a thing. So we're not sure what kind of thing it is [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=267.68s)]
*  at this point. So as I'm sure everybody knows, Donald Trump came into office mid-January. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=273.84000000000003s)]
*  His best buddy came into the Oval Office with him with this crazy idea. And I think on its face, [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=280.56s)]
*  everybody agrees with the idea that government efficiency and making the government run better [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=287.84000000000003s)]
*  and more modern is a good idea. In fact, I had a moment where I was like, okay, let's give these [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=292.8s)]
*  folks some time to figure this out because they come out of the tech world. There is, shoot, [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=298.72s)]
*  if you've ever worked for the federal government, we've all got lists of things that need to be [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=304.32s)]
*  modernized. All you have to do is go on a 1990s webpage and know that we need to modernize the [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=307.92s)]
*  government. But then they came in and Elon Musk, of course, that image of him with the chainsaw [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=313.28000000000003s)]
*  with the Argentinian president is like, I mean, these guys, the thing that's crazy to me is that [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=320.0s)]
*  if they had just followed the law, they would have been okay, right? Like they could have come up with [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=326.32s)]
*  a plan, spend a few months to talk to civil servants, submitted it to Congress. Some of it would [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=331.04s)]
*  have gotten through and some of it wouldn't. But instead, they just let Elon Musk do whatever he [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=336.24s)]
*  wanted inside the government. And he brought a bunch of his tech friends with him. They started [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=341.36s)]
*  hacking government data systems. They illegally fired all these federal employees. Now there's [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=345.68s)]
*  over 200 court cases and 170 court injunctions against them because they did it totally lawlessly. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=352.16s)]
*  And in conjunction with the Doge effort in the White House, the Republicans in the House set up [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=359.36s)]
*  a Doge subcommittee under the Oversight Committee. And the Oversight Committee has jurisdiction over [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=365.84000000000003s)]
*  the government, so government operations. So it made sense. And I was chosen to be the lead Democrat [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=370.64s)]
*  because you have Democrats and Republicans and the lead Republican is Marjorie Taylor Greene. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=377.76s)]
*  And I think, you know, many of us were highly skeptical of her tenureship in this role. And it [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=383.76s)]
*  has played out to be as strange as you would expect it to be. We just had a hearing two weeks ago that [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=390.15999999999997s)]
*  was totally bizarre and off the rails. And we're expecting they will probably call another hearing [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=395.44s)]
*  next week and who knows what they're going to do. But the thing that's interesting to me is that [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=401.44s)]
*  because Elon Musk has become such a toxic figure for Republicans, that they won't even say his name [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=405.92s)]
*  or say Doge anymore, even though they have a committee dedicated to him. So it's like they [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=412.24s)]
*  flipped 180 even though he's back there pulling the strings, hanging out with Donald Trump still. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=416.96s)]
*  Like the Doge subcommittee has become this like weird defunct political arm for Marjorie Taylor [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=422.08s)]
*  Greene now. Well, when you're being serious about government efficiency, you know, just wanting to [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=427.84s)]
*  make sure you're cutting the red tape and, you know, doing things right, going through things [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=433.44s)]
*  with a fine-tooth comb, that's the kind of project you put Marjorie Taylor Greene in charge of. She's [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=437.84s)]
*  shown a lot of skills at that. I wonder, so they haven't really been codifying a lot of what, [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=442.08s)]
*  as you mentioned, they did it lawlessly through the executive branch, a lot of these cuts. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=450.15999999999997s)]
*  I find it interesting that there is not a ton of the Doge stuff in the reconciliation bill. I don't [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=455.59999999999997s)]
*  mean the reconciliation bill broadly next, but I think it's telling about how unpopular they feel [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=461.59999999999997s)]
*  like it's going to be. But so having been on the inside of the committee, what, do you have any [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=469.28s)]
*  perspective on that? Like how much of the stuff are they even trying to get codified through [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=473.76s)]
*  Congress? And what's your perception on how they've been going about that? Yeah, I mean, [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=479.04s)]
*  you don't even have to take my word for it. Elon Musk said it himself Sunday morning. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=484.88s)]
*  He said himself he was disappointed that the reconciliation bill ran counter to his vision [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=489.76000000000005s)]
*  for Doge because it actually increases the deficit, not decreases it, and actually increases [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=495.92s)]
*  spending on all this crazy stuff. I mean, at the end of the day, the way I've been looking at this, [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=502.16s)]
*  and I think many people agree is like, even if Elon Musk came in with the best of intentions, [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=509.44s)]
*  we'll give him that as a thought experiment. I don't believe that, okay? Right? To come in [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=515.84s)]
*  and cut government waste. What he actually did was pilfer the most valuable data sets of the [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=522.4s)]
*  American people on planet Earth, and he is trying to consolidate an AI empire. And he now has access [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=528.48s)]
*  to all that data. And he gave himself billions of dollars in federal contract. He converted a bunch [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=535.9200000000001s)]
*  of communications contracts to Starlink, and he's trying to land SpaceX contracts and DOD, et cetera. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=541.44s)]
*  And when you look at the reconciliation bill, even though he may be on its face saying like, [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=548.48s)]
*  oh, it doesn't codify Doge, it's still going to give him billions of dollars in new contracts. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=553.6800000000001s)]
*  It's got a half billion dollars in there for AI contracts. It's got this golden dome project that [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=558.08s)]
*  he wants to bid on. And so even though the reconciliation bill may not be the codification [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=564.08s)]
*  of Doge, it still has tons of kickbacks for people like Elon Musk, not to mention that the whole thing [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=569.76s)]
*  is in service of giving tax breaks to billionaires. But the Republicans, I think their plan is to try [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=576.08s)]
*  to codify the Doge cuts starting this week with the regular FY26 budget process. And one of the [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=583.52s)]
*  things I've been trying to help people keep track of, I'm a former OMB employee during the Obama [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=591.1999999999999s)]
*  administration. I was a civil servant there, is that when you look at the budget that Trump and [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=597.04s)]
*  specifically Russell Vought, his OMB director, delivered to Congress about three weeks ago, [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=602.16s)]
*  and they're going to start marking that up this week. That is project 2025. That is the Doge cuts. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=607.36s)]
*  I mean, these guys are talking about eviscerating like half of EPA. And they've zeroed out like USAID [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=613.52s)]
*  in the budget. So they're planning to use the regular budget process to do that. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=621.2s)]
*  That's a good flag. And we'll be monitoring that. Do the quote you referenced. Elon said, [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=625.84s)]
*  I think a bill can be big or it could be beautiful. But I don't know if it could be both. Credit [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=630.4s)]
*  or due, Elon. That's pretty good. That's pretty good turn of phrase. Okay, so the Reconciliation [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=635.84s)]
*  Bill broadly, you mentioned how it is expanding the deficit and the debt. Also, a ton of cuts to [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=641.2s)]
*  services. New Mexico in particular, as a state, is going to get hit by snap cuts, Medicaid cuts. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=647.0400000000001s)]
*  So talk about what you see in the Reconciliation Bill that's headed over to the Senate. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=652.32s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, it's such a huge bill. It's hard to put it in one phrase. So I've been doing the [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=657.0400000000001s)]
*  ABCs of this bill. But to encapsulate the essence of this bill, in service of giving the largest [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=663.92s)]
*  tax breaks in American history to billionaires and corporations, this bill makes the largest cuts in [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=671.36s)]
*  Medicaid, Medicare, food assistance, and educational assistance in American history, and makes the [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=676.8s)]
*  largest deficit spend in American history. But the ABCs are essentially gives a huge tax break to [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=683.36s)]
*  billionaires and large corporations. It expands some of the tax breaks that were in the 2017 [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=689.7600000000001s)]
*  tax bill. It gives billions in kickbacks, as I just mentioned, to all these different industries [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=696.1600000000001s)]
*  and donors of the Republicans. It cuts royalty rates for oil and gas. That's all about kickbacks [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=704.24s)]
*  to the oil and gas industry and making them wealthier. It has these huge defense contracts, [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=709.9200000000001s)]
*  AI contracts. It probably won't surprise you to learn that there's billions of dollars in there [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=715.04s)]
*  for private prisons, for private detention. We're claiming that's for immigration, but [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=720.9599999999999s)]
*  I think it's important to understand that the DHS advisors for Donald Trump used to be lobbyists [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=726.16s)]
*  for the largest private prisons that do detention. So it's got kickbacks for them, [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=731.68s)]
*  cuts, Medicaid, Medicare, food assistance, Pell grants, all these basic social safety net [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=736.3199999999999s)]
*  supports for low income people. Millions of Americans are going to be impacted. D, it [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=744.0s)]
*  decimates the environment. It actually undermines federal worker protections by making them at will [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=749.68s)]
*  so they can be fired anytime. And it eviscerates the federal budget. And so, you know, one of the [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=756.24s)]
*  things that I just find so laughable, the Republicans right now, is that they all paraded around last [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=761.76s)]
*  week. They went to the White House and said, oh, we can't sign onto this bill because it, you know, [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=768.08s)]
*  increases the deficit. And then they came back and spent three straight days because they kept [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=773.44s)]
*  this up for two nights in a row, claiming that it doesn't include any deficit spending or impact the [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=778.4000000000001s)]
*  debt. And this is the largest increase in the deficit ever. They're talking $37 trillion over [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=785.5200000000001s)]
*  the next 30 years. That is going to put the United States on a course to bankruptcy, essentially. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=791.2800000000001s)]
*  I love that you mentioned the private prisons. It's a hobby horse of mine, too, these guys. It's [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=798.6400000000001s)]
*  like a golden age for the private prison industry here. And that stuff does get lost. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=802.08s)]
*  That's a pretty kind of dystopian view of the world. On the deficit thing, I was asking [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=807.5200000000001s)]
*  Pete Buttigieg about this yesterday. You guys are all kind of sending the throw at my leg [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=812.8000000000001s)]
*  as a former Republican with all the deficit talk coming from the Democratic guest. Like, do we feel [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=819.5200000000001s)]
*  like it has gotten so out of hand now that the type of focus, the amount of focus on this among [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=824.32s)]
*  Democrats might change? Because in the past, obviously, in the Clinton years, Democrats were [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=831.6s)]
*  very responsible on debt and deficit, not quite as much during the Biden years and recently. So [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=836.88s)]
*  I'm wondering what you think about that. I mean, that's why I say I think it's laughable [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=842.6400000000001s)]
*  in terms of the Republicans have branded themselves for decades as the party of fiscal [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=849.36s)]
*  responsibility. And I think that the party has clearly become the party of Donald Trump and [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=854.96s)]
*  whatever he says. And so I think, you know, in some ways, I feel for my colleagues across the aisle, [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=860.4s)]
*  because I see the mental and psychological gymnastics that they have to do on a daily basis [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=867.28s)]
*  to try to conform their real political convictions with what they're being asked to do by Donald [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=873.92s)]
*  Trump. And I think that's why we have a lot of people who are conservatives who are defecting [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=879.52s)]
*  from the Republican Party right now, because they're disgusted by what they see. And if you're not [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=884.8s)]
*  in the Washington mindset of like, you know, we've got to appease the great master. How do you square [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=889.92s)]
*  that? How do you be how do you square being a fiscal conservative as a Republican with the party [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=897.52s)]
*  that's about to do the largest emphasis spending in American history? It just it's not logical [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=903.2s)]
*  anymore. But you know, I'm a fiscal conservative. I worked at OMB. I come from a very low income [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=908.6400000000001s)]
*  family, you do not survive if you are not a fiscal conservative and watch your pocketbook. And so, [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=916.4000000000001s)]
*  you know, they say a budget reflects your values. And so if your value is that you're going to spend [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=922.6400000000001s)]
*  $7 trillion of taxpayer dollars to give tax breaks to billionaires so they don't have to pay estate [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=930.4s)]
*  taxes on their $22 million dollar mansions, and you're going to cut Medicaid in the process [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=936.3199999999999s)]
*  and let people die, where are your values? I don't understand that. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=942.0799999999999s)]
*  Totally aligned on that. I want to talk about just a couple other issues for others. You're a former [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=948.64s)]
*  teacher, so an education. I saw you were I see you're posting about, you know, how part of this [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=953.6s)]
*  project 2025 effort is on the on the Republican side on the MAGA Republican side, at least is [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=960.88s)]
*  getting rid of the Department of Education, you know, and a lot tons of cuts to education at every [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=966.24s)]
*  level. I saw a news story this morning that has me a little bit concerned about some of the education [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=971.9200000000001s)]
*  priorities on the far left to the support of San Francisco today. They have a new equity grading [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=977.0400000000001s)]
*  system where homework and tests don't count your grades and all F's become C's and B's become A's. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=982.96s)]
*  That sounded nice to me when I was a little troublemaker in high school. I just I'm worried, [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=989.6s)]
*  I feel like we've really lost our way. There was a time in the early 2000s where, you know, you [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=996.72s)]
*  might have disagreed with the policies, but like W was really focused on it trying to make schools [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=1002.24s)]
*  better. Maybe his policies weren't the right way to do it. If you're a progressive, then Obama, [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=1006.24s)]
*  really with race to the top was really, I felt like both sides are really focused on how to make [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=1010.72s)]
*  education better. And now I think it's really kind of a lost issue. I'm wondering as a teacher, [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=1014.5600000000001s)]
*  what your perspective is on what you're seeing from MAGA and also at a local level? [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=1020.1600000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, the my background is in the sciences. So I follow the science and what the science tells [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=1024.8s)]
*  us is that there are really two keys to student success. One is the quality of student teacher [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=1031.2s)]
*  interaction. And that means that you have highly qualified educators in the classroom and the [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=1039.68s)]
*  ability for those teachers to really invest in their students. And the second is that students [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=1045.68s)]
*  have a stable home environment where they've got food in their bellies. They are getting help if [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=1051.3600000000001s)]
*  they're struggling emotionally or socially or academically. And that, you know, if there are [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=1057.92s)]
*  issues at home or in the community that they have a stable network around them. And so what that [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=1066.0s)]
*  tells us is that we need to be investing in getting more teachers in the classroom. That's [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=1071.76s)]
*  recruitment, retention and education and teachers. And that tells us that we need community school [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=1077.36s)]
*  models where we're investing in the entire wraparound services, especially around students. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=1082.96s)]
*  And none of what's happening in the educational space at the national level is that what the Trump [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=1088.48s)]
*  administration is doing. I had the opportunity about a month ago to actually meet with the [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=1095.2s)]
*  current cabinet secretary who comes out of the world wrestling world is that they're viewing [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=1100.24s)]
*  what they're doing to Department of Ed through this lens of like a corporate restructuring. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=1108.4s)]
*  And that's not how you address educational needs of students. But there's a more insidious side to [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=1113.04s)]
*  what they're doing, which is very project 2025. The guy who is in charge of their civil rights [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=1119.04s)]
*  division is actually very much like the brain trust behind the attacks on Harvard and these [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=1125.44s)]
*  big Ivy League schools. These memos that are going to K through 12 schools telling them they have to [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=1132.0s)]
*  comply with doing away with diversity, equity and inclusion. And it's really I mean, you have to [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=1137.84s)]
*  understand the origin of Department of Education comes out of the civil rights movement. You know, [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=1143.76s)]
*  we didn't have school integration of kids of color being able to go to schools until the 1960s in [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=1149.68s)]
*  places and the federal government had to step in to make that possible. And so part of the core job [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=1158.24s)]
*  of the federal government is to make sure that all kids have access to education. And they are [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=1164.8799999999999s)]
*  actively trying to dismantle that. In fact, if you read some of these memos, they are directly [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=1169.68s)]
*  going after the Civil Rights Act and trying to redefine it. So I think it's important to understand [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=1174.48s)]
*  that like, what they're doing isn't in service of trying to improve education, it's the actual [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=1180.24s)]
*  dismantling of the federal role in making sure that there's equitable access to education. So I [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=1186.16s)]
*  agree with you, there's lots of different worldviews about how to improve education. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=1192.48s)]
*  But this administration doesn't even appear to have that they just appear to be in the in the [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=1198.3200000000002s)]
*  business of dismantling schools and access to education. A couple quick politics questions. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=1204.96s)]
*  The you know, there's this conversation happening around, I guess, the gerontocracy in the Democratic [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=1211.6000000000001s)]
*  Party, that three of your colleagues have passed away already during this Congress, which is [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=1217.3600000000001s)]
*  it's not without precedent. There's I forget what there was a Congress that had a similar level of [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=1222.8799999999999s)]
*  of people dying a couple a couple decades ago. But like, I mean, that's a big problem. I mean, [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=1230.32s)]
*  you know, I mean, obviously, our sympathies go out to their families. But you know, showing up to vote [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=1235.2s)]
*  is kind of a key part of, you know, being in Congress. And you know, we just went through [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=1240.1599999999999s)]
*  this with Biden. And now there's all the discussion about it with the Tapper book that is out. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=1244.96s)]
*  I'm just wondering and the DNC, the David Hogg controversy about whether they should be [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=1249.44s)]
*  primaring older members. I just wonder where you kind of come down on all that? [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=1253.92s)]
*  Yeah. Well, you know, first, obviously, I think all of us are still feeling the tragedy and loss [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=1259.6000000000001s)]
*  of our colleagues, including ranking member Connolly, whose services were just yesterday. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=1266.96s)]
*  And a mentor of mine was ranking member Grijalva who just passed away. But, you know, I think, [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=1272.16s)]
*  first of all, the United States in general is in a big demographic shift. All these baby boomers who [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=1278.4s)]
*  came into government at the height of their careers are aging. That's just the thing that's [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=1286.16s)]
*  happening everywhere. It's happening in governments happening in corporate America. And if you're able [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=1291.44s)]
*  to serve, it doesn't matter, right? Like you should be able to serve. If that is what your heart is [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=1296.88s)]
*  called to and the people elect you to do that. But there is a huge demographic shift happening. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=1302.48s)]
*  And you have all this amazing young talent who's been elected, especially since 2018. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=1308.08s)]
*  And, you know, like, for example, if you look at all the 2018ers, I call them people like AOC, [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=1314.96s)]
*  people like, you know, even the last couple of classes in Congress, Jasmine Crockett, Robert [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=1321.84s)]
*  Garcia. I mean, just incredible talent. And, you know, people, we're not such young fry [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=1327.84s)]
*  ourselves. We're in our 40s. We're like the babies in Congress, but we're in our 40s. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=1333.6s)]
*  Many of them are coming up. And I think you're going to see that shift reflected in the leadership [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=1339.4399999999998s)]
*  in the coming years. And it's exciting. When I look at the current leadership in the House, [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=1344.8s)]
*  you know, Hakeem Jeffries and Catherine Clark, like the energy and the youth. But we're also [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=1349.52s)]
*  fortunate in that we do have the guidance of people like Nancy Pelosi and [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=1356.08s)]
*  Representative Clyburn, who are still there, who are still helping to provide that institutional [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=1361.6s)]
*  knowledge and political guidance. So, yeah, it's a big shift. I know that people are totally freaked [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=1367.12s)]
*  out right now, for a good reason, because, like, we have a scary autocrat in the White House, [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=1372.32s)]
*  and Democrats, it feels like, are in the wilderness. But I really strongly believe that [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=1378.24s)]
*  you're going to see the Democratic Party emerge in the coming months with new strength and vigor. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=1384.4s)]
*  And I think going back to basics and understanding the assignment and getting out there. And, [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=1389.68s)]
*  you know, the one thing I said this last night, we had a town hall and here in Albuquerque, [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=1396.3200000000002s)]
*  myself and Senator Lujan, I get asked every day, what are you the Democrats going to do to [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=1400.16s)]
*  save this country? And listen, there's, you know, 200 plus of us, like working our hearts out every [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=1405.68s)]
*  single day, fighting on the front lines, what we need is the American people to help guide us out [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=1412.64s)]
*  of the wilderness. So it's not just leaders in the Democratic Party, like this is all hands on deck [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=1418.8000000000002s)]
*  emergency, and we need everyone in the fight. I just want to push back on this a little bit, [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=1424.96s)]
*  I hear you. And I, you know, if your heart is calling you to serve, you should serve, [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=1430.48s)]
*  but sometimes maybe it's your ego calling you to serve. And I think we've suffered like some really [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=1434.4s)]
*  serious consequences from RBG's death before the, you know, she was able to be replaced, [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=1438.8s)]
*  losing a Supreme Court seat, the Biden election. And now, you know, that reconciliation bill [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=1445.6s)]
*  probably passes still, even if all the Democrats are there, but maybe not, it becomes a lot more [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=1451.68s)]
*  tenuous. So there have been like real consequences to I mean, they only got it by one vote, a couple [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=1456.8s)]
*  guys didn't, Republicans didn't show up. But, you know, if Massey doesn't vote for it, it's hard to [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=1462.08s)]
*  game it out. But like, there have been serious consequences to the Democrats staying along longer [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=1467.28s)]
*  than they should have, right? Well, first of all, I mean, the Republicans have the majority, [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=1473.92s)]
*  they control the House, there's no chance that Democrats are going to win any votes. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=1480.8s)]
*  Massey was, that's not true, Massey was not going to vote for this bill, Thomas Massey isn't. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=1486.72s)]
*  Yeah, every, but let me push back. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=1491.76s)]
*  Democrats would have had 217, if all the Democrats are there, there would have been 217 votes against it, [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=1494.0s)]
*  against the bill. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=1500.6399999999999s)]
*  Let me, let me correct the record here. Every Democrat was there, two Republicans didn't even [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=1501.76s)]
*  show up to vote. And one of them apparently was drunk and asleep in the back. So this is not about [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=1507.6799999999998s)]
*  age, you know, I mean, I think- [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=1514.6399999999999s)]
*  Well, there were three Democrats that weren't there because they were dead. I'm not trying to be like [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=1516.56s)]
*  rude about it. That's just reality. Like had all of the Democrats been there in, you know, [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=1520.24s)]
*  in Corpus Mentis, that was, would have been 2217 votes against the bill. They had 215 for two, [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=1525.68s)]
*  you know, one was drunk. So maybe they would shake him awake, you get to 216. I don't think [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=1532.56s)]
*  that's true, actually, that it's guaranteed they would have jammed this through. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=1538.4s)]
*  I think that the premise that you're putting out there is false in this sense. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=1543.6s)]
*  Because the Republicans will find a way to whip their votes, right? Like if they had really needed [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=1550.32s)]
*  Massey, if they had, you know, whoever drunk dude in the cloakroom, like they probably would [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=1555.92s)]
*  have dragged him out and put his finger on the thing. I mean, they would have found a way. They [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=1562.88s)]
*  have the majority. I mean, there's a just reality, a real reality to being in the minority. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=1567.84s)]
*  That you like it doesn't matter what time and space it is. There's also no guarantees in life [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=1574.96s)]
*  that even a young person is going to survive. So I don't know. I think that right now we're in a [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=1581.2s)]
*  like self-flagellation era in the Democratic Party because we're in the wilderness without a [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=1586.6399999999999s)]
*  major candidate. We just lost the race and there's lots of reasons for that. And we're in a really [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=1592.08s)]
*  scary time, but there's like just realities and structural constraints about the institution right [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=1598.32s)]
*  now until we win back the House. So we're going to be in a hard place democratically. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=1604.3999999999999s)]
*  All right. Last question. I'm going to give you a chance to self-flagellate or not. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=1610.48s)]
*  So let's just at least be clear-eyed. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=1614.56s)]
*  I'm here for it. Let's do it. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=1616.1599999999999s)]
*  Let's do it. In New Mexico, Kamala Harris only won by six points in New Mexico. Biden won by 11. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=1617.28s)]
*  So New Mexico was closer for the Republicans than Ohio, Iowa, Florida, former swing states were for [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=1625.6s)]
*  the Democrats. Hispanic vote went down significantly. That's like not a great trajectory. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=1632.16s)]
*  It's not like New Mexico is a swing state per se, but that's a bad sign, right? I don't know. [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=1637.68s)]
*  Do you look at that and like what do you attribute that to? Is there something that Democrats could [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=1643.3600000000001s)]
*  be doing differently to kind of reverse that trend in your state? Yeah. So again, go back to the data. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=1647.3600000000001s)]
*  It's true everywhere in the United States where you had Democrats down ballot from Trump, [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=1655.6000000000001s)]
*  the Democrats outperformed Trump. So, you know, I hate to talk about Trump in a positive light, [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=1662.4s)]
*  but let me just say this. I do agree with people who say that he is sort of a unique [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=1669.6000000000001s)]
*  and singular figure politically. I think he is a very unique political figure and he has really [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=1675.76s)]
*  figured out whether it's a combination of big spending by his billionaire friends, [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=1682.08s)]
*  their use of very advanced data, micro targeting and communication, their total dominance of the [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=1687.9199999999998s)]
*  communication sphere and his unique and insane way of communicating, I think with working people [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=1694.3999999999999s)]
*  delivered a clear message, which was he said to the American people, it was a lie, that I'm going [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=1702.08s)]
*  to fight for you to make things cheaper and make your life better. Who couldn't vote for that, [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=1706.96s)]
*  right? But where you look at the actual data, Democrats outperformed him. In fact, even though [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=1711.28s)]
*  outperformed him down ballot. And what I attribute that to is in New Mexico, for example, [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=1719.36s)]
*  we're very practical people. You know, I think even myself, like I did not consider myself like [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=1725.76s)]
*  a very political person until I ran for office. And I hold some views that are probably, for example, [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=1731.84s)]
*  fiscally conservative. I definitely grew up like working the land. I have some, you know, [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=1739.04s)]
*  views that may not be considered more progressive in some ways, but I'm very socially progressive. [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=1745.44s)]
*  And I think that's how New Mexicans are across the board. So if you are a person that saw [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=1750.08s)]
*  Donald Trump making this promise about making life better and easier, and it sounded good to you, [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=1755.2s)]
*  you're like, yeah, okay, cool. I'll vote for that. But then you had this awesome member of Congress [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=1760.72s)]
*  who you know, who you know is fighting for you. You're also going to vote for that person. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=1766.24s)]
*  I think Americans are very practical in that sense. And I think that the part of the self [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=1770.72s)]
*  flagellation that we have not been effective in sort of evaluating and what we lost this last [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=1775.6s)]
*  election is that there hasn't been a lot of focus on our lack of ground game. And, you know, that's [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=1783.44s)]
*  what wins elections. When I ran in 2018 for my state house race, I ran in a district that was [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=1790.08s)]
*  red. It was a Republican district. And the number of statewide knocks and calls per house district [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=1796.8s)]
*  that campaign season was about 10,000 knocks and calls. We did 40,000 knocks and calls in my [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=1802.72s)]
*  district and I won by seven points in a Republican district. And I remember the newspaper asking me [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=1810.6399999999999s)]
*  the next day, oh my God, how did you win? What did you do? What did you say? It wasn't messaging. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=1816.4s)]
*  It was that we knocked and called 40,000 people. And I think that one of the things that people [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=1821.2800000000002s)]
*  don't realize is that, you know, we were behind the ball as Democrats on our field program. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=1827.2800000000002s)]
*  We didn't have really robustly staffed field programs in every state. And we switched candidates [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=1833.2800000000002s)]
*  mid-season. I mean, it was structurally not a good place to start from, regardless of all of [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=1841.6s)]
*  the other factors. And so I think that if we get organized, we mobilize people, we register people [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=1851.9199999999998s)]
*  to vote, we have really good candidates. I think we're going to blow it out of the water this year. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=1858.9599999999998s)]
*  All right. Thank you so much for coming on, Melanie Stansberry. Good to meet you. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=1863.6799999999998s)]

*  Let's try to steer clear of Marjorie Taylor Greene's arm reach, you know, on that subcommittee, [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrExWxxWMGI&t=1868.56s)]
