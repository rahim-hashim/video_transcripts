Video Description: Where is Obama? Where is George W. Bush? A Marine battalion and the National Guard have been deployed in response to a spark Trump set off by sweeping up people who aren't doing anything illegal besides being present here. And the administration may ramp up the tension if it uses the military for domestic law enforcement purposes. At least Gavin is finally angry. Plus, MAGA is built around conspiracists and conspiracy theories, so RFK jr can do what he wants with vaccines because he's only making doctors and public health experts mad—constituents Trump couldn't care less about. Bill Kristol joins Tim Miller.

# You Should Be ANGRY! (w/ Bill Kristol)
**The Bulwark Podcast:** [June 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU)
*  A lot of the most visible people don't seem to be that upset. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=0.0s)]
*  They don't seem to be emotionally enraged in a way that is called for, given what we've seen over the first five and a half months. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=4.88s)]
*  And that is why I was giving Gavin props yesterday. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=12.88s)]
*  Gavin seems actually pissed now. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=16.0s)]
*  And my response to that is good. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=18.48s)]
*  People should be pissed. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=21.44s)]
*  Hello and welcome to the Bulldog Podcast. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=30.24s)]
*  I'm your host, Tim Miller. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=31.68s)]
*  I am here on a Tuesday with editor-at-large Bill Kristol. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=33.2s)]
*  It feels unnatural. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=36.24s)]
*  I know it's good. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=37.44s)]
*  I'm going to spend all day thinking today is Monday and missing appointments and going to the wrong places and stuff. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=38.2s)]
*  And I'll blame you for having to switch the normal Monday to Tuesday. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=42.8s)]
*  You know, when you get older, Tim, you get a little set in your ways. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=46.6s)]
*  It's very, very hard to make these last minute adjustments. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=48.84s)]
*  Audibles, you know. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=52.8s)]
*  You have the same lunch every day. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=53.64s)]
*  Right. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=55.6s)]
*  430 p.m. dinner. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=57.08s)]
*  It's really great. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=58.48s)]
*  Well, it's good to be with you. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=61.839999999999996s)]
*  I'm sorry to disappoint the people who thought they had a break from Bill Kristol this week, but I can't. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=62.839999999999996s)]
*  I need my dose of Bill every week. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=66.44s)]
*  So we just moved it over to Tuesday. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=68.52s)]
*  Yesterday's newsletter was about how... [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=71.03999999999999s)]
*  I always don't know how you judge this. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=76.12s)]
*  You say we should be more alarmed. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=79.08s)]
*  I don't know what your baseline alarm level is, but you think we should be more alarmed about what's happening in L.A. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=80.56s)]
*  You wrote about Trump's usurpation proclamation, which you called it, which basically has three points. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=86.76s)]
*  I'm going to try to summarize those and you can explain why you're even more alarmed than one might think. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=92.24000000000001s)]
*  The first part was that of the proclamation was that protests or active violence directly inhibit the execution of the laws [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=98.24000000000001s)]
*  and they constitute a form of rebellion against the authority of the government. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=105.4s)]
*  The second paragraph talks about Trump calling federal service members and units of the National Guard under 10 U.S.C. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=109.84s)]
*  12406 to temporarily protect ICE. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=115.92s)]
*  You note that that is only authorized when the United States is invaded or in danger of invasion by a foreign nation or where there's a rebellion. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=118.28s)]
*  So that's why the rebellion and invasion terms are so critical here. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=127.12s)]
*  And lastly, if the Secretary of Defense may employ any other members of the regular armed forces, we'll get into that in a minute. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=131.04s)]
*  But talk about why this proclamation you felt was maybe even more ominous than people might realize. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=135.52s)]
*  I guess people were correctly alarmed about the deploying of the National Guard to the streets of L.A. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=143.88s)]
*  and all the incendiary rhetoric that went with that on the heels of what had been an incendiary mass deportation effort focused in L.A., [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=149.28s)]
*  including in Latino communities and going after people showing up for work, basically, to Home Depot parking lot. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=157.04000000000002s)]
*  To be assembled for their construction jobs or whatever. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=165.48000000000002s)]
*  So the whole thing and the rhetoric by Trump, Hagseth, Noem has been beyond irresponsible. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=168.04s)]
*  But the actual proclamation, when I happen to read it, I just want to tell you it's very short. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=174.20000000000002s)]
*  I think it's three paragraphs, is pretty striking. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=178.68s)]
*  It never mentions California. It never mentions Los Angeles. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=181.72s)]
*  It's not limited. And this is not true. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=184.92000000000002s)]
*  I did look back for five minutes to most preceding proclamations that I could find of this type. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=186.68s)]
*  It's not we're deploying the National Guard. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=192.28s)]
*  I authorized the deployment of the California National Guard in and around Los Angeles for no more than 60 days. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=194.52s)]
*  It's no mention of any place. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=200.92000000000002s)]
*  So this is an open ended authorization for the Secretary of Defense, Pete Hagseth, [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=202.60000000000002s)]
*  to use the National Guard and active duty troops at any time, in any place, in an open ended way. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=208.12s)]
*  When protests are happening, he doesn't specify that they have to be super serious or even, I think, violent. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=215.84s)]
*  Or even that they have threat assessments that protests could be happening. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=223.0s)]
*  This is three and a half years now. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=226.11999999999998s)]
*  Trump's giving himself to tell Hagseth, hey, send the National Guard here. Send it there. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=228.67999999999998s)]
*  You know, Kristi Noem got a report that there could be big trouble in Wichita. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=233.95999999999998s)]
*  Let's get a couple of thousand troops out there. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=238.11999999999998s)]
*  That's why I think it's very important. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=239.88s)]
*  I'm worried that we won't be able to do it, but I'm very important to have huge pushback against Trump doing this. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=242.2s)]
*  Once he gets away with this, let's assume the riots subside and the National Guard kind of leave the streets. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=247.48s)]
*  It'll be weak. But once he's done it once, he can do it a second, third and fourth time. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=252.6s)]
*  This is not a one off proclamation. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=256.76s)]
*  Yeah. I think you tie that to kind of just the historical context of doing this over the objection of Newsom. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=259.24s)]
*  Right. And, you know, that was just something that didn't occur to me just because I don't think about stuff in this context. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=267.24s)]
*  It's like a very unusual proclamations like this. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=278.36s)]
*  But when I started looking into it, it's like, well, Selma, Alabama was the last time this happened. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=281.24s)]
*  Right. Where the president sent to the National Guard against the objection of a state governor, [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=287.40000000000003s)]
*  obviously, kind of in an inverse type situation about who is acting in good faith in that scenario. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=292.28000000000003s)]
*  And so to do something that is this kind of extreme and unprecedented historically, [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=303.15999999999997s)]
*  it's only used during these civil rights protests with the segregationist governors in modern times. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=310.35999999999996s)]
*  And to do so, like essentially willy nilly, whatever you think. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=317.56s)]
*  I mean, obviously, we talked about this yesterday. I've been talking about this. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=321.96s)]
*  Like, you shouldn't throw rocks at cops, at cop cars. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=324.84s)]
*  Some of these riots have, you know, there have been some ugly images, of course. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=328.44s)]
*  Those folks should be arrested. But it's pretty minor. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=332.52s)]
*  Like, this is not a mass mobilization protest right now. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=336.03999999999996s)]
*  It's like two blocks in downtown L.A. It's a couple of areas in the suburbs. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=339.08s)]
*  You know, I think just speaks to this point when you combine that, [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=346.2s)]
*  like just how quick the trigger finger was on this, so to speak, you know, [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=352.03999999999996s)]
*  to do so over the objection of the governor. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=358.2s)]
*  Simultaneously with a proclamation that gives them an open-ended ability to do it at any time, [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=361.15999999999997s)]
*  I think tells you a lot about what the plans are. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=366.44s)]
*  At any time and for any alleged possible protests that could be trouble, you know. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=369.24s)]
*  No, I mean, the civil rights thing is it's slightly annoying watching people sometimes [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=374.92s)]
*  they find one or two instances in the past where something sort of comparable, [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=379.64s)]
*  not entirely, but somewhat analogous has happened in this case. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=383.15999999999997s)]
*  Obviously, Eisenhower in 57, he did use the Interaction Act. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=386.28s)]
*  To override Orville Faubus and send troops to Arkansas and then Johnson and Selma in 65, [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=389.96s)]
*  maybe Kennedy in 62. But that was like the South was engaged in massive resistance [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=395.0s)]
*  to ground reward and then to the Civil Rights Acts of 64 and 65. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=401.0s)]
*  And they had murdered civil rights workers and activists and had been murdered. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=405.0s)]
*  Regular people had been murdered, especially if they were Black. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=411.88s)]
*  You couldn't trust the police departments of some of these cities and towns. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=415.88s)]
*  You couldn't trust Governor George Wallace and people like that to enforce the law of the land. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=419.48s)]
*  So that's okay. Is Trump maintaining that's the case today? [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=425.8s)]
*  Because we have a lot of immigrants in the country that there's sort of huge swaths of the country [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=429.72s)]
*  or are in massive resistance to lawful authority. I guess that is what he's saying now that I say it. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=435.08000000000004s)]
*  Yes, right. That's his line, right? That Blue America, welcoming all these immigrants, [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=443.16s)]
*  showing some resistance to mass deportation efforts by ICE. No resistance to normal, [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=448.20000000000005s)]
*  incidentally, in very little resistance to normal enforcement and immigration law. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=454.04s)]
*  It's not like Biden didn't find people and deport them and adjust immigration things. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=458.12s)]
*  But anyway, that is their claim. So I mean, I think you put it, you do have to look at it [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=463.96000000000004s)]
*  as you sort of all together, right? This is their attempt to create a crisis on the level [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=468.36s)]
*  in reverse in a sense of the civil rights movement and its crisis. But then also the mass [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=474.76000000000005s)]
*  deportation. I guess I've become a little more obsessed with that in the last week or two or [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=479.72s)]
*  three. How crazy that is and how much that is an incitement in a way that, let's call it normal [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=483.32s)]
*  enforcement of tough anti-immigration laws that you and I might not like, you know, that enforcement. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=491.16s)]
*  We don't like those. That's just a whole different world from mass deportation. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=496.76s)]
*  And having Steve Miller say, we're not getting enough. Here's another quota for that. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=500.76s)]
*  How is that consistent with anything? [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=506.44s)]
*  Just really quick, because I want to get into the middle of the thing next. I just want to dial [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=509.48s)]
*  in on one more thing on the troops. Because again, just demonstrating, in addition to the [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=512.6s)]
*  National Guard, like these Marines, like since we taped yesterday with Ta-Nehisi, like the military [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=519.0s)]
*  has been deployed, like there was the exchange with Newsom where he sent the San Francisco Chronicle, [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=524.68s)]
*  writes a story and Newsom tweets out the picture of the troops like laying on the ground on each [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=531.08s)]
*  other because they don't actually have any place to sleep or there's no plan, no food or shelter [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=536.28s)]
*  for the troops that they've sent there. But anyway, Trump sends a bleat, all caps, [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=543.48s)]
*  bring in the troops, showing how excited he is about that. You mentioned that in morning shots [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=548.92s)]
*  this morning. Hegg's staff last night puts out a statement saying, due to increased threats to [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=553.4s)]
*  federal law enforcement officers in federal buildings, approximately 700 active duty US [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=558.76s)]
*  Marines from Camp Penalty Center being deployed. Again, there should be a law enforcement situation [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=563.08s)]
*  with the rioting, but it's pretty minor. The idea that they're using this to now say, okay, [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=572.4399999999999s)]
*  we sent in the National Guard, we had 500 troops, now we're increasing the number of Marines we need [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=577.8s)]
*  to send in just shows how they're championing the bit for this fight. Then you have the letter from [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=582.28s)]
*  Gnome to Heggseth that the Chronicle reported on yesterday requesting that the Pentagon give [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=587.8s)]
*  direction to DOD forces to detain, just as they would at any federal facility guarded by the [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=594.12s)]
*  military, lawbreakers under Title 18 until they can be arrested and processed or arrest them [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=599.88s)]
*  themselves. Gnome basically saying to Heggseth, formally requesting that the military do domestic [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=605.4s)]
*  law enforcement, which is separate from, again, what James Langford and some of these quasi-normal [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=615.64s)]
*  Republicans on the Sunday shows this weekend saying, well, the Marines are just going to support. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=622.12s)]
*  It's like, no, it's very explicit that Gnome is requesting that they do [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=626.68s)]
*  domestic law, like police law enforcement activity. Yeah, I mean, there's a legal reason based on this, [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=631.0s)]
*  I guess, OLC Justice Department opinion from 71 or something, why they think it is okay under this [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=636.36s)]
*  law to send National Guard in, again, not necessarily active duty military, to defend federal, [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=642.44s)]
*  what is they, facilities and functions, I think. So that sort of limits it. They didn't want to run [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=647.8800000000001s)]
*  afoul of the Posse Comitatus Act, which says you can't do law enforcement, you can't just go police [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=654.7600000000001s)]
*  force. So like the White House counsel remembered that when they wrote up Trump's Saturday Night [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=658.7600000000001s)]
*  Proclamation memorandum, Heggseth's people remind him to put it in his tweets, but that's not what [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=664.6800000000001s)]
*  they're doing. That's not why they're doing it. Trump's tweet that you quoted was send in the [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=670.28s)]
*  troops. It's not to make sure that some building isn't, there have been no buildings that have been [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=676.4399999999999s)]
*  overrun or close to open anyway, to defend the building or to defend, I don't know, an assemblage [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=683.16s)]
*  of ICE people or something like that. So that's their fake sort of argument. But Trump loves, [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=688.04s)]
*  of course, for both the former to point of view, kind of his childish narcissistic point of view, [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=695.0799999999999s)]
*  but also from an authoritarian point of view, quote, sending in the troops. And suddenly, [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=699.32s)]
*  if you want to defend buildings, the Marines are like, that's not what they're trained to. I mean, [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=703.24s)]
*  they could do it. Of course they could do with, you know, but that's not their role. It's really [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=706.5200000000001s)]
*  insane. He just, that for me, the Marines thing is very big. Not because I don't, I hope and pray [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=710.36s)]
*  that nothing happens with them. I don't think they're, you know, not big in the sense that they're [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=715.48s)]
*  going to go breaking skulls. Big in the sense that it just crosses another red line. And if he just [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=719.0s)]
*  gets away with it and it's just a little more than this, then we really are off to the races, [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=725.48s)]
*  right? Because then, you know, 700 Marines, two seven from 29 palms today and 4,000 from Camp [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=729.5600000000001s)]
*  Leavenworth, you know, a month from now, if there's some more serious trouble or if they invent some [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=737.16s)]
*  serious trouble, or if they cause serious trouble by having mass deportation rates. I mean, I don't [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=741.72s)]
*  want to get conspiratorial and I'm not really in this. I think it was sort of a one, two punch that [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=747.64s)]
*  they like, but I don't know that they planned. But in a certain way, if you had in mind, you're not [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=751.56s)]
*  kind of like to deploy troops here and test that and get beyond those red lines. You know what I'm [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=757.8s)]
*  going to do? I'm going to have mass deportation, ICE raids in heavily Latino areas of in and around [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=762.1199999999999s)]
*  Los Angeles, where we're not even pretending we're arresting criminals. We're just arresting people [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=768.52s)]
*  in a pretty rough way who are seeking a job or seeing nothing of people going to courthouses to [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=773.88s)]
*  register and kids go to school. And who knows how much they thought things through. They clearly [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=779.24s)]
*  thought things through some they were coordinating Homan and Miller and Noam and the Justice [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=783.64s)]
*  Department. So and Pam Bondi and all that. So but the one two punch is very dangerous. What [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=788.6s)]
*  characterizes authoritarianism or democracies collapsing into authoritarianism, usually demonizing [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=794.92s)]
*  of some subset of the population and legitimizing the use of military force at home. I bet those two [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=800.52s)]
*  are on the every list of five or seven or nine, you know, things to watch out for. And here they [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=808.52s)]
*  are both happening in real time. Again, what is the planning? What does that word mean? Right? [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=814.28s)]
*  Like did they really intend that the Home Depot raid in LA was going to be right? Like, no, you [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=821.56s)]
*  know, I don't think that they had plotted this all out and had thought about the 27. What is it? 27 [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=827.16s)]
*  palms or 29 palms? Yeah, 29 palms. I get there. There's a marine unit. Yeah, it was going to be [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=834.52s)]
*  the one they're going to bring out. But this the combination of no, we are going to up the raids [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=843.88s)]
*  on on regular nonviolent non criminal undocumented immigrants. And that we are going to crack down [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=852.84s)]
*  aggressively if there's pushback against it. I mean, that is absolutely there was their stated [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=861.96s)]
*  plan. And, you know, I think it just sprung up first in Los Angeles as far as the pushback is [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=868.9200000000001s)]
*  concerned. And you see this from so I don't know if you have anything on that. But I was going to [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=877.5600000000001s)]
*  go to the Wall Street Journal story with where they talk about this. And Stephen Miller in a meeting [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=881.48s)]
*  a couple weeks ago was saying to DHS and ICE officials that they're not arresting enough [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=886.76s)]
*  people that are not deporting enough people that they need to go to Home Depots, they need to go [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=891.72s)]
*  to 7 11. And they need to, you know, up the number of folks are resting. The whole Wall Street Journal [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=895.4s)]
*  story is pretty alarming. There's one one section that really struck me just about, [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=902.68s)]
*  you know, kind of the military, the militarization of ice, right? It's not like the bringing in of [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=909.24s)]
*  Marines with the way that they're using federal law enforcement officials to go after extremely [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=913.8s)]
*  minor immigration offenses. You had in Coral Springs, Florida, eight agents and tactical gear, [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=920.3599999999999s)]
*  shields and rifles surrounded a home with guns raised to arrest a father with no criminal history. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=925.7199999999999s)]
*  In Irvine, California, ICE agents drove a phalanx of military vehicles into the Orange County [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=931.16s)]
*  suburb to arrest a person not for illegal immigration. They were seeking the resident [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=936.76s)]
*  son who had been allegedly posting flyers alerting neighbors to the presence of ICE agents. And so [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=942.92s)]
*  this is what they want. Like this is the mass deportation element. This is not, oh, we're just [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=951.24s)]
*  gonna go after criminals. We're gonna go after people that got, you know, bad luck, you got a [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=959.16s)]
*  traffic violation and you happen to be undocumented. And now we're looking at your papers and tough [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=963.72s)]
*  break. You're out of here, right? Like whatever you think about all those kinds of policies. No, [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=969.48s)]
*  this is a proactive effort to go and sweep up people who are not doing anything illegally [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=973.08s)]
*  besides being present here. And, you know, in the bulwark, Andres Karaskios, he had a good [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=982.12s)]
*  conversation with him on Sunday. People should go check out. But he was reporting on a talking [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=987.72s)]
*  source whose father had gotten rounded up at a garment factory in L.A., right? So it wasn't [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=994.1999999999999s)]
*  just like the Home Depot, right? They were doing it all over town, you know, going into workplaces [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=999.64s)]
*  and pulling out people, including this woman's father who hadn't done anything, [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=1005.16s)]
*  who had no arrest record, who had been here for 27 years working. Right. And I don't know that [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=1011.64s)]
*  there were huge numbers of complaints about this in the localities or the city or county where this [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=1018.2s)]
*  was happening, right? It wasn't like they were rushing to the rescue of beleaguered, you know, [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=1024.76s)]
*  Los Angelenos. These people were working so well as one can tell and paying taxes. And as you say, [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=1029.16s)]
*  it's one thing if you catch someone for another crime and then use that to deport him, you can [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=1034.92s)]
*  argue about whether the crime is serious or not and what rights he should have to contest the [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=1039.72s)]
*  deportation and so forth. But this is a totally different level. I feel that I tried myself for [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=1044.44s)]
*  not quite being as attentive to how destructive the mass deportation stuff. I guess I knew it would be, [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=1050.2s)]
*  but I couldn't quite believe they would really do it. But that's just my foolishness. You know, [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=1058.2s)]
*  I wouldn't have believed that ICE agents would go around with masks. Incidentally, on the masks, [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=1062.2s)]
*  which you and I are both slightly obsessed with, it seems like the L.A. cops and the National Guard [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=1066.52s)]
*  are confronting actual demonstrators, some of whom, you know, are throwing rocks and being [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=1071.8s)]
*  somewhat violent. So that's actually much tougher, if I could just say, than the typical situation [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=1076.68s)]
*  these ICE agents are in when they go to a parking lot and seize people who are unsuspecting. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=1082.04s)]
*  They're not wearing masks. How come their families, you know, don't need protection, [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=1087.56s)]
*  right? I mean, no one does. This is where the whole intimidation side of ICE and really what's [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=1091.48s)]
*  happened to ICE, unfortunately, as part of DHS, under Nome, directly under Miller, obviously, [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=1096.76s)]
*  and Hohmann, is really bad, actually. I mean, you see the spirit of it in the masking, I think. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=1102.84s)]
*  Yeah, no, and there was like a local news story yesterday I saw come across, which is, [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=1110.68s)]
*  this isn't surprising, JBL's been talking about this happening, which is a criminal went into, [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=1116.68s)]
*  you know, some business pretending to be ICE, right? Masked in tactical gear, zip-tied, [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=1122.6000000000001s)]
*  you know, a person robbed them, assaulted them. And so you're getting, you get this type of [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=1130.3600000000001s)]
*  uncertainty, right, when people don't use normal law enforcement tactics. You know, as far as [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=1138.28s)]
*  the ICE tactics are concerned, and, you know, when you said that you, you know, maybe hadn't [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=1145.4s)]
*  anticipated it'd be like this. You hate to go to the Nazis. I know, we always, you always have to [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=1150.6s)]
*  pre-cab, yeah, but I'm not, this is not, we're not, we're not sending people to concentration [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=1157.6399999999999s)]
*  camps yet, I recognize this. But the parallel, I'm currently reading the Oppermans on the [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=1161.0s)]
*  recommendation of Anne Applebaum, story about a Jewish family in Germany. It's fiction, but, [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=1167.08s)]
*  you know, it was written by a German at the time, in the 1930s, it was published in 1934, you know, [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=1172.28s)]
*  about, and like the main theme of it, I'm only about halfway through, but the main theme of the [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=1178.6s)]
*  first half is that, like, the Jewish families didn't believe it was happening, right? You know, [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=1183.8s)]
*  it's the main story is Jewish become a business owner, and it's like, okay, well, we're going to [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=1191.1599999999999s)]
*  do a few things to protect ourselves, but they're not really coming for it, right? And then all of [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=1195.08s)]
*  a sudden, it happens very fast, right? And I do think that, unfortunately, like, just limiting it [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=1200.36s)]
*  to that element of the experience, if you are in a family right now that has mixed immigration status, [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=1206.52s)]
*  where you have some people that are undocumented, and some people that are legal, [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=1213.8799999999999s)]
*  I think probably the last two weeks has been a moment where they've started to realize, oh, shit, [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=1218.68s)]
*  like, I might have to really reconsider where we live, like, do we have to move? Do we have to change [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=1224.04s)]
*  our behavior? You know, and I think that's a pretty gruesome, like, reality for people to come to [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=1230.52s)]
*  realize if they have been kind of living here, working, raising a family, going to church, [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=1240.04s)]
*  being part of the community, not breaking any laws, and now they realize they're being targeted. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=1247.32s)]
*  And I do think that that realization is starting to happen. And I think the Trump administration [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=1252.28s)]
*  wants it. Well, they want it, obviously. Yeah. As you say, people have kids part way through school, [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=1257.32s)]
*  and it's not so easy to just pick up your old, they've made lives here. And so, but I haven't read [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=1260.6s)]
*  the novel. I've heard of it, and I'm sure it sounds very interesting. But just to make the obvious point, [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=1265.48s)]
*  1934 was very different from 1933. And 1938 was very, very different from 1934. I mean, [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=1270.6s)]
*  these things progress. Now, sometimes they stall out, you might say. Sometimes they get reversed. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=1276.76s)]
*  And Nixon, you know, they get defeated. The authoritarian moves lose because there's a [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=1281.1599999999999s)]
*  resistance from the courts or Congress or the public. But left alone, I guess, the way I would [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=1286.44s)]
*  put it, these authoritarian movements have a tendency to, I don't know what the right to say, [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=1291.88s)]
*  to self radicalize or to gain momentum to keep on going. And we're four and a half months in, [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=1295.64s)]
*  you know, and we're already at the best deportation. Mobile, if you were mobilizing the marines, [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=1301.0s)]
*  four and a half months in for this, for this, he didn't wait for the really, you know, God forbid, [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=1307.24s)]
*  some really big terrorist attack or the or natural disaster or real riots where I don't know, [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=1312.68s)]
*  properties burned, the LA riots in 92 and 55 people have killed as I recall. So I'm not, [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=1319.16s)]
*  God knows, I hope none of that happens. I'm just saying, it wasn't even the, the, the, the, he, [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=1324.28s)]
*  this is enough of a pretext already, not just call out the guard against over the objections [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=1329.56s)]
*  of the governor, not just issue this proclamation, which is so open ended, but to actually now call [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=1334.04s)]
*  up some marines. So where will it be a year from now? As you say, analogous to 33 versus 34, [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=1339.16s)]
*  but I also come back to 34 wasn't 36 and 36 wasn't 38. And so from the country's point of view, [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=1346.1200000000001s)]
*  in addition to those who were being targeted, it's a very, it's a scary moment. Honestly, [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=1353.0800000000002s)]
*  Do you remember the 92 LA riots and kind of like the decision making from the Bush White House? [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=1358.8400000000001s)]
*  I do a little, I think it was a lot of legal talk about the right way to do it. I'd say, [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=1364.28s)]
*  ironically, Bush, if I'm not mistaken, used the insurrection act, because he didn't think that this [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=1368.44s)]
*  non insurrection act was strong enough. I think they were convinced about the legal argument that [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=1373.56s)]
*  Trump is now making. Everyone kind of agrees if you go all the way to the insurrection act, [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=1378.68s)]
*  you can do what you need to do. But again, everyone wanted him to do it. Sorry, Governor Wilson, [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=1382.76s)]
*  I believe at the time of California, but I think Senator Feinstein, I mean, the Democratic senators [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=1387.24s)]
*  wanted it. No, there was no issue with the Democratic mayor of LA. It was the city was [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=1390.76s)]
*  burning. It was necessary to really, the LAPD was overwhelmed. But also remember the LAPD was [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=1395.96s)]
*  kind of at issue, right? Because the whole, you know, the riots were because of the acquittal [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=1402.3600000000001s)]
*  of Los Angeles officers who had beaten up Rodney King. So I mean, it's, you know, [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=1407.56s)]
*  it made a lot of sense to say, we got to get some federal forces in there, whom everyone can sort [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=1413.16s)]
*  of trust to be fair brokers, as it were. And I don't mean to impugn the LAPD is, but still, [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=1417.64s)]
*  that was the sentiment. And so anyway, there's a lot of this discussion, as I recall, vaguely over [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=1423.8s)]
*  30 years ago, it was done in good faith. I bet if you look at Bush's statement, this I haven't [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=1429.56s)]
*  done it be worth doing Bush's statement announcing it or Attorney General Bill Barr's statement. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=1433.72s)]
*  If you look at the statements made as they went through the next few days, and I guess it was [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=1438.2s)]
*  weeks even, the calls for peace and for, you know, the hope that this could be restored or quickly, [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=1442.9199999999998s)]
*  and the expressions of good faith and you know, wish to work together. I mean, [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=1449.96s)]
*  I'm night and day from today. So the people who are finding some sort of fake overlap or coincidence [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=1453.8s)]
*  of the two, I think the real story is the is this is this is different. This really is unprecedented, [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=1460.2s)]
*  actually, nothing like what Bush did in 92 or like what for that matter, Johnson did with Samba in 65. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=1465.88s)]
*  The neighborhood cat Aretha was back in the house yesterday. It's getting a little hot out there in [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=1472.36s)]
*  New Orleans. What a life to be a neighborhood cat, you know, only gets to come by to get fed, [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=1481.8s)]
*  to get love and shelter when needed. I guess it's kind of like being a college kid. But you know, [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=1490.12s)]
*  so when you're taking a cat from the neighborhood, you want to make sure you don't have any issues [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=1497.8s)]
*  with allergies. And that's why I use the new product by our podcast sponsor packaging. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=1500.68s)]
*  Only a cat doesn't have to mean endless itching and sneezing. Yet almost 20% of people suffer from [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=1506.6000000000001s)]
*  cat allergies. And three and four people aren't happy with their current allergy solutions. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=1512.1200000000001s)]
*  Packagin's cat allergen neutralizing spray targets the allergens around your home that trigger your [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=1516.68s)]
*  cat allergies and break them down. So you and your family can live and breathe in peace. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=1522.04s)]
*  Packagin's cat allergen neutralizing spray uses their patent pending whisker block protein, [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=1527.88s)]
*  cute name, to bind to and neutralize allergens in your home. No harsh chemicals, no side effects, [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=1532.2s)]

*  relief and breathe easier around their cats. That's a big deal. Cats groom themselves a lot. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=1544.2800000000002s)]
*  Do you know their saliva is the main source of allergens that trigger your cat allergies? So [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=1550.0400000000002s)]
*  grooming means your clean cat is now covered in allergens to shed around your home. I had [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=1553.56s)]
*  the grandparents come to visit this weekend. So it was fortuitous that Packagin came. Do a little [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=1559.96s)]
*  spray, do a little spritz spritz, and make sure nobody's going to be sneezing or have any issues [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=1567.48s)]
*  when Aretha decides that he, she wants to come into the house. Founded by a team of passionate [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=1573.72s)]
*  scientists from universities like Harvard and Princeton, Packagin has set a new standard in [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=1579.8s)]

*  I just want to play one little clip of something she said. Well, they're not a city of immigrants, [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=1635.56s)]
*  they're a city of criminals, because she has protected them for so many years. And so we're [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=1640.2s)]
*  coming in and doing what the president has said that he's going to do. JVL talks a lot about this, [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=1644.52s)]
*  the kind of like imbalance between what Republicans are allowed to say and do and how Democrats are [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=1650.92s)]
*  allowed to act. Any idea that Democrats would talk about some red state as a city of whatever [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=1657.8s)]
*  derogatory word you can come up with and get away with it? It's hard to imagine. I think that they do [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=1665.24s)]
*  see this as a political winner. They can just impugn LA, impugn all these cities and say they're [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=1673.08s)]
*  full of criminals and whatever fentanyl and migrants and awful foreigners that hate America [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=1679.48s)]
*  and not suffer consequences from it. TBD, I guess, but it's worth observing. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=1686.2s)]
*  No, it is. It's really true. You sort of from a normal political point of view, [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=1692.8400000000001s)]
*  I don't know. I mean, people visit LA, people have relatives in California. Maybe they don't [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=1697.24s)]
*  want the whole city or state to be impugned in that way. You know, even if you're not going to [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=1701.4s)]
*  carry California, maybe you- Toasting the Olympics and the World Cup in the next four years. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=1706.28s)]
*  Is Trump going to go to the- Trump likes that, right? He's going to go and revel in that. So [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=1711.16s)]
*  how can he go to such a state? I mean, you know, and then there are people in Arizona who [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=1714.52s)]
*  come from California and visit California and said that's a swing state. So from a normal [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=1718.68s)]
*  political calculus point of view, the part of politics you and I were somewhat involved in, [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=1723.16s)]
*  oh, that's- you don't do that. You say, I know most of the good citizens of California are horrified [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=1727.56s)]
*  by all this violence and we certainly wish we didn't have to do this. But no, I mean, [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=1731.72s)]
*  I will say I do one problem with coming out. I love your show, of course, coming out every week. [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=1736.36s)]
*  But the fact that you do occasionally play clips of people like Kristi Noem, it kind of ruins my [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=1739.8799999999999s)]
*  day. I'm sorry. I don't play- Even though it's only audio. I give you credit for the fact that [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=1745.48s)]
*  it's only mostly audio. Yeah. You don't want to see our new face. That's scary. I'm sorry. I only- [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=1749.4s)]
*  I don't play Trump's voice. The other voices we do have to hear on the podcast. The- just a couple [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=1754.76s)]
*  other like random political notes, odds and ends in my head around this. I do- this is probably, [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=1760.44s)]
*  you know, too focused on my yimby obsession, but I don't know. Is running- like there was a video I [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=1767.0s)]
*  saw of construction workers like running from ice outside a construction site in LA. Like in all [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=1773.96s)]
*  these places where they're desperate to build, where they have this huge housing short- housing [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=1781.32s)]
*  short- it costs so much money for people to rent there. In LA, they've set the fire since they need [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=1785.56s)]
*  to rebuild. Like is that- I don't know. Like it does seem like maybe there is some opportunity there [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=1790.92s)]
*  that these guys have totally like lost their eye on the ball of costs, what they were allegedly [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=1798.04s)]
*  coming in to run on. And you see Newsom, I think pushing back much more aggressively than really [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=1804.2s)]
*  you've seen from any other governor besides Pritzker and that you've seen from him even [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=1809.96s)]
*  over the last two days, full-throated doing the media rounds, going right at them. I don't know. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=1815.72s)]
*  Anything on the political side of either of those? [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=1823.32s)]
*  No, I mean, people should push back very hard and make the points about housing and other things, [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=1826.2s)]
*  but a normal administration, even if it was committed to really, you know, a certain amount [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=1829.8s)]
*  of deportation and strict immigration policies, would say, you know what, Calif- LA, we shouldn't [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=1834.6s)]
*  have gotten in the position where we need these undocumented immigrants to build all of our houses, [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=1840.2s)]
*  to help build all of our houses. We are in that position. So we're going to pause the crackdown [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=1843.96s)]
*  here. We'll go to other places where we're, you know, which don't need the labor right now. [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=1848.6799999999998s)]
*  They don't even think- that's not even a thought. So I don't take- so I think they don't care about [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=1853.8s)]
*  any of the other stuff. Why they think they can survive politically by not caring about the other [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=1857.56s)]
*  stuff? I guess the answer is they sort of have so far and they have great faith in [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=1861.9599999999998s)]
*  Trump's demagogic appeal. They have great faith, maybe excessive faith, in how, you know, potent [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=1866.52s)]
*  this issue is and just swamps everything else. I guess they think. I'm a little doubtful, but [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=1871.8s)]
*  again, he's the guy who won the presidency twice. So what do we know? [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=1877.32s)]
*  And you can't argue they don't have a coherent vision. [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=1880.52s)]
*  Correct. Absolutely. [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=1882.28s)]
*  On the one hand, they've got tariffs that, you know, you want to ensure that we are, [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=1883.16s)]
*  you know, having factories here. We're screwing in the screws on iPhones. Like Howard Lutnick said, [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=1888.12s)]
*  we're going to run out the people that work in these factories. And so, you know, they have a [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=1893.08s)]
*  vision of America where there are American citizens working in the garment factories, [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=1899.72s)]
*  screwing in the screws on the iPhone and intimidating anybody from that who is not [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=1903.96s)]
*  from this country away from coming here to work those jobs. So that's a view. I don't, [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=1909.4s)]
*  it doesn't really make sense appeal to me, but they're pushing. [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=1915.72s)]
*  With a slight caveat that on tariffs, he backs off some when the markets don't like it. So there, [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=1919.0s)]
*  he understands it's a more normal, if you will. I mean, he has a stupid economic view, [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=1924.28s)]
*  but he backs off as he wants, you know, a reasonably good stock market and he doesn't want it. [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=1929.0s)]
*  A recession or whatever, and his people, the people on Wall Street couldn't have some influence [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=1934.2s)]
*  on him. Not much or any real backing off on immigration. I do think that's very striking. [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=1939.4s)]
*  And also with tariffs, it sort of does ask, kind of has to affect the whole country. You can't really, [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=1944.3600000000001s)]
*  whereas the thing about immigration and this, I really, I'm curious what you think of this. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=1949.0s)]
*  How much of this is about going after California or immigration in California? We haven't really [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=1952.52s)]
*  seen this nearly as much. There are awful lot of immigrant, I mean, 350,000 Venezuelans were just [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=1958.76s)]
*  made undocumented by Trump's idiotic retraction of their temporary protected status. But what was [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=1963.64s)]
*  that, about two weeks ago? He's not doing, I don't see a huge number of raids there in that red state [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=1971.0s)]
*  or in Texas. So how much is this? And this is a JVL theme, and I've been a little dubious about [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=1976.44s)]
*  this because it gives them a little more, I don't know, cleverness and mean-spiritedness, [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=1980.92s)]
*  I suppose, willingness to divide the country than maybe even I thought they had. But how much is [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=1986.2800000000002s)]
*  this a blue state immigrant and anti-immigration, anti-blue state strategy as well? [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=1990.76s)]
*  I think it is definitely part of it that they want to demonize blue states and cities, and they want [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=1997.16s)]
*  to pick the fight with blue cities and red states and blue states more broadly. You've seen a lot of [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=2002.52s)]
*  raids in Massachusetts, in Chicago, in LA. I will start to take these guys seriously when you see [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=2008.84s)]
*  raids at Trump's golf courses, because you know that there are some undocumented immigrants there. [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=2015.8s)]
*  You've seen some in red states, and so I was really, I was looking at this this morning, [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=2022.04s)]
*  and I don't have a unified take on it yet, but you are, at some level, I think the only weakness in [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=2029.1599999999999s)]
*  that theory is that maybe the Trump administration wants that, but the red state governors and red [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=2038.52s)]
*  state prosecutors, they all got to butch themselves up too. They all have political aspirations. [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=2047.32s)]
*  And they're going after blue, typically just where immigrants end up. They're often going after blue [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=2054.2s)]
*  areas in red states. So it has its own internal dynamic which might override the red state [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=2059.24s)]
*  state distinction. But not a lot of farm raids. You'll know that they really are serious about it, [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=2066.52s)]
*  and that it's not just a political fight when northwest Iowa and the pig factories, [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=2073.0s)]
*  all of those places start getting raided. I haven't seen that quite yet. I want to move on [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=2077.7200000000003s)]
*  to something else. The RFK news. RFK on Monday dismissed an expert panel of vaccine advisors [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=2083.32s)]
*  that had guided the federal government's vaccine recommendations. The entirety of the 17-member [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=2092.84s)]
*  advisory committee on immunization practices, which advises the CDC on the vaccine schedule [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=2099.56s)]
*  and the required coverage of immunizations, will be retired and replaced with new members. [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=2104.84s)]
*  My senator, the illustrious Bill Cassidy, you remember he was vacillating back and forth on [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=2112.28s)]
*  what to do about Kennedy? In announcing his decision to vote yes to confirm Kennedy, [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=2118.52s)]
*  he said that the nominee had committed to him that he would maintain the advisory committee [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=2123.96s)]
*  on immunization practices without changes. So another Republican senator getting cucked [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=2129.16s)]
*  by the administration. What do you think about all that? [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=2136.84s)]
*  Andrew has a good piece on that. And this morning's warning shots and Jonathan Cohen's [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=2140.52s)]
*  obviously been writing a lot about Kennedy's stewardship of the HHS, if that's the word. [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=2143.96s)]
*  I assume they would confirm some of these other terrible nominees because they were [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=2151.32s)]
*  Fox News people or they were personally close to Trump or Republican governors like [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=2155.48s)]
*  Noem or Republican AGs like Bondi. So Kennedy, I think it was the one guy that Mitch McConnell [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=2159.8s)]
*  and Cassidy and people like that would stop. They care about these issues. Kennedy has no [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=2165.64s)]
*  credentials on the right, no history on the right. I was wrong about that. Then I thought, [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=2171.16s)]
*  okay, well, I guess Cassidy got these promises about him. Maybe Kennedy will just be a figure [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=2175.0s)]
*  head and go around giving idiotic speeches and he'll mostly let serious people kind of run the [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=2178.3599999999997s)]
*  place with a little bit of interference. I was wrong about that too. He believes it all and he's [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=2183.72s)]
*  doing it all. And I guess Trump and the White House think it's fine for him to do this. That's [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=2189.08s)]
*  another, well, that is, don't you think that's politically a little mysterious? Is there really [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=2193.64s)]
*  a majority in this country for not having as good vaccine policies and production as possible? [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=2197.4s)]
*  It also gets to the funding. It gets to the funding issues obviously with NIH as well. [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=2205.32s)]
*  I find this part, honestly, I understand, I think, the power of the nativism. I detest it, [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=2208.92s)]
*  but I understand it. I understand the authoritarianism, I think. This part, [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=2216.2000000000003s)]
*  honestly, I can't even quite understand. I mean, well, what is their interest and why are people [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=2220.2000000000003s)]
*  all worked up at destroying our medical and scientific establishments? [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=2224.68s)]
*  Well, I've worked through it on the vaccines. Cuts for the research is a little more, [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=2231.3999999999996s)]
*  well, I guess it's not mysterious. It's just part of their attack on elites and elite institutions. [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=2236.6s)]
*  The vaccine thing is a little different. I think that like you, Trump and the people around Trump [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=2242.2799999999997s)]
*  don't really understand Maha. I mean, Trump is not a Maha person. He doesn't care about what's in his [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=2247.16s)]
*  french fries guy. No, he's a McDonald's french fries guy. None of the people in the circle are [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=2253.88s)]
*  Maha people. RFK kind of brings this mysterious to them group in of voters. They feel like they have [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=2261.8s)]
*  to be responsive to it. They also don't care that much about all this. Go ahead and let RFK cook [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=2272.44s)]
*  over here in his little silo. As long as he's not messing with the other silos. Trump said that [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=2281.0s)]
*  several times. They've all vaccinated their children. They've all vaccinated their grandchildren. [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=2285.08s)]
*  So they don't think that that's any meaningful threat to them. There is not an organized [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=2292.2s)]
*  opposition to it that they care about, like doctors, experts. These are not important [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=2297.16s)]
*  constituencies in the Trump White House. You have seen a little bit of pushback [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=2302.76s)]
*  in on some of RFK's efforts in the pesticide space. Because going back to the farmers, some of the red [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=2309.08s)]
*  state red parts of America are upset about that. And there was a they're having, I think some kind [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=2315.56s)]
*  of summit in the next later this month on this on this topic where they're bringing in, you know, [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=2321.56s)]
*  farmers and ag groups. And so I think that kind of like as weird as it seems like the vaccine thing [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=2326.9199999999996s)]
*  is sort of the RFK pet issue that's part of Maha that there isn't a constituency that these guys [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=2335.0s)]
*  care about. They don't really understand it. And, you know, maybe things change if there's a bunch [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=2340.52s)]
*  of dead kids, but a handful of dead kids from measles, I don't think is going to do anything to [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=2346.6800000000003s)]
*  shake the conscious of the people inside the White House. So there you go. I like that. That's [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=2353.88s)]
*  I think that's correct, actually. And one could work out a little, you know, big ag is a is a [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=2358.04s)]
*  interest group that Trump wants basically on his side. And maybe he thinks there is no such group [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=2365.48s)]
*  with hospitals and the doctors are a little different. They're not well as well organized, [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=2371.24s)]
*  maybe I don't know. And he thinks that some of them are against him anyway. But yeah, I don't [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=2375.88s)]
*  it is. I don't know. It is still striking. You know, one point that our friend Tom Johnson made [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=2381.24s)]
*  to me that I was making a similar conversation with him a few days ago, sort of saying a little [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=2387.0s)]
*  bewilderment about why Trump puts in a way he's interested in this. And he made a point that's [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=2390.84s)]
*  slightly extension of what you were saying, which I'll test out on you, which is we can't [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=2396.2s)]
*  under people like us don't under fully understand the importance of these different overlapping [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=2400.68s)]
*  but separate conspiracy groups, conspiracist, you know, things, one of which is Maha, and obviously [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=2407.24s)]
*  the whole food stuff and another which you and on. Why do they put up with Q and R Q and R is [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=2414.12s)]
*  nuts. No one believes it in Trump's White House. He probably look at it and kind of horrified if [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=2418.12s)]
*  they are able to be horrified by anything. But you know what? It's kind of an important subgroup. [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=2422.92s)]
*  Trump has always understood that you need to assemble all these subgroups. And the one thing [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=2428.04s)]
*  that they kind of have in common, a couple things they haven't covered the loathing of quote elites, [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=2432.2799999999997s)]
*  even though a lot of them obviously are elite. And secondly, the love of conspiracies, you know, [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=2436.7599999999998s)]
*  people have studied social media, the best way to recruit people for the 2020 election conspiracy, [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=2441.8s)]
*  the big lie was to find people who believed in other conspiracies. It wasn't actually defined [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=2446.44s)]
*  necessarily ideological conservatives. And that's the Kennedy thing really brings that home, right? [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=2450.6000000000004s)]
*  There were a lot of the one on the left conspiracists like conspiracies, the degree to [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=2455.1600000000003s)]
*  which the whole Trump movement all of Maga is an assemblage of conspiracists and of conspiracy [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=2459.0800000000004s)]
*  theories, which fit, they don't always fit together perfectly, they can cut against each other a little [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=2464.6800000000003s)]
*  bit even. But he Trump's sort of in some weird instinctive way understands that it doesn't want [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=2469.48s)]
*  to alienate any of them. So you got the birthers and you've got the election deniers and you got [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=2474.68s)]
*  the ma, you know, when you think about it, when these things are kind of orthogonal to each other, [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=2479.16s)]
*  they're not really the same quick Q and on. But but yeah, he's been very tolerant of conspiracies [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=2482.84s)]
*  and that more than tolerance sees that together, maybe you get to 51% of the population by just [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=2488.76s)]
*  assembling a bunch of conspiracies and yeah, I don't know that makes [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=2494.52s)]
*  I that that that is I think very insightful by Tom Jocelyn and I and I would just add to it, [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=2498.68s)]
*  that it also benefits them and sort of this and in the anti establishment appeal, [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=2504.2s)]
*  but like what is the appeal of you know, we talked about the manosphere guys, I'm obsessed focusing [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=2511.24s)]
*  on the guys who are not ideological, right? The guy that Pete went on his podcast, Andrew Schultz, [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=2516.7599999999998s)]
*  the guy from down here in Louisiana, Deo Vaughn, I've been listening to their podcasts, and these [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=2523.56s)]
*  are not they just aren't like they they don't have deep ideological bearings. It's hard to grab on to [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=2527.32s)]
*  what it is exactly they care about what they think is that there is an elite there is a group of [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=2534.04s)]
*  whatever elite institutions that are that are failing people that are out to get people what [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=2539.64s)]
*  and some of them for some of them, it's farm off some of them, it's the military for some of them, [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=2544.04s)]
*  it's whatever you know, the the federal police. And so if you are on the side of saying, okay, [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=2548.04s)]
*  we're going to dismantle all this and we're going to uncover the truth, then that helps you gain [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=2555.32s)]
*  that group that's even a step out from the conspiracy group, right? Like they might not [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=2563.4s)]
*  have a specific conspiracy that they care about. They just they think that the system is is rigged [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=2567.16s)]
*  and that that they want to be on the side of whoever's gonna go after. [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=2573.08s)]
*  Yeah, to put that's very well said, or maybe to put it in a slightly different similar ways. [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=2576.36s)]
*  Conspiracism is an important part of Trump's appeal and message. And it tells you Gabbard, [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=2581.32s)]
*  in a way the conspiracy she believes that have nothing in common in a way with the ones [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=2587.8s)]
*  Kennedy believes in which have nothing in common with the ones Trump himself has promulgated [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=2591.08s)]
*  necessarily. And they've been on opposite sides of issues, therefore, therefore for the last 10 [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=2595.2400000000002s)]
*  years, obviously. But it's very for Trump, a culture of conspiracism, the more the strength [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=2600.04s)]
*  stronger that is in the country, the better it is for him. And he does have an instinct that it's [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=2606.12s)]
*  okay if it starts off on the left, the way Kennedy's and Gabbard's have he can loop them all in. [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=2609.96s)]
*  And so and they're, I guess, maybe there are enough conspiracists and potential conspiracists [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=2615.0s)]
*  floating around that you get a lot of votes that way and a lot of support that way and a lot of [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=2621.0s)]
*  energy, I think, that way too. Well, the necessary, [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=2625.16s)]
*  what would it be recommendation resolution to this observation, if it's true, is that the Democrats [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=2633.24s)]
*  need a conspiracist of their own. So we're not going to go there today. But let's, we'll just [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=2637.96s)]
*  let that simmer in everybody's brain. Is the state of the US making you want to escape for a little [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=2641.96s)]

*  As mentioned at the Free Andree Big Gay Life Show, Sarah Longwell wanted to shorten Pride Month, [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=2675.88s)]
*  take it down a little bit. The lesbians don't like revelry and celebration. Not me. We're extending it. [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=2682.04s)]
*  Our vacation this year, as mentioned earlier, we're going to Spain and we're going to catch [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=2690.28s)]

*  year. Once they start coming for those target shirts, the gays push back. And so, you know, [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=2701.32s)]
*  if you're going to be at World Pride, I want to make sure that I can do a little Spanish drink [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=2707.8s)]
*  ordering or flirting or chatting or whatever. And so we're turning to Babel to help with that. [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=2713.0800000000004s)]

*  Any thoughts on the military parade and the no kings protests coming on Sunday? Obviously, [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=2770.84s)]
*  we'll be talking about that a lot as the week goes on and end early next week. But [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=2775.48s)]
*  you'll be able to react to it on Monday when you'll be back on your normal schedule. Did you have any [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=2779.7200000000003s)]
*  thoughts? I'm staying out of DC on Saturday. And I say that joke that the traffic will be horrible [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=2783.4s)]
*  and stuff. But also, I mean, wonder what the mood will be. I would say I've been in touch with some [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=2788.44s)]
*  of the and watched just a bit of a distance the efforts of the protesters. No kings, I think, [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=2792.44s)]
*  is kind of the umbrella. They've been, they're really trying to be responsible. I give them [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=2798.76s)]
*  credit. You know, they're, they're, they, everyone's supposed to buy American flag. They're giving them [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=2803.88s)]
*  everyone American flags, as opposed to really stressing if you look at their website, no [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=2807.8s)]
*  violence, no provocation. And so the military is not their fault. They're being wrapped, wrapped [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=2812.2000000000003s)]
*  into this. And if you're demonstrating in another city, try not to cause trouble for the local [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=2817.88s)]
*  authorities who are just managing the, you know, the demonstration. They put the main demonstration [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=2821.96s)]
*  in Philadelphia against this because they didn't want to have it in DC, because they didn't want [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=2826.84s)]
*  to have a showdown and kind of excuse for Trump to do anything. And so I think, you know, for all that [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=2831.5600000000004s)]
*  the left has obviously elements that are responsible, it's a huge country. How could it not? [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=2836.68s)]
*  I gotta say, as in that previous demonstration, what was that about two months ago now, [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=2841.3999999999996s)]
*  which went very peacefully. I'm hopeful that's the case. And I'm hopeful that they're big those [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=2845.96s)]
*  demonstrations. And no kings is not a bad, you know, term to capture what's going on. I do think [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=2850.7599999999998s)]
*  it's much more don't you think it's more somehow potent or it seems more real. The notion that the [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=2857.64s)]
*  military is distasteful. We already had that. But now with the deployment of the military, [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=2863.88s)]
*  you know, across the country there in LA, in real time, it does seem more urgent to make clear that [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=2869.4s)]
*  this is part of a vision of America militarized and personalized under Trump's commands that we [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=2875.56s)]
*  should reject. I completely agree with everything you said. And I had the founders of that group, [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=2881.7200000000003s)]
*  Indivisible, that umbrella group on a couple of weeks ago, Azran, Leah, and I totally agree. [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=2887.7200000000003s)]
*  Indivisible has done some stuff that is a little lefty for my taste, like getting involved in [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=2892.76s)]
*  primaries. And so since some of the stuff that activism that they've had on local issues is not [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=2897.6400000000003s)]
*  stuff I would agree with, or I think was particularly strategically smart. But since the [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=2903.0800000000004s)]
*  election, like their stuff's been really good. And you have to acknowledge that and recognize [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=2908.0400000000004s)]
*  that it's like when a lot of other people haven't stepped up, they were stepping up. And I agree [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=2912.1200000000003s)]
*  with you absolutely on, you know, messaging and trying to keep people and trying to be broad tent. [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=2915.96s)]
*  And the nature of what they're doing, I think is really important. So I'm going to be out there in [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=2922.92s)]
*  New Orleans, as I've mentioned. Just a couple quick politics thing for Aleutia. Liebovich has [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=2928.0400000000004s)]
*  an Atlantic article today about Obama or maybe yesterday. The audacity of hope presidency has [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=2933.96s)]
*  given way to the fierce lethargy of semi-retirement. I've got to love Liebovich. He's basically making [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=2940.76s)]
*  the case that it's like, okay, I get that ex-presidents shouldn't typically have [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=2949.0s)]
*  receded. But maybe this isn't the moment for that. Maybe the Democrats have this vacuum of [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=2954.36s)]
*  communications ability. Maybe they pull in their best communicator to actually do something. [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=2959.08s)]
*  Some of the pushback from the article Eric Holder, a friend of Obama, said that they didn't want to [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=2963.96s)]
*  regularize him and have it just be like Tuesdays with Barack, you know, having him just be another [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=2967.4s)]
*  podcaster competing with me on the charts. I get that. I don't know. It cuts both ways for me. [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=2972.52s)]
*  What do you think? I don't know how much good Obama would do, but I agree with the spirit of [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=2979.24s)]
*  the criticism, which is he's not so high in my deal. If he wants to, he should have a body. I mean, [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=2983.48s)]
*  if he's so important, if the country's at risk, maybe he could go to the trouble of doing a podcast, [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=2988.2s)]
*  you know, for getting down to that level. I mean, we're going to the trouble of doing it, [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=2993.16s)]
*  which we're enjoying, of course, but still, we're not, I guess, quite at Obama's level. But I'm [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=2996.52s)]
*  not sympathetic, I will say, if we're going to criticize Obama, isn't there another president [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=3000.36s)]
*  who's around now who really deployed the military abroad, really has affection for the military, [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=3005.7200000000003s)]
*  also, I think would be a good model of not misusing the military at home. And I think his name is [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=3011.88s)]
*  George W. Bush, and I think maybe, remember him? He was president for like eight years. I think [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=3017.0s)]
*  he's around. I think he would speak to some, I mean, I won't overstate it, it wouldn't speak to [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=3022.36s)]
*  Trump supporters exactly. But there are probably some reluctant sort of Trump acquiescers and [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=3029.56s)]
*  apologists who might still remember that they voted twice for Bush. I kind of think he and [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=3035.88s)]
*  others like him would be, could be doing a little bit more here, you know? Yeah. [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=3040.92s)]
*  I agree. And I guess my main takeaway, I don't really care how often Obama talks that much. [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=3049.72s)]
*  Here's what I do care about. And if I, you know, if the former president wants to go in the pot, [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=3056.12s)]
*  he's always welcome. If somebody in his orbit wants to get my two cents and pass this along to him. [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=3060.7599999999998s)]
*  I just would like to see him pissed. I want to see people pissed. Like, people should be mad. [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=3067.08s)]
*  And I think that it contributes to the, to use Lieberman's word, lethargy, lethargy, however [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=3071.7999999999997s)]
*  we're pronouncing that. It contributes to the kind of universal limpness of the pushback. The [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=3078.28s)]
*  fact that a lot of the most visible people don't seem to be that upset. Like that they, that they [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=3087.48s)]
*  don't, they don't seem to be emotionally, like, enraged in a way that is called for, given what [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=3095.5600000000004s)]
*  we have seen over the first five and a half months. And, and like, that's the thing that [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=3102.6s)]
*  upsets me. And that is why I was, I was giving Gavin props yesterday. Like Gavin seems actually [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=3107.88s)]
*  pissed now. And, and to my response to that is good. People should be pissed. There's a lot to [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=3113.0s)]
*  be pissed about. And, and it is, it doesn't, you know, Obama always had kind of a cool, [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=3118.6s)]
*  you know, you know, you know, no drama Obama element to him. Like this just isn't the moment [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=3124.2s)]
*  for that. And there were times where you saw him get emotional and get, and get upset and get angry [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=3129.96s)]
*  and draw people in and draw people's attention to this and signal to people within, with his own, [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=3134.92s)]
*  you know, manner that this was something that really mattered. And I, and I would like to see [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=3140.92s)]
*  that from him and, and from any, and from everyone, all Democratic leaders. It's my critique of a lot [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=3145.08s)]
*  of Democratic leaders right now. And of course of, of the Bushes and Republicans and all that, [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=3150.52s)]
*  it's just the expectation is nil. And we haven't seen any Republicans, frankly, since the election. [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=3154.36s)]
*  And that's an ongoing shame and an ongoing disappointment. We have a New Jersey governor [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=3161.08s)]
*  primary today. You want to, you want to make an official endorsement for any listeners just making [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=3167.88s)]
*  a final decision who are desperate to know what Bill Kristol thinks they should do? [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=3171.88s)]
*  You know, I have a huge clout there in the Jersey. I grew up on the West side looking at Jersey, [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=3175.56s)]
*  Manhattan looking at the Jersey. So I'm sure they're waiting for me. I very much like and respect [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=3180.04s)]
*  Mikey Sherrill, the congressman for Navy helicopter pilot who is running a very intelligent and [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=3185.48s)]
*  sensible person. Others in the field are okay and fine. I think I don't know them the way I know her [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=3193.64s)]
*  personally. And so I hear, I'm here in Virginia, Abigail Spanberger is the Democratic nominee. [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=3201.08s)]
*  And honestly, from the point of view, if you care about a vibrant and honest centrist, [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=3206.92s)]
*  but also in this case, your just previous discussion, but also energetic, a Democratic party, [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=3211.2400000000002s)]
*  you know, if we could get Cheryl, governor Cheryl in New Jersey and governor Spanberger in Virginia [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=3216.44s)]
*  and the beginning of January 1st, 2026, I'd feel better about the future of the Democratic party. [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=3221.08s)]
*  Yeah, I would too. The focus group podcast was super interesting on this. If people want some [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=3229.48s)]
*  New Jersey primary day listening, I think the critique of Cheryl from some of those voters was [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=3232.92s)]
*  similar to what I just offered to Obama, like a little more fire, a little more fighting energy [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=3238.76s)]
*  against Obama. I don't know, Mayor Steve Fulpop seems okay to me. Some of the other candidates [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=3243.88s)]
*  are fine. I'm not the biggest Josh Cotthimer fan. Sorry if he's a listener. But the rest of them, [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=3250.6s)]
*  I can all seem fine. I don't and I do think that New Jersey Democrats should be taking this [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=3256.92s)]
*  phrase very seriously because there's been a big backsliding towards Republicans in New Jersey. [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=3262.52s)]
*  Let me actually just pull this up. Six points basically. I think all of them. Florida was 14, [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=3267.24s)]
*  Iowa was 13, Iowa was 12. New Jersey was closer than all three of those former swing states. So [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=3274.44s)]
*  that should be deeply alarming for Democrats thinking about how to reverse that. And I think [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=3285.16s)]
*  it's going to be a competitive state. Virginia's going to move in the other direction. So maybe a [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=3291.16s)]
*  different, not that Virginia residents shouldn't care about their governor's race, but just as far [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=3295.96s)]
*  as the broader political impact that New Jersey race is super important. So we will be monitoring [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=3300.12s)]
*  it. I think that's it. Do you have any Texas redistricting thoughts? That's my only other note. [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=3306.2799999999997s)]
*  These Republicans are trying to fuck around in Texas. And I guess it's just the mid-decade [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=3311.16s)]
*  redistricting is not the usual way that things go. But they're trying to figure out how they can do [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=3318.92s)]
*  anything to gerrymander some states they control to protect a few seats since the House. Or increase [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=3326.6s)]
*  considerably a couple seats in the House so they don't lose the House. I mean, yeah. I mean, that's [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=3331.32s)]
*  just the fact that that's just routinely on the table now. It got onto the table a little bit, [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=3335.64s)]
*  as I recall, in North Carolina and a couple other states in the last couple cycles. But Ohio, [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=3339.0s)]
*  I guess, had some- A lot of the times it was because of lawsuits, though. [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=3344.76s)]
*  But it was, yeah. It's been sort of a rule. Now, there's been a lot of gerrymandering every 10 [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=3347.5600000000004s)]
*  years. Don't get me wrong. But yeah, the notion that let's just, if we're going into a cycle where [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=3351.0800000000004s)]
*  it could help us, we'll just change the borders every two years. But it's on the piece, isn't it, [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=3356.2000000000003s)]
*  with what we should expect in 26 and 28, which is a Trump administration and a totally compliant [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=3361.2400000000002s)]
*  Republican party that is not playing by the standard rules. And that doesn't mean that they [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=3367.7200000000003s)]
*  literally will break laws. Maybe in this case they can do it, quote, legally. But the notion of, [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=3371.8s)]
*  you know, that goes beyond the strict rules and laws of free and fair elections, [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=3376.76s)]
*  level playing field, let's call it, use that metaphor. I don't know. We can't expect that, [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=3381.88s)]
*  honestly, you know? Indeed, we can't. Thanks to Bill Crystal for doing a Tuesday edition. [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=3386.28s)]
*  We lost Sly Stone yesterday. Funk, music, legend, dead at 82. Thank you for letting me be myself. [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=3393.32s)]
*  You know any Sly Stone, Bill Crystal? It was big when I was younger, but yeah, [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=3400.2s)]
*  family affair. I noticed that it was big. I didn't really personally know much about it. [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=3404.7599999999998s)]
*  Well, man, he was influential for me as a youth. So we'll take people out with some Sly Stone. [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=3410.2s)]
*  Appreciate everybody. We'll be back here tomorrow for another edition of the [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=3415.7999999999997s)]
*  Bulwark Podcast. We'll see you all then. Peace. [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX-ukkEddU&t=3419.24s)]
