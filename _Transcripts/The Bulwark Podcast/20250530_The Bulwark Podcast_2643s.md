Video Description: The Trump administration is trying to exert ideological control over every knowledge-producing institution in the country. And the assault on colleges is not only about having fewer highly-educated people, but also depriving Americans of trusted sources of information—much in the way Trump in 2020 wanted to stop counting Covid cases so it looked like he had the pandemic under control. Meanwhile, we're getting too much information about Elon's bladder control problems on his way out the door. The Atlantic's Adam Serwer joins Tim Miller for the weekend pod.

# Trump Is Ushering In a NEW DARK AGE (w/ Adam Serwer) | Bulwark Podcast
**The Bulwark Podcast:** [May 30, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E)
*  With the Trump hats, with the red hats, it's like a team sport. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=0.0s)]
*  They're almost not like Trump fans, Trump supporters, they're Trump fans. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=3.48s)]
*  And so they feel good when Team Trump wins, regardless of what the consequences of that are. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=8.28s)]
*  That is part of the sort of hacking of the lizard brain that the Trump folks have done [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=12.76s)]
*  that I think can be hard to understand if you're not a sports fan in some capacity, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=17.56s)]
*  if you don't hate another team enough to be happy when they lose. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=22.52s)]
*  Hello and welcome to the Bulldog podcast. I'm your host, Tim Miller. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=30.0s)]
*  I want to welcome a writer at the Atlantic, author of the book, The Cruelty is the Point. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=33.48s)]
*  His latest piece is on the Trump administration's attack on knowledge called The Dark Age. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=38.56s)]
*  Pumped to have him on the pod. It's Adam Serwer. Hey, Adam, what's happening, man? [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=43.88s)]
*  Not much. Just down here in San Antonio, finally getting a little rain. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=48.2s)]
*  You're San Antonio, man? [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=54.04s)]
*  I am a San Antonio man. I mean, I generally don't talk about this. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=56.08s)]
*  My wife is in the military. She's a surgeon and she's stationed here. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=58.8s)]
*  So that's why we live here. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=63.36s)]
*  All right. Well, you get a lot of wimpy next year. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=65.16s)]
*  That'll be good. Yeah. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=67.56s)]
*  Well, I'm excited to have you on. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=70.56s)]
*  As I mentioned, you have this new piece called The New Dark Age, which I want to get into. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=72.56s)]
*  First, I just have a couple of news items I got to mention for folks. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=75.96000000000001s)]
*  I'm interested to get your take on. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=78.96000000000001s)]
*  There's a big piece that I want to talk about. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=80.28s)]
*  I just have a couple of news items I got to mention for folks. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=82.28s)]
*  I'm interested to get your take on. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=84.28s)]
*  There's a big New York Times take out on Elon, our former shadow president, has been kicked out. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=85.67999999999999s)]
*  And I just felt like I had to mention that he's doing so much ketamine that he's having bladder control issues. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=90.67999999999999s)]
*  And I thought that was... [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=98.67999999999999s)]
*  It's not really great when the New York Times has a profile on you and they mention your bladder control issues several times. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=100.67999999999999s)]
*  And so I felt it was incumbent upon me for the listener's sake in case they missed that to just to flag that. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=106.2s)]
*  But I'm interested in just in your broader take on Elon and his legacy from his four months of, I guess, ending USAID and failing at everything else. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=112.2s)]
*  I'm wondering what you make of it all. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=124.2s)]
*  I mean, I just think you can look at it and see it as extraordinarily destructive, particularly abroad. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=126.2s)]
*  We go back to one of the things I think liberals would probably always concede to the George W. Bush administration is that PEPFAR is one of the best programs that the U.S. has ever done. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=132.72s)]
*  And you can see now the withdrawal of this kind of international aid is affecting hundreds of thousands, if not millions of people for no good reason. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=144.72s)]
*  And I think more, not just no good reason, but in my view, illegally, because Congress appropriated that money and the executive does not have the authority to impound it. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=158.24s)]
*  Simply because, you know, I really I think in some ways. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=171.76000000000002s)]
*  One of the most important things about it is the sort of ideology and mentality behind the belief that all these people's lives do not matter. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=177.76000000000002s)]
*  And you can simply withdraw the things that are keeping them alive and that will not have any consequences whatsoever because those people's lives aren't important. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=186.76000000000002s)]
*  I think that, you know, to be honest, that kind of boils my blood. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=194.76000000000002s)]
*  I am completely unsympathetic to Elon and whatever his mental health issues are, given the impact that he's had on the country. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=200.28s)]
*  I think as. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=210.28s)]
*  I think his effect on American democracy has been extraordinarily negative. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=215.28s)]
*  To have someone who, you know, when you look at what they did in the courts with Doge, you know, this sort of shell game, pretending that Elon wasn't in charge. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=220.28s)]
*  You have this person who was not elected, who was not appointed in any like Senate confirmed way, who is exercising all this authority to alter the structure of American government in a way that, you know, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=227.8s)]
*  Congress did not authorize and the American people did not vote for. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=241.6s)]
*  I just think it's incredibly destructive. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=246.6s)]
*  And the fact that someone with that kind of wealth and power can simply walk into the U.S. government and do whatever they want, I think is a real problem. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=248.6s)]
*  And something that, you know, however America recovers from the Trump era, if it ever does, is going to be something really important to think about how to prevent, you know, people like this from seizing control in this way and exercising their will, you know, in opposition to sort of basic democratic accountability. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=257.59999999999997s)]
*  And again, you know, I'm not I think part of the issue here is that if if you build a system that runs on checks and balances and the other branches are not willing to check and balance, you know, there's not a whole lot people can do. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=279.92s)]
*  You know, Congress doesn't want to assert its authority if the courts do not enforce the laws written, you know, there aren't a whole lot of options. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=293.92s)]
*  And I think in some ways, Elon really revealed the weakness of the system as it currently exists. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=304.24s)]
*  Our friends over at Lawfare, Ben Wittes flagged this from yesterday. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=311.24s)]
*  Anna Bauer wrote this article about just like their efforts to even try to find the who was the supposed administrator of Doge and what the legal rationale was for it. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=314.24s)]
*  And I'll put the link in the show notes for people because it's it's I mean, it's like a dark comedy like the Cape, you know, because the seriousness of the matter. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=325.56s)]
*  But like this caper to find this ridiculous kind of person that's like the ostensible leader of Doge while Elon is running roughshod over the government. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=334.56s)]
*  And to your point, like when I was listening at your response, it's like, on the one hand, yeah, we have to figure out, you know, if we get through this, how to put in protections that prevent this from happening in the future. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=341.88s)]
*  But it's kind of like, in this case, those protections kind of existed. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=356.88s)]
*  It's just nobody's enforcing the laws. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=359.88s)]
*  And like, we're seeing this across a number of verticals, particularly on like Trump's corruption. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=361.88s)]
*  And some of the cases Trump has, you know, been like the Kool-Aid man breaking through the wall and just like not following any of the norms, things that were not laws, like, you know, going all the way back to I'm not going to release my tax returns or whatever. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=366.2s)]
*  But this time around, they're just acting straight illegally across a lot of areas. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=376.2s)]
*  And, you know, in the judiciary, in some ways is limiting them, which has been good. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=382.2s)]
*  They've lost, I think, like 94 percent of their cases last month. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=386.2s)]
*  But there are other areas where like they're just people can't like there isn't like a clear way to challenge it in the courts. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=389.52s)]
*  And you're seeing this across, I think, corruption and Doge in particular. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=399.52s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I think it's kind of extraordinary because you have this sort of a historical idea of, you know, the unitary executive, which is that it would just sort of in complete opposition to the intentions of the founders. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=403.52s)]
*  And so for years I've been hearing, you know, about how important the founders intentions were. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=418.84s)]
*  And here you have two things that are extraordinarily important to the structure of the government that they created, which is, you know, to prevent the arbitrary exercise of power by the state and to prevent, you know, foreign corrupt sources from using money to warp the government and the intentions of the government. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=423.84s)]
*  And I think that's a really good example of Trump violating both of those things and conservatives insisting that it's not really a problem at all because the president is a king who can do whatever he wants. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=444.15999999999997s)]
*  And it's just, you know, I've seen it. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=455.15999999999997s)]
*  I think there are a lot of historical inversions in American politics. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=457.15999999999997s)]
*  And I think, you know, particularly with race, there's always this sort of inversion that happens where people talk about, you know, the actual oppressed people as though they're the oppressors. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=461.15999999999997s)]
*  And that is used to justify oppression of that minority group. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=471.48s)]
*  But here the inversion is extraordinary because you have all these people who are saying like they want the government to be exactly as be run exactly as the founders intended. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=475.48s)]
*  And then, you know, they invent these legal theories that allow them to do the complete opposite. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=485.48s)]
*  I have a little news item that I wanted to flag just because, you know, this is the thing that boils my blood the most. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=490.8s)]
*  And I want to keep updated with the story. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=497.8s)]
*  But it relates to what your point about Elon and USAID just about like the dehumanization of people around the globe. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=499.8s)]
*  And in this case, I'm referring to the Venezuelans we sent to El Salvador. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=507.8s)]
*  There's a ProPublica story out this morning. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=510.8s)]
*  I think it's a good point. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=513.12s)]
*  I think it's a good point. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=514.12s)]
*  I think it's a good point. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=515.12s)]
*  I think it's a good point. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=516.12s)]
*  I think it's a good point. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=517.12s)]
*  I think it's a good point. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=518.12s)]
*  I think it's a good point. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=519.12s)]
*  I think it's a good point. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=520.12s)]
*  I think it's a good point. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=521.12s)]
*  I think it's a good point. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=522.12s)]
*  I think it's a good point. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=523.12s)]
*  I think it's a good point. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=524.12s)]
*  I think it's a good point. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=525.12s)]
*  I think it's a good point. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=526.12s)]
*  I think it's a good point. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=527.12s)]
*  I think it's a good point. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=528.12s)]
*  I think it's a good point. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=529.12s)]
*  I think it's a good point. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=530.12s)]
*  I think it's a good point. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=531.12s)]
*  I think it's a good point. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=532.12s)]
*  I think it's a good point. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=533.12s)]
*  I think it's a good point. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=534.12s)]
*  Even Bukele, I guess, had asked. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=535.12s)]
*  Somebody inside the administration was like, are you sure these guys are gangsters? [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=538.92s)]
*  Because it doesn't really seem so to me. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=542.24s)]
*  I think that's pretty telling when a tinpot dictator who's known for throwing people into [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=544.92s)]
*  jail without evidence is a little concerned that they were being willy-nilly. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=549.52s)]
*  I think that was a pretty bad sign. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=554.16s)]
*  Now we have hard data on that. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=556.8s)]
*  I'm just wondering what your reaction is to all of that. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=558.16s)]
*  I think something that people simply do not want to accept because of how scary and extreme [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=564.1999999999999s)]
*  it is, is that Trump's mass deportation project is actually a demographic engineering project. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=567.76s)]
*  If you go back and you look at the emails that Stephen Miller was exchanging with Breitbart [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=574.24s)]
*  writers and stuff like that back in the day, his perception is that the removal of racist [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=578.36s)]
*  immigration restrictions in 1965 doomed the country. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=585.24s)]
*  And remember, when we're talking about these immigration restrictions, these were put in [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=590.56s)]
*  place essentially when eugenics was a reigning ideology among the American elite. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=593.72s)]
*  So his problem is that America has gotten less white than he wants it to be. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=600.1600000000001s)]
*  And you have all these people. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=605.36s)]
*  The reality of this is that there are not enough criminals to do a mass deportation [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=607.96s)]
*  of immigrant criminals, undocumented criminals in the United States. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=611.7600000000001s)]
*  And so instead, we're focusing resources on taking out people who are gainfully employed [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=615.72s)]
*  who have functionally assimilated, some of whom are married to U.S. citizens, have U.S. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=621.52s)]
*  citizens, citizen children. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=625.88s)]
*  But in the view of the people who are running this administration, they are a demographic [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=628.32s)]
*  problem that must be removed. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=632.6s)]
*  And that's also why you see them closing the doors to refugees all over the world, except [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=635.24s)]
*  for white people from South Africa who are upset about the end of apartheid and don't [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=640.4s)]
*  want to live in a country with a black majority that has democratic self-determination. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=647.48s)]
*  So I think the reality of this is, is that it doesn't matter whether the Venezuelans [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=652.12s)]
*  are criminals because the people who are running this administration don't want them there [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=659.44s)]
*  because they are Venezuelan. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=663.4s)]
*  It doesn't matter that many of them are ideologically conservative because they're fleeing a leftist [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=664.76s)]
*  regime in Venezuela. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=669.28s)]
*  You know what I mean? It's like when you think about it, I mean, you can I think a lot about [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=670.52s)]
*  the example of Jewish immigration. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=676.56s)]
*  The first wave of Jewish immigration contains a lot of left-leaning people because they're [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=678.0s)]
*  fleeing the czar. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=682.0799999999999s)]
*  And the second wave from the Soviet Union contains a lot of conservatives because they're [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=684.76s)]
*  coming from a communist country. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=689.04s)]
*  And so you have all these immigrants who ideologically are probably more inclined towards the right [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=691.6999999999999s)]
*  than the left, but they are simply the wrong ethnicity. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=696.64s)]
*  And so the Trump administration wants to get rid of them and bring in people who fit their [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=700.3199999999999s)]
*  idea of who Americans are and should be. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=705.24s)]
*  Yeah, it's a good point. The case of the Venezuelans that are going to Sokoto, like, is just I [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=707.96s)]
*  mean, it's a little bit of a category difference, right? [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=715.0s)]
*  Because it's like it's one thing if it's like, OK, man, we're going to put you guys on a bus [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=720.0s)]
*  and put you in shackles, whatever, and send you back to Venezuela or send you to Mexico or [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=723.6400000000001s)]
*  whatever. I mean, I would not be for that. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=727.32s)]
*  It's another thing when it's like, no, we're going to disappear you and put you in a hole. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=729.6400000000001s)]
*  We're going to put you in a gulag in a foreign country where there's no due process and where, [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=732.9599999999999s)]
*  reportedly, no one has ever left. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=737.1199999999999s)]
*  And I think if you're El Salvador, they don't want anybody to leave. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=739.28s)]
*  So even if they know that these people are not dangerous and not criminals, to maintain [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=743.92s)]
*  the mystique around this prison, they don't want to let people out. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=749.3199999999999s)]
*  It is a nightmare situation. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=752.92s)]
*  It is a complete violation of the basic constitutional values that the country was founded [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=757.52s)]
*  on in terms of preventing the arbitrary exercise of power and ensuring due process and [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=763.4s)]
*  stuff like that. And it's really it's one of the worst things I think that is happening [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=769.1999999999999s)]
*  right now as far as the Trump administration is concerned. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=775.4s)]
*  And I think I guess what worries me about it is there is a kind of. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=778.68s)]
*  You know, I think the public in general is either uninformed about how bad what is going [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=785.7199999999999s)]
*  on is as far as this is concerned or seems, you know, unconcerned about it. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=792.12s)]
*  But the reality is that the legal positions the administration has taken, which is like [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=796.68s)]
*  if we deport you by mistake, we don't have to go get you, means that a U.S. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=801.3199999999999s)]
*  citizen could could could suffer that fate and could end up, you know, trapped in a [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=805.4799999999999s)]
*  foreign prison for the rest of their life for no good reason at all. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=811.72s)]
*  I want to get to your article, The New Dark Age, which is why we asked you to come come on. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=816.48s)]
*  And I agreed with the premise and a couple of issues with some of the particulars. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=820.5200000000001s)]
*  So let's dig in and let's like for folks who haven't seen it, just give a little kind of [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=825.24s)]
*  Reader's Digest summary of what the argument you're making. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=830.1600000000001s)]
*  Yeah. So, I mean, my argument is basically that, you know, and basically every feel [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=834.12s)]
*  that involves gathering knowledge, the Trump administration is trying to defund or impose [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=841.6s)]
*  a stifling, you know, we could use the phrase political correctness on any kind of [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=846.6800000000001s)]
*  scientific, historical, cultural inquiry. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=852.1600000000001s)]
*  You know, they want to they don't want any studies saying, you know, employers, [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=856.72s)]
*  employers, landlords or, you know, anybody else is discriminating on the basis of race. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=863.44s)]
*  They don't want any studies that say climate change is affecting the environment. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=869.44s)]
*  They don't want any studies that say, you know, pollution is bad for you and makes you [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=873.48s)]
*  sick. They don't want any museum exhibits that discuss the history of racism in the [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=877.6400000000001s)]
*  United States. They don't want any art produced or history produced or taught that [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=882.72s)]
*  teaches anybody anything that might lead to people believing that industry should be more [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=888.72s)]
*  strictly regulated, that, you know, equality under the law is not is not already a reality or [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=894.36s)]
*  that, you know, we should redistribute income from the rich to people who are not rich. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=899.84s)]
*  And it is basically a sort of an attempt to exert ideological control over basically [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=907.32s)]
*  every knowledge producing institution in the United States. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=914.24s)]
*  And they're doing this, I think, because they believe that there's a couple of reasons. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=917.72s)]
*  One is that they see knowledge workers, white collar workers who are engaged in any kind of [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=922.88s)]
*  knowledge production as a kind of class enemy given educational polarization in the United [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=927.04s)]
*  States. And so they want fewer of those people because they believe that will also mean fewer [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=932.56s)]
*  Democrats getting elected. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=938.52s)]
*  I also think, you know, the example that I use is if you go back to the first administration [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=941.08s)]
*  with Covid, you know, Trump's saying, you know, if we stopped counting the cases, we [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=945.96s)]
*  wouldn't have so many cases. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=950.56s)]
*  And so that is basically the same thing that's going on here. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=952.8399999999999s)]
*  If we can prevent the production of empirical information that can be used to politically [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=956.1999999999999s)]
*  oppose the administration, then people just have to trust us. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=963.64s)]
*  And whatever it is we say, they have they are dependent on the firehose of propaganda that we [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=966.5999999999999s)]
*  produce day in and day out. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=972.2399999999999s)]
*  And I think the American research infrastructure is probably the most profitable, effective [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=974.48s)]
*  one that has ever existed in the history of humanity. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=982.88s)]
*  And that's simply a matter of the time that we live in and how rich America is. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=986.36s)]
*  I don't think it's like anything particular to Americans. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=992.96s)]
*  But, you know, one of virtually what's ironic, I think, is like, you know, you have all these [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=997.32s)]
*  people from the tech industry who are, you know, involved in this sort of dismantling of this. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=1004.2s)]
*  But, you know, virtually every profitable technology that we adopt starts off as some sort of [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=1010.76s)]
*  government grant, because prior to it becoming profitable, commercial entities can't take that [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=1017.88s)]
*  kind of risk. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=1024.8s)]
*  So, I mean, I think, you know, I can't say for sure what the effect of this will be, but I know it [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=1027.48s)]
*  will be bad for the country. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=1034.08s)]
*  You know, one of my big concerns is that if you look at the way that red states have destroyed [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=1035.92s)]
*  public goods, you know, people might say, oh, well, there will be a backlash to this. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=1041.56s)]
*  But if you look at the way that red states have destroyed public goods in the end, you know, [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=1045.96s)]
*  sometimes there isn't a backlash because people can be convinced to scapegoat or blame someone [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=1049.24s)]
*  else for their problems and become, you know, perhaps even angrier, even more reactionary. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=1053.68s)]
*  Yeah, I know. I make that point a lot. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=1060.1200000000001s)]
*  Like my husband's from West Virginia. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=1061.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=1063.48s)]
*  I mean, West Virginia has collapsed economically and across basically every metric over the past [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=1064.6000000000001s)]
*  two decades. And it's just gotten more and more red. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=1070.8s)]
*  That's right. So there's no, you know, the fact that, you know, I think sometimes you sometimes [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=1073.64s)]
*  see liberals rooting for things to get worse so that people will get angry about it. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=1078.3600000000001s)]
*  But it's just not necessarily the case that that will lead to Republicans losing power. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=1082.8s)]
*  And I think they understand that. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=1088.8799999999999s)]
*  OK, so the one part about this that I am absolutely aligned with is what their intentions are. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=1090.64s)]
*  And part of that is because it was a nice gift to you after you wrote the article, the [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=1095.56s)]
*  Secretary of Education, our former WWE executive, essentially admitted it. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=1100.36s)]
*  Let's I got the audio that let's listen to it real quick. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=1107.48s)]
*  And universities should continue to be able to do research as long as they're abiding by the laws [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=1110.2s)]
*  and are in sync, I think, with with the administration and what the administration is trying to accomplish. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=1115.4s)]
*  Universities should be allowed to do research as long as they're in sync with what the [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=1122.08s)]
*  administration is trying to accomplish. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=1125.6000000000001s)]
*  And that's some fucking communist shit. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=1127.96s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, it's it's totalitarian. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=1130.28s)]
*  You're allowed to you're allowed to think and say what the government allows you to think and say. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=1132.4s)]
*  And if you don't do that, then there will be consequences. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=1137.88s)]
*  And I think, you know, sometimes, you know, the administration has people who are sophisticated [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=1142.68s)]
*  enough to talk around these things and talk about them in euphemism. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=1148.16s)]
*  But obviously, Ms. McMahon, perhaps due to her career in professional wrestling, is not one of those people. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=1154.0800000000002s)]
*  She also, you know, there was another revealing moment during her confirmation hearing where they asked her [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=1160.2800000000002s)]
*  whether a black history class would be illegal. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=1165.12s)]
*  And she says she didn't know. And it's like, you know, it's always good when you have the people who are not [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=1166.76s)]
*  quite clever enough to veil what's actually going on. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=1172.4799999999998s)]
*  Yeah. All right. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=1176.8799999999999s)]
*  So the. I guess my what I wanted to kind of hash out with you is like the. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=1178.6399999999999s)]
*  I may be a little bit more optimistic about their efficacy than you are. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=1186.1999999999998s)]
*  I actually have concerns about a new, you know, the the premise of the, you know, the [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=1191.5200000000002s)]
*  theme of the article, the New Dark Age. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=1197.0s)]
*  I have some concerns about this across, you know, kind of like the technology and propaganda [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=1199.3200000000002s)]
*  verticals, right? Like, you know, I mean, Elon owning X and, you know, a lot of these radicalized [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=1203.92s)]
*  red pill tech guys owning these platforms and and and and people struggling going forward to be able to tell [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=1209.8400000000001s)]
*  truth from fiction, which is already a problem. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=1218.84s)]
*  I think it's going to become a much, much greater problem in the years ahead with AI. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=1221.52s)]
*  And so I have some concerns about that that are like overlapping with what some people in the administration [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=1225.92s)]
*  are doing. I'm not really sure that their efforts to defund research and silence black history classes and [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=1231.8s)]
*  things like this are actually going to are going to work. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=1240.44s)]
*  I mean, there's going to be long term negative ramifications because the research will stop for a few years. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=1243.28s)]
*  But I don't I'm not to me, they seem a little bit like the Keystone cops on that front. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=1248.4s)]
*  And I'm more worried about the tech overlords on this front. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=1253.24s)]
*  I don't know. I don't know what you make of that. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=1255.68s)]
*  I think that. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=1257.76s)]
*  My my concern, I mean, I think you're probably right to worry about the technology, I think, you know, to [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=1262.48s)]
*  the thing that sticks out to me is the vaccine stuff. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=1268.92s)]
*  So it's not just that knowledge is destroyed or the ability to accumulate [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=1272.1999999999998s)]
*  and synthesize it is harmed, but it's replaced with junk. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=1278.12s)]
*  Right. So you have this issue with this outbreak of of of measles in the southwest. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=1284.12s)]
*  And we're talking about cod liver. I mean, that stuff is really bad. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=1290.4399999999998s)]
*  Yeah. You know, we have like, you know, my my my fear is partially not just, you know, that they're going to [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=1293.6s)]
*  mess with technology, but our ability to advance technology, but that, you know, people will stop [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=1302.1599999999999s)]
*  accepting scientific conclusions because their brains are so cooked by the stuff that they're seeing on social [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=1309.1599999999999s)]
*  media. As far as black history is concerned, I mean, you know, it's to some extent, you know, you can't. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=1315.4399999999998s)]
*  I mean, on the one hand, the Internet means you can you can do a book burning that is much bigger than an actual [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=1324.4399999999998s)]
*  literal book burning. On the other hand, it is hard to delete anything from the Internet now that now that it [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=1331.4s)]
*  exists. The Library of Alexandria situation. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=1338.1200000000001s)]
*  Right. Right. We're not talking about like, you know, there are plays that Eskielas wrote that we're never going [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=1340.16s)]
*  to get to read. But I do think that, you know, this. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=1345.68s)]
*  You know, me personally, I grew up in Washington, D.C. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=1354.52s)]
*  I went to a public school. I went to the Duke Ellington School of the Arts and there were classes that I took there, [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=1358.04s)]
*  you know, classes on the Harlem Renaissance, classes on black history that were there because DCPS serves a mostly [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=1363.48s)]
*  black student body. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=1369.72s)]
*  And I when I got to college, I knew things that other kids had not been taught because of that. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=1372.4s)]
*  And so, you know, to some extent, my fear with this stuff is that we're going it's not so much that none of this stuff [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=1378.96s)]
*  will ever get taught, but we're going to turn the clock back to a period where people simply did not know the [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=1386.28s)]
*  nuances of the history that that I was fortunate enough to learn because they simply won't be taught it. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=1391.36s)]
*  Like, it will simply be censored or will simply be taken out of academic inquiry. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=1398.8s)]
*  And I take the point that for most kids, like, you know, most kids are not arguing about, you know, whether or not [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=1402.76s)]
*  the Civil War was caused by slavery. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=1409.96s)]
*  Like, the truth is, we have bigger problems as far as, like, making sure everybody learns math and reading properly. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=1412.1599999999999s)]
*  But I do fear that, you know, popular understandings of history really do affect ideological conclusions about the world. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=1418.76s)]
*  And they understand that. So, like, they're looking back to 2020 and the George Floyd thing, and they want to prevent [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=1428.8s)]
*  something like that from ever happening again. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=1434.12s)]
*  They don't want any more awakenings around the importance of discrimination in public policy to happen because that might [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=1437.24s)]
*  lead to political changes. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=1447.44s)]
*  And, you know, we can make critiques about the excesses of that period, et cetera, et cetera. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=1448.92s)]
*  But the point is that, you know, they do not want actual factual information to reach people in a way that might make them [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=1454.48s)]
*  say, well, you know, maybe we should do something about this problem. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=1461.76s)]
*  And, you know, that is actually my bigger fear, not simply that they will manage to, you know, completely prevent anybody [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=1465.64s)]
*  from ever reading The Souls of Black Folk ever again. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=1472.72s)]
*  I mean, I didn't read The Souls of Black Folk until I was, like, 39. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=1478.0s)]
*  So, you know, that is...so I'm pretty concerned about what's happening elsewhere. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=1480.72s)]
*  We didn't read it in high school. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=1484.96s)]
*  We did have, like, a section of it that our teacher gave us. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=1486.16s)]
*  You know, I mean, again, like, this is one of the cool things about growing up in D.C. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=1491.32s)]
*  is that we just, you know, we learn things that other people didn't learn, that people didn't learn until they got to [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=1497.2s)]
*  college. But again, that's part of, you know, their assault on college, right? [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=1501.48s)]
*  Is that they don't want people learning those things when they get to these institutions. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=1506.9199999999998s)]
*  They don't want people learning about convict leasing or that, you know, or the true story of reconstruction or, you know, [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=1510.48s)]
*  the Wilmington riot. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=1518.6s)]
*  They don't want people learning these things when they get to college. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=1519.8s)]
*  They want people learning, you know, what Stephen Miller says when he gets on the podium that America is great. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=1521.84s)]
*  It's always been great. There's never been any problems. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=1526.8799999999999s)]
*  And you should shut up and like it. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=1528.96s)]
*  It's interesting. It's a provocative concept. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=1530.96s)]
*  It just had me kind of noodling it over my head because obviously, if there is some kind of, you know, rollback of the [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=1533.12s)]
*  clock or maybe roll forward of the clock where the way the technology works, that learning, you know, is different and [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=1539.48s)]
*  that we go through, you know, some period of regression. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=1545.72s)]
*  Like, it's not going to look like like the dark age of the eight hundreds or whatever, right? [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=1548.96s)]
*  Like, it's not going to be the same as it was in the past. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=1552.8000000000002s)]
*  But I the confluence of this type of, you know, autocratic movement here and around the world with shortening attention, [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=1555.1200000000001s)]
*  spans with AI, with how complicated it is to understand facts with, you know, the loss of gatekeepers, not gatekeepers, [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=1566.92s)]
*  but what sort of like, you know, news judgment and just the proliferation of slop. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=1577.8s)]
*  I don't know, man. I think that it is we could be going to a period where people are underestimating just how like how much we [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=1585.08s)]
*  could regress. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=1595.28s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, look, people I'm convinced after reading a lot about history that people are basically the same in every [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=1596.6399999999999s)]
*  period, but their circumstances are not the same. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=1602.96s)]
*  And I think what we've done with AI, with social media, with some other things is we've created technologies that enhance [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=1606.16s)]
*  our some of our worst impulses as human beings in a way that makes democratic accountability very difficult. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=1613.68s)]
*  And I don't have all the answers to those problems, but I think you're right. [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=1623.1200000000001s)]
*  Like, no, we're not we're not going to, you know, the past does not repeat in that kind of identical way. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=1625.92s)]
*  But, you know, we can become a less literate, poor, less prosperous, more unequal and less democratic country as a result of [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=1634.52s)]
*  everything that's happening now. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=1643.96s)]
*  And I think, you know, even if this has some sort of even if this period that we're in right now has some sort of happy [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=1645.4399999999998s)]
*  ending, I think, you know, broadly speaking, that might be inevitable. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=1652.8799999999999s)]
*  I'm not sure. We'll see. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=1658.1599999999999s)]
*  Yeah. Just a couple of things I want to pick your brain on. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=1659.32s)]
*  What's it like being the cruelty is the point guy? [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=1664.6399999999999s)]
*  You know, it's interesting. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=1668.24s)]
*  A couple of months after I wrote that piece, I stopped saying it because I didn't want to be like catchphrase guy. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=1670.1200000000001s)]
*  You know what I mean? I just like, you know, you can search around. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=1677.1200000000001s)]
*  You haven't. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=1680.0400000000002s)]
*  Hotel California. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=1680.8400000000001s)]
*  Yeah. So I just, you know, I wrote the book, obviously, because I, you know, I had some things to say and I just, you know, [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=1682.68s)]
*  I wanted I wanted to make the point more complex. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=1690.5200000000002s)]
*  So the book is more about sort of the ideological and historical currents that led to Trump to begin with. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=1696.28s)]
*  But, you know, I don't have a problem with people using the phrase, you know, I personally don't use it very much because I [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=1702.76s)]
*  don't want to turn into, you know, you know, say the thing, Bart. [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=1709.88s)]
*  You know what I mean? Like, I just don't want to be that guy. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=1714.08s)]
*  Say the line, Adam. [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=1715.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=1717.1200000000001s)]
*  But as you're thinking about it, it evolves since you first wrote it, you know, like as far as as implications and I mean, [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=1718.68s)]
*  we have so many more years now of information and action to, you know, to kind of layer onto it. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=1726.2s)]
*  Well, I mean, I think, you know, it really I think for me, it remains the main political and human nature insight of the Trump [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=1732.68s)]
*  people, which is that there is a kind of bond that is created when you get together to pick on somebody. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=1740.64s)]
*  And that's as true of elementary school children as it is of adults. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=1748.92s)]
*  And I think emotionally, you know, when you involve someone in something like that, they then become invested in defending it. [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=1752.6s)]
*  Right. So, you know, you look at these deportations to a gulag, like, you know, when the Trump administration says they're [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=1762.24s)]
*  the worst of the worst, their supporters want to agree with that because the opposite implication says something very nasty about [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=1768.6799999999998s)]
*  them personally. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=1778.08s)]
*  Right. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=1779.32s)]
*  So I think, you know, one of the one of the aspects of this kind of politics of cruelty is that it invests people in the [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=1780.8s)]
*  cruelty in a way that makes it hard for them to reflect and change course. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=1789.52s)]
*  And I think they very much understand that, because if you've invested so much of your life in hurting innocent people, you [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=1793.12s)]
*  don't want to believe that you're doing that. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=1799.76s)]
*  People want to believe they're acting in righteous ways. [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=1801.1599999999999s)]
*  And so pulling that back and saying, wait, I did something wrong, that's very hard for people to do, regardless of ideology, [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=1804.72s)]
*  regardless of background. [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=1811.48s)]
*  And the Trump administration, the Trump people understand this and they've sort of recruited people into this emotional sort of [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=1814.72s)]
*  sunk cost situation where reversing yourself would mean acknowledging that you have been a party to some pretty terrible [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=1821.28s)]
*  things and that that says something not necessarily positive about you as a person. [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=1829.72s)]
*  Yeah. And I think it's also one observation I've had on it is and I don't know whether this is an insight that somebody had or [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=1835.3600000000001s)]
*  whether Trump just it's kind of like his preternatural lizard instinct to do this. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=1842.68s)]
*  But it is why they do so much of the kind of silly, cruel stuff, too, that seems fun. [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=1849.1200000000001s)]
*  Right. Because it takes a little bit of the weight out of it. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=1856.92s)]
*  You know, I think about the eating the dogs, eating the cats, and then they have like the remix song they're making of it. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=1859.12s)]
*  And you got the Ole Miss frat boys yelling at a tailgate. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=1865.12s)]
*  And it becomes like to your point about how getting together to make fun of somebody like can be can bond people. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=1871.4799999999998s)]
*  Like if you're doing it in a way that feels jovial, right, rather than feeling purely mean, it can add more people to the [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=1879.76s)]
*  group. Right. And I think Trump is uniquely good at that in a way that some of the copycats are not. [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=1888.84s)]
*  You know, I think it's easier to understand what's going on with Trump if you follow sports, you know, because, you know, if you like [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=1895.6399999999999s)]
*  there are just there are teams that people root for and there are teams that people hate and they want to see fail. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=1904.8799999999999s)]
*  And when those teams fail, they love to like go online and make fun of their fans and you know, I'm saying they feel good about it. [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=1909.48s)]
*  And this is like very much the same dynamic that's happening in politics, except the stakes are real. [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=1915.12s)]
*  But I think for people being part of what they feel like is the winning team, the team that's constantly owning the other side, [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=1921.8799999999999s)]
*  you know, people do like that. [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=1928.32s)]
*  I mean, there's a reason why Real Madrid has so many fans. [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=1929.84s)]
*  You know what I mean? Like, and so this feeling of like Trump winning and beating everybody, you know, for them is like a [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=1932.64s)]
*  sort of it makes them feel good. [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=1940.6s)]
*  You know, it's like it's like a boost to their self-esteem to be part of the quote unquote winning team. [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=1943.8000000000002s)]
*  And I say this, you know, when I, you know, when I, you know, I'm a big soccer fan when my team wins, I feel good about myself for [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=1948.04s)]
*  the next week. It's stupid. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=1955.52s)]
*  It has nothing to do with me. [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=1956.6000000000001s)]
*  I'm not doing anything, but it is sort of like a human nature thing. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=1958.24s)]
*  And I think they understand that, like with the Trump hats, with the red hats, it's like a team sport. [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=1961.72s)]
*  They're almost not like Trump fans, Trump supporters, they're Trump fans. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=1966.44s)]
*  And so they feel good when Team Trump wins, regardless of what the consequences of that are. [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=1971.2800000000002s)]
*  And I think, you know, that is part of the sort of hacking of the loser brain that the Trump folks have done that I think, you [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=1975.8000000000002s)]
*  know, can be hard to understand if you're not, you know, if you're not a sports fan in some in some capacity, if you don't like [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=1983.76s)]
*  hate another team enough to be happy when they lose. [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=1988.8400000000001s)]
*  The LSU fans, I'm an LSU man. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=1992.64s)]
*  They have a chant, suck that tiger dick bitch. [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=1994.72s)]
*  That's what the students yell with the other team. [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=1998.8s)]
*  And there is that like that's there is that element to try. [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=2001.76s)]
*  And like, that's appealing. It's funny. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=2005.6s)]
*  Right. It's funny. It's it's it's again, everybody's together. [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=2007.04s)]
*  The stakes are low. Right. [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=2009.6799999999998s)]
*  It's about like making fun of Bama or whatever. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=2011.28s)]
*  Do the Democrats need like there's this tension right on the Democratic side where it's like, do you react to that energy by [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=2013.9199999999998s)]
*  saying, no, you know, we've got to be more serious and kind and like to the Democrats need to suck that tiger dick bitch kind [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=2020.32s)]
*  of energy to do. [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=2028.12s)]
*  So I'm a political I'm not a political consultant and I can't tell them that. [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=2030.76s)]
*  But that's kind of why we want your take. [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=2034.4799999999998s)]
*  Man, political consultants are failing. [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=2036.2399999999998s)]
*  I will say that I think that's what the Harris campaign was trying to do. [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=2039.7199999999998s)]
*  Right. They were trying to be fun in a less negative way. [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=2043.3999999999999s)]
*  I don't know that the Democratic base is in the mood for that anymore. [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=2048.56s)]
*  You know, I think they want to see people, you know, they want to see, you know, some some, you know, to put it in soccer terms, [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=2053.36s)]
*  they want to see some wins that are like five zero. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=2061.36s)]
*  You know what I mean? They they they they want to see the other side receive its just desserts. [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=2063.84s)]
*  So I'm not sure, you know, I'm not sure that the vibe that they have right now is working for them as far as the base is [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=2070.28s)]
*  concerned. But I also don't know what the optimal approach is for maximizing their political support. [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=2077.08s)]
*  I think it's a it's an information environment that's extraordinarily toxic. [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=2084.8s)]
*  And so it's difficult for them to get their message out. [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=2089.76s)]
*  You know, they keep talking about like, we want to talk about kitchen table issues. [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=2092.36s)]
*  And it's like, well, you know, the other side gets a say in what you talk about. [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=2096.04s)]
*  And the Democrats have not figured out how to talk, get everybody talking about the things that they want to talk about. [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=2100.2000000000003s)]
*  And I think that is probably a much bigger issue. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=2109.1600000000003s)]
*  Although I do think, you know, I don't know that. [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=2111.92s)]
*  You know, I do think that some sort of specific. [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=2118.0800000000004s)]
*  You know, we are we are winning and we're making them mad at us. [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=2121.0s)]
*  And that feels good element of democratic politics is probably necessary as much as like, you know, [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=2126.68s)]
*  someone like me might consider that, you know, beneath the seriousness of politics. [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=2134.6s)]
*  But, you know, the reality is, as Trump has illustrated, is that the way Americans and people in general interact with [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=2139.24s)]
*  politics is not always through the sort of high amount of values that, you know, we like to that we like to talk about when it comes to democracy. [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=2148.28s)]
*  It's a growing thing that I'm starting to believe in. [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=2158.52s)]
*  I may be starting to believe it too much. [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=2160.7200000000003s)]
*  So I'm questioning my own view on this because there is no silver bullet. [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=2162.44s)]
*  But like, I do think people that are really into politics or really into policy or have some very defined perspective, [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=2166.6000000000004s)]
*  you know, like want to think like when you see this kind of discourse happening online, like it's like, well, it needs to be somebody that's more Bernie or it needs to be somebody that's more moderate or like people have very defined views. [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=2174.2s)]
*  And I was like in the next segment, we're going to have Justin Jones interview from last night from Tennessee. [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=2183.8s)]
*  And I was listening to him last night. We don't we agree on like nothing, basically. [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=2189.0s)]
*  But the dude has charisma, you know, and and passion and and juice, you know, and like the Democrats haven't had anybody that's had juice, really. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=2192.08s)]
*  Since Obama. And part of me just thinks that like, like reaching folks, you know, with that whatever sports team, you know, rallying cry energy is as much as more really about juice than it is even like the details. [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=2203.88s)]
*  Right. I mean, obviously, there's some things that they could believe that are that would be disqualifying within a Democratic coalition. [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=2221.48s)]
*  But like, I don't know, I think part of it to me feels like that's more of a key, more of the more of the political problem. [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=2227.3199999999997s)]
*  I think that's part of it. I mean, you know, when you look back to like Obama in 2012, where he sort of overperformed the polls with the same white voters, white working class voters in the Midwest that are hard to poll and that, you know, came out pretty substantially for Trump. [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=2236.04s)]
*  I mean, I think there is, you know, there's unquestionably a sort of juice question there. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=2252.24s)]
*  You know, I don't. I don't know who that might be, but I think it's probably correct that, you know, when people when they tried to do all this negative stuff on Obama, he had an ability of redirecting or responding in a way that was extraordinarily effective. [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=2259.04s)]
*  And they and I remember during that time how frustrated conservatives were that nothing seemed to stick with him. [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=2275.84s)]
*  They could never, you know, no matter what they said about him and how crazy it was, he always seemed to find a way out. [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=2283.0s)]
*  And I think, you know, that is definitely related to personal charisma. [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=2291.2000000000003s)]
*  People want wanted to like Obama. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=2295.32s)]
*  And I think the reality is a lot of people want to like Trump. [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=2297.8s)]
*  And so they will, you know, invent reasons to do so. [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=2301.32s)]
*  And I think you see this sort of in the gap between what the Trump people are actually doing and want to do and what Trump's a lot of Trump supporters thought he would do. [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=2305.56s)]
*  Like, you know, I went around to rallies and, you know, Trump was telling people he was going to get them their FEMA money that, you know, Biden and Harris were giving to illegal immigrants. [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=2315.32s)]
*  And now he's like blocking FEMA money for everybody. [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=2327.88s)]
*  You know what I mean? Like, there is a gap between what these people thought Trump was going to do and what he's actually doing. [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=2331.04s)]
*  Like, a lot of people say, you know, we need to get rid of the criminals. [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=2337.3199999999997s)]
*  He's going to focus on the criminals. Why do you think, you know, why do you think it's racist? [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=2339.72s)]
*  Like, you're being crazy. There is a gap between Trumpists and Trump. [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=2343.3999999999996s)]
*  You know, there's a reason why he disavowed Project 2025 during the election and is basically implementing it now. [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=2348.9199999999996s)]
*  You know, but people but those people still want to like him. [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=2356.36s)]
*  They still want to be Trump fans in the same way that a lot of Obama voters probably didn't agree with him on everything, probably thought he was a little too liberal, but they wanted to like him. [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=2360.2000000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=2369.36s)]
*  All right. I want to ask you one more thing. I want to figure out one other topic, which you've written on and you've already been talking about in the pod and written a lot about, you know, kind of racial identity and how that intersects with politics. [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=2371.36s)]
*  I'm just it's kind of interesting in this moment that you see a lot of white folks actually being the ones that are moving left. [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=2382.92s)]
*  I think this New York mayor's race where the left is Canada. [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=2388.92s)]
*  There's a poll I saw yesterday is he's he's doing well. [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=2391.2400000000002s)]
*  He's winning white voters. [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=2394.28s)]
*  Zoran, while Andrew Cuomo is crushing him with black and brown voters, you kind of look at the cross tabs from the election as they come out. [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=2396.0800000000004s)]
*  Kamala basically held serve among suburban white people and lost ground, like a ton of ground with Hispanic men, less, but a little bit of ground with black men, Asian men. [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=2404.2s)]
*  Like, what do you just what do you make of all that? [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=2415.2799999999997s)]
*  Is there anything we can take from those trends? [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=2418.24s)]
*  I think it's interesting, you know, because it feels like it's downstream of at least somewhat of education polarization. [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=2421.2799999999997s)]
*  At some point, you sort of wonder when like actual policy views are going to intervene here, but it really does seem like we're floating on vibes in some ways. [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=2431.84s)]
*  So, you know, if if Cuomo is somebody who is well known, has high name recognition, is like known as a prominent Democrat, was sort of got this reputation for standing up to Trump during covid. [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=2443.5600000000004s)]
*  And I think people who the people who are opposing him tend to be people who are much more dialed into the day to day politics stuff. [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=2459.68s)]
*  And so it doesn't it somewhat doesn't surprise me that there is that divide as far as like the Democratic coalition is concerned. [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=2469.8799999999997s)]
*  You don't think it's like crime. [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=2479.72s)]
*  I don't think there's any policy element to it as a crime, immigration, social. [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=2480.64s)]
*  Well, I think I think it's interesting because, you know, black voters in particular tend to have more progressive economic views and more conservative views on immigration. [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=2485.2799999999997s)]
*  But I don't know that, you know, the mayor's race is turning on those particular issues. [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=2495.56s)]
*  It may be a question of we don't know who this guy is, but we know who Cuomo is. [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=2503.16s)]
*  We know he stood up to Trump, et cetera, et cetera. [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=2507.0s)]
*  And, you know, we are in the midst of, I think, a very, you know, I don't talk about this much in the piece, but I do think we're in the midst of a kind of gender related backlash. [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=2510.52s)]
*  You know, where things that got people in trouble, you know, when they did terrible things to women back in the day, you know, that was a career ender. [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=2522.0s)]
*  And I think we're in the midst of a backlash where there's a lot of people who do not want that to be a career ender. [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=2533.2400000000002s)]
*  And so, you know, there are people who probably should be unacceptable, who I would consider unfit for public office, who are nonetheless, you know, getting a second chance. [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=2538.28s)]
*  In part because of this backlash against what people what some people feel like is over sensitivity to sexism. [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=2553.1600000000003s)]
*  And I think they're wrong. [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=2560.96s)]
*  But that doesn't mean that that, you know, a lot of the electorate agrees with me. [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=2562.88s)]
*  All right, brother. You got anything else? [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=2570.4s)]
*  Anything I didn't ask you about you want to pop off on? [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=2571.6400000000003s)]
*  Nope, not really. [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=2574.52s)]
*  Thank you so much for having me on. [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=2575.8s)]
*  And, you know, we'll talk next time. [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=2578.6400000000003s)]
*  Man, I really appreciate it. [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=2580.36s)]
*  We'll have you back soon. [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=2581.32s)]
*  Hey, guys, it's Tim and Sarah. [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=2582.32s)]
*  We're here with my friend of me, John Lovett from Love It or Leave It. [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=2583.76s)]
*  June is Pride Month and we're going to be live in D.C. [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=2586.36s)]
*  On June 6th for World Pride for a very special live show fundraiser featuring the three of us, plus some gay special guests. [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9FYg4mC6E&t=2589.92s)]
*  Crooked and the Bullwork will be donating the proceeds from this fundraiser to the Immigrant Defenders Law Center to support André Romero, the makeup artist who the Trump administration wrongly disappeared to El Salvador and he was currently being held in Sikant.
