Video Description: Trump keeps wrapping himself in the American flag while behaving in a very anti-American way—like threatening to shut down protests at his $45 million birthday parade or giving a highly partisan speech in front of soldiers in violation of military policy. And as the haphazardly deployed Marines join federalized Guard troops in LA, Trump seems hellbent on escalating his feud with Gavin Newsom—and the giant blue state that rejects him. Plus, Putin looks to gain an advantage in Ukraine while America is distracted, and Tulsi may have disclosed state secrets to the entire world. Gen. Mark Hertling joins Tim Miller.

# Trump’s Sickening Fort Bragg Speech (w/ Mark Hertling)
**The Bulwark Podcast:** [June 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4)
*  These were generals that did not cover themselves with glory. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=0.0s)]
*  And in fact, they were some of the most incompetent Confederate generals, [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=3.2800000000000002s)]
*  but they happen to be good in the eyes of their citizens enough to [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=6.48s)]
*  posture them as the namesakes of some of these. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=10.24s)]
*  Do you have a theory for why that might be? [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=12.88s)]
*  I know. I have no... [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=15.76s)]
*  I've got one. Racism. I'm very upset about the Mexican flag, right? Because at these protests [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=18.56s)]
*  is the claim because, you know, you got to represent America. But at the same time, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=24.080000000000002s)]
*  we want to take the people that were traders to America, put their names back on our military [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=27.759999999999998s)]
*  installations. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=32.0s)]
*  Hello and welcome to the Bulldog podcast. I'm your host, Tim Miller. Delighted to welcome back, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=40.24s)]
*  retired Lieutenant General. He's a former commanding general of the US Army of Europe. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=44.0s)]
*  It's Mark Hartling. How you doing, sir? [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=49.28s)]
*  Hey, good, Tim. How are you? [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=50.96s)]
*  I'm doing well. Appreciate you coming on today, kind of on short notice. I got to tell you, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=53.04s)]
*  I was pretty shook by President Trump's speech yesterday at Fort Bragg. Obviously, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=58.400000000000006s)]
*  there have been actual policies that I've found more appalling since he's been in. But just as a [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=67.36s)]
*  scene, it might've been the most dispiriting scene, I think, for me since the inauguration. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=73.84s)]
*  He's speaking in front of a bunch of soldiers commemorating the 250th anniversary. I try not [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=78.72s)]
*  to do clips of him for people because, you know, everybody needs a break. They can watch him on [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=85.2s)]
*  the news if they want. But I'm more interested in the reaction than in Trump's words. So if you don't [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=89.03999999999999s)]
*  mind, I've got a little highlight, low light reel, if you will, from the speech. I want to play and [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=94.16s)]
*  get your reaction to it. I do the boos. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=99.28s)]
*  Fake news, ladies and gentlemen. Look at them. Look at them all. Oh, what I have to put up with. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=101.2s)]
*  Fake news. What I have to put up with. You think this crowd would have showed up for Biden? I [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=106.96s)]
*  don't think so. I don't think so. I don't think so. Maybe I'm wrong. Maybe I'm wrong. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=115.52s)]
*  In Los Angeles, the governor of California and the mayor of Los Angeles, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=122.96s)]
*  they're incompetent. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=133.51999999999998s)]
*  Yes, active duty military. They're booing fake news. Former commander in chief, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=135.44s)]
*  Gavin Newsom. What did you make of that? [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=140.64s)]
*  Yeah, it was, you said you were shook by it. I was too. I was also embarrassed. But I'll lead [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=142.64s)]
*  in by saying, you know, the military, especially the army draws from all elements of the population. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=149.83999999999997s)]
*  So it is not a surprise that there are some soldiers who support different parties. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=156.56s)]
*  A lot of soldiers maybe in this audience appeared to have supported Trump. The backstory, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=164.64s)]
*  though, that I'm receiving from some folks in the military, and I'm not sure any of this is true, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=171.76s)]
*  but there was a couple of chain of command. I don't want to say orders, but they were, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=177.28s)]
*  hey, if you support this guy and you want to, you know, stand behind him, you can do that. Just make [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=186.07999999999998s)]
*  sure that you look good, that you're in shape. You've got your beret on. And so there and don't [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=191.2s)]
*  embarrass yourself. And if you're not a support and if you're not a supporter, then you don't even [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=198.48s)]
*  have to go to the speech. So this was not something that was ordered to the entire either 18th Airborne [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=206.32s)]
*  Corps or 82nd Airborne Division. But you can understand that, you know, a lot of people jumped [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=213.28s)]
*  at the chance because a lot of young soldiers are enamored by their president no matter what party [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=218.48s)]
*  they're in. But what really stunned me, and I think this is what stunned you, was the reaction [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=223.92s)]
*  to some of the things that were actually contrary to our constitution, you know, insulting the press, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=230.16s)]
*  insulting other politicians. It became a political speech. It became a rally. It was a rally speech. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=236.23999999999998s)]
*  It didn't become one. It probably started off as a rally. And there's a significant number of rules [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=242.24s)]
*  and regulations and policies that tell soldiers when you're wearing the uniform, you must remain [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=249.04s)]
*  apolitical. You can't support another party in either an election or a campaign or in current [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=256.0s)]
*  political issues. So these were a bunch of young soldiers. And I scanned the audience when I was [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=263.52s)]
*  watching it, and it seemed like a bunch of very young soldiers without probably a whole lot of [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=270.08s)]
*  leadership, either sergeants or officers in the crowd with them. And they got caught up in the [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=276.15999999999997s)]
*  rally environment and almost kind of a mob-like reaction. So yeah, it was very disappointing. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=282.32s)]
*  And what I'll tell you, Tim, is I sure would hope there's a bunch of commanders and senior leaders [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=291.36s)]
*  right now telling their soldiers about the policies, reminding them again what they should [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=297.28s)]
*  and should not do at political rallies in terms of supporting candidates, but especially candidates [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=303.59999999999997s)]
*  that seem to run contrary to some of the things that our constitution requires. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=310.08s)]
*  Tim Cynova Yeah, I mean, look, I've been 20 before and got caught up in a mob-like environment, [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=315.11999999999995s)]
*  jeering at people that maybe I look back at and shouldn't have done, right? So I understand that. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=320.71999999999997s)]
*  Even still, it's in the military, everybody's in uniform. And like you said, hopefully, [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=326.08000000000004s)]
*  there are some commanders or military leadership that would have, that maybe would provide some [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=332.72s)]
*  feedback afterwards. But are we sure that? Is that happening? Is there evidence of that happening? [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=339.28000000000003s)]
*  Tom Nichols is in the Atlantic this morning saying folks should speak out as far as military [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=344.56s)]
*  leadership is concerned. Maybe that's too much to wish for. I don't know. But what do you think? [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=350.8s)]
*  In the conversations you have with ex-military and all that, what do you think the conversations [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=359.12s)]
*  are like? Tim Cynova Yeah, I think there's going to be a reaction by the military today. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=362.96000000000004s)]
*  And I always look at it from what would I do if, when I do military analysis for different people, [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=367.76s)]
*  I try and look at the enemy's point of view, the friendly point of view, and what I would do as a [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=374.88s)]
*  commander. If I had been still in command of either US Army Europe, First Armored Division, [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=379.12s)]
*  a brigade or a squadron or even a company with 100 people in it, if I had seen that, I think the [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=386.32s)]
*  very first thing I would do at morning PT formation is go in and talk to the soldiers that I was [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=394.24s)]
*  leading and say, hey, this isn't what we are. This is not who we are proposing to be. This is not the [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=401.04s)]
*  culture of the military. We don't jeer the press. We work with the press even though sometimes we [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=410.0s)]
*  don't like them and they get under our cross sometimes. We work with them because by the way, [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=418.16s)]
*  the military, the army specifically and the press are the two institutions that are named by name [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=423.84000000000003s)]
*  in the Constitution of the United States. So those are two things you don't counter and you [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=429.76s)]
*  don't cheer for one political party or person over another. When people make fun of other people, [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=435.44s)]
*  I mean, one of our army values is respect. We have respect. We should have respect for all people. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=442.88s)]
*  And so when you're jeering the press or you're jeering Governor Newscombe, as Mr. Trump called [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=450.4s)]
*  them or anything else, that's just not appropriate in the military culture. And I think soldiers have [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=455.52s)]
*  to be reminded of that. Yeah. I do think it will be interesting to see how that shakes out. I hope [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=461.03999999999996s)]
*  that's happening. Obviously, the worries are, at some level, the scene was like where did you use [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=467.44s)]
*  embarrassing and it felt like not particularly American. And so that is what gives you kind of [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=474.0s)]
*  a natural negative physical reaction to it. But the worry, obviously, is the kind of worst case [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=479.28s)]
*  scenario elements of all this that folks in the military just start to get used to this. And we're [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=487.52s)]
*  about to get into LA next, but across a series of different ways, they start to undermine what the [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=492.71999999999997s)]
*  traditional role had been. And you start to see the military doing more partisan stuff on behalf [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=501.91999999999996s)]
*  of an increasingly emboldened wannabe autocrat. I mean, that's the thing that I think worried me [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=508.64s)]
*  watching that is like, man, I see a lot of people that I think would go along with a lot of stuff [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=514.56s)]
*  right now that isn't great. Yeah. I think we see the president openly trying to create chaos in [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=519.1999999999999s)]
*  different institutions, and especially the institutions that held during his first [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=527.36s)]
*  administration, the legal system, the rule of law, the courts, the military. Those are the ones, [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=533.76s)]
*  I think, present the biggest potential for a crisis. And I see last night truly as kind of that [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=540.2399999999999s)]
*  opening of a door to a potential crisis, especially given the other things that are going on. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=550.88s)]
*  The context of last night at Fort Bragg was really pretty interesting, talking about [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=557.6s)]
*  the parade this weekend, what's going on in Los Angeles, what's potentially going on in other [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=565.4399999999999s)]
*  places, the reduction of arms to Ukraine, the announcement made by Secretary Hegseth. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=572.24s)]
*  Those are the things all coming together that really show an upheaval of not only our policies, [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=579.6s)]
*  but also our foreign policy. Yeah. I want to get into all those things. One more thing from the [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=587.2s)]
*  speech, in the words of Rick Sanchez from Rick and Morty, your booze mean nothing because I've [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=592.24s)]
*  seen what makes you cheer. It wasn't just what they booed that was concerning. There was some [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=597.44s)]
*  cheers following the announcement that we're going to rename some of these military installations [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=602.96s)]
*  or go back to the Confederate names. I was going to play that clip really quick. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=610.64s)]
*  I think it took them a little by surprise, but for a little breaking news, we are also going to be [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=615.36s)]
*  restoring the names to Fort Pickett, Fort Hood, Fort Gordon, Fort Rucker, Fort Polk, Fort AP, [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=622.96s)]
*  Hill and Fort Robert E. Lee. Yeah. Well, you know, it's interesting because every one of those that [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=632.96s)]
*  he named were a Confederate general. The posts were named after the Department of Defense. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=645.52s)]
*  Secretary Hegseth is trying to get around that by saying, well, it's not the real Lee that we're [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=651.12s)]
*  naming it after. We're not really naming it after Robert E. Lee. We're naming it after Fitz Lee, [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=656.32s)]
*  who I think was actually a relative of Robert E. Lee, who died in another war and received an award. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=661.2s)]
*  But you know, I'm sorry. Yeah. A lot of the relatives of Robert E. Lee who fought for the [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=668.32s)]
*  union, by the way, I was seeing some stuff with some chatter on social media about how, well, [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=674.32s)]
*  how can you blame Robert E. Lee? We got to go back to him. He was defending his family. It's like, [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=678.72s)]
*  actually, that's not true. People should listen to the Behind the Basterds about Robert E. Lee. It's [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=682.96s)]
*  a really excellent podcast. His family was split, actually. That's not quite right. So there are [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=686.88s)]
*  some Lee's that were on the union side we could name things after, for sure. Right. And the other [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=693.12s)]
*  post, A. P. Hill, Bragg, I mean, these were generals that did not cover themselves with glory. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=698.8s)]
*  And in fact, they were some of the most incompetent Confederate generals. Not only did they act as a [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=706.0s)]
*  traitor to the country by disavowing their oath, but they also were not all that good on the [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=711.84s)]
*  battlefield. But they happen to be good in the eyes of their citizens enough to posture them as [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=716.72s)]
*  the namesakes of some of these posts. Do you have a theory for why that might be? [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=722.24s)]
*  I know. I have no theory. Okay. I've got one. Racism. They like the Confederacy. It's [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=726.88s)]
*  Confederacy nostalgia. I'm very upset about the Mexican flag, right? Because at these protests is [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=733.36s)]
*  the claim because you've got to represent America. But at the same time, we want to take the people [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=738.88s)]
*  that were traitors to America and put their names back on our military. Well, if you don't like the [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=743.52s)]
*  Mexican flag, you'd probably like the Confederate flag even more or less or whatever. But yeah, [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=749.52s)]
*  it's nonsensical. It's just appealing to emotion. It's the proverbial red meat. And I hate to use [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=756.64s)]
*  that phrase, but it seems to override any logic or pragmatism that when you look at the evidence, [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=763.2s)]
*  you say, oh, okay, that's why these posts shouldn't be named that way. Or that's why the Marines [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=772.4000000000001s)]
*  shouldn't deploy. Or that's why, yeah, I mean, you could go down the entire list if you actually [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=777.9200000000001s)]
*  analyze it and apply facts and rationale, you'll get a whole different solution. But it doesn't [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=782.8000000000001s)]
*  seem to be that's in the equation. It's all about emotions and opinions and rabidness, I guess. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=789.0400000000001s)]
*  Yeah. And it's all about sticking your finger in the eye of the other guys, right? I mean, [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=796.24s)]
*  Hank Seth does this, you know, we're not going to be woke, we're not going to be political correct, [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=800.08s)]
*  politically correct. And it's about that, right? It's like, we know this will make our political [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=804.5600000000001s)]
*  enemies unhappy, you know, that it will be a troll on them to rename this, these, you know, whatever, [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=809.9200000000001s)]
*  and rename a fort after some loser, traitor general. And that's why they're doing it. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=816.4s)]
*  Okay, I want to talk about Los Angeles. So some stuff has happened since yesterday. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=822.0s)]
*  We do now have hundreds of Marines, they're hitting the streets of LA today. We learned a [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=830.24s)]
*  little bit more about what the National Guard troops were doing. Maybe you can explain this, [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=835.92s)]
*  Adam Kinzinger texted me and said that's not, they are National Guard troops, but technically, [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=841.4399999999999s)]
*  they're kind of federal troops because of the nature of how they've been brought into, [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=845.44s)]
*  you know, service, so to speak, here in Los Angeles. But anyway, we saw the type of [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=850.24s)]
*  protection they're providing, we have reporting that they're providing perimeter protection for [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=855.84s)]
*  ICE raids. So it's not even anti riot. Anyway, what do you make of what we know so far about what [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=860.0s)]
*  the use of military in Southern California? Well, I'll talk about the control of them first. I mean, [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=866.8000000000001s)]
*  any state's National Guard belongs to the governor of that state. And he or she can use the guard [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=872.7199999999999s)]
*  in ways that contribute to law and order or security within the state, or for humanitarian [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=880.0s)]
*  crisis. That's something called Title 32. And when the president says, hey, I need the National Guard [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=887.8399999999999s)]
*  for something else, like, I mean, all during the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, multiple National [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=896.32s)]
*  Guard units were mobilized under Title 10, and reinforce the active duty military. But that's with [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=903.5200000000001s)]
*  the coordination and the collaboration of the government of the state, particularly the governor. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=910.8000000000001s)]
*  So the president would go to the governor and say, hey, look, I need, you know, the division out of [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=915.9200000000001s)]
*  California to reinforce one of the active divisions in Iraq. Can you mobilize them under [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=920.8s)]
*  Title 10? And we can federalize them and have them go just like active troops. And they do that. And [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=927.4399999999999s)]
*  they're great. I mean, they are terrific. They normally do logistics functions, but there are [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=933.68s)]
*  some combat arms forces. Okay, so when you disregard the role of the governor in controlling his [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=938.8s)]
*  National Guard, then that's a major party fall. You should always be coordinating with the guard [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=946.72s)]
*  for their state's militia, if you will. So that's the first thing that stuck in the craw of Governor [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=954.4s)]
*  Newsom, that he was not asked if these could be federalized. It just came as an order from the [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=960.32s)]
*  Department of Defense. So very little coordination. And what you have to consider is these guard [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=965.84s)]
*  soldiers are not sitting around in a barrack somewhere or, you know, in the motor pool of some [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=971.5200000000001s)]
*  tank park. They're working jobs as real estate agents and dental assistants and anything you [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=977.6800000000001s)]
*  can name. And they are pulled away from those jobs. So it's a huge disruption, not just for [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=983.0400000000001s)]
*  the individual soldier who has to then report to his unit for deployment, but it's a disruption of [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=988.96s)]
*  the workplace that they have to leave. Add to that the fact that the California Guard specifically [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=994.08s)]
*  does some wonderful things, not only in firefighting and, and, you know, wildfires and all the things [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=1000.48s)]
*  that they do, but they're also part of something called a state partnership program, which no one [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=1008.0s)]
*  really knows about. So every single state has a partnership with some other country. Coincidentally, [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=1012.32s)]
*  over the last 10 years, California's National Guard has had a partnership with Ukraine. So they [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=1018.72s)]
*  have been inside of Ukraine multiple times with small forces training the Ukrainian Army prior to [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=1024.48s)]
*  the war breaking out. I used to work with the California Guard. They're a great, when I was in [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=1030.8s)]
*  U.S. Army Europe, they're a great organization. They've got some great leaders and the, and the [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=1035.44s)]
*  Ukrainians stand by them a hundred percent. So you can see just by that description, the churn you're [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=1039.6s)]
*  going to get of disrupting normal missions and taking people away from their jobs and how employers [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=1045.68s)]
*  feel about this. You know, if you've got a person working for you who's a guardsman and every couple [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=1052.8s)]
*  weeks they're saying, Hey, I just got notified. I got to go somewhere. Well, if you're an employer, [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=1058.48s)]
*  you're going to lose that person for a month or two months. And in this case, from what I understand, [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=1062.6399999999999s)]
*  the deployment order is two months long, 60 days, even though they haven't been really given a [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=1067.12s)]
*  mission other than support for civilian authorities. And that's a very amorphous kind of mission set [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=1071.9199999999998s)]
*  where you're asked to do anything you can. So that's the background. Well, I think that's [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=1080.16s)]
*  interesting context in particular for the other element of what I brought up, right? That we're [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=1084.64s)]
*  learning yesterday. It's like we're, you're disrupting the lives of these guardsmen. You're [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=1087.8400000000001s)]
*  disrupting the businesses they work at. You're disrupting, you know, you're doing all that. To [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=1093.92s)]
*  what end? Right. And the end here- Basically you're taking them away from their family as well. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=1097.6000000000001s)]
*  Yeah. So there's a lot of- To be the muscle for a deportation force. And that's really what this is. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=1103.0400000000002s)]
*  It'd be one thing to say, okay, these riots are out of control and we need more manpower. Now, [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=1109.84s)]
*  obviously you would want to coordinate with the governor on that. And this has happened many times [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=1114.6399999999999s)]
*  throughout history where the governor and president have coordinated on such a thing. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=1118.6399999999999s)]
*  That's what they kind of said it was, but what it turns out it actually is, is that they're taking [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=1123.4399999999998s)]
*  these guys to go to raid businesses where they're unarmed immigrants. There are videos yesterday of [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=1127.04s)]
*  ICE agents, you know, kind of detaining unarmed immigrants with these guardsmen kind of standing [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=1136.56s)]
*  around with their weapons, just, you know, whatever, protecting the space. That feels to me to be insane. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=1142.56s)]
*  With no coordination beforehand for things like lodging and food and, hey, that's up to the guard. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=1149.84s)]
*  Or in this case, once it transfers from the guard to the federal authority, then they fall under an [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=1155.12s)]
*  entirely different command structure. So every national guard has the adjutant general, which is [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=1161.28s)]
*  a two-star general. And as soon as they're mobilized, that two-star general is no longer [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=1167.36s)]
*  the authority. They are put under the control of U.S. Northern Command, a federal active component [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=1172.24s)]
*  organization. So there's that, you know, whole kabuki dance. The one other thing I would say [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=1178.8799999999999s)]
*  about the guardsmen that I didn't mention, Tim, and it's important. A lot of soldiers, [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=1185.28s)]
*  a lot of guardsmen are single parents. So when they're deployed for 30 days or 60 days at a time, [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=1190.8s)]
*  where do their kids go? When you're a guardsman, you have to have a family support plan where you [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=1198.56s)]
*  say, if I am deployed, if I am activated for service, here's where my child is going to go. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=1203.76s)]
*  It's either going to go with a grandparent or your ex-wife or whatever. So even that creates a whole [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=1209.6s)]
*  bunch of churn within the personal aspects of the guard. And then, especially when they're [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=1216.4s)]
*  mobilized by the feds to work against their fellow citizens, you've got the face-off of guardsmen who [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=1222.88s)]
*  may or may not believe in what's going on, facing off against civilians who are in most cases [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=1230.16s)]
*  peacefully protesting. So there's more dynamics to this than I think most Americans understand. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=1236.3200000000002s)]
*  Yeah. To me, it also just should, listening to you explain all that, my reaction is, [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=1243.44s)]
*  it really raises the bar for doing this. This is not a thing to do willy-nilly because you want a [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=1252.96s)]
*  Fox News segment. There's a lot of considerations at play. There's a lot of personal considerations. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=1258.96s)]
*  There's safety considerations. And there's no evidence at this point that this was necessary [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=1264.08s)]
*  for anything other than escalating the public feud between Trump and Newsom and blue states [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=1272.8799999999999s)]
*  and immigrants. Is there any rationale for doing it the way they've done it? [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=1282.24s)]
*  That's what you just described is sort of how I see it. But you and I are not on the ground [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=1288.6399999999999s)]
*  in California. So we're taking the word of Newsom versus Trump, Bass versus Trump. But I tend to [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=1294.72s)]
*  believe the person on the ground who's seeing what's happening, especially a person that has [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=1301.44s)]
*  a very large police force at their disposal. It was interesting. I heard somebody say the other day [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=1306.56s)]
*  that there are, with the 2000 plus 2000 plus 700 Marines, there are more National Guard and Marines [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=1313.68s)]
*  on the ground in California than we had at the very end of the stages in Afghanistan. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=1322.8s)]
*  So it's kind of an interesting comparison. But to your point, it really gets to [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=1328.24s)]
*  how do civilian leaders make decisions on using the military? It better be a considered, analyzed, [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=1335.68s)]
*  pragmatic way. And the ones who finally pull that trigger of saying, let's launch this force [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=1346.48s)]
*  really have to understand the implications of launching this force to what you to your point [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=1353.6s)]
*  of it shouldn't just be something to put on Fox News, because there's perceived craziness. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=1359.04s)]
*  Yeah, I think that's right. And look, you're right. We're not on the ground in LA. But, [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=1366.24s)]
*  you know, they're just and there certainly are like some sophisticated writers. And I was watching [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=1371.12s)]
*  some of the news last night and like some of these guys are, you know, you are obviously have [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=1377.52s)]
*  thought through the trouble making that they're trying to do. I guess just say that. So it's not [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=1383.12s)]
*  as if I mean, they're also a bunch of peaceful for like all this stuff is happening simultaneously, [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=1387.84s)]
*  right? So it's not as if there's no public safety threat. But I just think to what you're getting [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=1391.76s)]
*  at, like the thing that worries me, anything that worries a lot of people is just like, okay, well, [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=1397.84s)]
*  it doesn't like the Trump administration isn't even really making the case that they needed to [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=1403.84s)]
*  do this to support the public safety element of this only right and that like they were going to [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=1409.76s)]
*  do what was needed to work with, you know, any anybody in California that needs them, the LAPD [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=1415.04s)]
*  or whatever. Like that's not the case that they're making. Like there are cases that LA is out of [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=1419.36s)]
*  control and that they need to go in there and they need to be part of the mass deportation efforts. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=1424.8799999999999s)]
*  That's just a very different animal, I guess. And again, I'm going to go back to the mission set [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=1429.92s)]
*  because this is important too. When the guard is deployed, when active duty soldiers or Marines are [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=1435.3600000000001s)]
*  deployed, unless the insurrection act has been called, there's a limit on what they can do. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=1441.52s)]
*  There's a mission set called support for civil authorities. So what the guard does in those kind [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=1449.68s)]
*  of missions is they take on the administrative functions, the logistical functions of supporting [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=1455.2s)]
*  the frontline people who are doing the acts. So as Mike Barnicle said yesterday, our shared friend, [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=1461.44s)]
*  he said the one thing that the guard or the Marines can't do is say you're under arrest. They're not [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=1470.4s)]
*  authorized to do that. They can't touch people unless they're threatened. So when you're talking [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=1477.28s)]
*  about what the guard can do, they can put up barricades, they can put up fences, they can [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=1483.44s)]
*  stand around buildings to protect them. And in fact, the new mission set that you're talking [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=1490.88s)]
*  about is standing around or forming a cordon around ICE. They can actually do that too, [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=1496.64s)]
*  but it puts them in a position that they could be attacked by these protesters and then they have to [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=1502.48s)]
*  use force to extricate themselves. But they can't arrest the people that are using force or that [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=1508.16s)]
*  are protesting. I think there was a letter DHS was trying to ask Higgs for permission to let them do [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=1514.48s)]
*  that or whatever, which again takes you to a very concerning place. Well, that's where the whole [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=1521.3600000000001s)]
*  posse commentatitis, which few people understand comes into play. Because they explain it for folks. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=1526.0800000000002s)]
*  Well, it's a Latin term saying for the county. And it basically says that military forces, [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=1532.8799999999999s)]
*  unless it's an emergency or an insurrection, cannot use or do not have the power to police, [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=1539.84s)]
*  to do the acts of police people. And there's a very good reason for that. There's many good reasons [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=1547.9199999999998s)]
*  for it. The one is you're approaching fellow citizens and arresting them when you're supposed [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=1553.2s)]
*  to be defending them as the military. The second thing is most of these guardsmen on the street [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=1557.44s)]
*  have not been trained in police action. Unless you've got a military police battalion out on [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=1563.2s)]
*  the street, they're not going to know how to handcuff people. They're not going to know how [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=1569.8400000000001s)]
*  to treat people. They're not going to know how to read rights or any of those other kinds of things [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=1573.28s)]
*  that policemen do. They're infantry guys or in some cases cooks and bottle washers. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=1577.52s)]
*  That's the scary part of it. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=1582.72s)]
*  Y'all looking for some norm core summer basics that feel good and last look good? [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=1588.32s)]
*  I'd recommend going back to quince, just like I've been. Quince is all the things you actually want [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=1595.28s)]
*  to wear this summer. Organic cotton silk polos, European linen beach shorts, and comfortable pants [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=1598.8s)]
*  that work for everything from backyard hangs to nice dinners. The best part, everything with [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=1606.32s)]
*  quince is half the cost of similar brands. By working directly with top artisans and cutting [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=1611.44s)]
*  out the middleman, quince gives you luxury pieces without the markups. I've been very pleased with [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=1616.48s)]
*  the quince orders we've been getting. I got some new shorts. Needed some short shorts. It's tough [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=1624.8s)]
*  out there, I gotta tell you. For us short short wearers, the short shorts are out. We were shopping [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=1628.96s)]
*  in Nashville and I was complaining to the person at the hipster store that all the shorts were long [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=1636.96s)]
*  and he was like, yeah, the guys just, nobody buys short shorts anymore. Back in the day, [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=1642.64s)]
*  the games bought short shorts and there's a little kind of a Southern frat bro short short [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=1646.72s)]
*  energy as well. But these days, no. The youngs, the hipsters, straights, everybody wants long shorts. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=1652.16s)]
*  That's tough, but quince had some five inch inseamers. I got that. Got my little army green [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=1658.96s)]
*  jacket. I've been wearing a lot of quince gear. I like, you should check it out as well. Stick [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=1664.56s)]
*  to the staples that last with elevated essentials from quince. Go to quince.com slash the board for [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=1669.44s)]

*  on the folks on the ground there in LA, because there is some dialogue about this going on. I saw [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=1690.64s)]
*  a video of, she was dressed like an active duty troop. I guess I didn't check. She was in fatigues [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=1695.6000000000001s)]
*  talking about how her fellow soldiers should not obey unconstitutional orders and that do any sort [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=1702.4s)]
*  of the things that you're talking about, things that violate posicummatatus, things that violate [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=1709.92s)]
*  the constitutional rights of Americans when it comes to these immigration raids. They should not [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=1714.24s)]
*  be a part of Michael Wood, who we've had on here a few times, who's a veteran and who ran for Congress [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=1718.8s)]
*  posted, Marine soldiers, sailors, airmen, you're not some sort of Republican guard, [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=1728.8799999999999s)]
*  your loyalties to the constitution above all else. But on the other hand, I noticed you posted [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=1732.48s)]
*  a guy named Joseph Collins saying that he's concerned about the well-meaning people telling [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=1737.9199999999998s)]
*  these corporals and privates not to obey an unlawful order. It's more complex than it seems. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=1742.56s)]
*  Why don't you just talk about that choice that I don't think we're kind of, I don't know if we've [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=1749.28s)]
*  crossed the Rubicon to that yet, but man, we're a lot closer than we've been in a while. [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=1754.32s)]
*  David S. Lipsetter We are close. And I saw that clip too, or that tweet or whatever it was. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=1757.84s)]
*  And it was a very good point because there's an expression in the military called a barracks [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=1763.04s)]
*  lawyer. That's someone that lives in the barracks and makes decisions on what's right and wrong and [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=1768.72s)]
*  what's legal and not. And normally, most soldiers don't have law degrees. So they can't really tell [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=1773.04s)]
*  but within units, there are lawyers that advise commanders that say, here's what's legal and [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=1778.96s)]
*  here's what's not. Okay, here's the order I just got. What do you think? Well, that's an illegal [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=1785.04s)]
*  order. You should protest it with your superior. Individual soldiers should not do that because [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=1788.72s)]
*  they really don't know what is a legal or illegal order is. But if they have questions about it, [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=1796.56s)]
*  they should ask their commander and their chain of command. And even that gets a little tenuous [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=1802.6399999999999s)]
*  as well. David S. Lipsetter Yeah. I guess what is the chatter for you among fellow retireds? How [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=1807.36s)]
*  worried is everybody about this? What is the state of alarm about the use of military domestically [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=1816.7199999999998s)]
*  at this point? David S. Lipsetter Well, the chatter among the proverbial generals and admirals is, [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=1823.6799999999998s)]
*  it's a continuous debate on civil military relations. What do we do? What do we have the [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=1830.3999999999999s)]
*  authority to do other than what we're doing right now talking about the facts associated with the [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=1835.84s)]
*  issues? What we can't say is, we need to go arrest Trump. That's ridiculous. I mean, that [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=1840.72s)]
*  David S. Lipsetter I can do that. David S. Lipsetter [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=1846.3999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, you could do that. As a guy who represents the defense of America, I can't. What I can point [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=1848.0s)]
*  out are things that are happening within our republic that says, these don't seem to fit into [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=1854.8799999999999s)]
*  our constitution. And boy, you should remember that the next time you vote. But as long as you [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=1860.88s)]
*  voted, the American public have given this guy the plurality of the vote, the military is beholden to [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=1866.0800000000002s)]
*  obey his legal orders, number one. But then there's beyond the military debate going on, Tim. And this [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=1872.16s)]
*  is the interesting thing. I can't tell you the number of texts or tweets or blue skies that I get [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=1878.88s)]
*  on a daily basis saying, why aren't you guys doing something about this? And the question is, what [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=1884.24s)]
*  exactly do you want us to do? You're the one that elected them. I'm sorry. And I think somebody said [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=1890.08s)]
*  this after the last election, the generals aren't going to save you. That's not what we do. We defend [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=1894.72s)]
*  the country. So if you want a different leader, it's up to you to determine how to get that leader. [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=1900.8799999999999s)]
*  And usually it's associated with voting. Tim Cynova [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=1906.08s)]
*  Yeah. And yeah, some of that is just the gasp of frustration of people, like who is going to be [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=1908.3999999999999s)]
*  out there? And I get that. And part of it is, I don't know, again, I think we're closer to [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=1913.28s)]
*  this than we've been. I don't know. I certainly may back to the civil rights era, maybe more, [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=1921.52s)]
*  where these questions become real, which is like, what is my duty? Is my duty to just follow orders [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=1927.36s)]
*  blindly? Is my duty to the Constitution? If I'm going to be ordered to do something that is illegal [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=1935.2s)]
*  or that targets my fellow citizens, how do I process that? I don't know. If somebody called [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=1941.76s)]
*  you and was just like, what advice do you have for me on this? I'm in a pickle. What is the answer [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=1946.4s)]
*  right now? It seems to me- Tim Cynova [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=1952.72s)]
*  What I would tell you is I'm in that same kind of squishy ground, because I was thinking about it [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=1953.68s)]
*  the other day. During my 38-year military career, I worked under five Democratic presidents, and [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=1958.24s)]
*  I think it was either five or four Democratic presidents and six Republican presidents. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=1968.32s)]
*  And I never had these kind of thoughts before. That's the problem. And even in Tom Nichols' [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=1972.96s)]
*  column you mentioned the other day, he said, Randy George, the chief of staff of the Army, [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=1979.92s)]
*  should go in and whisper in the president's ear and say, you got to quit using troops as your [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=1984.88s)]
*  political props. That's easier written in the Atlantic than it is done by the chief of the Army, [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=1989.36s)]
*  especially with this president. That's the hard part. How do you get this guy to back off, [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=1995.04s)]
*  and how do you get Hegseth to back off from the kinds of things that they're doing? And I don't [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=2000.6399999999999s)]
*  know the answer to that. Tim Cynova [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=2005.44s)]
*  I think the last thing we talked about the military parade, which is coming up this weekend, [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=2008.1599999999999s)]
*  so I don't know how much more you have to say about that. One thing that happened yesterday [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=2011.44s)]
*  was Trump said that anybody who protests the military parade, quote, hate our country and [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=2015.6s)]
*  will be met with very heavy force. And that's alarming as well. I don't know. It could just be [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=2022.16s)]
*  Trump bluster. But again, this is the type of thing that's like, we are really on a precipice [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=2032.64s)]
*  here. And so I don't know, I'm wondering if you've kind of updated your thoughts on what we're going [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=2038.0s)]
*  to see Saturday since we last spoke. Tim Cynova [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=2042.96s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I said to some folks yesterday that I'm all for celebrating the soldiers who [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=2044.88s)]
*  have served in the Army or are currently serving in the Army for 250 years. It's a great milestone. [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=2054.6400000000003s)]
*  It was the Army was founded, was created and its birthday is a year older than our country. So [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=2059.92s)]
*  that's a pretty big deal. I've never, you know, other than required parades, like for changes [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=2066.48s)]
*  of command or, or Memorial Day parades where you go down the street, you honor different people. [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=2073.44s)]
*  I've never been truthfully a big parade guy. Even at West Point, I tried to avoid as many [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=2079.68s)]
*  parades as I could as a, as a athlete. But what if you do have a parade, it should be [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=2085.28s)]
*  honoring the soldiers that served on their birthday, or that are currently serving. [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=2095.52s)]
*  Part of the parade is doing that. But what we're seeing is it's turning into somewhat of a vanity [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=2101.28s)]
*  play for one individual. And they're making no bones about that. That's, that's the sad thing [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=2107.6800000000003s)]
*  about it. And when I say they, it's primarily the people in the White House and the Defense Department. [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=2113.52s)]
*  So I think what was initially planned as a celebration of soldiers, and the [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=2119.52s)]
*  anniversary of the Army has turned into something else. And with the remarks from yesterday about, [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=2126.64s)]
*  you know, very big actions against protesters, I mean, that's part of the Constitution too. [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=2133.7599999999998s)]
*  That's part of the First Amendment rights to protest, the right to protest and to speak freely. [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=2140.88s)]
*  So again, it's, it's, there's a contrary action being associated with a celebration. [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=2146.64s)]
*  If somebody wants to get out and stand along the side of the road that they're marching down and [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=2156.2400000000002s)]
*  say, we protest with signs, I'm okay with that. The same thing as the Americans said last night [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=2161.12s)]
*  in front of the troops that they cheered about people kneeling at football games when the [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=2166.88s)]
*  Star Spangled Banner is played. I'm okay with that too, to be honest with you. I don't like it, [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=2172.08s)]
*  but I'm okay with it because that's what we protect. We protect freedom of speech and expression. [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=2176.08s)]
*  So there's that conversation that I think is being overwhelmed by some of the bluster. [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=2181.2799999999997s)]
*  And that's what concerns me. [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=2188.48s)]
*  Yeah. So to find a point, it really is kind of [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=2190.16s)]
*  wrapping in the American flag, a lot of really anti-American sentiments, you know, [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=2196.0s)]
*  a lot of quasi authoritarian sentiments when it comes to breaking down protesters, [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=2201.36s)]
*  very partisan speeches in front of the military, going out right, anti-immigrant, like all this stuff [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=2206.48s)]
*  is this kind of jingoism without the underlying elements of what makes America special. And that [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=2212.48s)]
*  that is, I don't know, that's something that really, you know, I find dangerous. [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=2219.36s)]
*  Well, I think we've talked about this once before, but it gets back to American values. [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=2226.4s)]
*  And you have a lot of people say they are, you know, that I'm all for American values. [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=2231.84s)]
*  Okay, really, what are those values? What are they? Well, there's freedom of expression, [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=2236.48s)]
*  freedom of speech, respect for other individuals, liberty, life. And, you know, you go down all the [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=2240.4s)]
*  pluralism. Yeah, you go down the speeches of people like King and Kennedy and Roosevelt, [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=2246.2400000000002s)]
*  and you see what American values are. And there's oftentimes we're running contrary to what those [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=2253.92s)]
*  American values are, especially respect for one another and freedom of speech and freedom of [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=2260.96s)]
*  religion. Freedom from what? Those are the kind of things that have been outlined for us as part of [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=2266.16s)]
*  our history. And yet they're being ignored by just a simple statement of why I'm all for American [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=2273.2s)]
*  values. Okay, well, what are they? And are you really living by them? So there's a little bit [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=2279.52s)]
*  of hypocrisy there. Two more just topics really quick. Well, I guess related to Trump, but not [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=2283.68s)]
*  as directly. I had some friends sending me videos from Ukraine over the last few days. [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=2289.44s)]
*  There have been massive aerial attacks from Russia on Karheev, on Kiev. It's a little bit [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=2295.52s)]
*  out of the news because of all the other stuff that is happening. But, you know, that offensive [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=2302.96s)]
*  coming off of, you know, this period of Trump talking to Putin for an hour and a half and saying [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=2310.4s)]
*  that these are just like two guys fighting on the playground, you got to let them fight it out. [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=2315.68s)]
*  I mean, it seems like to me, again, as an outsider, that this is that we're in an escalating period [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=2319.92s)]
*  from Russia in response to the president's cowering. But I don't know what you make of [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=2327.36s)]
*  what you're seeing out of Ukraine and what you're hearing from folks. It's interesting. I think the [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=2333.44s)]
*  Russians continue to do what they've been doing for three years, but at a much greater rate. They [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=2338.4s)]
*  launched over 450 missiles and drones over the last couple of nights each night [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=2343.84s)]
*  against civilian targets, specifically civilian targets. So they're hitting infrastructure, [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=2350.88s)]
*  apartment buildings, hospitals, schools, churches. And this is in direct reaction to [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=2357.2000000000003s)]
*  Ukraine's action in the spider web operation that specifically targeted military aircraft [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=2364.96s)]
*  and military facilities. So you've got one side going after the military and the other side [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=2372.48s)]
*  continuing to try and affect the will of the Ukrainian people by killing people, by killing [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=2377.44s)]
*  civilians, contrary to the law, international law and the law of land warfare. And it is Putin, [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=2383.12s)]
*  I think, trying to gain an advantage of inserting, imparting his will against the people more [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=2390.7200000000003s)]
*  massively than he has over the last couple of years. And it's because we are ignoring it. [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=2397.04s)]
*  I think that's one of the reasons why Putin invaded in the first place, because he saw a [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=2403.52s)]
*  divided America and a divided NATO. Well, NATO has come together, America sort of came together [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=2408.48s)]
*  for a while, and now it's separating apart. So he's using that obfuscation as a way to continue [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=2414.32s)]
*  with his desires to occupy part or all of Ukraine, which is troubling. [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=2422.0s)]
*  Yeah. Kyiv Pride is this weekend, so I'd request that folks stay safe on that. That feels like [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=2427.2s)]
*  a lot of, I guess, a lot of dangerous targets these days. If you're in Ukraine, do you have any, [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=2434.56s)]
*  I think I asked you this last time, but three months, things are changing so quickly. We've [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=2441.36s)]
*  seen what happened with the offensive from Ukraine. Do you sense that without America, [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=2446.16s)]
*  this is a doable fight for Ukraine with the Europeans behind them? How do you assess their [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=2453.12s)]
*  capabilities without us? Yeah, I do. In fact, I was in Sweden two weeks ago talking to their [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=2459.04s)]
*  defense college, defense university, and there seems to be, my take is there's an uptick on what [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=2464.72s)]
*  the Europeans are trying to do to compensate for the loss of at least some of American support. [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=2473.36s)]
*  But at the same time, I also see Ukraine masterfully building drone factories and [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=2480.32s)]
*  ammunition factories and trying to keep up. But the biggest problem is they don't have the air [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=2486.2400000000002s)]
*  defense capability that they need, and there's only a few people, us included, that can provide [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=2492.1600000000003s)]
*  some of that. And that's what Secretary Hegs has evidently eliminated as of today. [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=2497.52s)]
*  Eliminated the air defense help? Yeah, the contributions of weapon systems to Ukraine. [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=2504.8s)]
*  Not sure that may be just internet rumor, but allegedly that's what he said he was going to do. [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=2510.24s)]
*  And he said it in the speech last night at Fort Bragg. Yeah, speaking of internet rumor, [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=2515.6s)]
*  I also have on decent authority that it's not going to be surprising that they're going to revoke, [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=2519.52s)]
*  I don't have the official name in front of me, but whatever the version of TPS was for Ukraine, [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=2526.08s)]
*  temporary protected status for Ukrainians who came to America. It isn't TPS, it was a different [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=2531.52s)]
*  program. But it sounds a lot of discussion in immigration circles that they're planning on [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=2536.4s)]
*  revoking that. Well, that goes in line with the revoking of the Afghan special visa holders as [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=2542.88s)]
*  well. Is there outrage about that in your circles, the Afghan special visa revocation? [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=2550.0s)]
*  Because I think a lot of the military folks who served in Afghanistan understand it, [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=2558.8s)]
*  what it's going to do. It's going to send people back to Afghanistan who were contributing to our [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=2562.96s)]
*  fight as interpreters or sisters in units. So yeah, there's outrage in the military community, [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=2568.4s)]
*  but it's underneath the wave tops of all the other crap that's going on. [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=2575.36s)]
*  Okay, last thing, I couldn't not ask you about Tulsi, our director of national intelligence, [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=2580.8s)]
*  while I had you. Two news items in the last 48 hours. Apparently, she fed the JFK files into [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=2586.2400000000002s)]
*  an AI to see what she thought should be declassified. She said that in a speech, [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=2592.7200000000003s)]
*  at some corporate function. She also put out this creepy video about how we're the closest [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=2598.1600000000003s)]
*  we've ever been to nuclear annihilation, which to me read as either some sort of [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=2603.28s)]
*  Russian propaganda type message that like, hey, we should back out of Ukraine. We don't want to [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=2610.7200000000003s)]
*  escalate towards nuclear war, or maybe kind of a golden dome type. I was trying to understand [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=2615.84s)]
*  what was behind this very weird video. Me and Sam Stein did a big breakdown of it, where she was [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=2623.0400000000004s)]
*  warning that we're close to nuclear annihilation. Well, I open ended on what you've seen from our [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=2628.8799999999997s)]
*  director of national intelligence. The latter one on the nuclear weapons is that that seems to be [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=2635.3599999999997s)]
*  a messaging of a Russian talking point, multiple talking points that they've made about using [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=2641.12s)]
*  nuclear weapons. And it continues to be a debate within the Russian government. The first one about [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=2648.3999999999996s)]
*  the AI, I heard that this morning. And it's just mind boggling to me that unless it's a secure AI [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=2653.6s)]
*  capability, she's given up secrets. I mean, I can insert things and chat GPT and say, consolidate [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=2659.92s)]
*  all my writings into this thing and give me a summary of all this, which is if what she did [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=2667.52s)]
*  was an open source AI platform, she's just provided it to the entire world. So [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=2672.64s)]
*  what the director of national intelligence, like also that job, she's so up front, like that, it [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=2681.12s)]
*  should be a secret. It should be a behind the scenes job. Right. I mean, talk to me about that. [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=2690.3999999999996s)]
*  You're in the military. Do you want the director of national intelligence out there? [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=2695.2799999999997s)]
*  And I was in the Pentagon as the J seven when the when the D and I was first created under [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=2699.7599999999998s)]
*  Rumsfeld. And it's interesting because that was supposed to be the first one. [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=2705.4399999999996s)]
*  Wasn't it cam bone? I'm not sure. I don't remember. But but the thing was created and it was supposed [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=2709.92s)]
*  to be the coordinator of all the intelligence agencies. Well, you would think that person would [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=2715.6800000000003s)]
*  be in a trench somewhere and no one would ever know the very fact that we don't even know who [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=2720.2400000000002s)]
*  it was. And I don't even know who the last couple of ones were. That was you that they're never seen. [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=2724.1600000000003s)]
*  But I'm seeing gathered all over the news recently, you know, with performative politics and what she [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=2728.48s)]
*  thinks should be happening. And it's not collaboration of intelligence is just her own personal beliefs. [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=2733.6800000000003s)]
*  All right. Anything I didn't ask you for any wisdom you want to leave us with? It was a pretty [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=2740.0s)]
*  it was a pretty bleak podcast today. General, you got me. Well, you know, the one thing that [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=2743.44s)]
*  I've kind of been hot on that that I don't think has garnered attention because it's it's so buried [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=2748.48s)]
*  and that's the deletion of CISA, the cyber network folks that are doing a great job and keeping us [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=2754.1600000000003s)]
*  safe. I think that, you know, it's not a military operation, but it certainly is connected than [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=2761.52s)]
*  military. And I think, you know, we've said that cyber warfare is a potential national threat for [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=2766.72s)]
*  the last 20 years. And now we've completely disbanded the agency that is supposed to be [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=2772.9599999999996s)]
*  protecting us. So that I think that's troublesome and should garner more attention. I'm glad you [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=2778.48s)]
*  mentioned that. And I think that I can it's hard to do you're doing Kremlin ology now with the [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=2784.08s)]
*  administration sometimes, but it could be just directly related to the 2020 stuff. Chris Krebs [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=2790.0s)]
*  was the person that was the point man on that that spoke that they were protecting our elections [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=2796.16s)]
*  from cyber attacks. They do other protection of us from cyber attacks. But that was one thing they [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=2800.96s)]
*  were doing that he was the point person on. And Trump got obviously mad at him for a lot for [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=2806.3199999999997s)]
*  for telling the truth about the election and is targeting him. And who the hell knows with Trump, [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=2811.12s)]
*  it might just be like now that word CISA he doesn't like anymore because because they were the people [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=2816.8799999999997s)]
*  that were saying the election was was not stolen in 2020. Right. The cleanest election we've ever [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=2821.6s)]
*  had. And so let's disband the people that helped make it that way. Yeah, so that's one area. But [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=2828.4s)]
*  Tim, there's so many others we could go on and on. But it's kind of an interesting national security [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=2836.48s)]
*  environment, isn't it? Not an uplifting close. But okay, that's okay. You know, that's just the world [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=2841.52s)]
*  we're in. Mark Kertling, please come back. We obviously have a lot of developments, [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=2846.64s)]
*  unfortunately, domestically and abroad related to the military. And so we appreciate your [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdKT9B2x5K4&t=2852.24s)]
