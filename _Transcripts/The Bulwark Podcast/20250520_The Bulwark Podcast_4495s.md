Video Description: One day Trump sounds like Bernie promising the government will provide for everything. Then the next, he's like Paul Ryan the belt-tightener prepping for austerity. And Code Pink was the order of the day when Mr. Tough Guy was in Saudi Arabia—attacking the foreign policy of the United States in the land of the 9/11 hijackers. Plus, Trump's SCOTUS appointees show some spine, Marco is truly pathetic, the big, insane reconciliation bill would gut Medicaid and hurt MAGA voters even if Trump denies it, and the DOJ investigates the hiring practices of Chicago's mayor. David French joins Tim Miller.

# Little Marco Goes FULL MAGA! (w/ David French) | Bulwark Podcast
**The Bulwark Podcast:** [May 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA)
*  Yeah, I don't think you can look at these Supreme Court cases in isolation any longer. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=0.0s)]
*  I think what you're looking at right now is an emerging understanding with the Supreme [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=6.38s)]
*  Court, well, I would say seven members of the Supreme Court, that this administration [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=10.74s)]
*  cannot be trusted. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=15.56s)]
*  Hello, and welcome to the Bulwark Podcast. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=17.6s)]
*  I'm your host, Tim Miller. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=26.3s)]
*  We're back with one of our faves and opinion columnist for the New York Times, also cohost [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=28.24s)]
*  of the legal podcast, Advisory Opinions. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=32.04s)]
*  It's David French. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=34.6s)]
*  What's up, man? [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=35.6s)]
*  Tim, it's always so good to see you. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=36.599999999999994s)]
*  It's good to see you too. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=38.68s)]
*  I noticed you're not posting as much anymore. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=40.68s)]
*  I just a little, you know, kind of behind the curtain here. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=43.2s)]
*  I like to prep for the guests by just diving, you know, diving deep into the recent posts. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=45.4s)]
*  But you're, are you like cleansing your social media life? [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=51.44s)]
*  Or is it just, you know, the grandbabies or what's happening? [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=56.16s)]
*  No, we're in the process of kind of moving up to Chicago for my oldest daughter is starting [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=59.36s)]
*  law school and she's got two little, our two little grandbabies, four and two, and we're [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=66.9s)]
*  going to be helping with the grandbabies while my oldest daughter is in law school. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=71.56s)]
*  And so yeah, Tim, let me just say this. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=75.56s)]
*  I have a recommend and I have a do not recommend. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=79.6s)]
*  Okay. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=82.6s)]
*  Okay. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=83.6s)]
*  Grandbabies. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=84.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=85.64s)]
*  Do not recommend moving. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=86.64s)]
*  However, however, grandchildren are the, the good reason to go ahead and upend your life. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=88.64s)]
*  So, so we're in the middle of that. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=95.72s)]
*  Okay. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=97.75999999999999s)]
*  So it's not part of Pritzker 2028. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=98.75999999999999s)]
*  You're not, you haven't gotten full native. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=100.96s)]
*  No, no. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=102.96s)]
*  I do notice we have a live event in Chicago, so maybe I'll see you. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=105.39999999999999s)]
*  It's next week, May 28th. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=108.67999999999999s)]
*  It's sold out, but I don't know if you, if you DM me and you're really special, we might [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=110.03999999999999s)]
*  figure something out, but we'll be there on May 28th. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=114.08s)]
*  And I've got, I had some backlash when I made a joke about the Chicago weather on a couple [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=117.24000000000001s)]
*  of podcasts ago, some listener backlash, and I'm just pulling up the seven day right now. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=124.28s)]
*  It's 55. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=130.52s)]
*  It's 55. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=131.52s)]
*  It's fucking May 20th. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=132.52s)]
*  Who would want to live there? [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=133.52s)]
*  So I'm sorry. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=135.4s)]
*  I do not apologize for my views on this. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=136.4s)]
*  It's 55. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=138.44s)]
*  Today's the high. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=139.44s)]
*  That's not acceptable. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=140.72s)]
*  How are you going to tolerate that? [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=141.72s)]
*  Tim, it's a great summer city and it's not summer yet. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=143.23999999999998s)]
*  So, you know, you just, you just got to give Chicago a pass until like it's officially [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=146.48s)]
*  summer. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=152.95999999999998s)]
*  And then it's just a tremendous place to be. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=153.95999999999998s)]
*  It's summer in New Orleans already. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=156.0s)]
*  All right. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=157.64s)]
*  We've got a bunch to talk about. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=158.64s)]
*  Obviously want to do legal stuff with you since you're not posting. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=159.64s)]
*  I was listening to advisory opinions recently, so I have some follow up questions from you [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=163.84s)]
*  on your recent, on your recent podcast. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=167.56s)]
*  I guess the most recent case of relevance is the alien enemies case was seven to two [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=169.92s)]
*  ruling essentially that the Venezuelans overwhelmingly Venezuelans that we have disappeared to a [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=176.2s)]
*  foreign prison camp had due process rights. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=184.12s)]
*  What I guess I'm curious what you think that means for, you know, the Venezuelans themselves [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=188.32s)]
*  who are like trying to organize as a class now and whether they're going to have relief [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=194.44s)]
*  the ones that have already been sent and then also just what you thought about the result [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=198.28s)]
*  there seven to two ruling. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=203.2s)]
*  Yeah, I don't think you can look at these Supreme Court cases in isolation any longer. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=205.39999999999998s)]
*  I think what you're looking at right now is an emerging understanding with the Supreme [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=212.0s)]
*  Court. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=216.39999999999998s)]
*  Well, I would say seven members of the Supreme Court that this administration cannot be trusted. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=217.39999999999998s)]
*  And the reason why I say that is because you've had now twice the court intervening [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=222.79999999999998s)]
*  in the Alien Enemies Act context very quickly, very quickly, in very unusual ways. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=227.84s)]
*  And so this is where the dissent, you know, maybe if you squint has a point because the [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=235.72s)]
*  court really is intervening in these cases at just record speed. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=241.8s)]
*  It's remarkable. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=246.68s)]
*  People who follow the Supreme Court who don't follow the Supreme Court closely really have [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=248.04s)]
*  no idea how unusual all this is that these cases are hitting this fast. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=252.2s)]
*  So it's intervening very, very quickly. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=256.22s)]
*  It's intervening in a way that is increasingly decisive. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=258.96000000000004s)]
*  So you had more vague language like facilitate return, for example, or you had, you know, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=262.94000000000005s)]
*  more vague language like due process notice and an opportunity to be heard before removal. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=271.62s)]
*  And now it's getting to be like, no, no, no, you're not doing it correctly. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=277.38000000000005s)]
*  This notice you're giving is not notice enough. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=282.62s)]
*  And the one other thing which also links, we also had the birthright citizenship oral [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=287.06s)]
*  argument, and it was very telling. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=291.3s)]
*  There was a very telling moment when Amy Coney Barrett asked the Trump administration about [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=293.65999999999997s)]
*  would it comply with rulings? [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=299.14s)]
*  Would it respect precedent? [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=301.3s)]
*  And the Trump administration said generally it was talking about precedent coming out [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=302.84s)]
*  of the circuits. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=306.82s)]
*  And I believe their quote was generally, yes, in general. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=307.82s)]
*  In general, it's not the right answer. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=313.34s)]
*  The answer is only yes, we will respect precedent. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=315.06s)]
*  So you could see, I mean, you could hear the irritation in Amy Coney Barrett's voice in [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=318.66s)]
*  that moment. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=325.1s)]
*  So I think you're seeing an increasingly impatient and skeptical Supreme Court. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=326.1s)]
*  Yeah, I want to get back to the Venezuelans in particular, but just really quick on the [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=330.34000000000003s)]
*  court breakdown. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=335.38s)]
*  It is notable that it's the two Bush appointees, each separate Bush, HW and W appointees that [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=336.62s)]
*  are out on their own on this and the three Trump appointees that have been rebuking him. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=344.34000000000003s)]
*  I don't know if there's a psychological examination. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=349.74s)]
*  I don't know if there's like Foxbrain. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=352.82000000000005s)]
*  I don't know what we can attribute to this. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=354.5s)]
*  It's just random or if there's any regrets from Trump about his first term choices. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=356.42s)]
*  What do you make of that breakdown? [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=363.14000000000004s)]
*  You know, I think Trump has been pretty mild in his criticism by his standards. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=365.58000000000004s)]
*  I mean, he has some tweeted out or truth out some pretty deranged stuff about the Supreme [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=371.14s)]
*  Court in general. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=375.86s)]
*  And he did say that he wanted to release terrorists at the Chevy Chase Club, which I believe John [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=376.86s)]
*  Roberts and Brett Kavanaugh are members of. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=382.34s)]
*  So, you know, not exactly mild for him. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=384.26s)]
*  I guess that's the way to put it. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=387.82s)]
*  By his standards, right, which is obscene for everybody else, but by his standards. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=389.9s)]
*  And I'm talking about the very specific aimed at his justices that he appointed. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=395.46s)]
*  You haven't seen that as much. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=402.34s)]
*  However, MAGA is over some of these guys, especially MAGA is over Amy Coney Barrett. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=404.62s)]
*  And so, but the problem here, Tim, is if you followed these people closely over the years, [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=411.97999999999996s)]
*  if you've if you've known about Amy Coney Barrett or Brett Kavanaugh or Neil Gorsuch [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=418.29999999999995s)]
*  before Trump, you would know that it would be surprising if they just fell in line behind [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=423.42s)]
*  him. That that would be the surprise because they had records and they had their own independent [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=429.46s)]
*  existences and philosophies before Trump came along. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=435.5s)]
*  And they're in a very different position from a Mike Johnson or a John Thune. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=439.18s)]
*  They don't have to worry about primaries. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=443.7s)]
*  They don't have that pressure hovering over them. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=445.38s)]
*  So what do they have to face? [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=448.18s)]
*  Twitter shame storms? [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=449.86s)]
*  You know, they do have threats for sure, but they have security. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=451.34000000000003s)]
*  And I'm not so sure that threatening them is productive. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=455.82s)]
*  I'm not so sure that threatening them is going to give you the results that you want. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=459.7s)]
*  And so these are people who are independent. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=463.94s)]
*  They have their own record of accomplishment. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=466.66s)]
*  They have their own, you know, they have their own dignity and they don't have to face primary [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=468.34000000000003s)]
*  voters. And historically, the more you push them and the more you threaten them, the more [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=473.3s)]
*  resistant they become. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=477.66s)]
*  Yeah, a couple of thoughts on that. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=479.42s)]
*  I mean, all three of them had pretty strong records on on abortion related issues on Roe [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=480.62s)]
*  and all that, which I think maybe, you know, so just the kind of shock of that, but the [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=485.7s)]
*  overturning of Roe to folks on the left, like led maybe to a misinterpretation of the of [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=490.02s)]
*  the three. Right. Because that was like one case where they just were very that was one [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=495.38s)]
*  topic where they're going to be very misaligned from liberal and progressive people. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=499.5s)]
*  So that and so maybe there's like a projection that they will be that misaligned across the [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=503.58s)]
*  board and everything else. So it's one one theory. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=508.22s)]
*  The case I have is as I'm doing a social analysis of this, the other and some listeners [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=510.34000000000003s)]
*  are going to get mad about this, maybe the wives, I don't know, Clarence Thomas and Samuel [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=514.34s)]
*  Alito have some pretty radical wives when it comes to their political philosophy. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=520.66s)]
*  I don't know if you can get into this on advisory opinions, but you're welcome to in the [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=527.34s)]
*  bulwark. But that might be my other explanation for the for the breakup of the of the majority [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=530.82s)]
*  there. There's there seems to be very little question. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=536.58s)]
*  Well, certainly, Jenny Thomas, certainly heavily radicalized. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=539.7s)]
*  Yeah, you know, she was actively an active participant in the coup. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=544.86s)]
*  Yeah, I don't think we have to dive into the psychology of their marriages to know that [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=550.1s)]
*  definitely when it comes to Thomas and often Alito, they are in a different category in [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=556.1s)]
*  approaching these cases than the other seven. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=561.94s)]
*  And and I honestly wonder and here's what I do wonder. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=565.5s)]
*  I do wonder if Thomas and Alito are still willing to give the administration sort of the [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=569.34s)]
*  traditional benefit of the doubt in some ways, this presumption of regular order that we've [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=576.0200000000001s)]
*  talked about on advisory opinions has been sort of been kind of a part of the approach to [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=580.46s)]
*  the Department of Justice from the judiciary. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=585.7s)]
*  The Department of Justice has been seen as a respectable player in the legal, you know, [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=587.8199999999999s)]
*  has been seen as sort of a standard setting, not just respectable, but standard setting [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=593.42s)]
*  player in the legal system. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=598.26s)]
*  And so there's been this kind of you talk to defense attorneys and they can go on at [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=599.9s)]
*  length about there's just too much deference to the Department of Justice. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=603.5s)]
*  And I think that you still have some of that coming from Thomas and Alito. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=608.18s)]
*  And I don't think you see it from the other seven. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=612.38s)]
*  OK. Well, I hope it's deference to the Department of Justice. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=614.66s)]
*  I kind of think they want a mega autocracy. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=619.14s)]
*  But, you know, since there's only two of them, that's kind of splitting hairs, I guess, at [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=622.5s)]
*  this point, just really going back to the Alien Enemies Act cases, because one more [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=626.06s)]
*  thing, we have a fundraiser and live show with our friends at Crooked in Washington, [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=630.86s)]
*  D.C., June 6, raising money for some of the legal defenses of some of the people that [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=635.6999999999999s)]
*  have been sent to El Salvador. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=639.02s)]
*  So people haven't signed up for that. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=640.5799999999999s)]
*  You should go to the website and check that out. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=641.98s)]
*  If you happen to be in D.C., June 6, want to come hang out. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=644.34s)]
*  But, you know, like there have been some developments, which I mentioned at the start [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=646.7800000000001s)]
*  about how, you know, like the other I don't even know what you would call them as a [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=652.02s)]
*  class. I was about to say the deportees have been deported, disappeared, feels a [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=657.9s)]
*  little dramatic, but that's really closer to what it is that they are trying to organize [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=662.1s)]
*  as a class to get, you know, kind of relief as a class. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=667.7s)]
*  And there have been various different kind of rulings on that at the lower courts. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=670.74s)]
*  I just I wonder what you think the hope for for relief might be for those that have [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=674.26s)]
*  already been sent. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=679.74s)]
*  Well, I think there's a lot more hope now even than there was a week ago on two counts. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=681.46s)]
*  And they're related to something I said earlier. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=687.98s)]
*  Count number one is just the most recent case, which says we mean due process. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=689.74s)]
*  We mean it. OK, so it's not 24 hours notice. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=694.74s)]
*  It's not 12 hours notice. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=698.9s)]
*  That doesn't satisfy it. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=700.3s)]
*  You have to have an actual process here. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=701.26s)]
*  So that's number one. And then number two, you had the birthright citizenship oral argument, [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=703.66s)]
*  which I think was going down the road might be more important than people realize, [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=708.26s)]
*  because everyone sort of focused on the merits of birthright citizenship. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=714.62s)]
*  Like, does this thing actually is this thing actually legal? [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=717.86s)]
*  And if you think that Trump's birthright citizenship, EO is legal, you had no comfort [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=721.98s)]
*  from the court in that oral argument. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=728.22s)]
*  It was if you listen to the oral argument, it was almost presumed that it was an illegal [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=729.7s)]
*  executive order. But what they were really wrestling with was this concept of the nationwide [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=735.7800000000001s)]
*  or the universal injunction. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=740.82s)]
*  And it became pretty clear that at least a significant part of the court says way one [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=742.6600000000001s)]
*  way through this rather than sort of having the these grab bag injunctions and not injunctions [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=747.82s)]
*  from district to district would be to organize class level relief. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=753.74s)]
*  And so it was very clear to me that the court was encouraging this, that it was encouraging [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=758.4599999999999s)]
*  going down the route of class certification. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=763.3399999999999s)]
*  And so when you have that kind of encouragement from the Supreme Court, I think you're going [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=766.5799999999999s)]
*  to see that radiate down to the lower courts. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=770.14s)]
*  And you could have classes of potential deportees under the Alien Enemies Act and then seek [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=772.18s)]
*  relief on that basis. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=777.6199999999999s)]
*  Fingers crossed. Do you and it seems like you're on the birthright citizenship thing, [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=780.5s)]
*  you seem that it feels like you think that SCOTUS is going to rule against the administration [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=785.42s)]
*  on that. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=789.0999999999999s)]
*  Well, OK, so this is a weird case because what was actually up before the court and [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=790.14s)]
*  what they actually spent 95 percent of their time talking about was the whole concept of [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=795.14s)]
*  the universal injunction or the nationwide injunction. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=799.86s)]
*  So it was really an argument about the injunction power much more than it was an argument [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=803.18s)]
*  about birthright citizenship. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=808.6999999999999s)]
*  It was this weird argument, Tim, because it was almost like everyone was saying, OK, [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=810.02s)]
*  we know this birthright citizenship order is total hot, steaming garbage. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=815.42s)]
*  Everybody knows this. What's the right way to strike it down? [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=819.9s)]
*  That that was sort of the whole tone of the argument. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=822.86s)]
*  So you could very well end up with a kind of headline out of the ruling out of the [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=825.54s)]
*  Supreme Court that something like Trump wins victory. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=830.06s)]
*  But it would only be a victory in the sense that this nationwide injunction concept is [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=833.42s)]
*  pulled back some. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=839.26s)]
*  That's not really a Trump victory. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=841.06s)]
*  That's more of a limitation on the judicial branch. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=842.8199999999999s)]
*  But then what you'll also have is alternatives to the nationwide injunction, such as [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=845.8199999999999s)]
*  class actions. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=850.4599999999999s)]
*  And then that's where Trump's he's just not going to win on birthright citizenship. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=852.02s)]
*  There was just no hope. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=855.66s)]
*  There wasn't a glimmer of hope on birthright citizenship for the Trump administration [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=858.38s)]
*  that leaked out of that oral argument. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=862.62s)]
*  Not a glimmer. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=864.42s)]
*  Got it. And and so what about the side of it about the injunctions? [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=866.26s)]
*  How do you think that? [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=869.5s)]
*  So I think on the injunction point, they may well say, OK, nationwide [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=870.5s)]
*  injunctions are pulled back to some extent. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=876.94s)]
*  Yeah. But I'm fine with that, Tim. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=879.78s)]
*  I'm I'm fine with that. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=881.98s)]
*  This is something that has been a problem for across multiple administrations. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=883.22s)]
*  This is not just a Trump thing. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=888.94s)]
*  And what happens for for reader or listeners who who not really followed this closely [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=890.42s)]
*  is, let's suppose a president enacts a policy that you don't like. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=896.3s)]
*  Well, a state attorneys general or other plaintiffs will then go and find [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=899.86s)]
*  the local court that they believe will be most favorable to them. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=905.38s)]
*  In other words, it's called forum shopping. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=909.5s)]
*  So they go if you're more progressive, you go to the northern district of California. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=911.3000000000001s)]
*  If you're conservative, there's this one judge in Amarillo, Texas, I believe, [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=915.9000000000001s)]
*  who is like the favorite judge of conservatives who are looking for nationwide [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=923.58s)]
*  injunctions. And so they go running to these handpicked judges to get these [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=927.62s)]
*  national orders. And that's not really how the system is supposed to work. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=932.34s)]
*  The system is supposed to provide relief. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=937.82s)]
*  But think of it like this, Tim, you could go to eight eight district courts. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=940.58s)]
*  You could lose seven out of eight. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=944.46s)]
*  But if you can just find one that would agree with you, then you can get that [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=946.22s)]
*  nationwide injunction, at least for a time. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=950.02s)]
*  So I think this practice does need to be pulled back. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=952.46s)]
*  But there also has to be an avenue for people to get relief. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=955.74s)]
*  And that's where this class action concept comes in. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=959.22s)]
*  And man, we're we're getting in some legal weeds here. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=961.4599999999999s)]
*  That's great. This is good. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=964.5s)]
*  I like to, you know, a little bit of both. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=965.78s)]
*  I like to do both here. You know, we can get dirty. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=967.5799999999999s)]
*  We can get legal and then, you know, we can do pop kissing, you know, kind of [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=970.18s)]
*  content another day and just like straight Trump derangement syndrome the next day. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=975.1s)]
*  You know, you got to keep people on their toes. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=979.3s)]
*  The what else is speaking of nerdy? [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=981.42s)]
*  What else we got coming on the court? [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=984.18s)]
*  Anything else? I just as far as like what you're most interested in as far as the [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=986.42s)]
*  sessions. Yeah. Well, you know, we've been having kind of two tracks and it's a [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=990.4599999999999s)]
*  symbol. It's an interesting symbol about how our politics is changing. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=994.1s)]
*  Yeah. All of the heat right now at the Supreme Court and all of the attention on [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=998.3s)]
*  the Supreme Court is on the Trump administration litigation cases. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=1002.3s)]
*  So you've got a lot more heat about birthright citizenship or alien enemies act [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=1006.18s)]
*  than you do about like the traditional culture war cases that are also coming up [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=1010.54s)]
*  to the court. So you have a case, for example, on Texas's law restricting age, [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=1015.3399999999999s)]
*  age gating access to pornography. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=1021.14s)]
*  That's in some world, in some universes, that would be one of the biggest cases [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=1024.78s)]
*  of the term. Or you've got Tennessee's restriction on medical interventions for [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=1029.42s)]
*  gender affirming care. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=1035.02s)]
*  And two, three years ago, that would be the number one case on everyone's mind. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=1036.78s)]
*  And it's fascinating to me as the Republican Party is becoming something very [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=1041.82s)]
*  different, like Bernie economics with like. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=1049.34s)]
*  We're going to get into the foreign policy side of things here in a minute to as [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=1054.82s)]
*  listed into Marco sounded like Cindy Sheehan yesterday at an event at the White [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=1057.58s)]
*  House. So, you know, we'll get to that in a second. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=1061.82s)]
*  Yeah, it's like Bernie's economics and code pinks, foreign power. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=1064.42s)]
*  I mean, you know, what is even happening here? [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=1067.5s)]
*  And so that means that a lot of the culture war issues that very much coded [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=1070.22s)]
*  Republican versus Democrat are very much where the things that were getting people [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=1075.82s)]
*  out of bed in the morning to go post on Twitter are receding in importance to the [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=1079.42s)]
*  sort of more fundamental structural issues of American democracy, such as, you [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=1084.7s)]
*  know, these minor questions of how long can we keep our republic or will the [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=1089.5s)]
*  global international order that has kept great power peace since 1945 collapse in [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=1094.86s)]
*  front of our eyes because we killed it like those things are very much more in [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=1100.34s)]
*  people's minds than the culture war stuff, which though important compared to [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=1105.82s)]
*  those kinds of issues feels more or less like a historical blip by comparison to [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=1110.86s)]
*  trends that might be talked about in 100 years. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=1117.6200000000001s)]
*  One more thing you just teased me on advisory opinions when I was listening this [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=1122.74s)]
*  morning and said you're very excited to talk about Barnes versus Felix. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=1125.98s)]
*  And I was like, I don't even know what Barnes versus Felix is. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=1128.9s)]
*  So now I'm going to make you do it on this podcast first. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=1130.8600000000001s)]
*  So it's a spoiler for advisory opinions listeners. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=1133.3000000000002s)]
*  Tim, Tim, Tim, this case is something else. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=1136.46s)]
*  So this goes, this is a police violence case. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=1138.66s)]
*  It's a police shooting case. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=1141.42s)]
*  And it involves a situation. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=1143.2600000000002s)]
*  It's a horrible. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=1144.7800000000002s)]
*  It, this is awful, but a police officer pulls over a car for unpaid tolls. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=1146.1000000000001s)]
*  Okay. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=1152.7800000000002s)]
*  Turn turns out that it was a rental car and the person driving it wasn't even [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=1153.1000000000001s)]
*  the person who refused to pay the toll. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=1157.74s)]
*  So they've just rented a car. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=1160.18s)]
*  They're driving. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=1161.8600000000001s)]
*  They don't know why they're getting pulled over. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=1162.8200000000002s)]
*  They didn't do anything wrong. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=1165.18s)]
*  There wasn't, they didn't fail to pay the toll, but then things get really weird. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=1166.5800000000002s)]
*  So the cop comes up there's at the beginning of normal exchange, but it [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=1171.54s)]
*  kind of gets a little weird. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=1176.58s)]
*  And at one point the police officer says, can you get out of the car? [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=1177.78s)]
*  The driver turns the car on. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=1181.38s)]
*  The police officer starts to say he had turned the ignition off. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=1184.26s)]
*  Then he turns ignition on. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=1186.98s)]
*  The police officer starts to warn him, tries to demand that he [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=1188.06s)]
*  get off, get, uh, get out of the car. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=1191.14s)]
*  The driver inexplicably. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=1194.34s)]
*  Starts to drive away. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=1197.42s)]
*  Nobody knows why he starts to drive away. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=1199.34s)]
*  The police officer inexplicably jumps on the moving car and in the space, which [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=1201.38s)]
*  is again, that's inexplicable. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=1208.98s)]
*  A human being does not stop a moving car by jumping on the side of it. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=1210.98s)]
*  Okay. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=1214.7800000000002s)]
*  So he jumps on the side of the moving car, which then puts him in mortal danger. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=1215.7800000000002s)]
*  There's just no question. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=1221.2600000000002s)]
*  If you're hanging on to the side of a car as it's driving, that you [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=1222.38s)]
*  are in total mortal danger. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=1226.1000000000001s)]
*  So he pulls out his gun and he shoots and he kills the driver. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=1228.2600000000002s)]
*  And so the family of the deceased driver sues the officer because he was saying, [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=1231.5800000000002s)]
*  they were saying, look, this is totally unnecessary. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=1238.3400000000001s)]
*  The shooting was totally unnecessary. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=1241.6200000000001s)]
*  You created the danger by jumping on the car that you then resolved by killing it. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=1243.6200000000001s)]
*  But, and so the fifth circuit had said, no, no, you don't ask the question. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=1250.5800000000002s)]
*  Why did he jump on the car? [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=1256.18s)]
*  You don't go, you don't look at anything other than the immediate moment of the [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=1258.74s)]
*  threat. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=1262.58s)]
*  And if at that immediate moment, the police officer was felt like reasonably felt [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=1263.6200000000001s)]
*  like his life was in danger, he can pull the trigger. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=1268.42s)]
*  And so the issue was at the Supreme court, do you look at the totality of the [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=1270.78s)]
*  circumstances that led up to the shooting? [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=1274.74s)]
*  Or do you only look at the immediate moment at the threat? [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=1277.1s)]
*  And, and Tim, I know like America isn't being torn apart right now by these [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=1280.5s)]
*  police violence cases, but this is a critically important case. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=1285.46s)]
*  I mean, those are the driver's block. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=1288.5s)]
*  I just, just for the context. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=1289.78s)]
*  Yes. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=1291.38s)]
*  Yes. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=1291.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=1291.98s)]
*  And, and so the, um, and so the Supreme court ruled that the, uh, the Supreme [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=1292.94s)]
*  court ruled that you have to look at the totality of the circumstances and send [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=1299.98s)]
*  it back. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=1303.1000000000001s)]
*  Interesting. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=1303.42s)]
*  So it was a very good ruling. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=1303.82s)]
*  Pardon? [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=1307.18s)]
*  Supreme court sided with the deceased. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=1307.9s)]
*  The Supreme court sided with the driver. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=1310.22s)]
*  Yes. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=1311.7s)]
*  Yes. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=1312.14s)]
*  So the Supreme court sided with the motorist and sent it back down for more [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=1312.42s)]
*  proceedings, but it was a very good and important, it's one of these background [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=1316.78s)]
*  cases that's more important than people realize, because one of the problems we [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=1321.7s)]
*  have, and you and I both know this is this just total lack of trust and [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=1326.7s)]
*  institutions, just this collapsing trust. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=1330.74s)]
*  Well, one of the ways you destroy trust is by insulating institutions from [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=1333.98s)]
*  accountability and these kinds of doc, some of these doctrines that have [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=1337.46s)]
*  protected police have insulated law enforcement from accountability and [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=1342.02s)]
*  degraded trust. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=1346.02s)]
*  And this is a good, this is a step towards accountability. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=1346.94s)]
*  I'm glad I asked about that. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=1350.02s)]
*  Good news. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=1351.18s)]
*  Good news. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=1352.42s)]
*  I was, as you were telling me the whole story, I was listening to it and just, [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=1352.74s)]
*  you know, as I'm, you know, as my, my nature is always to expect the worst [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=1355.3799999999999s)]
*  happening and like prepare for it. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=1360.1s)]
*  I'm listening to you tell the story and I'm like, Oh God, they're going to [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=1361.66s)]
*  side with the murder, with the murdering cop. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=1363.98s)]
*  And so it's, you know, so that's nice. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=1365.86s)]
*  That's part of also the problem, why we don't have trust because these stories [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=1368.42s)]
*  don't end up in the front page, right? [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=1372.3s)]
*  Like where the inverse would, you know, right. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=1373.98s)]
*  I don't know how to fix that problem. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=1376.66s)]
*  It's like a, it's like a fundamental problem about that media and what [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=1378.22s)]
*  kind of stuff people consume. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=1383.06s)]
*  Um, anyway, the, um, you know, when there's craziness going on in the world, [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=1384.3s)]
*  nothing brings me peace of mind, like talking to David French, uh, and hope [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=1392.5800000000002s)]
*  that that brings you a little solace as well, but, uh, you know, there are other [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=1397.98s)]

*  What do you make of the reconciliation bill they're trying to jam through on the [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=1541.02s)]
*  Hill right now? [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=1545.54s)]
*  I borderline insane, Bill. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=1547.06s)]
*  I mean, if, if we're in a, we just remember Tim came out of a period of inflation in [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=1550.58s)]
*  the early years of the Biden term that, you know, you don't want to overuse this [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=1557.2199999999998s)]
*  word, but it absolutely like sort of had a, especially amongst poor middle-class [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=1562.6599999999999s)]
*  working-class families had a traumatic effect where you're talking about people [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=1568.3799999999999s)]
*  living paycheck to paycheck, whose paychecks are spent purchasing less and less. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=1572.78s)]
*  And so in the overhang from that inflation and the, the, the long-term [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=1576.82s)]
*  consequences of that inflation or chief reason why Kamala Harris isn't president [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=1581.86s)]
*  of the United States. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=1585.8999999999999s)]
*  And so you would think that this sort of notion that we can spend, spend, spend, [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=1586.6599999999999s)]
*  run up deficits at astronomical levels, that that would be old think. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=1592.02s)]
*  In other words, you, we've now realized that all these kinds of folks who said [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=1597.22s)]
*  deficits don't matter, that public spending can is sort of this thing that you can [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=1601.5400000000002s)]
*  just turn on the spigot and you solve recessions and do all of these amazing [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=1605.38s)]
*  things, that's over, that should be over. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=1610.8600000000001s)]
*  But you have this. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=1613.94s)]
*  Oh, it's not, I got, I got some messages from some MMT people in the past couple [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=1615.26s)]
*  of weeks about my, about my deficit, all gushed. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=1619.0600000000002s)]
*  I didn't, I didn't understand there's things I'm missing about the inflationary [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=1621.6200000000001s)]
*  period of the last past few years. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=1626.26s)]
*  Oh, yeah, it's, it should be over, but apparently it's not. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=1628.62s)]
*  And this time it's coming through the Republicans, not through turning on the [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=1632.34s)]
*  spigot and spending giant, giant, giant sums of new money. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=1636.5s)]
*  They are doing that to some extent by also by starving the government of [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=1639.54s)]
*  revenue, by the continuing tax cuts without any kind of systemic fiscal reform at all. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=1643.34s)]
*  And if, if, um, your listeners don't follow Jessica Riedel of the Manhattan [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=1651.74s)]
*  Institute, they, they really need to, on Twitter, um, Jessica's probably, I mean, [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=1657.3s)]
*  this is a person who is consistently asked to come to the Hill for the kind [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=1663.46s)]
*  of closed door briefings where members get their straight scoop or off the [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=1668.58s)]
*  record briefings where members get the straight scoop. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=1672.7s)]
*  Um, but Jessica's work has been invaluable and just sort of showing this [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=1675.54s)]
*  sheer scale that this just the incredible scale of our fiscal problem and how this [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=1679.42s)]
*  bill is going to make everything worse. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=1685.18s)]
*  I mean, people forget that the deficit went up under Trump every year, even [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=1688.3400000000001s)]
*  during peace and prosperity before COVID, the deficit was increasing every year. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=1694.5800000000002s)]
*  And even though, oh yeah. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=1699.8600000000001s)]
*  Even though Doge has made all these headlines about cutting, cutting, cutting, [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=1703.1000000000001s)]
*  you know, by some measures, the Trump administration is already outspending [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=1707.06s)]
*  the pace of the Biden administration. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=1711.78s)]
*  And then you add on the big, beautiful bill and you're going to have, I mean, [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=1713.86s)]
*  it's just where everybody knows who, everybody knows that we can't keep doing [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=1717.5s)]
*  this and yet we keep doing this and doing it worse and worse and the big, beautiful [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=1724.06s)]
*  bill is just going to make things worse. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=1727.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=1731.14s)]
*  I mean, the, the combination of like doing, you know, if you bring the Doge into it [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=1731.5s)]
*  and like some of the Medicaid cuts and the snap cuts, I get really ads, how insane it [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=1738.02s)]
*  is. It's just like there, there is, there are these ostensible efforts, you know, [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=1741.46s)]
*  that have this kind of veneer of fiscal responsibility on them that are like really [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=1747.86s)]
*  just totally hackish and causing pain, not, not fixing anything structurally, like [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=1753.02s)]
*  just going to cause pain to either government workers, some of whom who didn't [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=1758.7s)]
*  deserve it. Most of whom didn't deserve it really. Or poor, you know, poor Americans [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=1762.8200000000002s)]
*  with regards to snap or Medicaid. And, and you're doing that and pairing it with [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=1768.18s)]
*  something that is like going to add six trillion onto the already increased [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=1773.6200000000001s)]
*  deficit. So that's not like the total deficit number. Like the total deficit [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=1780.02s)]
*  number is like 16 trillion. We're on a path of adding 10, you know, a trillion a [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=1782.78s)]
*  year over the next 10 years. We're just dumping six on top of that with this bill [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=1787.42s)]
*  and then adding the cuts, you know, just as like a little, you know, just a little [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=1792.1000000000001s)]
*  cherry on top for people. We're gonna, we're gonna make some cuts to people's snap [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=1798.1000000000001s)]
*  programs. And the whole thing is, the whole thing is preposterous. And it's, and [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=1801.18s)]
*  it's like, you can see the kind of pain in the Chip Roys of the world as they try to [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=1804.94s)]
*  talk about it. And it's just, you know, I, you know, there's not really, there's no [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=1809.02s)]
*  real rationale for it. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=1815.22s)]
*  Right. And, you know, this is part of this Trump instinct on one at one moment, he [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=1817.9s)]
*  wants to give everything away to anybody who asks to win over love and adoration [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=1823.18s)]
*  and approval. So he's not going to ask in some ways, it's some days he's not [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=1829.54s)]
*  gonna ask any of his constituents to pay any more money. He's not going to make [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=1835.38s)]
*  any painful cuts except to people he doesn't care about, which, you know, a [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=1840.34s)]
*  lot of people in the Met and the Medicaid world are saying, no, no, no, [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=1844.9s)]
*  these are a lot of your voters. These are a lot of your voters. Why are you doing [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=1847.7800000000002s)]
*  this? And but so he, so one day he's promising the world. And then the another [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=1851.3400000000001s)]
*  day he's when he's talking about tariffs and trade, he's like, get ready for the [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=1856.38s)]
*  austerity and the difficulty. And so it's just back and forth. It's like a possessed [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=1860.26s)]
*  Bernie one day, and then it swings to possessed Paul Ryan the next day. And [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=1865.98s)]
*  that's just no way to run an economy. [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=1870.8200000000002s)]
*  No, it's kind of the worst of both worlds. Really, you know, it's like the [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=1873.14s)]
*  worst part of both of the ideological, you know, I mean, there's something to be [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=1877.5s)]
*  said for both Paul Ryanism and Bernieism. He's like, I'm going to take the worst [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=1881.46s)]
*  elements of both and we're going to combine it into, you know, one big [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=1885.22s)]
*  irresponsible piece of policy that makes [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=1889.34s)]
*  it's like that bizarro world Superman, bizarro world, you know, so this is [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=1891.26s)]
*  bizarro world, Bernie, bizarro world, Paul Ryan, but we don't know Monday, it's [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=1895.58s)]
*  Bernie Day, Tuesday, it's Ryan Day, who knows? [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=1899.74s)]
*  Let's move to foreign policy. There was a two hour call, apparently, with [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=1904.6200000000001s)]
*  Vladimir Putin yesterday between Trump and Putin. What came out of that call was [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=1909.26s)]
*  basically nothing. No ceasefire, a promise to talk more promised to talk [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=1915.54s)]
*  from Putin while he continues bombing Ukraine. He, he described it as we have [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=1920.9s)]
*  the principles of settlement, the terms of a possible conclusion of the peace [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=1929.06s)]
*  agreement. Kasparov, Gary Kasparov, you know, Russian dissident and chess [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=1934.22s)]
*  genius wrote, when a war criminal when a war criminal dictator talks about the [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=1942.02s)]
*  terms of a possible conclusion of the peace agreement for the war he started [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=1947.34s)]
*  and chooses to continue every day to kill more innocents, he's telling you he [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=1951.02s)]
*  thinks you're an idiot while he stalls. And that's about right. It feels about [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=1954.4199999999998s)]
*  right to me. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=1958.66s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, why would Putin come to the table? I mean, now, there are a lot of [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=1959.9s)]
*  reasons why a reasonable ruler would come to the table here. I mean, he's his [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=1965.3000000000002s)]
*  military suffered catastrophic losses, young men of his country being bled dry. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=1970.18s)]
*  But [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=1976.26s)]
*  Trump's offering a totally irrational, like type of deal that you really aren't [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=1977.0600000000002s)]
*  going to get with another US president who is not in your pocket, right? He's [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=1981.98s)]
*  like, totally, you know, we will welcome you back into that world of nations [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=1985.98s)]
*  economically, diplomatically. So, you know, I mean, that would, I guess, be the [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=1990.74s)]
*  rationale that you're going to get this great potential, you know, you're going [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=1994.66s)]
*  to have an American counterpart that's going to give you whatever you want. [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=1999.02s)]
*  Well, you know, that the problem with that is, of course, Putin knows Zelensky [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2003.02s)]
*  won't accept those terms. And so one of the things that is that is unfolding [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2007.38s)]
*  right now, and this is something that actually I was talking to some people [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2013.18s)]
*  right at the start of Trump's term who had been following this entire saga since [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2018.0200000000002s)]
*  before the original invasion of Crimea in 2014. And they said this, Trump doesn't [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2022.7800000000002s)]
*  realize how much Putin has changed. He is not dealing with the Vladimir Putin of [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2027.7s)]
*  his first term. He is not. He's dealing with a man who has launched the biggest [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2032.14s)]
*  land war in Europe since World War Two has gotten away with it to the extent [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2036.1000000000001s)]
*  that right now it's still him against Ukraine with his North Korean allies [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2040.5s)]
*  coming in. He's launched a war that he thinks right now he is winning. [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2044.54s)]
*  And Trump's unwillingness to stand with Ukraine gives Putin every belief that he [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2050.54s)]
*  can just keep winning. So why do you concede anything if you're Vladimir [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2057.18s)]
*  Putin where, yeah, there has been some aid released that was pre-approved in [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2063.78s)]
*  the Biden administration over to Ukraine, but there's no new aid apparently coming [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2069.34s)]
*  from the United States. Putin, I don't think, thinks Europe can sustain this war [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2074.5s)]
*  effort. And so Putin believes he's holding all of the cards. And it's really [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2078.6600000000003s)]
*  interesting watching this sort of realization dawning on JD Vance or others [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2084.06s)]
*  that, well, golly gee, Putin might not be negotiating in good faith. What we've [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2089.94s)]
*  been so, we've been reaching out to him. I mean, and you're just thinking, [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2097.74s)]
*  where have you been? Zelensky, look, I'm old enough to remember Zelensky very [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2105.5s)]
*  calmly in the Oval Office telling JD Vance that Putin can't be trusted. And JD [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2111.18s)]
*  Vance using that as a pretext to unload on Zelensky in front of the world to the [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2117.42s)]
*  thunderous applause of MAGA. Look at our guy standing up. And everything that [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2124.62s)]
*  Zelensky told him is being born out in real time. And JD Vance and that team are [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2129.58s)]
*  like, wait, what? [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2134.18s)]
*  Does it seem like JD has reflected on that at all? Actually, you're being kind [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2136.02s)]
*  of nice to him by acting like he's like, wait, what's going on? He's basically [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2139.34s)]
*  taking in this new information and in the most condescending manner possible, [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2145.18s)]
*  lecturing people about how the fact that he was wrong and the fact that he was [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2150.4199999999996s)]
*  wrong means that we're just going to have to walk away from the table because [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2155.5s)]
*  people don't know how right I, you know, people don't appreciate how right I was. [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2158.1s)]
*  I wasn't being thanked enough. His tone is unbelievably condescending, like [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2161.74s)]
*  while talking about him. [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2167.94s)]
*  I'm so glad you said that. I'm so glad you said that, Tim, because this is, you [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2168.94s)]
*  know, one of the things that we're seeing about the right is you take almost [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2174.14s)]
*  any malady of the far left. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2177.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2180.42s)]
*  And then you take it over to the, to the Trump right. [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2181.1400000000003s)]
*  And they make it worse. [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2183.5800000000004s)]
*  So cancel culture from the far left. [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2185.1000000000004s)]
*  Bad. [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2188.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2188.94s)]
*  We'll get into that. [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2189.1400000000003s)]
*  Magna cancel culture. [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2189.5400000000004s)]
*  Hold my beer. [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2190.6200000000003s)]
*  Okay. [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2191.6200000000003s)]
*  Uh, far left condescension, smug, you know, if you're disagreeing with me, you're [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2193.1000000000004s)]
*  a bad problematic person. [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2198.78s)]
*  That's bad. [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2200.42s)]
*  Trump turns it into, if you disagree with me, I'm so obviously right that you're [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2201.82s)]
*  not just an idiot. [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2206.82s)]
*  If you disagree that you're also a coward. [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2208.1800000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2210.5s)]
*  And so MAGA overlays the cowardice over the, you know, it is the [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2210.9s)]
*  unproblematic allegation. [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2214.6200000000003s)]
*  And so every malady you saw on the far left in the sort of woke world, the [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2216.38s)]
*  anti woke MAGA world has replicated and amplified and, and what you just pointed [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2222.1800000000003s)]
*  out, this condescension, the smugness, this arrogance is one of those, one of [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2228.2200000000003s)]
*  those maladies that it's just amplified. [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2233.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2235.94s)]
*  And with most cases, not even with bad intentions, you know, that like the road, [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2236.34s)]
*  the road to hell is paved with good intentions. [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2239.98s)]
*  A lot of times as far as lafter maladies come with good intentions and they're [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2241.78s)]
*  like layering over on top of them with, with ill intent. [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2245.26s)]
*  Um, I don't know if that's true for Marco here. [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2247.6600000000003s)]
*  I'm curious. [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2250.0200000000004s)]
*  I want you to psychoanalyze Marco for me. [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2250.38s)]
*  Uh, because he was, uh, we, I did a thing with Peter Hamby on Friday where we [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2252.9s)]
*  ranked the most obsequious members of Congress and, uh, and Marco wasn't drafted [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2258.1000000000004s)]
*  in the first three rounds. [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2262.7s)]
*  And so he, I think maybe heard about it on the podcast, wanted to make sure that [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2263.8199999999997s)]
*  he, you know, he got recognized in the future. [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2267.66s)]
*  Here he was yesterday talking about Trump, the peacemaker. [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2270.46s)]
*  If you can stomach it, it's going to be about 48 seconds. [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2274.2999999999997s)]
*  Kind of an aside. [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2278.3799999999997s)]
*  One of the Cardinals I was meeting with, Mr. President, uh, the day before the [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2279.22s)]
*  papal mass said to me, you know, it's very unusual for us. [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2282.74s)]
*  It's, uh, you know, we have an American president that wants peace and it's the, [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2286.06s)]
*  some of the Europeans that are constantly talking about doing war stuff. [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2289.7799999999997s)]
*  So it's kind of the world's upside down in their mind right now is usually the [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2292.74s)]
*  other way around. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2295.66s)]
*  And, uh, it's a great honor to, to work for a president who literally spends half [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2296.8599999999997s)]
*  his day, maybe more trying to stop wars and wars prevent wars. [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2301.3399999999997s)]
*  And it's an extraordinary thing to be a part of. [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2305.9799999999996s)]
*  And thank you for your leadership on that front. [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2308.1s)]
*  He's a [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2310.1s)]
*  key part of the speech he gave. [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2316.74s)]
*  And I just summarize it this way. [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2318.1s)]
*  Our president is a builder, not a bomber. [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2319.5s)]
*  He wants to make things. [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2322.38s)]
*  He wants to build things. [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2323.38s)]
*  He wants people to have prosperity and to be happy. [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2324.38s)]
*  He wants people to be happy. [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2327.74s)]
*  Does Marco believe, like, has Marco just gone fully native? [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2329.22s)]
*  I don't understand. [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2332.94s)]
*  Like Marco is now like, you know, blessed are the peacemakers, like Neocon Marco. [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2334.2599999999998s)]
*  Like what has happened? [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2341.7799999999997s)]
*  You know, it would have to depend on how we measure the obsequiousness [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2343.7799999999997s)]
*  scale, because is it from start point to finish point? [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2347.94s)]
*  If, if it's that scale, Marco Rubio has the Olympic gold easily, because this was [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2352.1s)]
*  a guy I remember in 2016 who was sounding the alarm as loudly and urgently [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2358.66s)]
*  as anyone in that race, he did not do what Ted Cruz did for a while, which was [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2363.9s)]
*  to play super nice and friendly with, with Trump Rubio was more against Trump [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2368.2200000000003s)]
*  sooner than a lot of the other guys were. [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2374.26s)]
*  And then he goes from that to this. [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2377.42s)]
*  That's a huge migration. [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2379.54s)]
*  And in my experience, Tim, there are some great valuable life lessons you can [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2381.5s)]
*  learn by being a litigator for 21 years. [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2385.8199999999997s)]
*  And one of the things that you learn is that when people can commit to a bit so [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2388.54s)]
*  much that they become the bit. [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2392.7799999999997s)]
*  And, you know, I, one of the things that I, I was, I remember thinking when as a [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2395.1s)]
*  young lawyer was what's it like to represent somebody who knows they're [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2400.94s)]
*  guilty? [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2404.98s)]
*  In other words, they know they're guilty. [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2406.14s)]
*  Well, I was mainly a civil litigator, not, not criminal. [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2408.62s)]
*  It's a different thing. [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2411.62s)]
*  And one of the things that I saw was that in civil litigation, people could [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2412.58s)]
*  convince themselves of almost anything. [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2416.54s)]
*  If enough money is on the line, if enough pride is on the line and enough, [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2420.5s)]
*  and then years and months and years go by, people migrate into the bit completely. [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2424.06s)]
*  And I feel like that that's where we are with a lot of these Republicans, [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2429.7s)]
*  traditional Republicans who are now quite maggot. [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2433.02s)]
*  They have migrated and they are the bit now they are into the bit. [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2435.14s)]
*  And, and I think what's happened is that I think this is right. [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2439.06s)]
*  I think he looks at himself in the mirror and thinks I'm a good person now. [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2441.94s)]
*  This is actually a part of how I rationalize being for Trump who I know is [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2444.9s)]
*  kind of as a bad character traits, but like we're doing good now. [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2447.94s)]
*  We are the Cardinals, a pre, you know, the Cardinals in the, you know, and [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2451.22s)]
*  Vatican city are blessing me now. [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2456.3799999999997s)]
*  And this is how I rationalize it. [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2458.2599999999998s)]
*  I truly think that he is the bet he's gone like fully around the bend on that. [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2459.5s)]
*  Oh, I totally agree. [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2464.82s)]
*  When, when I meet somebody who's, who's as vocally Trump loving as Rubio is, [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2466.06s)]
*  I'm now know, I mean, I know countless people like that. [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2474.38s)]
*  I just countless people like that, including former established [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2476.94s)]
*  from Republicans who are effusive. [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2480.02s)]
*  And I, I do not detect deception here. [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2482.3s)]
*  And, and I will tell you this, it's also a different thing. [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2485.5s)]
*  Like when you're traveling in Republican circles in 2016, you had, there [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2487.78s)]
*  was this constant, he's doing terrible things. [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2493.14s)]
*  I wish he wasn't our guy, but then that when the cameras come on, then you [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2496.7799999999997s)]
*  defend him and attack the Democrats. [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2500.8199999999997s)]
*  I'm not hearing that green room honesty anymore as much or not, not nearly as much. [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2502.8199999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2507.7s)]
*  A little bit on the bill, on the bill, on the financial stuff, like a little bit on the [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2508.74s)]
*  tear. [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2512.14s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2512.38s)]
*  On the tariffs, you started to get it, but on some of these other issues and no, no, [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2512.9s)]
*  I don't. [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2517.62s)]
*  And the Marco thing, and again, this like becomes cliche at this point to even [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2518.42s)]
*  bring up, but just, it's just so stark with him is that if Kamala had won and was [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2521.62s)]
*  saying we need total rapprochement with Iran and Russia and, and, and, and frankly, [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2531.18s)]
*  the, you know, the sponsors of Hamas, all three total, I can exchange for whatever, [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2538.7s)]
*  some financial deal. [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2544.02s)]
*  And her secretary of state was talking about how she's a peacemaker. [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2545.58s)]
*  How the only thing that matters is that we lay down our arms and that everybody hugs [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2550.54s)]
*  and that she just wants people to be happy. [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2555.98s)]
*  I like the person who offered the most withering critique of that in all of Washington [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2558.26s)]
*  would have been Marco Rubio. [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2563.46s)]
*  Oh, no question. [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2565.26s)]
*  No question. [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2568.02s)]
*  I mean, this, this idea that we're going to effectively switch sides in the Ukraine war [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2569.1800000000003s)]
*  to side with Russia, the Republican Party for generations would have been apoplectic. [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2576.22s)]
*  This is worse than any of the alleged, you know, the appeasement or weakness allegations [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2584.5s)]
*  thrown at a Walter Mondale back in the day or a George McGovern back in the day. [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2590.02s)]
*  I mean, the Obama apology tour, which wasn't great for me, actually, but was like a [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2594.2599999999998s)]
*  mild, was just the most mild compared to what Trump just did in Saudi. [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2600.4199999999996s)]
*  Oh, it's unbelievable. [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2606.18s)]
*  It's just unbelievable. [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2608.18s)]
*  The direct attack on the United States of America, the direct attack sort of on our [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2609.14s)]
*  history and our foreign policy and all of its predecessors and the, and then the [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2613.3799999999997s)]
*  appeasement of a Russian dictator, the imitation in many ways of a Russian [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2617.8199999999997s)]
*  dictator's approach to foreign policy, where with this whole spheres of influence, [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2623.2599999999998s)]
*  where Canada now becomes more of an enemy than Russia in some ways. [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2627.58s)]
*  I mean, what are we even, we're trying to bully and intimidate our neighbors the [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2632.94s)]
*  way that Putin tries to bully and intimidate his neighbors. [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2636.82s)]
*  This is, this is something that, and here's what's frustrating to me, Tim. [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2640.06s)]
*  Such a small percentage of Americans pay close attention to politics that there [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2645.86s)]
*  are millions of Republicans who are walking around still thinking that the [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2650.94s)]
*  Republican Party is the hawkish party on national defense. [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2655.82s)]
*  They're still thinking that this is, if you want strength, if you want toughness, [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2659.38s)]
*  you toughness, you go to Donald Trump. [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2665.02s)]
*  And what we are seeing is with Trump, you're beginning to see appeasement. [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2668.62s)]
*  Not just beginning to see, you're seeing appeasement, you're seeing abandonment of [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2673.06s)]
*  allies, you're seeing weakness, you're seeing retreat, you're not seeing toughness. [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2676.22s)]
*  And then this much vaunted Houthi bombing campaign, which I think one of Biden's [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2681.06s)]
*  failures was his failure to deal with the Houthis and Trump was going to do [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2685.5s)]
*  it and so for a month or whatever, he bombs the crap out of the Houthis. [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2688.58s)]
*  Oh, I'm sorry. [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2692.9s)]
*  I thought he was a builder, not a bomber. [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2693.34s)]
*  He was bombing the Houthis? [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2694.8199999999997s)]
*  Oh, okay. [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2696.22s)]
*  He was in the bombing phase, which is the pre-building phase, right? [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2696.86s)]
*  And so he's bombing the crap out of the Houthis to no apparent effect. [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2700.66s)]
*  And then just like calls it a day. [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2705.38s)]
*  And I guess the shipping lanes aren't as vital anymore. [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2707.38s)]
*  I mean, it, it's all very confusing. [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2710.14s)]
*  And you know, my colleague, my newsroom colleagues at the Times wrote up a really [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2712.54s)]
*  tremendous report of sort of the confusion around the bombing campaign and how it was, [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2716.2599999999998s)]
*  uh, how ineffective it was. [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2722.3799999999997s)]
*  And, and, and let's look at the Pete Hegseth record so far. [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2723.8599999999997s)]
*  We've had a signal chat scandal. [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2727.8999999999996s)]
*  We've had the loss of a lot of a senior team. [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2730.3399999999997s)]
*  We've had a signature chat signal chat scandal 2.0, and we've had a completely [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2733.06s)]
*  ineffective bombing campaign against the Houthis, but Hey, at least the military [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2737.8199999999997s)]
*  isn't woke anymore, Tim. [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2742.7799999999997s)]
*  Well, no, they're tough. [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2745.18s)]
*  It's a tough military guys are really taking out the Houthis that we just gave up after a [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2746.7799999999997s)]
*  month. [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2750.22s)]
*  Um, you know, and also David, I like, look, this is the thing. [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2750.4599999999996s)]
*  As long as if everybody could just be happy and build golf courses and do, and have [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2753.8199999999997s)]
*  crypto, why would, why would they do wars? [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2757.66s)]
*  Wars, wars aren't about anything anyway. [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2759.7799999999997s)]
*  It's just all about money and happiness. [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2761.74s)]
*  And if Donald Trump can just go and give people hugs and let them use his fake [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2764.18s)]
*  currency and like build cool resorts, then, then peace will come in our time. [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2770.14s)]
*  That's, that's right. [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2775.94s)]
*  I think that's right. [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2776.8199999999997s)]
*  History's proven that out. [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2777.62s)]
*  Um, are you ready to feel normal for a second? [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2778.7s)]
*  You're ready just to breathe. [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2780.94s)]

*  Mike Pence did an interview on Sunday and it's just like, in case you have any doubt [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2785.5s)]
*  about what an actual, what Marco Rubio might've sounded like, you know, had, had [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2790.02s)]

*  aforementioned Trump speech in Saudi Arabia. [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2804.82s)]
*  Well, I think first we've got to remember who Qatar is. [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2808.1000000000004s)]
*  We've got a military base there. [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2811.82s)]

*  They support Hamas. [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2822.2200000000003s)]
*  And so the very idea that, that we would accept an air force want, uh, from Qatar, [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2824.4199999999996s)]

*  snatched and apparently it's a two way thing. [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2869.34s)]
*  That's what is interesting. [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2871.78s)]
*  Like your body can be snatched and then returned to you, which has happened for [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2872.6600000000003s)]
*  Mike Pence. [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2876.1800000000003s)]
*  Well, you know, the thing is Mike Pence had a reaction to January 6th that normal [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2877.62s)]
*  people would have, which is these people tried to kill me. [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2881.98s)]
*  They may not be great people. [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2885.66s)]
*  Okay. [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2887.5s)]
*  And then you have all these senators and congressmen who are like, these people [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2888.46s)]
*  tried to kill me. [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2891.34s)]
*  How can I be closer to this team? [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2892.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2894.94s)]
*  How can they, how can I butter them up a little bit? [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2895.3s)]
*  So they aim their fire somewhere else. [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2898.58s)]
*  Then we can give them a $5 million payout. [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2900.34s)]
*  Like we just did to Ashley Babbitt's family. [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2902.26s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2904.66s)]
*  Now this cutter plane issue, you know, you're of two minds of it, [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2905.58s)]
*  because one of them should be nothing about it should be surprising. [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2911.82s)]
*  I mean, the guy has been, I mean, just going back to the first term when one [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2915.6600000000003s)]
*  of the first signs that somebody had, or an organization had really began to turn [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2920.78s)]
*  from traditional conservative to MAGA was they're renting out the Trump hotel [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2924.86s)]
*  ballroom for their events. [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2929.3s)]
*  Right. [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2930.6600000000003s)]
*  So, cause Trump is still master of his empire, his business empire while he's [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2930.94s)]
*  president of the United States. [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2936.1800000000003s)]
*  And so people are buying Trump properties, or people are, you know, using [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2937.58s)]
*  Trump properties and spending money at Trump events and Trump properties. [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2943.14s)]
*  So he's taken this to a whole nother level with the Trump meme coin scandal [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2947.34s)]
*  and that, you know, the crypto nonsense. [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2951.46s)]
*  So this is just the next evolution. [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2954.94s)]
*  And so in the one sense, you wouldn't be surprised, but in another sense, you just [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2957.5s)]
*  sometimes have to step back for a minute and just do this mental exercise of [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2962.42s)]
*  what if Barack Obama had agreed to receive an airplane from a nation that [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2967.62s)]
*  supports Hamas and that his attorney general who had previously been paid, [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2974.38s)]
*  what was it a hundred thousand a month by the same nation before she became [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2980.74s)]
*  attorney general signs off on it. [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2985.34s)]
*  Yet the other people's planes might be nicer than our plane. [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2988.38s)]
*  And look, I'm not defending Boeing in any way, shape or form for not getting the [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2991.46s)]
*  plane, the air force one done on time on budget, the new air force one, [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=2996.46s)]
*  Boeing has problems, but the cure to Boeing, Boeing's problems is not a [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3000.1s)]
*  Qatari plane. [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3005.34s)]
*  That's not the cure to Boeing's problems. [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3007.26s)]
*  So that it's just utterly, utterly absurd where we are here. [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3010.2200000000003s)]
*  And, and then this extra layer of it's not a gift to him, say his defenders on [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3015.66s)]
*  Twitter, because it's going to his library afterwards, like in the Reagan [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3021.02s)]
*  library. Well, the understanding I have is that this is not just going to be [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3025.22s)]
*  Trump walking and going into some hanger and sitting around in the Trump library. [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3031.7799999999997s)]
*  This thing may well be available for his use after he leaves office. [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3037.14s)]
*  So an opulent 747 to his opulence tastes becomes his for his use after office. [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3041.8199999999997s)]
*  Now it remains to be seen how it will all work out. [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3049.62s)]
*  We have to acknowledge that remains to be seen how it all will all work out. [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3052.7s)]
*  But this is just. [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3055.74s)]
*  This should be shocking stuff. [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3058.18s)]
*  It is, it is not shocking stuff to a sufficient number. [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3059.7799999999997s)]
*  All right. [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3068.18s)]
*  So it's shark week here on the Borg podcasts was today's sponsor, the latest and [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3068.42s)]

*  who would dehumanize the Palestinians on the right. [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3221.5s)]
*  To say there are no, and you, I'm sure you've seen this on Twitter. [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3224.8199999999997s)]
*  There are no innocent Palestinians. [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3227.42s)]
*  They're all bad. [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3229.14s)]
*  They're all awful. [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3229.94s)]
*  And this was a, this was a temptation that some people had during the worst [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3231.2999999999997s)]
*  days of the Iraq war was to sort of think of the Iraqi people and dehumanize [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3235.34s)]
*  the Iraqi people. [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3238.98s)]
*  But my, my commander in Iraq said something really brilliant at the start [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3239.74s)]
*  of our deployment. [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3244.14s)]
*  He said, a lot of you guys are going to be hostile to the Iraqi people because [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3244.86s)]
*  you're going to see them seemingly totally passive in the face of some [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3250.3s)]
*  horrific evil. [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3254.86s)]
*  And he said, let me ask you a question. [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3256.7400000000002s)]
*  What do you call one man with a gun in a room full of a hundred people? [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3258.5400000000004s)]
*  We're like, I don't know, sir. [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3263.46s)]
*  A majority. [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3265.0200000000004s)]
*  He said, they dictate the terms. [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3266.5800000000004s)]
*  So for us to understand the other hundred, the mindset and the thoughts [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3269.86s)]
*  and the, of the other hundred people, you got to get rid of the man with a gun. [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3273.7400000000002s)]
*  And once you get rid of the man with a gun, the civil society can flourish. [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3277.66s)]
*  And I've thought about that in the context of Hamas. [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3281.02s)]
*  They've been living under this Hamas brutality for a very long time, [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3283.06s)]
*  20 or so years. [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3287.46s)]
*  They've been living under Hamas brutality. [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3289.1s)]
*  They know very well if they stand up to Hamas, they could be killed, brutally [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3291.22s)]
*  tortured and killed. [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3295.3399999999997s)]
*  And so to see this as breathtaking bravery, and it's a sign for everyone on [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3297.1s)]
*  the right, far right, who says, these people are just too far gone. [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3300.58s)]
*  No, no. [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3305.5s)]
*  There are people showing indescribable courage. [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3306.7s)]
*  And then for those people on the far left, who some, for some reason, tend to [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3309.06s)]
*  think that Hamas is some sort of authentic representative of the Palestinian people. [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3312.7799999999997s)]
*  And that it's somehow an acceptable outcome. [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3317.66s)]
*  The violent resistance is what is needed because of, you know, [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3320.18s)]
*  Right. [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3323.18s)]
*  Or that an acceptable outcome of this war is Hamas still in charge. [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3324.1s)]
*  Those protesters rebuke them as well, because they're a living symbol that no, [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3327.2599999999998s)]
*  Hamas is not a representative of the Palestinian people. [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3331.58s)]
*  It's a faction. [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3334.58s)]
*  No question, but it is not the representative of the Palestinian people. [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3335.98s)]
*  And so I, you know, I think it's one of the most courageous things I've ever seen. [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3340.14s)]
*  And it has within it the seeds, the very, very, very small seeds of actual hope [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3346.54s)]
*  here, but, you know, it hope is very hard to hope does not live for very long in [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3351.2599999999998s)]
*  the Middle East. [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3357.46s)]
*  No. [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3358.42s)]
*  All right. [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3359.14s)]
*  A couple of quick other legal items just for others. [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3359.3799999999997s)]
*  So on the free speech topic, I always do like to talk to you about, you know, [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3362.66s)]
*  the, I'm just so blown away by the commitment to the free speech on the [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3366.46s)]
*  anti-woke right. [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3369.66s)]
*  In particular, we saw this week, James Comey, and I don't know, just as you're, [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3370.62s)]
*  you have a lot of expertise having been a lawyer on First Amendment issues. [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3376.7s)]
*  What do you think? [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3380.94s)]
*  Like posting an Instagram picture of, of, of, of, let's say 86, 47. [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3381.5s)]
*  Is that jailable? [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3387.42s)]
*  Is that jailable for you? [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3388.8199999999997s)]
*  Or no. [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3389.8199999999997s)]
*  I mean, it's not even close. [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3390.46s)]
*  I mean, so let's look at this from two standpoints. [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3392.3799999999997s)]
*  One is, is 86 a violent threat? [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3395.2599999999998s)]
*  No, no. [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3398.62s)]
*  I was a waiter back in the day, Tim. [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3400.4199999999996s)]
*  I don't know if you've ever had the. [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3402.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3404.4199999999996s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3405.3799999999997s)]
*  Where, where, what kind of restaurant? [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3405.74s)]
*  So I was a waiter at a restaurant called Darrell's in, in Nashville. [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3407.8199999999997s)]
*  It was a chain restaurant, kind of like an Applebee's back in the day, except a [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3412.4199999999996s)]
*  little, you know, they all have like an outfit. [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3415.8999999999996s)]
*  Did you have to wear flair? [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3417.74s)]
*  I did not have to wear flair. [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3419.8599999999997s)]
*  Thankfully, but I did have to wear those suspenders. [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3421.18s)]
*  Suspenders. [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3424.06s)]
*  So I had to have a, I had to have a handwritten name tag. [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3424.7s)]
*  And then I had the white shirt and I had like a maroon suspenders. [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3428.8999999999996s)]
*  That's cute. [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3434.58s)]
*  So, and then, uh, I left Darrell's and worked at the old spaghetti factory, [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3434.94s)]
*  which I think is still on second Avenue and downtown Nashville. [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3439.8999999999996s)]
*  And so that my friend is a crappy waiting tables job because there's like [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3443.22s)]
*  seven courses and the meals are cheap. [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3448.4199999999996s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3451.14s)]
*  So it's a bad combo. [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3451.38s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3454.22s)]
*  Um, but where was we, where were we going with the waiting? [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3455.5s)]
*  That you know that 86 doesn't mean assassinate. [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3461.14s)]
*  Yes. [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3463.7s)]
*  As a, as a waiter, as a former waiter. [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3464.1s)]
*  This was an inefficient way to tell this story, but when you're waiting tables, [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3467.98s)]
*  you know, 86, the fries, like you're out of the fries, 86, the, you know, 86, [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3472.22s)]
*  the filet or the prime rib, you're out of it. [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3477.22s)]
*  Um, and so he's meaning like we should be done with him. [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3479.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3483.2200000000003s)]
*  So that's not a violent threat. [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3483.6200000000003s)]
*  And, and the other thing though, even if it was, even if a reasonable [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3484.98s)]
*  interpret person could interpret it as some sort of aspirationally violent [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3489.26s)]
*  sentiment, there's actually Supreme court authority on the hang Mike Pence, [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3492.9s)]
*  for example, if it said hang Mike Pence instead of maybe 10 47. [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3496.78s)]
*  Now in that context where you're actually storming the building, [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3501.38s)]
*  no, I meant if just the, if just the stones said hang Mike Pence, [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3505.1400000000003s)]
*  right. [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3509.6200000000003s)]
*  There is a case about a, a Vietnam war protester who during the Vietnam [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3510.58s)]
*  war said, if I'm drafted, the first thing I do when I get a rifle is I'm [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3515.06s)]
*  going to shoot Johnson. [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3518.46s)]
*  And this went all the way up to the Supreme court and the Supreme court [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3520.1800000000003s)]
*  said that's free speech. [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3522.46s)]
*  That is free speech. [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3524.1800000000003s)]
*  So it's a joke. [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3525.1000000000004s)]
*  It's a ridiculous joke that they would call this some sort of violent [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3526.78s)]
*  threat or actionable threat. [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3530.42s)]
*  Um, okay. [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3532.6600000000003s)]
*  Just on, uh, going around fire on these. [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3533.82s)]
*  So, uh, Warren Wyman and Sanders sent a letter essentially saying that [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3535.54s)]
*  there's a concern, there's an appearance of bribery in the situation [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3539.7799999999997s)]
*  with Paramount where, uh, like all signs point to the fact that the [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3543.1s)]
*  Paramount is going to settle with Trump on the ridiculous 60 minutes lawsuit. [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3548.06s)]
*  And, um, what do you, what do you, what do you make of the back and forth on that? [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3552.34s)]
*  Yeah, I think bribery is a major stretch, especially considering the, um, recent [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3557.22s)]
*  Supreme court authority on that issue. [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3562.06s)]
*  I think what you're talking about is, uh, you know, you're, you wrote, throw [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3563.82s)]
*  around a legal term of art like that. [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3568.42s)]
*  Uh, no, but it's a grift man and it is cowardice. [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3570.34s)]
*  It is a cowardice in the most significant way. [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3575.14s)]
*  And, and it's, it's not just cowardice in the abstract. [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3578.2999999999997s)]
*  It's very dangerous cowardice because what we're seeing, Tim, I'm actually less [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3581.74s)]
*  alarmed that Donald Trump is Donald Trump than I am that major institutions [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3586.2599999999998s)]
*  capitulate to Donald Trump because when he came in, we knew who he was. [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3591.38s)]
*  We knew his character. [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3596.7000000000003s)]
*  And so none of the things that he's doing should surprise us at all. [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3598.94s)]
*  However, what is surprising me is the sort of retreat and capitulation of key [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3602.6600000000003s)]
*  elements of civil society, including big, big legal institutions, including [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3607.78s)]
*  major media institutions. [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3612.26s)]
*  So you're beginning to see, Tim, how Americans and American institutions [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3614.7000000000003s)]
*  we're not made of some sort of special clay where we're uniquely resistant. [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3620.02s)]
*  To thugs and tyrants. [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3625.74s)]
*  We do have systems that help us resist thugs and tyrants, but the people who [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3627.74s)]
*  make up these systems in many ways are just as weak, just as cowardly as you've [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3631.42s)]
*  seen around the world in the face of autocrats and, but to see that in the [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3637.66s)]
*  U S is it's tough to absorb. [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3643.06s)]
*  It is. [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3646.2599999999998s)]
*  I mean, Sherry redstone should be ashamed of herself. [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3647.14s)]
*  It's so pathetic. [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3648.86s)]
*  I want to move to your new city, Chicago. [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3649.7s)]
*  There's a new DOJ investigation into your mayor. [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3652.18s)]
*  I don't know if you saw this. [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3654.3399999999997s)]
*  Your mayor's about as popular as like Janet awards. [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3656.2599999999998s)]
*  So I don't really have a huge political fandom of Brandon Johnson, but I'm [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3658.8599999999997s)]
*  not sure about, about jailing him. [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3662.94s)]
*  Here is what the letter from, from a Harmeet Dillon said, in your remarks [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3665.5s)]
*  made at the apostolic church of God and woodlawn, you highlighted the number of [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3671.66s)]
*  black officials in your administration. [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3675.58s)]
*  You then went on to list each of these individuals, emphasizing their race. [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3677.62s)]
*  Um, uh, and, uh, as a result of that, uh, they are opening investigation, I [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3682.58s)]
*  guess, regarding, uh, determining whether the city of Chicago is engaged in a [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3690.46s)]
*  pattern or practice of discrimination in hiring, um, here, I just want to read [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3694.86s)]
*  you his quote here. [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3700.22s)]
*  He said, uh, uh, let's see. [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3700.98s)]
*  He lists all the people that he hired who are black. [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3702.86s)]
*  And then he says, there are some detractors who will push back on me and [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3704.58s)]
*  say, you know, the only thing the mayor talks about is the hiring of black people. [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3707.18s)]
*  No, what I'm saying is when you hire our people, we always look out for everybody [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3710.46s)]
*  else. [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3713.5s)]
*  We are the most generous people on the planet having, having people in my [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3714.2599999999998s)]
*  administration that will look out for the interest of everyone. [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3717.2599999999998s)]
*  And everyone means you have to look out for the interest of black folks [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3719.54s)]
*  because that hasn't happened. [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3722.7s)]
*  That's how we ensure long-term sustainable growth. [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3724.18s)]
*  So, uh, what do you think there? [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3727.54s)]
*  DOJ letter at Brandon Johnson. [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3729.3399999999997s)]
*  Um, [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3731.18s)]
*  being proud of the fact that you have an increasingly diverse workforce is not [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3731.7s)]
*  evidence of illegality. [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3736.3799999999997s)]
*  Okay. [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3738.2999999999997s)]
*  So it is absolutely true, however, that you can potentially create diverse [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3739.06s)]
*  workforces through illegality because race-based hiring, race-based promotion [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3744.9399999999996s)]
*  is illegal. [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3751.14s)]
*  Okay. [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3752.22s)]
*  So it should not occur. [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3752.54s)]
*  However, however, it is very weird. [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3753.8999999999996s)]
*  We're getting to a very weird time, Tim, when, uh, you know, the city of [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3756.7s)]
*  when the, if a person who is hired is not a white male, people presume [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3761.18s)]
*  malfeasance. [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3768.5s)]
*  Okay. [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3770.94s)]
*  That's horrible. [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3771.3799999999997s)]
*  But yeah, you're right. [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3772.5s)]
*  I mean, but think about it for five seconds. [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3773.7799999999997s)]
*  I mean, like, Oh wait, there's a black police commissioner. [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3775.74s)]
*  Well, that's obviously DEI or there's a woman pilot. [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3780.54s)]
*  Well, that's obviously DEI because the default competence is white dudes. [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3784.2999999999997s)]
*  No, no, no, no, no. [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3791.34s)]
*  The fact of the matter is that a nation that has like our nation been afflicted [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3794.2599999999998s)]
*  with centuries of de jure and de facto racist, uh, racism, that when you stop [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3798.54s)]
*  being racist, just that alone is going to start increasing diversity. [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3807.38s)]
*  Sure. [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3814.18s)]
*  Okay. [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3814.58s)]
*  So being not racist will increase diversity, but then if you got an [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3815.34s)]
*  administration saying, Oh, look at that increased diversity, there must be a [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3819.18s)]
*  problem. [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3823.06s)]
*  That is not the way the law works. [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3824.8599999999997s)]
*  And also it is not the case. [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3827.02s)]
*  And this is so important for people to realize after the Harvard ruling on [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3829.06s)]
*  affirmative action, which I think was the right ruling that Harvard cannot [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3834.18s)]
*  discriminate on the basis of race and its admissions. [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3837.14s)]
*  I think that was the correct ruling. [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3840.3799999999997s)]
*  It is not the case that diversity efforts are now illegal. [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3842.18s)]
*  It is not the case. [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3846.1s)]
*  For example, here's an example of a very legal and quite good diversity [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3847.54s)]
*  effort, the Texas 10% rule. [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3852.74s)]
*  So the Texas 10% rule allows you to be admitted to a major Texas public [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3855.2999999999997s)]
*  university. [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3859.58s)]
*  If you finish in the top 10% of your high school class, that disproportionately [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3860.06s)]
*  helps applicants, non-white applicants. [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3864.74s)]
*  It does provide assistance and help to non-white applicants, but it's a race [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3867.98s)]
*  neutral criteria. [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3872.66s)]
*  So it's just, are you in the top 10% or not? [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3875.02s)]
*  And so because of the facts of historic marginalization, whenever you reach out [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3878.3799999999997s)]
*  on the basis of class, you have disproportionate benefits also on the [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3884.3399999999997s)]
*  basis of race. [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3891.5s)]
*  That is not illegal. [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3893.1s)]
*  In fact, it's not just not illegal. [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3895.94s)]
*  I think it's actually a really good thing for institutions to do is to reach out [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3897.8999999999996s)]
*  on the basis of socioeconomic class, which does increase racial diversity. [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3903.46s)]
*  It's a race neutral way of increasing American diversity and representation in [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3908.94s)]
*  American institutions. [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3916.94s)]
*  And so what the Trump administration is doing, however, is just basically taking [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3918.78s)]
*  any move that honors the existence of black people in the workforce or women in [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3922.58s)]
*  the workforce or you name it. [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3928.18s)]
*  And then uses that as evidence of illegality. [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3929.8199999999997s)]
*  When you and I both know that a super white workforce, they would look at and [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3933.5s)]
*  go, Oh, merit talkers. [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3936.7799999999997s)]
*  And I also think of this case, this is intimidation. [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3940.1s)]
*  This is like simply what this is. [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3942.3799999999997s)]
*  This is not like a legit, I don't think that our meat is looking to take this [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3943.9399999999996s)]
*  case in front of a grand jury. [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3947.3799999999997s)]
*  I could, what they want to do is scare people out of doing this kind of doing [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3949.4199999999996s)]
*  diversity hiring. [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3954.4199999999996s)]
*  Like, you know, they want to make people feel self-conscious and nervous as they're [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3955.2599999999998s)]
*  going through the process of trying to figure out how to hire non-white applicants. [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3960.58s)]
*  Look, if you can prove that there is discrimination on the basis of race, file [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3964.7s)]
*  that suit. [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3969.14s)]
*  Based on a church speech where you're bragging about your staff. [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3970.06s)]
*  Like, come on. [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3972.4199999999996s)]
*  Okay. [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3974.22s)]
*  I have mixed views on this. [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3974.5s)]
*  I had one more legal thing I want to bring to you because I did your city, [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3976.3399999999997s)]
*  Chicago. [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3978.74s)]
*  We have one in New Orleans right now. [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3979.1s)]
*  Big, big discussion about this. [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3980.22s)]
*  And I don't, I have my two wolves inside of me, my civil libertarian side and my [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3982.26s)]
*  old Republican law and order side are like fighting each other right now. [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3988.34s)]
*  So I want you to help me. [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3991.82s)]
*  New Orleans police have been using information from a 200 plus camera network [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3993.26s)]
*  to find wanted individuals for the past two years. [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=3999.0200000000004s)]
*  It's a facial recognition camera. [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=4002.34s)]
*  And they've been migrating the streets and sending alerts to officers' phones in [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=4005.3s)]
*  real time. [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=4009.1400000000003s)]
*  I guess what they see, you know, suspects of violent crimes. [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=4010.42s)]
*  Crime is down in New Orleans significantly over the last two years. [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=4015.2599999999998s)]
*  Don't know if it's related or not. [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=4018.22s)]
*  They have, they have found violent criminals using this process. [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=4019.9s)]
*  We also did just let 11 violent criminals escape from jail. [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=4023.14s)]
*  So maybe kind of an even steven here. [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=4025.7799999999997s)]
*  But I, I, there's, there's some very real like civil liberties concerns because [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=4029.38s)]
*  there's, they went out around, around city council as far as like what types of [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=4033.14s)]
*  alerts and how broadly the AI, you know, facial recognition cameras are being used. [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=4037.38s)]
*  What, like, obviously, you know, you've been briefed on all the details of this [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=4043.42s)]
*  case, but where, what, what, what do you make of, of the, cause this is coming [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=4046.86s)]
*  everywhere, the potential for using facial recognition technology. [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=4050.54s)]
*  I mean, you know, I'm, I'm enough of a fan of British crime dramas, Tim, to be [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=4053.9s)]
*  aware of the near universal existence of CCTV over overseas. [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=4059.06s)]
*  I mean in Britain. [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=4064.1800000000003s)]
*  And why do all the murders happen in the CCTV blind spot? [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=4065.62s)]
*  But you got, they got advanced the plot. [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=4069.46s)]
*  I got advanced the plot. [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=4072.8599999999997s)]
*  That's right. [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=4073.8999999999996s)]
*  Well, so traditionally there's been this phrase used when you're describing what [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=4074.3399999999997s)]
*  is reasonable and unreasonable when it comes to a search and seizure, what, like [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=4080.54s)]
*  when do you need a warrant versus not a warrant, et cetera. [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=4083.66s)]
*  And there's this phrase that has endured for a while, although you, you, uh, [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=4085.8999999999996s)]
*  criminal defense lawyers and prosecutors listening, I understand I'm about to [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=4090.3799999999997s)]
*  paint with broad brush here and there's lots of nuances, but there's been a [[01:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=4094.1s)]
*  phrase that has been used for a while. [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=4097.26s)]
*  That is reasonable expectation of privacy. [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=4099.78s)]
*  So if you're in a place where you have a reasonable expectation of privacy, like [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=4102.98s)]
*  your own home or in, you know, uh, in, in other circumstances, in a hotel room or [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=4106.14s)]
*  other places, then that's this sort of zone of protection, but if you're out in [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=4112.26s)]
*  public, out in public, you've generally not been deemed to have a reasonable [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=4117.5s)]
*  expectation of privacy. [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=4121.42s)]
*  And so things like, you know, uh, traffic light cameras or CCTV. [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=4122.98s)]
*  I hate traffic light cameras. [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=4128.099999999999s)]
*  This is where this is the two wolves inside of me. [[01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=4129.419999999999s)]
*  I'm like, I pretty much hate all this unless you're talking about, we're using [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=4131.299999999999s)]
*  it to find violent criminals. [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=4135.379999999999s)]
*  Then all of a sudden I get interested, but then I'm like, wait a minute, does [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=4136.86s)]
*  that mean that I'm being inconsistent? [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=4139.46s)]
*  You know? [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=4141.419999999999s)]
*  Well, no, you're being perfectly consistent. [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=4142.219999999999s)]
*  You want to get away with your transgressions and you don't want anyone [[01:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=4144.62s)]
*  else to get away with their. [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=4147.419999999999s)]
*  Thank you. [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=4149.7s)]
*  Thank you, David. [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=4150.74s)]
*  I appreciate that. [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=4151.46s)]
*  I am consistent. [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=4152.139999999999s)]
*  It's an ethos. [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=4152.98s)]
*  It's an ethos, but, but yeah. [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=4153.9s)]
*  So I, I tend to be fine with CCTV in public spaces, but the devil's in the details. [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=4157.0199999999995s)]
*  Like, as you were saying, if you've got a bad AI model or you've got something [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=4165.54s)]
*  here that is creating a kind of. [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=4169.139999999999s)]
*  Drag net effect that could result in people, innocent people being sort of [[01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=4172.0599999999995s)]
*  grabbed, uh, disruption to innocent people. [[01:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=4175.98s)]
*  Racial bias in this, like the cameras. [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=4180.299999999999s)]
*  Determining black faces, which I could be possible particularly at night. [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=4183.099999999999s)]
*  And so then you end up getting people that are, that are drug in who they, [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=4186.0199999999995s)]
*  you think that they're violent criminals, but they get arrested for some [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=4190.5s)]
*  other like petty crime that they did. [[01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=4192.66s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=4194.74s)]
*  Like all of that stuff is a worry. [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=4195.179999999999s)]
*  So I would say in principle, a CCTV, um, presence in public spaces, I'm fine with [[01:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=4196.98s)]
*  it, but the devil would be in the details. [[01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=4203.219999999999s)]
*  Okay. [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=4205.379999999999s)]
*  I lied. [[01:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=4206.339999999999s)]
*  I do have one last topic. [[01:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=4206.7s)]
*  We've NBA playoffs are happening. [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=4207.66s)]
*  Both of our teams have been dispatched by the Oklahoma city thunder. [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=4208.9s)]
*  Uh, my team won three games years, one zero. [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=4211.7s)]
*  So I think, you know, uh, we had a little bit of clarity on how that, how [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=4213.74s)]
*  that series would have turned out. [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=4217.3s)]
*  Had we got to face each other. [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=4218.46s)]
*  Um, so therefore squads left, who are you rooting for? [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=4219.9s)]
*  Do you have a, who are you pulling for? [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=4222.62s)]
*  I gotta say I'm rooting for the Knicks. [[01:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=4224.26s)]
*  I've got to say, so I, I kinda go, um, I am a very geographic sort of span, [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=4225.94s)]
*  which is I root for the team where I live. [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=4231.9s)]
*  So that's Memphis, uh, is closer to me and went living in Tennessee. [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=4233.98s)]
*  But I also used to live in for a year in New York. [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=4238.98s)]
*  So I've got that. [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=4241.5s)]
*  I've been to the garden when it's rocking and the crowds going insane. [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=4242.58s)]
*  So I've got a tiny and then, Hey, I work for a New York company. [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=4245.9s)]
*  So I'm, they're not my first choice, but I'm riding with, I'm on, [[01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=4249.1s)]
*  I'm jumping on the next bit. [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=4253.22s)]
*  Very rarely are New York teams kind of like, you know, the fan favorite or the, [[01:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=4254.14s)]
*  the, you know, store, uh, New York teams have, you know, kind of like the best. [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=4259.18s)]
*  I even caught an underdog story feels overstated, but the Knicks have been bad [[01:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=4263.82s)]
*  for so long, it kind of is, uh, it's kind of nice and refreshing to see Madison [[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=4266.9s)]
*  square garden popping like this. [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=4270.86s)]
*  I got to go to a game a couple of weeks ago. [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=4272.0199999999995s)]
*  There was unbelievable. [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=4273.299999999999s)]
*  Jalen Brunson, all the Nova guys. [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=4274.82s)]
*  It's a big year for Nova. [[01:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=4276.58s)]
*  We have a Nova Pope, Nova Knicks. [[01:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=4277.62s)]
*  So it could be that my brother went to Villanova. [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=4279.86s)]
*  I'm with you. [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=4281.78s)]
*  I'm there. [[01:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=4282.259999999999s)]
*  I also have a, just a real soft spot for Anthony Edwards. [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=4283.0199999999995s)]
*  And so I w I wouldn't mind seeing the Timberwolves beat the Thunder. [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=4286.86s)]
*  I love Anthony Edwards. [[01:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=4289.54s)]
*  He's got some rough edges, but I like that about him. [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=4290.94s)]
*  He's so fun. [[01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=4293.54s)]
*  He's so fun. [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=4294.94s)]
*  I just, I'm tired. [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=4295.62s)]
*  Like, I feel like when I was growing up, there was all these great rivalries and [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=4296.38s)]
*  trash talking and a lot of the players now it's like politicians. [[01:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=4299.62s)]
*  Like a lot of the players have been trained by PR bots now and they're like [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=4302.74s)]
*  very, you know, you know what I mean? [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=4307.0599999999995s)]
*  And so they, they don't have, um, the personality that is not ant and Edwards [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=4308.74s)]
*  is just a phenomenal athlete as great as that. [[01:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=4314.34s)]
*  So that would be my other, the other, uh, my other rooting interest. [[01:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=4316.62s)]
*  Ant is incredible to watch, hilarious to listen to and a total mess. [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=4320.5s)]
*  Right. [[01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=4327.38s)]
*  It's just all things I love. [[01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=4327.86s)]
*  He is an absolute mess. [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=4330.099999999999s)]
*  But my fate, one of my favorite interactions was last year when, uh, they [[01:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=4332.22s)]
*  were advancing to the Western conference finals against the Mavericks and sir [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=4335.54s)]
*  Charles, you know, one of the great living Americans, Charles Barkley is [[01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=4339.46s)]
*  interviewing ant and he says, it's, it's been a while since I've been to Minnesota. [[01:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=4343.46s)]
*  And ant interrupts him and goes, well, bring your ass, bring your ass. [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=4348.18s)]
*  It was so funny. [[01:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=4352.14s)]
*  And in the moment you hear the studio breaking up and like, it was just like [[01:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=4354.0199999999995s)]
*  this complete interject. [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=4358.22s)]
*  It was so funny. [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=4359.66s)]
*  And he was, uh, he was, uh, shouting at a fan recently and doing kind of the [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=4360.740000000001s)]
*  reverse Marco, if you remember what Marco said about Donald Trump's manhood. [[01:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=4364.820000000001s)]
*  And ant was, uh, was describing his in the inverse to a fan. [[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=4369.3s)]
*  I love that type of trash talk. [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=4374.22s)]
*  You know, I had to, if it had been Sarah Longwell and JVL on the pod, I would [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=4376.860000000001s)]
*  have been vulgar there, but it's David French. [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=4380.22s)]
*  I like to behave a little bit. [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=4381.9400000000005s)]
*  Um, it's, uh, I'm the only one who cursed him. [[01:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=4382.9800000000005s)]
*  I'm the only one who cursed. [[01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=4385.860000000001s)]
*  Is that true? [[01:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=4386.9400000000005s)]
*  You guys all on the cursed on the pod today? [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=4387.42s)]
*  What are you going to have to go? [[01:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=4389.3s)]
*  I just, I just said, you know, I just quoted an aunt, you know, so I don't [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=4390.06s)]
*  think you, did you say anything worse than ass over the course of the whole? [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=4394.9s)]
*  Usually. [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=4398.66s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=4399.74s)]
*  I just, sometimes they just come out. [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=4400.34s)]
*  I don't monitor my own. [[01:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=4401.58s)]
*  I I'm, I'm so conscious of it. [[01:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=4402.82s)]
*  It's like being around my mother. [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=4404.66s)]
*  I don't, I curse way less around my mother and it's like a subconscious. [[01:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=4406.18s)]
*  It's somewhere just inside of my little brain. [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knvkgI48FRA&t=4409.7s)]
