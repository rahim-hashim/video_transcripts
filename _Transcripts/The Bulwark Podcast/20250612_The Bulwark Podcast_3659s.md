Video Description: Trump is outright fabricating a justification for sending Guard troops into Los Angeles, and his directive is not limited only to LA. So, if someone acts violent during a 'No Kings' protest on Saturday somewhere in America, would he deploy the National Guard there too? The potential chilling effect on our First Amendment rights to protest is enormous. Plus, masks are liberating ICE agents to act with impunity, Kash is a thin-skinned beta cuck, and the new self-appointed chair of the Kennedy Center was greeted with a mix of boos and cheers on the opening night performance of "Les Miz."
Andrew Weissmann joins Tim Miller.

# “Beta Cuck” Kash Patel Did WHAT?! (w/ Andrew Weissmann)
**The Bulwark Podcast:** [June 12, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM)
*  breakdown of the federal district court rulings from from May. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=0.0s)]
*  96% of them went against the administration. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=4.24s)]
*  In April is 76% 51 of 67. So I mean, like, this is not precedented really, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=7.36s)]
*  like, just how much they're being rebuked. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=14.88s)]
*  Across the board, it's not just democratically appointed judges and nominated by Democrats, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=18.16s)]
*  Republican, including judges appointed by Donald Trump. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=26.080000000000002s)]
*  Hello, and welcome to the Bullock podcast. I'm your host, Tim Miller, delighted to welcome back [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=38.160000000000004s)]
*  Professor of Practice at NYU Law School. He was a lead prosecutor of Bob Miller's investigation [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=42.24s)]
*  of the Russia interference in the 2016 election, which actually did happen. And chief of the fraud [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=47.040000000000006s)]
*  section at the Department of Justice. He co hosts the podcast main justice with Mary McCord. He's [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=52.4s)]
*  got a sub stack called Behind the Headlines. He's on a little bit of a sabbatical, but not too much [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=57.04s)]
*  of one to, you know, take a break from hanging out with me. It's Andrew Weissman. Hello, how are you? [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=61.44s)]
*  This is kind of like vacation being with me. You know, is that that's sort of true, right? [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=67.75999999999999s)]
*  Really? You know, I, yeah, that's like a straight line for me to say, you know, many people say it's [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=73.28s)]
*  work. But I won't know. You're absolutely right. Look, it's all it is always a pleasure. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=79.12s)]
*  Back at you, my friend. We have a lot happening. Yeah, there is. And plenty in the legal front. And [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=86.4s)]
*  I was like going through the outline and I don't want to make the entire podcast about immigration [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=92.56s)]
*  law, but we got to do a lot of immigration law. Unfortunately, I think it's the nature of our [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=96.48s)]
*  moment. But we have today. So the governor of California gave a new son, the attorney general [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=100.08000000000001s)]
*  Robbanta, have a lawsuit against the administration. There's a hearing today. They are suing to end [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=106.24s)]
*  the what they call illegal and unnecessary takeover of the California National Guard unit. They argue [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=112.39999999999999s)]
*  the takeover violates the Constitution and exceeds the president's Title 10 authority. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=117.6s)]
*  What what do you make of that? Is there anything there? The Trump Justice Department says that's [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=123.28s)]
*  a political stunt. There's nothing to it. So, you know, I've been thinking about this [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=126.88s)]
*  and sort of the best way for people to understand what is going on. And I think [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=132.96s)]
*  I try and get my blood pressure down and discussing this. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=141.12s)]
*  Jai breath really quick. Yeah, exactly. I think you you have to look at this and you have to look at [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=145.28s)]
*  the way that this administration evoked the Alien Enemies Act to deport people to El Salvador [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=152.4s)]
*  in the same context. And what I mean by that is in both situations, the administration takes [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=160.48s)]
*  a tiny kernel of a fact and blows it way out of proportion and says to the courts, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=171.84s)]
*  you have to agree with our assessment of those facts. We are essentially torturing the English [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=180.48s)]
*  language to be able to do things that are absolutely authoritarian and contrary to law. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=187.6s)]
*  So in the Alien Enemies Act, the idea that we're invaded by the TDA gang is not true. There are four [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=196.64s)]
*  federal courts that have said no way that is torturing the English language. What is going [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=208.24s)]
*  on in L.A. is the same thing. People who participate in a demonstration where a small [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=214.56s)]
*  fraction of them do something illegal and participate in violence is not an invasion. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=225.04s)]
*  It is not a rebellion. It is not an attempted or risk of rebellion. It is not a situation where [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=232.72s)]
*  law enforcement cannot do its job anymore. Just to be clear, the law to send those people in [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=241.44s)]
*  requires there to be an invasion or rebellion or the law enforcement can't be sent in. So there takes [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=248.16s)]
*  kernel of a problem, blow it completely out of proportion in order to have an authoritarian [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=256.08s)]
*  regime where people are denied their rights. It is so outlandish and the courts unfortunately [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=263.28s)]
*  have developed law in the context of thinking about normal administrations [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=272.23999999999995s)]
*  where you don't have somebody acting, in my view, in complete bad faith in the way that they're [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=279.44s)]
*  assessing the facts. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=285.2s)]
*  Yeah. I guess my question then in this case is, all right, [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=288.0s)]
*  so let's say, I'm actually not sure which court, which circuit is here in the Newsome case today. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=298.64s)]
*  I see one of the California ones. But assuming they agree. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=304.08s)]
*  It's San Francisco. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=306.15999999999997s)]
*  Yeah. So assuming they agree with that assessment from you, then what? [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=307.76s)]
*  Right. I mean, is this something that you can really get emergency remediation from, [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=313.28000000000003s)]
*  from the Supreme Court? That's kind of hard to imagine for me, but maybe not. I don't know. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=321.12s)]
*  Well, assuming the court agrees that this is not lawful, they can say that you can't have 4,000 [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=326.32s)]
*  National Guard troops there. It's a slightly different issue when you're sending in federal [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=337.84s)]
*  military. So the Marines is a different legal structure, but it would be relevant to the 4,000 [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=345.2s)]
*  people there. By the way, one thing, since I'm discussing this as a lawyer, it is important to [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=351.84s)]
*  remember, just as a human being, talk about a complete overreaction to the situation. I mean, [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=358.47999999999996s)]
*  the reason that I think the law point I make, which is this is escalating something and [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=365.28s)]
*  torturing the English language to be authoritarian is because of the obvious point, which is you do [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=371.44s)]
*  not need to send in 4,700 military people to deal with this situation. I mean, this is supposed to [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=377.28s)]
*  be deescalating, not escalating. So it just tells you exactly what's going on. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=384.71999999999997s)]
*  Well, they want it. I mean, the politics of it, I was reading a real clear politics article this [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=390.55999999999995s)]
*  morning where they're on the record. It's not like TDS or MSNBC talk to be like, they want [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=394.08s)]
*  disorder. They say it. Trump says it. The MAGA advisors are like, this will be good for us in [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=399.59999999999997s)]
*  the midterms. They're not trying to quell the disorder. They are reveling in it. And so I do [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=404.56s)]
*  think about that. The other side of this political coin, though, is like, okay, [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=413.52s)]
*  I do think that's kind of regardless of whether it's true on the law, like it, I think you get to [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=416.72s)]
*  a pretty concerning place if it's like, okay, some judge in San Francisco says that the president of [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=426.72s)]
*  the United States can't call in National Guard troops. Right. I do think that that is a very dicey [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=432.96000000000004s)]
*  political situation. Right. I mean, that's something that you'd really have to take up [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=440.96000000000004s)]
*  to the Supreme Court. Yeah. No, look, it is the kind of thing that would go up and it would go up [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=444.8s)]
*  very quickly. But, you know, let me just give you an example of something where the courts, [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=450.48s)]
*  you know, it's going to be from a long time ago. But when President Truman tried to take over the [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=456.40000000000003s)]
*  steel mills and said, I need to do this because we need the steel for our military to fight in [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=464.24s)]
*  Korea, the Supreme Court said, no way. This is a civilian [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=470.72s)]
*  legal system and legal structure. And you are the commander in chief, but it is Congress's call as [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=479.12s)]
*  to whether they want to do that, not yours. And so again, this is, I mean, we're, it's so easy to [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=485.20000000000005s)]
*  understand that, but we're dealing in a situation where, you know, we don't have a Congress that's [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=494.32000000000005s)]
*  doing anything. So the President has just filled that vacuum because, you know, nature pours a [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=498.56s)]
*  vacuum, or in this case, you know, I would say Donald Trump pours a vacuum. A couple other things [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=504.48s)]
*  that we've been seeing in LA. And we talked about this a little bit yesterday with Mark Hurtling, [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=510.24s)]
*  but we had a general talking to somebody that had a B average in undergrad and didn't go to [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=514.96s)]
*  law school. So I don't know if we gave the most coherent description of posse comitatus for our [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=520.64s)]
*  listeners. And so that is the kind of other element here, right? There's this question of can, [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=526.24s)]
*  you know, the, either the federalized national guard troops or the [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=532.24s)]
*  Marines that are being sent in do law enforcement, like what are they allowed to do? What are the [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=536.72s)]
*  limitations? Of course, when you're at DOJ, something you're very familiar with. So like, [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=542.0s)]
*  let's talk a little bit about that. Yeah, sure. I mean, you know, this doesn't come up a lot. I [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=545.92s)]
*  mean, this is kind of thing where, you know, I was in DOJ for a long time, never came up because we [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=550.4s)]
*  don't have administrations like this. And I served under normal or, you know, Republican and [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=555.36s)]
*  Democratic administrations. It's not a political issue. So here's the thing. I don't recall coming [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=560.72s)]
*  up in Republican politics that there was a big anti posse comitatus wing of the party. People [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=568.24s)]
*  were very excited to, you know, take the military and police-ify them. But here we are. Yeah. So [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=573.52s)]
*  the posse comitatus act is a statute by Congress that, unless an exception applies, [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=581.12s)]
*  says that the military cannot operate domestically in our country to do law enforcement [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=593.6s)]
*  activities. When President Nixon called in the National Guard to help deliver mail because there [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=601.84s)]
*  was a postal strike, that was allowed because it had nothing to do with law enforcement. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=611.9200000000001s)]
*  Here, the argument is that they're not doing anything related to law enforcement. They're [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=618.48s)]
*  just protecting federal property. But the problem is it also has to be an invasion or rebellion, [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=625.2800000000001s)]
*  or there has to be a complete failure of law enforcement to be able to carry out its functions. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=632.4000000000001s)]
*  I don't see any of that as a prerequisite. Here's the big sort of, you know, elephant in the room [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=637.5200000000001s)]
*  is that at the end of the day, the way that the president would get around this is he would [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=645.2800000000001s)]
*  invoke something called the Insurrection Act. And you've been seeing them throw around the word [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=651.6s)]
*  insurrection a couple times. Absolutely. Yep. This is all a precursor to that. And to your point, [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=656.8000000000001s)]
*  I mean, politically, you raise it in an immigration context. So it makes people who feel like, [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=663.36s)]
*  you know, if you oppose this, suddenly it means you're for illegal immigration. And this is one [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=669.9200000000001s)]
*  where, you know, you can keep two ideas in your head at the same time, which is you can agree that [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=676.24s)]
*  the law should be, should not be violated, and should adhere to the law. And at the same time, [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=682.0s)]
*  you can think if you're in the country illegally, you can be deported lawfully. But it is simply [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=688.08s)]
*  not the case that just because there's some people in the country here illegally, that you just then [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=695.36s)]
*  get to say, you know what, we get to violate the law and extracting them. This is why you had Judge [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=701.36s)]
*  Wilkinson in the Fourth Circuit, a really conservative, but highly respected jurist, [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=706.88s)]
*  saying it doesn't work that way. This is you have to comply with the law. If you want these people [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=713.12s)]
*  to be removed, there is a lawful way to do that that gives them due process, where you can respect [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=719.04s)]
*  the process. And I think this is, to your point, this is so deliberate to do this in a way that you, [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=725.84s)]
*  when you have people, you know, saying, oh, this these pesky liberals who are worrying about the [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=733.36s)]
*  niceties of the law, and they're doing it for people who are potentially in this country illegally, [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=738.96s)]
*  that's what it means to be a rule of law country. Yeah, right. There's one element of this LA thing [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=745.76s)]
*  that's really well, and everywhere now it's happening everywhere that is, it's getting under [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=754.56s)]
*  my skin. And I saw a legal angle on it. On social media, it's maybe a little fanciful, but I just [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=759.1999999999999s)]
*  wanted to toss it by you. And that is kind of like whether just I forget the the military side of [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=764.7199999999999s)]
*  this, like whether just the way that they're doing the immigration enforcement is also illegal. This [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=772.9599999999999s)]
*  is David Beer from Cato says that the Wall Street Journal is reporting on the conspiracy [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=778.0799999999999s)]
*  by the White House and ICE to violate the Constitution and conduct warrantless suspicionless [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=782.16s)]
*  sweeps of Hispanic areas of the country. This is referring to that Wall Street Journal story that [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=786.8s)]
*  Stephen Miller is like, just go to Home Depot, just go to 7-Eleven, like stop, you know, we got to get [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=791.4399999999999s)]
*  more people deported. Beer says this is a criminal behavior, and that the state police need to start [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=796.0799999999999s)]
*  investigating these crimes. It feels a little bit like a fantasy, but it does, it does feel illegal. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=802.24s)]
*  I don't know. I know that's not a technical law term, but it yeah, but right. I mean, like, if they [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=808.0s)]
*  don't have it's one thing if they're saying, hey, we're going to this Home Depot, because we have a [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=813.36s)]
*  deportation order for this one person that works there. And like, while we're there, you know, [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=817.92s)]
*  we're going to do sweeps. You know, okay, I don't know, I'm not for that. But that's one thing versus [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=823.2s)]
*  just, like, willy nilly going to areas where you think that there are a lot of Hispanic workers. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=828.64s)]
*  Um, look, so there's an equal protection clause is, is a potential claim that people have if you are [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=834.16s)]
*  choosing to target people based on what suspect classification, so race and nationality. The Fourth [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=844.48s)]
*  Amendment is a protection because everyone in this country has a protection about being seized or [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=854.16s)]
*  searched without there being probable cause. And so that's another protection. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=861.12s)]
*  That's true on immigration, right? Like, is probable cause like somebody doesn't have their [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=868.64s)]
*  ID? Is that probable cause? I don't know. Well, you have to, you would have to have a basis for [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=872.4s)]
*  just knowing that they don't have their ID. I mean, yes, you can just be clear that you can go to [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=878.24s)]
*  up to anybody assuming you're not targeting them for an improper unconstitutional purpose. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=883.44s)]
*  You can go up to anyone and voluntarily ask them, you know, can I see your papers, etc. But you know, [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=889.44s)]
*  the person doesn't have to respond, though the law is very liberal, though, in terms of what, [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=895.12s)]
*  what law enforcement can do. But here's, here's the real problem is, is that in general, what we're [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=900.6400000000001s)]
*  seeing is the administration is not giving those people their day in court. So all of these things [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=910.1600000000001s)]
*  where you're saying, oh, well, they might have a constitutional claim about or I'm saying they [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=917.68s)]
*  might have a constitutional claim on the protection clause, or they may have violated various immigration [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=921.28s)]
*  rules in doing this or the Fourth Amendment in doing this, all of that presupposes that they're [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=925.8399999999999s)]
*  going to have an opportunity to be heard. The reason that you had the Supreme Court rule 920, [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=930.64s)]
*  not once, but twice in this area is because this administration has denied due process to the [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=939.4399999999999s)]
*  people who have been summarily extracted from this country without due process of law. So they [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=947.28s)]
*  don't have the opportunity to raise any of these claims. There's been a couple other things I wanted [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=954.88s)]
*  to get you on just just generally speaking, only about some of the immigration stuff, but overall, [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=961.92s)]
*  like the Trump Justice Department's failures, and I wonder what you think and whether this when this [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=966.88s)]
*  might come to a head. I was asking before I had you on, our very capable lesbian in-house attorney [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=972.0s)]
*  for advice on what we should talk about. She pointed me to a breakdown of the federal district [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=982.0s)]
*  court rulings from May. 96% of them went against the administration. In April, it was 76%, 51 of 67%. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=989.04s)]
*  So I mean, like, this is not precedented really, like, just how much they're being rebuked. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=998.72s)]
*  But okay, like, what is what are the implications of that, like level of failure? [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=1005.76s)]
*  So, first, you know, the administration says about that, see, look how unfair the courts are. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=1011.9200000000001s)]
*  And, you know, the other response to that is, no, when you have an administration that has [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=1018.8000000000001s)]
*  never done so many things that are illegal. And the reason you know it is the latter and not the [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=1025.2s)]
*  administration is you can look at the identity of the judges who are doing this. And the identity [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=1033.04s)]
*  of judges is across the board. It's not just democratically appointed judges and nominated [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=1038.24s)]
*  by Democrats, it's Republican, including judges appointed by Donald Trump. And so that's a huge [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=1046.48s)]
*  issue. I think there's the other thing that I think gets not enough attention is that there's [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=1056.88s)]
*  a lot of things that the Department of Justice is doing that is lawful, but outrageous. So, you know, [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=1063.76s)]
*  we're talking about the things that are outrageous and unlawful. But as a friend of mine said, [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=1071.92s)]
*  who used to be who's a Republican and a former white collar prosecutor, he said, this is the golden, [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=1077.76s)]
*  you know, age for being a white collar criminal. There's it is just a shutdown of the, you know, [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=1084.5600000000002s)]
*  public integrity section, the fraud section that I used to run at the Department of Justice. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=1094.0s)]
*  They just announced essentially that the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act prosecutions are being [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=1099.3600000000001s)]
*  destroyed. What is in the fraud section? Like, what are some of the things that you were [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=1105.0400000000002s)]
*  prosecuting that now we're not going to be looking into? So one of the really big cases that we did [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=1110.5600000000002s)]
*  as I was leaving was the Volkswagen case. So Volkswagen had gained the system and was selling [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=1119.44s)]
*  cars as environmentally friendly when in fact, they basically turned off that they were anything [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=1126.6399999999999s)]
*  but they sort of figured out a way to turn on the environmentally friendly engine when it was being [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=1132.72s)]
*  tested. And then immediately it went off. And this was Yeah, and just you know, people in Germany are [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=1137.9199999999998s)]
*  now being prosecuted for people were prosecuted here, the company paid a fortune here and pled [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=1146.32s)]
*  guilty to a felony. And it was an unusual corporate crime, because it was actually [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=1152.0s)]
*  orchestrated from above. And sort of in the way it sort of was discovered was that people below [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=1159.36s)]
*  were like, you know what, we're not we're not down with this. So that's one example, their [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=1165.76s)]
*  corporations that were like, and on huge financial institutions engaged in various frauds [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=1173.12s)]
*  that affect millions and millions of people across the country. Maybe there in us in the fraud [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=1181.04s)]
*  section. There in this was not in the fraud section. But let me give you just another example [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=1186.72s)]
*  of crimes that the fraud section prosecuted in the health care unit. There is just one example, [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=1192.32s)]
*  a doctor who falsely told his patients that they had cancer, so that he could charge them for [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=1200.0s)]
*  chemotherapy, and then also wasn't actually even treating them for what was there. So not only did [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=1210.08s)]
*  they go through, you know, chemotherapy is not a benign thing to go through. So they went through [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=1217.36s)]
*  all of that, they went through this psychic issue of that their family went through it, all for greed. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=1224.3999999999999s)]
*  And so these are really I mean, so you can have that sort of an outrageous crime on a small scale, [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=1232.32s)]
*  and then there were crimes that huge corporate crimes that affect people can affect people [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=1239.76s)]
*  monetarily can affect the environments like Volkswagen, all of these are really, really [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=1246.4s)]
*  important things. And, you know, this administration is saying essentially, if you're a rich white person, [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=1252.08s)]
*  you know, we're not really in the business of looking out for, you know, the crimes that you're [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=1259.6s)]
*  committing. I used to, you know, I basically spent 20 years of my life, I used to say I was [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=1265.2s)]
*  basically prosecuting sort of like corporate executives. And it's just hard to see that that's [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=1269.76s)]
*  gonna go on anymore. Yeah, I mean, what's because when they talk about law and order, they're not [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=1276.24s)]
*  talking about that, right? Like, it's just like they don't Trump doesn't see like corporate crime, [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=1281.6000000000001s)]
*  theft, scams as crimes, because he committed them many times and has been, you know, whether it be [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=1287.1200000000001s)]
*  Trump University, you know, you get a judgment against him on or all those right that he did a [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=1293.84s)]
*  multi-level marketing scheme and MLM scheme he was involved in National Review did a long report on [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=1300.0s)]
*  that back in the day. So, you know, I mean, I think that's like a big part of this. Yeah, I mean, let's [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=1305.12s)]
*  let's not forget, he is a convicted felon. I mean, yeah, I mean, right. If you have a criminal, [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=1312.0s)]
*  if you have a white collar criminal in the White House, I'm not surprised by the fact that he [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=1320.72s)]
*  doesn't want to go after white collar crime. It's just, you remember on day one that Pam Bondi [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=1328.56s)]
*  started as the Attorney General, she issued it's a lawful thing to do, but she issued a memorandum, [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=1334.24s)]
*  basically gutting, you know, all of these areas that are so important for holding people to account [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=1340.72s)]
*  and also equal justice. It should not be because you're rich that they or white, you know, can [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=1349.36s)]
*  correlate that you suddenly are immune from criminal investigation. Yeah, how did I immediately [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=1357.6799999999998s)]
*  get my political hat on? You know, and I want to think like, there has to be a populist angle for [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=1365.6s)]
*  the Democrats here. Just like listening to you talk about this. It's like these, you know, [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=1371.1999999999998s)]
*  these guys claim that they're for the forgotten man and they're going after the elites and going [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=1376.4s)]
*  after the deep state, but it's like the opposite. Like they're letting you go through the partons [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=1380.6399999999999s)]
*  and talk about the sort of the nature that the number of people who are pardoned, who engaged in, [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=1386.6399999999999s)]
*  you know, grift. And it's like, why are those people getting pardoned when you have a lot of [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=1395.44s)]
*  small fry, if you were going to try and do this in an even-handed way, who don't have the, you know, [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=1402.56s)]
*  the wherewithal to have influence with the people deciding who's going to get presented for a pardon [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=1410.0s)]
*  to the president? Yeah. And I just think that like, I don't know, I'm trying to cast this person in a [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=1416.48s)]
*  movie, but like the Democrats need like a character who, you know, sounds like a working man with a [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=1424.48s)]
*  southern accent to start being like, they're, you know, they're letting all the fucking fat [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=1431.44s)]
*  cats get away with every, I mean, you know, Huey Long, honestly, like, that's not really my kind of [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=1436.24s)]
*  politics, but like somebody that can like get this through to people that it is the people that are [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=1439.92s)]
*  screwing over regular folks that are getting, letting, being let off scott free right now, [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=1444.8s)]
*  left and right. And to this point, my buddy texted me yesterday about one of the U.S. attorney's [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=1449.28s)]
*  offices. And I want to kind of just get your take on this without getting into the details. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=1455.6000000000001s)]
*  It's my understanding this is happening everywhere, but that essentially at one of the U.S. attorney's [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=1459.92s)]
*  offices, it's not in a border state. They're still redirecting resources essentially entirely to [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=1465.2s)]
*  immigration issues and that they have people coming in from D.C. that are focused on that. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=1473.92s)]
*  And the folks that are working on stuff at, you know, out in these various, you know, regional [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=1478.64s)]
*  offices, maybe not all of them, but a good proportion of them are being pushed to, you know, [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=1484.56s)]
*  focus their energies and resources on immigration. And is that your kind of understanding? And how [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=1491.2s)]
*  does that, and just talk to us about how that works, like from being inside DOJ. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=1496.0s)]
*  Sure. And this is an example of elections have consequences. I mean, there's nothing just to be [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=1500.32s)]
*  put in context of our broader conversation. There's nothing unlawful about it. It's just a question of [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=1506.1599999999999s)]
*  is it something that is you're listening to this and your viewers are watching? Are they sitting [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=1511.12s)]
*  there going, hey, this is a good idea? So a U.S. attorney's office is usually, it's that sort of [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=1515.76s)]
*  federal level. They're not that big. Even the largest are not that big. I worked in the U.S. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=1522.8799999999999s)]
*  attorney's office in the Eastern District of New York. That's sort of Brooklyn and Queens. It's [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=1528.4799999999998s)]
*  part of the New York sort of offices. And that was about a hundred or so criminal prosecutors. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=1532.56s)]
*  That's really big for a U.S. attorney's office. If you suddenly take people and say, okay, 30 of you [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=1541.44s)]
*  are now being moved. So the other things that are being looked at are organized crime, gang [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=1549.6s)]
*  prosecutions, gangs that are sort of emerging gangs that prey on lawful immigrant groups that [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=1557.68s)]
*  come to New York that are now limited. I sort of traditionally have gangs to start. You have white [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=1566.5600000000002s)]
*  collar crime that we've talked about. And suddenly you're pulling resources from that, all sorts of [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=1573.28s)]
*  economic crime. And then you have terrorism. And that, I think this administration is acting [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=1579.28s)]
*  as if there is no domestic or foreign terrorism threat. And that is just so foolhardy to think [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=1588.32s)]
*  that. And so you are pulling those resources. And that's why the sort of a rational discussion [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=1598.3999999999999s)]
*  is about what is the cost of doing this? And so that is where it just doesn't make a lot of sense [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=1606.96s)]
*  to me that you would be doing that when you really need that. You have limited federal resources. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=1616.32s)]
*  And there's so much that really has to be done at the federal level to prosecute the kinds of [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=1623.12s)]
*  cases we're talking about. You got to hit your quota with Stephen Miller. You don't want Harry [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=1628.3999999999999s)]
*  or Sarah Miller getting mad at you. So just like a process, I'm trying to understand how this works [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=1632.0s)]
*  and how much independence everybody has. So when you were at the Eastern District of New York, [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=1636.96s)]
*  you talked to the deputy attorney general and are like, here's the kind of cases we're prioritizing. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=1642.24s)]
*  Are they, how would Todd Blanch or whoever would be the point person that DOJ influence this? [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=1646.56s)]
*  So that is one where as a matter of sort of what can DOJ in fact do, DOJ in fact can instruct [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=1655.2s)]
*  and tell the local offices exactly what they have to do and how they're going to allocate [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=1666.32s)]
*  within congressional bounds. But they actually have that power. It's just that in most administrations, [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=1674.88s)]
*  it is exercised only around the edges. There's an enormous amount of deference to the US attorney [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=1682.64s)]
*  for a whole variety of reasons, but usually because the US attorney was selected by a sitting senator [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=1690.0s)]
*  who gets proposed to the president and then the US attorney is actually nominated by the president. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=1697.04s)]
*  So they have some independent clout. And so usually the attorney general and the deputy attorney general [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=1703.68s)]
*  are careful before they step on those toes. But Pam Bondi and Todd Blanch can just reach in and say, [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=1711.44s)]
*  do this and don't do that. We saw that in the Eric Adams case where they basically pulled the case [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=1720.72s)]
*  eventually from the Southern District of New York and moved it to DC. And they directed them as to [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=1727.1200000000001s)]
*  exactly what they were going to do, including saying that you're going to move to dismiss the case [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=1732.96s)]
*  without prejudice. And you saw what happened, which is people both in the field in the Southern [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=1738.24s)]
*  District of New York and people in public integrity resigned over it, which is completely abnormal. [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=1745.1200000000001s)]
*  It's just, you know, that is something the only time we've seen that in any recent time is in Trump [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=1752.0s)]
*  1.0. Yeah. Meanwhile, Eric Adams might end up being your best option for mayor in your city up there. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=1757.68s)]
*  We'll see how it shakes out. You got the beret guy as a Republican, who knows? [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=1767.2s)]
*  Well, I can't really, I don't do like political things, but I just, I know, I just, [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=1771.92s)]
*  I just, there are in fact better options. [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=1782.24s)]
*  There are better options than the beret man and Eric Adams and Andrew Cuomo? [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=1788.16s)]
*  Yes. [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=1792.48s)]
*  We'll see. TBD on that. That's a bold statement. We'll see how your wise fellow citizens. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=1793.12s)]
*  Yeah. What I'm saying, there are better options. I'm not sure they're polling all that well, [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=1799.4399999999998s)]
*  but I'm just saying there are better options. I mean, I might as well seize it now. I have a [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=1804.56s)]
*  little interview with Zoran who is not, who's on the far, far left for me coming up. Maybe we might [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=1809.4399999999998s)]
*  have a bonus pod for people this weekend. So keep an eye out for that. It's quite the, quite the field [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=1815.12s)]
*  that you've got there. There are the little, it's, I feel, it feels welcoming for me. [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=1820.48s)]
*  Now that I've, you know, whatever left the Republican party and more aligned on the other side. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=1825.36s)]
*  My favorite Republican was always the one finishing in last in the primaries and all [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=1829.44s)]
*  of these things, because I always liked the moderate squish. And now I just am living the [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=1833.44s)]
*  same experience. My favorite Democratic person in the mayor's primary has 2%. So, you know, it's just [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=1837.44s)]
*  the people and I are not aligned, unfortunately. [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=1843.52s)]
*  All right, y'all. I've been trying to get in shape for pride month. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=1850.96s)]
*  I'm going to the gym from time to time and was in the market for some new, you know, [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=1855.68s)]
*  gym clothes with the mesh liners, you know, what you're, I'm sure those of you that go to the gym [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=1861.92s)]
*  know what I'm talking about. I don't know. I'm doing my best over here. And luckily we got a [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=1866.72s)]
*  new sponsor that provided in my mode of need. It's fair Harbor. This episode is brought to you by [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=1871.44s)]
*  fair Harbor. They makers of the world's most comfortable swimwear. If you're heading to the [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=1878.32s)]
*  beach or a vacation coming up, you can prep pack their Breeze knit lined trunks and say goodbye [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=1883.76s)]
*  to mesh lining forever. I should mention lid to the intro. I wear Speedos. So the need for [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=1889.4399999999998s)]
*  the fair Harbor trunks look great. Great. Great for trunk. If you're a long trunk person. [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=1895.6799999999998s)]
*  But hence the reference to why I'm using them at the gym. You know, the mesh lining and swim [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=1900.8799999999999s)]
*  trunks that every guy hates with fair Harbor's built in box or brief liner. Their trunks are [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=1904.72s)]
*  softer than anything you have ever felt before. Fair Harbor trunks are perfect for swimming, [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=1910.64s)]
*  lounging or soaking up some sun, a variety of designs and styles make finding your favorite [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=1915.04s)]
*  pair easy. And fair Harbor's super soft built in liner keeps you comfortable all day. You'll [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=1920.0s)]
*  never go back to the mesh line trunks again. I already put mine on there in kind of a [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=1924.72s)]
*  coral red color looking good. I gotta tell you, I'm into it. Maybe a father's day gift [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=1931.44s)]
*  along with swim trunks. Fair Harbor carries a full line of casual clothing. I picked up a linen [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=1937.84s)]
*  shirt. Their shorts, shirts and hoodies let you relax beyond the beach. And if the rest of the [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=1941.6799999999998s)]
*  family gets jealous, they've got kids styles too. Ready to ditch your old swimwear. Fair Harbor [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=1946.48s)]
*  makes the most comfortable trunks you'll ever wear. Chaff-free quick drying and built for all day [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=1951.76s)]
*  comfort. Upgrade your collection and get 15% off your first purchase. Head to fairharborclothing.com [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=1956.08s)]
*  and use code BULWERK for 20% off your first purchase. Once again, that's fairharborclothing.com [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=1961.84s)]
*  What else do I have for you? All right. Komi. When I asked about this, I also want your take. [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=1974.4s)]
*  I'm obsessed with this, because again, it's something that having not been in any of these [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=1982.72s)]
*  agencies, I don't really understand how it works, like the process works. But the DHS is just [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=1987.2s)]
*  spending way more than they have been allocated. And Christine Elm. And Chris Murphy really put it [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=1994.08s)]
*  to Christine Elm on this the other day. And I want to play that for you and just kind of get your [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=2001.84s)]
*  thoughts on it. I say this with seriousness and respect, but your department is out of control. [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=2007.28s)]
*  You are spending like you don't have a budget. You're on the verge of running out of money for [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=2013.3600000000001s)]
*  the fiscal year. You are illegally refusing to spend funds that have been authorized by this [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=2017.28s)]
*  Congress and appropriated by this committee. You are ignoring the immigration laws of this nation, [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=2021.8400000000001s)]
*  implementing a brand new immigration system that you have invented that has little relation to the [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=2026.16s)]
*  statutes that you require, that you are commanded to follow as spelled out in your oath of office. [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=2030.8s)]
*  You are routinely violating the rights of immigrants who may not be citizens, [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=2035.92s)]
*  but whether you like it or not, they have constitutional and statutory rights [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=2039.44s)]
*  when they reside in the United States. We've covered the second half of that quite a bit, [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=2043.04s)]
*  but on the first half, it really strong there from Chris Murphy, but on the first half, [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=2047.68s)]
*  like what, how did that, I guess if Congress doesn't care, they can just spend what they want, [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=2051.44s)]
*  but where are they getting the money from? I just, I don't understand how it's working. [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=2057.44s)]
*  Yeah. So, I mean, this is, you know, the Supreme Court case that I was sort of alluding to involving [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=2061.12s)]
*  Truman, the famous concurrence by Justice Jackson, where they uphold congressional authority. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=2070.72s)]
*  He ends it by saying, you know, we can do this for Congress, but, you know, it's yours to implement. [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=2078.72s)]
*  Like if you, Congress, don't sort of have the backbone to do what you need to do, [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=2086.64s)]
*  this is all for naught. And, you know, I think that's what we're seeing. And so, [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=2094.3199999999997s)]
*  as much as the Senator did a great job, you know, he's not in the majority. And so, in terms of [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=2100.8799999999997s)]
*  actually having enough money, I mean, presumably they will run out of money, but they will, [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=2108.24s)]
*  they could get it in a re-off. If they were to take it from something that was not allocated to [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=2113.76s)]
*  them, again, that can be against the law. But I think a lot of people sort of watching this are [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=2120.6400000000003s)]
*  going to be like, yeah, and who's going to do anything about it? That's the tick. You know, [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=2127.6000000000004s)]
*  remember we started with the tick tock band. Who would have standing? Yeah, who would have standing? [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=2131.92s)]
*  Congress. Congress. That's right. I mean, the tick tock ban was how this started, where the tick [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=2136.0s)]
*  tock ban was imposed by Congress. It went to the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court says it is lawful. [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=2144.0s)]
*  And then Donald Trump says, yeah, we're not implementing it. And Pam Bondi issues a letter [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=2151.2000000000003s)]
*  to tech companies saying, don't worry about putting them on your platforms, because essentially [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=2157.1200000000003s)]
*  we're not going to prosecute it. And so when you start that way, this is sending a message of [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=2163.92s)]
*  what are you going to do about it? Any doubts for you in the American Constitutional Republic? [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=2173.6s)]
*  I just look at this and it's like, we never had considered really before, and I guess besides [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=2181.2000000000003s)]
*  treatment of black folks, but like outside of that, never really considered before like the notion [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=2186.88s)]
*  that maybe Congress would just decide not to do anything and that the president and that the [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=2190.48s)]
*  administration could just do whatever they want and that there isn't really a remedy for it. Like [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=2196.4s)]
*  that option hadn't really crossed my mind. Yeah. I mean, look, the one thing that Donald Trump has [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=2202.32s)]
*  clearly shown is that our checks and balances are clearly not sufficient. I mean, that if you have [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=2208.96s)]
*  somebody who is pure id work, you know, to an homage to my psychologist mother, you know, [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=2217.12s)]
*  somebody who doesn't have this sort of external controls that you're counting on Congress, [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=2226.88s)]
*  you're counting on the courts. And, you know, ultimately, though, you have to we've sort of [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=2233.6s)]
*  learned you have to count on the American people caring enough. They're going to do something about [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=2237.68s)]
*  it because these sort of institutional checks and balances have a lot of flaws. And obviously, [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=2242.72s)]
*  we talked a little bit about the pardon power, but that is a way to completely gut the legal system, [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=2248.24s)]
*  at least at the federal level. Psychologist mother, that's just trying to explain things. [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=2255.04s)]
*  I'm starting the picture is starting to come in. The full picture is starting to [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=2259.68s)]
*  come into focus. That's pure nerd. Yeah. Said when some of my colleagues have worked [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=2265.7599999999998s)]
*  my mother at the Denver live show, they're like, Oh, okay, now I get it. That makes sense. Now, [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=2272.56s)]
*  I'll rapid fire there a couple of these other immigration things, because we spent too much [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=2279.12s)]
*  time in a bit. But the just really quick the ice covering faces, not identifying themselves. [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=2281.6800000000003s)]
*  Like, okay, so I really try not to curse. So the closest I'm going to get, but it's not really what [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=2287.52s)]
*  I'm thinking is what the hell. I mean, just to clear that is so unwritten, it's so outrageous. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=2295.12s)]
*  We are not during this is not COVID. You don't look at the idea that they're the only reason to [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=2305.92s)]
*  do that is to both scare people and to not be able to be held to account. So that you have sort of [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=2312.3199999999997s)]
*  this anonymity. And I think it also has this effect, again, to channel sort of psychology. [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=2321.04s)]
*  Once you do that, I think it sort of in some ways liberates you to do to act worse, [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=2327.92s)]
*  because to act with impunity, because you're sort of covered. Right. Obviously. And so I just think [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=2335.04s)]
*  it is it is unbelievable that there aren't people like bosses, this is where you know, this is where [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=2341.92s)]
*  you want adults in the room to be like, that's not happening. And what we've seen in this [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=2349.7599999999998s)]
*  administration, there are no adults in the room. And from a prosecutor's perspective, [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=2354.96s)]
*  you also have to be like, wait a minute, this is going to create issues, right? Like as far as, [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=2358.48s)]
*  you know, it depends, right? I know, we've seen some of these arrests, these people are not getting [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=2363.44s)]
*  their Miranda rights read to them. They're not even admitting that they're cops half the time. [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=2367.6s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, that's, you know, they're limited, the issues, obviously, if they're not read your [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=2372.96s)]
*  Miranda rights, that's, that's one thing, but wearing the mask is something that is, you know, [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=2378.88s)]
*  there's no constitutional right to be arrested by somebody who's not wearing a mask. So maybe [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=2386.32s)]
*  we should have thought about that. Yeah, but it's the thing. But again, this just goes to the idea [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=2392.8s)]
*  that is this what you want? Is this what you voted for that you want? These people work for us, [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=2400.32s)]
*  not vice versa. And that's what's just so outrageous about this. [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=2407.36s)]
*  I think sadly, it is what people voted for. And then finally, I just, I can't, obviously, I can't [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=2412.96s)]
*  not mention the case regarding Andre, Hernandez Romero, federal judge Boasberg ruled last [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=2419.52s)]
*  Wednesday, this group of Venezuelans must be provided a legal avenue to contest the [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=2427.2s)]
*  administration's accusations. There are gang members. I appreciate that Boasberg described [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=2431.9199999999996s)]
*  the process of these removals as being akin to a scene from the Kafka novel, The Trial, [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=2436.48s)]
*  which, which is a good read, people haven't checked that out since college. And, you know, [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=2443.6s)]
*  I, again, I don't know what the remediation is for these folks, but it's maybe kind of good. [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=2449.12s)]
*  But look, Judge, it is good. You know, we just had our podcast on this, Justice, and I have to say, [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=2455.12s)]
*  I'm a little exasperated. I mean, it's a 60 plus page decision that it yes, it does say they can [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=2463.76s)]
*  be a class action. But the heart of it is something that I think American citizens are like, [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=2472.88s)]
*  wait a second, you said these people have due process rights, and they're entitled to [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=2478.1600000000003s)]
*  be there. You have to do something government to facilitate their release into the, so they have [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=2483.36s)]
*  a right to have to be heard and to be heard in court. That was already set by the Supreme Court, [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=2490.0s)]
*  not once, but twice. I was just like, Judge Boasberg, can we move on? I mean, it just read [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=2496.6400000000003s)]
*  to me like you need to just get to the point where the government either is going to agree [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=2502.88s)]
*  to the court order or not and just have a fine point on it. You have to actually just say, [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=2510.4s)]
*  we're doing it. And I think what he ended up saying is, okay, I'm going to turn to the government and [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=2516.2400000000002s)]
*  say, what are you proposing? That could have been done as soon as the Supreme Court said for the [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=2523.28s)]
*  first time that their due process rights were violated, or maybe it could have been done right [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=2529.84s)]
*  after the second time. And the reason I'm being, you're hearing this exasperation, and I have [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=2535.04s)]
*  enormous respect for Judge Boasberg, is these people are still in a God forsaken foreign prison [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=2539.6s)]
*  where they were put in violation of due process. That is not me saying that. That's the Supreme [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=2546.96s)]
*  Court 920. So these people's rights are currently being violated. There should be some sense of [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=2551.92s)]
*  urgency about reviting it. It's not crazy to say that life is in danger. I mean, talk about [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=2559.36s)]
*  urgency. We've seen this person. We don't have proof of life for Andrei and some of these people. [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=2564.8s)]
*  Can you just think about this? Let's assume that there is one person there who they put there by [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=2570.96s)]
*  mistake. We know that's already true with respect to Abrego Garcia, that he was not supposed to have [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=2577.2000000000003s)]
*  been taken in violation of a court order. So that means that that person is denied their day in court. [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=2583.76s)]
*  I mean, so it is the reason for the exasperation on my part is [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=2593.6s)]
*  it's hard to imagine if these were people with clout politically in a different economic [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=2603.12s)]
*  and racial composition, that there would be the tolerance for the amount of delay that has gone [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=2614.24s)]
*  on while they're stuck in a prison. Amen to that. Okay, last, last, I lied. One more last immigration [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=2621.04s)]
*  one because we just have to hit it with regards to Mahmoud Khalil, district judge Michael- [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=2628.8s)]
*  Farbyars. Farbyars. There we go. Said he could not be removed or detained based on Rubio's [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=2634.8s)]
*  determination. The government has till tomorrow morning at this time, the time of our taping [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=2641.12s)]
*  right now to appeal. I saw some folks saying they expect Khalil out in the next week. [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=2645.6s)]
*  Where are you at on the Khalil saga? You know, we'll see. I mean, I could see them just appealing it [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=2652.08s)]
*  on that. I mean, you know, we'll see. You know, the district judge did sort of give the government [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=2659.52s)]
*  time to potentially appeal to the Third Circuit. I'm not really sure why they wouldn't do that. [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=2669.44s)]
*  The only cases I know where they really haven't appealed is in the law firm cases where [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=2678.48s)]
*  I think they've gotten everything they want, so there's no reason for them to appeal. [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=2685.76s)]
*  My one piece of good news I keep trying to bring up when discussing all these immigration cases [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=2693.68s)]
*  is with regards to Khalil and us. So in both the kind of whatever you want to call the bucket of [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=2698.0s)]
*  State Department deciding you're a bad student and we can detain you bucket and the DHS deciding [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=2703.6s)]
*  you're a gang member based on your tattoos and we can send you to a foreign Gulag bucket. [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=2710.96s)]
*  There's no reason to believe that they had planned on stopping where they stopped, [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=2715.92s)]
*  right? Like the Khalil and Oz Turk and this group, including Andre and others that were sent to [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=2719.36s)]
*  Venezuela, like that was the plan. Like they were planning on sending more people to El Salvador [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=2725.2s)]
*  and they're planning on taking more student leaders and they haven't yet. Doesn't mean that [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=2729.68s)]
*  they can't start again between now and when this taping comes out, but it does feel like a win for [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=2733.68s)]
*  both the legal and political pushback on this that kind of we're still talking about that same [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=2740.16s)]
*  initial tranche of cases. Small silver lining there? No? [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=2746.8s)]
*  I'd say small silver lining because on those things it hasn't gotten appreciably worse. [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=2753.6800000000003s)]
*  But there's an endless array of outrage to go forward. I mean the LA piece is just the [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=2765.52s)]
*  beginning. This is a point that I'm not the first to make which is I want to make sure everyone [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=2774.96s)]
*  understands that president's directive was not targeted to LA. It applies to any place in the [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=2779.52s)]
*  country. And so the number one sort of issue that I've been hearing from people about is [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=2787.12s)]
*  if we participate in a peaceful protest on Saturday or at some other time and one person [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=2794.7200000000003s)]
*  is violent or even somebody foments it to create a ruse, are we all going to get locked up? Is the [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=2803.04s)]
*  military going to suddenly be brought in around the country? And the idea that that's what we're [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=2812.16s)]
*  talking about is that kind of chilling effect on the First Amendment is, I mean it's hard for me to [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=2817.6s)]
*  do the optimistic ending. Way to just take my silver lining and just like throw it in the trash [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=2828.08s)]
*  compactor and turn on the like, I'm shredding it. I'm basically going to him like what planet are you on? [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=2835.36s)]
*  Okay great. It's fine. It is in the spirit of the Borg podcast. A listener and fan gave me a button [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=2844.0s)]
*  at the Nashville event that said it gets worse before it gets worse, which I liked. [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=2849.92s)]
*  Listen, I'm no Tim the Toolman Taylor, okay, around the house fixing stuff. I don't know if [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=2858.56s)]

*  officials? Is there then any progress on any of that or is that all just Jimmy and the courts? [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=2968.4s)]
*  Jimmy It is going its way through the courts but that is again just to give you bad news. I mean [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=2974.0s)]
*  it's pretty clear the Supreme Court is going to overrule this case called Humphrey's Executor. [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=2982.48s)]
*  It sounds really nerdy but it's not because what it means is that the executive, the White [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=2988.32s)]
*  House will have more power to get rid of people and to have more political operatives in government [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=2995.6000000000004s)]
*  and have fewer independent bodies and that's like the last thing we need. [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=3002.8s)]
*  Two other random items just for you that are just kind of in what I would call the Andrew [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=3010.8s)]
*  Weissman remit. The FBI Director Cash Patel filed a lawsuit in Texas if you saw this against [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=3016.0s)]
*  an MSNBC colleague of ours, Frank Fugluzzi. Patel is suing him for quote fabricating a specific [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=3024.4s)]
*  lie about him and in response to Fugluzzi saying that he's been more visible at nightclubs than on [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=3031.84s)]
*  the seventh floor of the Hoover building. I guess Patel saying he's not been to a nightclub so [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=3037.68s)]
*  that's the basis of the lawsuit. I don't know, the free speech absolutists, pretty alarming [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=3042.7999999999997s)]
*  that the FBI Director allowed on his plate would be suing a pundit. So I don't know, on the other [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=3048.24s)]
*  hand, I guess I'd probably, sorry to Frank, but I guess I'd probably rather be spending his time on [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=3056.3199999999997s)]
*  stupid shit like this and going to hockey games than the most nefarious things he could be doing [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=3060.8799999999997s)]
*  but I don't know. Do you have any thoughts on that? So yeah, I had not seen that. [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=3065.52s)]
*  But this is what I would say having been in government, you know, you go into government, [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=3071.84s)]
*  you develop a thick skin, you're going to be criticized by people. [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=3079.52s)]
*  Were you criticized at all at the Mueller, during the Mueller investigation? [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=3084.1600000000003s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. I mean- Any non-factual critiques of you from anyone across the entire [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=3086.96s)]
*  punditocracy? I guess it might, let's see, who can I think of who might have done that? Well, [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=3094.4s)]
*  yeah, wait, the president. So, you know, like I've been called scum, a really bad guy, [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=3098.8s)]
*  Steve Miller called me a degenerate and a moron. And here's the thing, when you're in government, [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=3106.0800000000004s)]
*  you develop a thick skin and you know you're going to get batted around on all so different sides. [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=3114.7200000000003s)]
*  And that's why the mantra is just sort of like, you keep your head down and you have to just be [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=3120.32s)]
*  trying to do the right thing all the time. And if you get called on it, that's your defense, [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=3126.32s)]
*  is like, that's what you're trying to do. So it's just such poor form. And, you know, [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=3131.68s)]
*  I think the biggest concern I have is the chilling effect of bringing things like that. [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=3137.12s)]
*  It seems like what you're saying is that Cash Patel is a thin-skinned beta cuck. [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=3144.08s)]
*  I think that would be a technical term for it. But I'm not gonna put that into your mouth. [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=3148.32s)]
*  Yeah, well, so I think you're gonna be like a, what is it, a co-defendant of Rex. [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=3152.8s)]
*  Now, I don't think that there's any factual statement that can be attributed to there. [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=3160.88s)]
*  I mean, I guess he could, maybe he's taking a test. I wouldn't put it past somebody like Cash, [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=3166.4s)]
*  a little guy like that, to have taken a test that proves that he's an alpha. Maybe he's taken like [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=3171.52s)]
*  a testosterone test and that he can bring to the court and say, this is not true. I was defamed [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=3175.36s)]
*  by a podcaster who said I was low T, but I had a doctor show that I'm high T. That's possible. [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=3181.68s)]
*  Are you thinking about that at all when you're popping off these days? Are you feeling chilled? [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=3189.04s)]
*  I'm not because my view is, I mean, I think it is more important than ever [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=3195.6s)]
*  to be speaking out. And, you know, this is gonna sound a little, you know, soapboxy and polyannish, [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=3203.44s)]
*  but you and I are privileged to be able to do this. And I think the reason that, [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=3210.3199999999997s)]
*  like a lot of people come up to me and to thank me, but I think what they're really thanking is [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=3216.56s)]
*  like somebody, we're allowed to voice something that they're thinking and thinking they're alone. [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=3221.3599999999997s)]
*  And so, you know, I just think that is incumbent. And obviously we have to be, you should be careful [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=3228.3999999999996s)]
*  about what you say, but that's always true. I agree with this. No, they're trying to, [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=3234.7999999999997s)]
*  you know, and everybody's just more sensitive now. Like there's just stuff I hear about stuff [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=3241.6s)]
*  that I hadn't heard about, you know, like, well, is this thing exactly right? You know, [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=3245.04s)]
*  like when you're using figures of speech or, you know, but I'm just, I don't, I'm not being [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=3248.24s)]
*  bullied. I'm not gonna be bullied by these little guys. If you want to go to the Texas, [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=3255.7599999999998s)]
*  I'm in Louisiana. I don't know if the Louisiana district would be as favorable to them. You'd [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=3259.04s)]
*  think there's some free speech just judges out there that are like, you know, I think that we [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=3262.8s)]
*  can have a little bit still in this country as of right now, as of June 12th, also all the FBI [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=3266.8s)]
*  director low T without worrying that you're going to get without worried that you're going to be [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=3273.2000000000003s)]
*  jailed. So that's also when you're, let's just remember when you're a public, you know, a public [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=3276.8s)]
*  figure and obviously the FBI director is, I mean, really he, he thinks that Frank or anybody, [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=3282.5600000000004s)]
*  you have to be willing to show actual malice and there are all sorts of things. [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=3289.12s)]
*  And he knew for a fact, you know, never been to a nightclub. He'd seen his whole calendar. He knew [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=3293.6s)]
*  that he'd never been there. And then he met like that. I know it'd have to be like that level of [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=3297.7599999999998s)]
*  knowledge, but we've seen the other guys fold. I mean, that was true in some of these other cases [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=3301.2799999999997s)]
*  with the media folks, which I don't want to get into. Okay. Fun final topic, which is in the [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=3306.48s)]
*  Andrew Wiesen remit. I assume you're a musical person. You're, I know your opera. Do you do [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=3311.36s)]
*  musicals as well? You know, I'm more, I'm more concerts than an opera and, but I do. Since I'm [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=3315.68s)]
*  a New Yorker, I go to the theater a lot and that's like that straight plays musicals, everything. [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=3323.6s)]
*  Oh, okay. Longtime listeners of the pod would know that I'm not a musical gay. It's the one, [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=3329.3599999999997s)]
*  it's the one part of gay culture. I just am a total zero on yesterday. The president and vice [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=3334.7999999999997s)]
*  president went to see a musical at the Kennedy center. Wait, went to see, as I understood it, [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=3341.36s)]
*  Les Miserables. Yeah. Right. I don't know what that's about. Do you know what that's about? [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=3350.32s)]
*  I don't, which is the point of where I'm going. So still hold up one second. I don't know what [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=3356.1600000000003s)]
*  it's about and here's why. And I want to demonstrate you. Jay sent a tweet about his attendance [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=3360.32s)]
*  and he wrote this about to see Les Miserables is how you pronounce it. According to Andrew, [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=3365.52s)]
*  about to see Les Miserables with POTUS at the Kennedy center. Me to Usha. So what's this about? [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=3370.64s)]
*  A barber who kills people? Usha hysterical laughter. There are a couple of issues with [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=3376.8799999999997s)]
*  this tweet for me because I can't, I can't, I don't understand what's funny about it because [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=3383.04s)]
*  I don't know what happens in Les Miserables. And I assume maybe there was a barber. I don't know. [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=3388.8799999999997s)]
*  I don't know what's in the mood. And my colleague, Sonny Bunch points out that this is the kind of [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=3394.16s)]
*  thing that you put out. If you do know what happened in Les Miserables actually, but you [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=3398.48s)]
*  are too embarrassed to admit that you're into fancy boy plays. And it seems like JD Vance is [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=3403.6s)]
*  doing that. He's pretending that he doesn't know because I don't, I literally don't understand the [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=3409.36s)]
*  joke. So I'm hoping you can explain it to me. I can't. And it is true that he, I agree with [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=3414.16s)]
*  your colleague who says that he's doing this because he does know, but it's not for the reason [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=3419.92s)]
*  that you're suggesting. So one that is it about a barber who kills people? That's based on the [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=3424.32s)]
*  Stephen Sondheim musical Sweeney Todd, which was about Sweeney Todd was a barber who killed people. [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=3430.48s)]
*  And then they got chopped up. So JD Vance proved that he didn't know about musicals by referencing [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=3437.28s)]
*  an even lesser known niche musical that I'd never heard of until. Okay. Can I just say, never repeat [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=3442.88s)]
*  that again, which is like, it is like an incredibly good Stephen Sondheim. Do you know what Stephen [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=3449.76s)]
*  Sondheim is? I've heard the name Stephen Sondheim. I know that he's a person that exists. [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=3454.4s)]
*  If you said the category in jeopardy was Stephen Sondheim plays, and then the first question was [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=3460.1600000000003s)]
*  name one, I would have been unable to do that until right now. I could do Sweeney Todd, I guess. So, [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=3465.44s)]
*  okay, for all of the people who are watching this, who are shocked beyond belief. The OGs know already. [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=3471.0400000000004s)]
*  Okay, we're gonna, we're gonna have to do a little remedial help. But okay, so that's, he was [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=3477.68s)]
*  referencing Stephen Sondheim's Sweeney Todd, which by the way, they got chopped up and they got put [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=3484.0s)]
*  into meat pies, and then people ate them. So it was a cannibalism musical. Okay. But the reason he [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=3488.7999999999997s)]
*  was doing this is Les Miserables is about the French Revolution. And it's about the people rising [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=3498.56s)]
*  up against a king who is an authoritarian. So the idea that you have him, you have tanks going [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=3505.68s)]
*  through Washington DC in a military parade on Saturday, he has the 4,700 military people being [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=3516.7999999999997s)]
*  called in, you know, let's take a bazooka to go after a fly in LA. And he's issuing all these [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=3523.68s)]
*  orders and he's going off to see Les Miserables is, I mean, you know, this, what do you say irony [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=3531.84s)]
*  is now or satire is now dead? Do you, I mean, Trump is a theater queen. So he knows, like, [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=3539.52s)]
*  does he not understand, does he, does he think that the, again, I don't know the plot. So maybe [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=3545.28s)]
*  I'm missing, does he not, does he think maybe the people to get overthrown or the hero? Does he think [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=3548.96s)]
*  the king is a hero? The king doesn't come off well in Les Miserables, because you know what happened? [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=3553.28s)]
*  Confused? Trump be confused about that? What happens in the French Revolution to the king? [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=3558.8s)]
*  Let's just say his, his head and the rest of him are separated. So maybe Trump doesn't, [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=3563.44s)]
*  maybe doesn't identify with the king and thinks he's a nicer person. I don't, I don't know. What [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=3569.6000000000004s)]
*  do you think is going through his little head? Like what are the little flies, you know, buzzing [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=3573.92s)]
*  around? What does this make America have the guillotine again? I mean, I'm not going to say [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=3578.0s)]
*  what I would have thought about that, because I don't want Cash Patel coming after me. But [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=3584.0s)]
*  the guillotine, that's something to look into, I would say. I don't know. I'm open. As it's kind [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=3589.1200000000003s)]
*  of similar to my thoughts about Seacat and El Salvador. It's something that I'm against until [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=3594.88s)]
*  I start thinking about sending Marco there. And then all of a sudden I'm like, huh. [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=3599.44s)]
*  You have a future in this administration. [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=3602.88s)]
*  No, Andrew Weisman. That's the meanest thing you could say. I kept you too long. You're on holiday. [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbVK6Iv8SeM&t=3606.0s)]
