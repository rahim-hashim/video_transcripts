# E. Jean Carroll: I’m Going to TAKE Trump’s Money and GIVE It to Everything He Hates!
**The Bulwark Podcast:** [July 01, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0)
*  I will see if you remember this, but you did pique my interest. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=0.0s)]
*  You had a line in there where you said Alina Haber reminds me of something, [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=2.8000000000000003s)]
*  but I'm not going to say what it is. But now I need to know. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=8.0s)]
*  I need to know what was it. What were you thinking? We're just on the podcast. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=12.48s)]
*  Oh, God. Okay. What I was thinking of, have you seen a dead fish on a slab of ice? [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=16.48s)]
*  Of course, yeah. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=23.6s)]
*  Okay. Have you really seen that? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=24.72s)]
*  Oh yeah, I'm with the New Orleans girls. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=26.72s)]
*  Hello and welcome to the Bullard podcast. I'm your host, Tim Miller. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=30.0s)]
*  I'm delighted to be here up first with a person that wrote the [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=39.36s)]
*  Ask E. Jean Carroll column for 27 years for Elle magazine. It's since moved to [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=43.519999999999996s)]
*  Substack and she also has a new book, Not My Type One Woman vs. A President at Long Last. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=47.519999999999996s)]
*  We've got E. Jean Carroll on the podcast. How you doing, girl? [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=52.16s)]
*  Oh, Tim, you are such a faithful reader of Ask E. Jean. I can just tell. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=54.64s)]
*  You never missed a column. I know I can tell. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=59.92s)]
*  It is so funny you start with that because I asked my friend Dan Savage, as gay, I was more [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=63.52s)]
*  partial to the Dan Savage advice column, I must say. And I said, what should I ask a fellow [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=70.48s)]
*  advice columnist? And he said, you should ask E. Jean what you do if someone tells you they've [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=74.72s)]
*  been reading you for years and then asks you a question you've answered a hundred times already. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=80.8s)]
*  So what do you do in that situation as an advice columnist? [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=87.2s)]
*  Let's just say Dan Savage is one of the premier great advice columnists of all time. Okay. You [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=90.56s)]
*  couldn't have talked to anybody. As a matter of fact, he should be here sitting here instead of [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=100.8s)]
*  me. No, Dan Savage. Well, I think he'd be happy to not be here because he wouldn't want Donald [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=105.2s)]
*  Trump touching him, I think. No, he would not. No, he would not. And Dan Savage would have [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=109.68s)]
*  gotten out of that dressing room faster than I would because he's in very good shape. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=116.16s)]
*  Well, I don't know. You might have that. You have kind of a spirit of a, you have that dog inside [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=123.2s)]
*  you, as they say these days that maybe Dan doesn't. I don't know. I don't have a dog inside me. I have [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=128.32s)]
*  a cheerleader. A cheerleader? I have a cheerleader. People can already tell. I said this yesterday, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=136.32s)]
*  at the very end, I said, we've got such a fun guest coming tomorrow. And then I said that, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=141.76s)]
*  and I kind of caught myself because the book is about sexual assault. And so that's not really a [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=146.56s)]
*  fun thing to talk about, but the book is, it's fun. How did you manage to deal with all of this in [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=151.92s)]
*  such good spirits? Well, Tim, I found myself in the middle of a high comedy. Have you been in a [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=160.72s)]
*  courtroom, Tim? You've been in a courtroom. Yeah, I've been in a courtroom a couple of times. We're [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=170.24s)]
*  not going to do the details because my mother doesn't know about one of them. But yeah, I've [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=174.8s)]
*  been in a couple of courtrooms. So I found myself surrounded by characters that not even Jonathan [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=178.16s)]
*  Swift could have created. It was so absurd and so bizarre. I had to get it down. And when I started [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=186.0s)]
*  to write it down, when I started to take notes, when I spoke every night into my iPhone, the notes [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=195.04s)]
*  so I wouldn't forget, it was coming out funny. It was just coming out funny. Just the details were [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=200.56s)]
*  funny. So that was the truth. That's what I wrote. And I think people are really sort of liking it. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=207.2s)]
*  Well, I include myself among them. I have to say, I have to live the Donald Trump life, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=217.68s)]
*  so I don't like reading about it. And so I was a little bit like, do I have to go relive this trial [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=223.04s)]
*  like through the news? And I opened the book. And it begins with probably the most delightful [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=228.64s)]
*  list of consensual sex partners I've ever heard. I may be the best list. This is how you start the [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=236.88s)]
*  book. And I was like, Okay, now I'm talking now we're talking a gentle ladies, eight men total, [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=242.23999999999998s)]
*  only one one night stand. They include an Olympian, the man who opened the door for Neil Armstrong [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=248.0s)]
*  when he landed back on earth, Chris Guest Brother Dumbledore. So many acclaimed actors. I think they [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=254.32s)]
*  might have an EGOT if you put them all together. What a list. Well, first of all, Alina Haber Esquire, [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=260.48s)]
*  the fabulous Alina Haber Esquire, who is Trump's most beautiful attorney. And she is the as you [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=269.92s)]
*  know, the acting attorney right now of New Jersey. She's stunningly beautiful. She's I know you're [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=277.44s)]
*  frowning. I can see your frown. I'm frowning. No, she's not for me. She's highly intelligent, [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=285.92s)]
*  deliciously arrogant. And she she's highly intelligent. EG, she was a parking lot attorney [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=292.79999999999995s)]
*  before she was deposing you. I don't care. I don't care. Listen, who got elected? [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=299.52s)]
*  Well, not EG. All right, excuse me, not not Alina. I mean, no, no, she got him elected because [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=305.76s)]
*  after the trial every single day, she went out and spoke to the reporters and said that everything [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=312.15999999999997s)]
*  that Judge Kaplan said she could not say anyway, Alina asked me, she said she hated to ask me, [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=316.56s)]
*  but could I possibly tell her everybody I've ever slept with? That was her question. Now, [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=326.08s)]
*  she did this. No, she never said that. Oh, yeah, she should have said that. Because I did not put [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=334.48s)]
*  the very man the whole deposition was about. I didn't put him on the list. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=342.64s)]
*  She did it to shame me. Yeah, she did it to try to make me look like a floozy. But of course, [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=346.48s)]
*  it was the one thing I love talking about. Right. I love my lovers. And it was I hear you, [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=353.6s)]
*  Guff. I hear you. Can you also love the lovers? Apparently, may I stand up and let him out? [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=360.88s)]
*  Yeah, you had to ask about the lovers. It drives the dogs crazy. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=368.16s)]
*  I did have to ask about the lawyers because it made the book. It was such a great choice to start [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=375.6s)]
*  with it. I went from I went from dreading reading the book to wanting to turn pages. I mean, I [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=380.32s)]
*  wanted to learn more actually about the eight men. Well, one of them showed up at the book party. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=385.2s)]
*  See, most of them, I am 81. So many of the men. So do you. Thank you. I'm not 81 now. Yeah. Well, [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=392.4s)]
*  you will be. One came to the book party, and it was fabulous. And he was 88. And he walked in, [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=402.15999999999997s)]
*  he had all his brain. He was adorable. It was great seeing him. I introduced him to the crowd. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=411.91999999999996s)]
*  So that was yeah. So she meant to humiliate me. She meant to drag make me look like a cheap, [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=417.2s)]
*  huzzy slut, you know, skank and all the words of the ad. But no, oh my God, it was a moment. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=424.96s)]
*  And Robbie Kaplan's. Yeah, she was next to me. Yes. The world's greatest civil rights attorney, [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=433.12s)]
*  who was born with a lust for competition. Her brush. Yes, she heard this list. And as I named them off, [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=442.48s)]
*  when I said, Ben Boreen, she rocked forward in her chair and beamed at her notebook, it turns out at [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=456.64s)]
*  the end of the deposition, she says, and just for the record, Ben Boreen is the first Broadway star [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=469.12s)]
*  I saw in my first Broadway play. So that ended the deposition. It was quite. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=477.68s)]
*  It was a great list. You didn't memory hole anyone. I mean, there was not a single [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=485.2s)]
*  miss on there. You know, I mean, we all make bad choices sometimes. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=489.2s)]
*  Eugene, there was no. No, I'm picky, picky, picky. Very picky. I make bad choices, but not about men. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=493.52s)]
*  I'm pretty good about men. Well, it was a wonderful way to start. And you're right about [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=504.0s)]
*  Robbie. She's the best. She argued the Windsor trial in front of the Supreme Court. I had her [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=510.8s)]
*  on the pod maybe last summer. And we talked a little bit about your case. So folks should go back [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=516.56s)]
*  and listen to that. She's unbelievable. So I want to I wanted to ask about Alina Habba. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=520.48s)]
*  I'm pretty disappointed in your initial comments. You're not at all alarmed about the fact that this [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=529.04s)]
*  is the U.S. attorney. I mean, you seem a little bit more impressed with her than I was. But [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=533.36s)]
*  no, she's highly intelligent. No, she seems vindictive, though. It's not a great trait for [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=538.5600000000001s)]
*  a U.S. attorney, I wouldn't think. No, no, she's full of revenge, full of revenge. They're living [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=544.32s)]
*  and dying for revenge. It's she's Uma Thurman in Kill Bill, running New Jersey. I understand this, [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=551.36s)]
*  but I can't do anything about it. All I could do, Robbie and I beat her. We beat her. Now, [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=559.84s)]
*  you would have enjoyed some delicious moments in court because Trump treated her with such [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=569.76s)]
*  disrespect in the courtroom. He snarled and snapped at her and told her what to do, [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=576.8s)]
*  told her what to say, told her to stay. He kept saying, stand up, stand up. And then she would [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=583.6s)]
*  stand up and would have no idea why she was standing up because she didn't know what she [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=589.28s)]
*  was supposed to object to. No, he really tortured her. But she took it and then she stood up and [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=594.96s)]
*  then she defended him and defended him. And he would snarl and snap. It was, you know, she ate a mile [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=603.52s)]
*  of his garbage just to praise him. It was not pretty to be in the courtroom watching that. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=613.12s)]
*  You, I will see if you remember this, but you did pique my interest. You had a line in there [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=619.92s)]
*  where you said, Alina Haber reminds me of something, but I'm not going to say what it is. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=624.8s)]
*  But now I need to know. I need to know what was it? What were you thinking? [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=631.4399999999999s)]
*  We're just on the podcast. Just you. Oh, God. Okay. What I was thinking of, [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=635.68s)]
*  have you seen a dead fish on a slab of ice? Of course. Yeah. Okay. Have you really seen that? [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=639.76s)]
*  Oh yeah. I live in New Orleans, girl. We go to the fish market all the time. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=647.12s)]
*  Oh my God. Okay. So. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=650.8s)]
*  Porgeys. Recommend it. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=652.4s)]
*  So you've seen fish on ice that are still alive and we think they're dead and their [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=654.32s)]
*  mouths are closing and opening like this on the slab of ice. That's Alina Haber. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=662.08s)]
*  Okay. Now that is the kind of description that I was hoping for. That's more of my alley. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=668.16s)]
*  I need to ask you about, there's one disappointing thing in a postscript to the book I want to ask [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=677.12s)]
*  you about, which was my first question when Robbie reached out, which is, is this cheap [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=681.2s)]
*  bastard ever going to pay you? What's the status of the money? [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=686.5600000000001s)]
*  Well, he will pay after he gets done exhausting the appeals. And every time he's appealed in the [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=690.16s)]
*  United States court of appeals, second circuit, he has lost to Robbie Kaplan. She just argued [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=701.76s)]
*  last week on the $83.3 million. First of all, the arguments are flimsy. Second of all, [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=709.04s)]
*  Robbie Kaplan tore the roof off the second circuit last week. She was like, well, I said Henry the [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=716.48s)]
*  fifth in adjunct court. I couldn't help myself. I mean, she blistered him. And then your honors, [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=726.64s)]
*  he stood up during my final summation and walked out of court. She was brilliant. She was brilliant. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=734.56s)]
*  So he's going to lose that. And then he will exhaust those appeals and then he'll go to the [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=742.64s)]
*  Supreme Court. Now, Tim, let me ask you. Okay. What do you think the chances are the Supreme Court [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=749.52s)]
*  wants to take a case where the president has been found liable for sexual abuse [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=756.72s)]
*  and huge damages? Do you think they want to take that case? [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=764.48s)]
*  Tim Cynova You know, it seems unlikely to me, [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=768.0s)]
*  but I would be surprised. I've been surprised before. I don't know. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=770.3199999999999s)]
*  Mary Flaherty Seems unlikely. There's a lot they've got to do right now. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=772.88s)]
*  Tim Cynova Yeah. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=777.6s)]
*  Mary Flaherty There's a lot. They're very busy tearing apart. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=777.92s)]
*  Tim Cynova So then in your mind, is it like, do you get like one of those big checks, like from [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=782.24s)]
*  Publishers Clearinghouse? Or how does it, how would it work? [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=786.64s)]
*  Mary Flaherty That'd be great. Wouldn't that be great? [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=789.36s)]
*  I would love to have you come in with one of those big checks. But I'll tell you, [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=791.52s)]
*  you know what I'm going to do with it? If there's one thing Trump loves, and just loves and worships, [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=794.96s)]
*  it's his money. So I am going to take that money and I'm going to give it to everything he hates. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=802.48s)]
*  Tim Cynova I love that. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=811.52s)]
*  Mary Flaherty I don't really care about money myself. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=813.44s)]
*  So let's just torture Trump by giving it. Let's give it away for women's reproductive rights. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=819.36s)]
*  Tim Cynova Yeah, let's give it to the immigrants that he's [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=827.44s)]
*  sending to El Salvador. Mary Flaherty [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=830.5600000000001s)]
*  See, yes. See, and it's changing day by day what I'm going to give the money to. So I'm going to do [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=832.4s)]
*  publicly on Substack for everything we send them. I have an official foundation. And everything we [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=839.52s)]
*  support and send money to will be made public. So we can all join in. And if you have ideas, [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=850.56s)]
*  Tim, and I'm sure you do. Tim Cynova [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=857.76s)]
*  I've got some nominations. So things are coming straight to mind. Yeah. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=859.3599999999999s)]
*  Mary Flaherty Really? What, really? [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=862.2399999999999s)]
*  Tim Cynova Well, I mean, I'm obsessed with the El [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=863.92s)]
*  Salvador stuff, as I mentioned. And I mean, you know, like the poor, we're just now into July, [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=866.56s)]
*  we did a Pride Month fundraiser last month for Andre, the makeup artist who's been sent to a [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=871.3599999999999s)]
*  fucking hole in El Salvador with no rights. So that is something that jumps straight to mind. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=877.68s)]
*  But I'm sure we could think of other things. People, the trans folks have been kicked out [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=884.4s)]
*  of the military. That seems pretty good. So maybe what would bug Trump the most would be like to [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=890.0799999999999s)]
*  give money to some of his other rich rivals. But I guess we probably shouldn't do that. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=895.84s)]
*  That probably wouldn't count. Mary Flaherty [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=900.88s)]
*  Wait a minute, we could give it to Elon Musk. Tim Cynova [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=902.8000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, Elon, right? Mary Flaherty [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=904.72s)]
*  Oh my god, that would drive him insane. Tim Cynova [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=906.48s)]
*  Or at least asking him for an idea. That's, we can keep brainstorming on how to torture him [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=909.6800000000001s)]
*  more about that. I do like that. I wonder though, if it wasn't, if you don't care about money, [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=915.9200000000001s)]
*  what, why, I mean, why did you put yourself through this? [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=921.2800000000001s)]
*  Tim Cynova You could have done anything. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=924.0s)]
*  You could have fed your dogs and hung out. Mary Flaherty [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=928.3199999999999s)]
*  Well, the plot of the whole two trials was this kid from the sticks of Indiana, [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=930.88s)]
*  grows up, becomes a cheerleader and a beauty queen and a journalist, finds herself in front of [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=937.76s)]
*  Bergdorf's, running into this guy named Donald Trump. And what happens is so horrible, [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=947.28s)]
*  she doesn't speak about it. And then at 75, she finds her voice and at 80, [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=954.0s)]
*  she goes to trial and beats him. There was a drive behind this to get back at him, [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=962.4s)]
*  which was so strong in me, so strong to not let him get away with this. It took two trials. And [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=969.28s)]
*  I'm still extremely happy we did it, Rob and me. Tim Cynova [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=978.64s)]
*  There's a satisfaction in it. Mary Flaherty [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=985.36s)]
*  Total satisfaction. Tim Cynova [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=988.0s)]
*  Was it the fact that he won again? Did that take anything away from you? [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=989.6800000000001s)]
*  Mary Flaherty That wasn't great. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=993.28s)]
*  Tim Cynova It wasn't great for me either. I just wonder. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=995.52s)]
*  Mary Flaherty It's got to be part of it that like, part of it was tough to take. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=1000.3199999999999s)]
*  Mary Flaherty Well, I'm just mad that people didn't get off their lazy asses and get out there and [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=1003.68s)]
*  vote. You know, we just didn't get out. And now we're all sitting in our houses on our lazy asses, [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=1008.3199999999999s)]
*  doing nothing now as he's tearing everything to shreds. So I'm wanting people to leave their houses [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=1013.1999999999999s)]
*  and go out, look at your neighbors, organize a little thing, stop, just get off your ass. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=1022.48s)]
*  Doesn't it drive you crazy? Tim Cynova [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=1029.84s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I try not to think about it. I try to just look at my little box here in my room and [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=1032.24s)]
*  just rant and do my part. Mary Flaherty [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=1036.56s)]

*  Thank you. But I well, not really. I mean, you know, like you said, he won again. It is it's a [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=1040.4s)]
*  mix. Let's just be honest. Like, I don't know, I felt mixed about I'm sure Robbie did too. It's like, [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=1044.72s)]
*  you know, there are certain things we did. And we felt good about what we did. And obviously, [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=1049.44s)]
*  I didn't go through anything like that you went through. But then for him to still to not get the [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=1053.2s)]
*  fucking comeuppance is a tough pill to swallow a little bit. You know, I mean, you at least got [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=1058.64s)]
*  them to get the comeuppance on the money, which is nice, but it's still a tough pill to swallow. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=1064.48s)]
*  Mary Flaherty Oh, I think we I think if I keep thinking, [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=1068.32s)]
*  just fucking leave the house, everybody leave the fucking house, and we may be able to get [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=1073.68s)]
*  something done. I am a I'm a Paul not really. He's a fact. But I'm appalled at my fellow citizens [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=1080.72s)]
*  really, really. Really? Tim Cynova [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=1088.24s)]
*  Same. You find yourself out the dead. I was in New York this when he won't the day after. And I [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=1092.4s)]
*  found myself this is a horrible trace. I'm just admitting that this is horrible that this thought [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=1098.3200000000002s)]
*  come across my brain or just being honest. I found myself walking down the street, not too far [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=1102.56s)]
*  from Bergdorf's actually, and like looking at people and just being like, did were you did you [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=1106.8s)]
*  fucking did you do this? Yeah, were you were and then looking at another person like, did you not [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=1111.6799999999998s)]
*  show up? You know, and like getting mad at strangers, just stereotyping them, which is a totally [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=1115.9199999999998s)]
*  irrational, insane thing to do. But it is no, no, that's rational. No, that's the rational reaction. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=1120.96s)]
*  That's the rational reaction. Just being blase is the irrational. If you look around what's going [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=1128.24s)]
*  on. I mean, how hot is it right now in New York? I've heard it's hot. I wasn't up there. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=1134.96s)]
*  Where are you? New Orleans. It's hot as balls down here. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=1142.48s)]
*  Okay. Shouldn't that be enough to drive us outside? Come on, shouldn't that be enough? I just [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=1146.64s)]
*  yeah, no. Okay. So you and I are fed up, but and you have a big soapbox. I'm trying. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=1156.48s)]
*  And I have a little soapbox. So let's get it's getting bigger though. Hopefully with that, [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=1163.04s)]
*  with that sub stack, once we get to decide what's this, how to spend your money, I'm starting to [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=1167.36s)]
*  think about that. What can I ask you a little bit more about the deposition like of having to watch [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=1171.12s)]
*  him? I guess let's, let's go back to the positive. Having to watch him get kind of humiliated, had to [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=1176.48s)]
*  be sort of joyful. And when he confused you with Marla, did that sink in immediately for folks who [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=1181.6s)]
*  didn't listen? He's on the, Robbie shows in the picture of where you and him were together, [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=1188.48s)]
*  because he said he'd never met you. And he looks at the picture and he's like, is that Marla, [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=1192.56s)]
*  which is his ex-wife? How'd you, how'd you process that? [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=1196.48s)]
*  Well, it was Robbie Kaplan. Here's how devastating Robbie is. I do realize to him that she told him [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=1200.3999999999999s)]
*  three times before she showed him a picture of me, that she was going to show him a picture of me. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=1210.5600000000002s)]
*  She warned him, but Robbie, as you know, set trap after trap after trap and Trump fell into almost [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=1218.16s)]
*  every one of them. So when she comes up with this photograph of two couples, she said, can you have, [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=1228.16s)]
*  she didn't mention my name. She just says, can you identify the people in this photograph? [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=1234.88s)]
*  He looks at, he doesn't recognize Ivana, of course. And he says, you know, he recognizes my [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=1239.92s)]
*  ex-husband, John Johnson. Because he was on TV. He watches a lot of TV. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=1245.2s)]
*  Yeah. He watches TV. And then he said, and that's Marla. And Robbie didn't say a word. He said, [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=1248.96s)]
*  he said, yeah, that's my wife. And then Habba leaps in. No, that's Carol. Robbie was, you know, [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=1257.68s)]
*  it was perfect. And so the jury was shown this while he was sitting there in court, [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=1274.16s)]
*  you know, calling me Marla. And it was, I guess there's a, it was sort of a divine moment to watch [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=1283.76s)]
*  the jury. The jury was mesmerized by him anyway. Everything he did. They were just, oh, so delighted [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=1294.32s)]
*  by everything he did. But they were particular, their eyes all went to him while he was sitting [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=1301.84s)]
*  while after he made that mistake. So it was a wonderful moment. And Robbie showed that [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=1307.44s)]
*  deposition to the jury every chance she got. Yeah. I believe it. The other one, the other [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=1315.6s)]
*  kind of iconic moment in a more negative way from the trial, I was wondering how it struck you having [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=1322.32s)]
*  an A, having been through it personally, but also as a vice columnist, I'm sure you heard from lots [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=1328.24s)]
*  of women that dealt with sexual harassment. And Robbie says to him, well, Trump says, Trump's [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=1332.24s)]
*  asked for that access Hollywood tape. And he says, well, historically that is true with stars that [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=1340.48s)]
*  they let you do it. That's what he says. And then Robbie says, it's what do you mean? It's true with [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=1345.68s)]
*  stars. It's true with stars. They can grab women by the pussy. And, and Trump replies, well, that's [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=1349.1200000000001s)]
*  what, if you look over the last million years, I guess that's been largely true. Not always, but [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=1353.92s)]
*  largely true. Unfortunately, or fortunately. So he won't even grant that it's a bad thing. He's [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=1359.12s)]
*  like, maybe, or fortunately, maybe it's a good thing. This is his world view. He, he is the, [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=1366.56s)]
*  and he is, it's all in our bones. We love a strong man, as you know, we love a strong man. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=1375.36s)]
*  Okay, kind of the other way, but that's for, that's for the advice section at the end. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=1381.76s)]
*  So if, and part of being a strong man is having whatever you want, [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=1385.36s)]
*  having whatever you want. And he just has the right to have whatever women he wants. And as we know, [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=1394.56s)]
*  at least a dozen women came forward. Some say 23, some say 48. So he took what he wanted. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=1405.04s)]
*  And people voted for him because that's the sign of a powerful man. That's the sign. He can have [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=1413.76s)]
*  whatever we want. So of course he's not going to deny it to Robbie in a deposition. You know, [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=1421.68s)]
*  he's not going to deny it because he's talking to his people, talking to his people, and that's what [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=1427.04s)]
*  they want to hear. His voters want to hear. He can have anything he wants, and that's how it's been [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=1433.52s)]
*  for him in years. So vote for me. There's a moment where I felt like that was like that [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=1439.6s)]
*  the culture was rejecting that. And I don't know, kind of feels like we've backslid. I don't know. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=1444.72s)]
*  What do you think about that? Oh, yeah, no. Do women have rights in half this country anymore? No, [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=1451.2s)]
*  no, we've yeah, that's like, but that'll change. We can change it back. We can change it back. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=1458.08s)]
*  Yeah, we can change it back. I like your optimism. What the other women, you had several of them [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=1465.2800000000002s)]
*  testified at the trial and you've written about them. Just talk about their stories and like, [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=1471.2800000000002s)]
*  I don't know how you guys have connected. And I don't know at some level, I can't, it's hard for [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=1476.0800000000002s)]
*  me to put myself in your shoes, right? Like is that, is it nice to hear from other from them? [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=1482.16s)]
*  And is it a balm or maybe it's stressful? I don't know. What was it like to kind of build [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=1488.16s)]
*  a relationship with the other women that went through this? We have what is called the sorority. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=1492.56s)]
*  We have the strange sorority and it's the women who've come forward and we all banded together. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=1501.44s)]
*  We banded together on election night. That was a real downer. Yeah. You were all together or just [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=1507.12s)]
*  on text. We're on zoom. Zoom, yeah. And we do it, a couple of us are really struggling, really, [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=1514.32s)]
*  really struggling. The impact of him on their lives, it just crushed their lives. Others are [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=1526.8799999999999s)]
*  like me, I don't center my life around it. It happened. I tried to move on. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=1537.5200000000002s)]
*  So we help each other. So the strong help, the weaker ones are, they can come to the group and [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=1544.64s)]
*  say, things are tough right now. Things are so tough for women who have been [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=1551.7600000000002s)]
*  pounded by him and then have him go out and deny it. He denies it. So these women think [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=1559.2s)]
*  that everyone believes they're a liar and they're a whore. So it's hard to deal with. But the group of [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=1566.56s)]
*  us, you should come to it. I would love to. We have wine and we laugh our asses off most of the time. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=1572.6399999999999s)]
*  I would be honored to be included. I like talking about feelings and I hate Donald Trump. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=1586.08s)]
*  And I like wine. So that would be a good, I feel like I'd fit in. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=1590.56s)]
*  One of my hobby horses, you said you're mad at the people. One thing that I'm mad at is, [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=1595.4399999999998s)]
*  some of them I kind of hate media criticism because media is so big and some people are [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=1600.1599999999999s)]
*  better than others. That's just the way the world works. But with you guys, I felt like in 2016, [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=1604.24s)]
*  there was this big outpouring of coverage and interest around the Access Hollywood tape. So [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=1610.56s)]
*  it's like he admitted it, right? And these folks are coming out and then he wins. And then it's [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=1616.0s)]
*  like, oh, well, he wins. I guess people don't care and it goes away. And they'll cover your trial. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=1622.56s)]
*  But it's like, he doesn't get asked about this anymore. He hasn't been since he's won this time. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=1627.52s)]
*  Nobody, no journalist has asked him about the women that he assaulted anymore. It just gets [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=1631.6s)]
*  memory hold and that just really pisses me off. Well, right now we have more important things to [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=1637.2s)]
*  deal with than sexual assault. We have the democracy being split to smithereens. So sexual [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=1645.28s)]
*  assault is extremely important. But right now we got a fight on our hands. A fight. No, it's, [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=1652.8s)]
*  well, every time I see him, no, I've learned not to think of it when I see him because it's, [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=1661.28s)]
*  you know, the constant. He's such a bad man that it's astonishing to me [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=1667.2s)]
*  that we would vote for a man like that. Yeah. How, when you were having to go and do the [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=1680.96s)]
*  deposition and think, like, how did you kind of just deal with that? I mean, like, just the thought [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=1690.24s)]
*  of, oh, I've got to, you're writing about this in the book. Like I got to get dressed up a certain [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=1694.64s)]
*  way and I've got to talk a certain way and he's going to be in the room. And you know, what was [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=1699.68s)]
*  that like? Oh my God. Are you kidding? It was years. It was years. We remember we've been, this [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=1704.72s)]
*  is the sixth, we're as soon we'll be in our sixth year. So Robbie Kaplan prepared me. She and the [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=1711.76s)]
*  Carroll team prepared me. We did a mock jury, Tim. That's where you have typical New Yorkers [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=1722.08s)]
*  come into a ballroom. They're given lunch, breakfast and every other thing. And we put on an entire [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=1731.1999999999998s)]
*  trial for them. Then they split into three groups and the Carroll team watches them as they make [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=1736.3999999999999s)]
*  their decision. The mock juries all agreed on three major things. Number one, it's possible two people [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=1742.0s)]
*  could end up in a Bergdorf dressing room in 1996. Yes, they all agree. Two, they all agreed. Yes, [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=1751.6s)]
*  something sexual could have happened in a Bergdorf dressing room in 1996. All agreed on that. And [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=1759.6799999999998s)]
*  all of them totally agreed. One of those people could have been Donald Trump and one of the people [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=1766.1599999999999s)]
*  could have been E. Jean Caroll. All agreed. You know what they disagreed about? They thought I [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=1772.08s)]
*  wanted it. Because I was so old and unattractive and such a disaccaded old carcass, they could not [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=1780.64s)]
*  imagine somebody as glorious, as fabulous as Trump attacking me. So that was a problem. He's a genius [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=1790.48s)]
*  blob. He's horrific. He is like his makeup, the little tiny hands. Why would anyone? Well, the jury [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=1800.3200000000002s)]
*  sees him as the glorious Donald Trump. The hair? Yeah, no, the hair. That's horrible. No, the hair. [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=1810.88s)]
*  Okay. So then, that has to be pretty dispiriting that then you're like, well, I got to be hotter [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=1818.0800000000002s)]
*  to win this case? Yeah, I got to be fuckable is the word. So what we did is we looked, I had a [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=1825.2800000000002s)]
*  talk show, a TV talk show in 1996. I went through that. Some of the shows took screenshots of my [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=1833.68s)]
*  hair cut in a bob. And then I found the hairdresser and the makeup person who made me look like that [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=1842.4s)]
*  in 1996. She came every day to trial, did my hair and makeup exactly like it was in 1996. I wore the [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=1850.0s)]
*  exact same clothes I wore in 1996, the exact clothes. Yeah, they're back. It's back in trend. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=1858.88s)]
*  Yeah. Oh, I don't have a book here, but the thing I'm wearing on the cover, I bought it at Bergdorf's [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=1865.5200000000002s)]
*  in 1993. So that's the kind of... And I didn't look like I looked in 96, but I looked like somebody [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=1871.7600000000002s)]
*  who could have looked like somebody in 96. And it was enough. It was enough. So it was a trick. [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=1882.56s)]
*  It was a trick. That doesn't make you annoyed? Your feminist juices don't start flowing over that? [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=1892.0s)]
*  This is crazy. Tim, who are you looking at? I'm a woman. I'm into clothes and hair. What can I say? [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=1897.6s)]
*  Hey, so are you! I'm into clothes and hair, but it's just more like the principle. It's about the [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=1905.6s)]
*  principle of the matter is I shouldn't need to look fuckable for you to believe that I was assaulted. [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=1910.48s)]
*  No, Tim, you understand in the history of sexual assault trials, the center of the trial [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=1918.08s)]
*  is always the woman's body, always the woman's body. That's it. [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=1925.28s)]
*  Okay. Are you... Go ahead. I was going to say, and any of the young men who've accused, [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=1932.56s)]
*  famous politicians of really bad behavior, if any of those go to trial, the young man's body [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=1940.08s)]
*  will be at the center of the trial. So that's... Yeah. All right. What are you doing now? [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=1947.84s)]
*  Are you good? But you have your Zooms. You're just hanging out up there? I've got my exercise ball, [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=1955.68s)]
*  as you can see. Yeah. I'm living in upstate New York in my hubble, and I hike, and I [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=1960.8799999999999s)]
*  got a best-selling book, so I'm thrilled. Are you scared at all? No. These fuckers are [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=1968.96s)]
*  going to come for you? No, I've got a gun. What kind of gun do you have? I have a Mossberg [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=1975.68s)]
*  shotgun. Really? Have you shot it? Yes, of course I've shot it. Of course. I haven't [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=1984.0s)]
*  shot a gun one time. I got peer pressured. What'd you shoot? Was it a handgun? I don't know. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=1992.64s)]
*  I don't know the different types of guns. I'm a gay from the suburbs, [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=1998.0s)]
*  Gene. I don't know. It was a little gun. Was it a hand... Yeah, I don't know. We were at a little [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=2002.0s)]
*  range. We were at a little shooting range. Oh, okay. A little rifle, maybe. No, I didn't hit [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=2005.84s)]
*  anything. I missed it. I'm not saving anybody with a gun, but you can shoot. I'm not a great [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=2009.9199999999998s)]
*  shot, but it's a shotgun. The principle of shotguns is you just aim it in the direction, [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=2016.48s)]
*  and you're going to hit something. All right. I feel fine. Also, did you just see that white [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=2021.76s)]
*  blur? It is. Okay, that dog waves more than I do. You can hear them outside right now? [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=2029.04s)]
*  Well, I saw them run through. I can't hear them right now. No, they're good protection. [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=2036.96s)]
*  Okay. Well, I'm good. I was just worried about you. I just don't want you to be all alone up [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=2044.1599999999999s)]
*  there without worried about anything. No, no. It's cool. Robbie got around my hubble 24-hour [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=2048.32s)]
*  surveillance. Listen, you even look at this place. You look at it. The police come down. No, really. [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=2062.6400000000003s)]
*  Get out of here, Cash Patel, with your little masked micro-penis agents. [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=2071.28s)]
*  Oh, the mask, the goggle. It's horrible. It's horrible. It's horrible. It's frightening. [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=2076.32s)]
*  And it's not masculine, I don't think. It feels very performant. It feels camp, [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=2086.32s)]
*  almost. They're trying to be scary because they're overcompensating for something. [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=2090.88s)]
*  She is totally scary and totally. It's all performance. It's all performance. You're right. [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=2096.0s)]
*  You nailed it. That's the word. Yeah. All right. I want to do advice column. Is there anything else [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=2102.72s)]
*  you want to say about Donald Trump or the book that I didn't ask you about? You want to go off on it? [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=2108.56s)]
*  Well, you're famous for doing great interviews. I want to ask you about advice column life. [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=2114.7999999999997s)]
*  I feel like I could have been an advice columnist. Yeah, you could have. It's an alternate journey [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=2122.16s)]
*  that I thought I'd think about for myself. You'd be good because you're funny. [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=2125.12s)]
*  When you look back on it, you have all this wisdom now. Is there anything you look back on [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=2129.52s)]
*  any of your advice columns? You're like, man, I missed that one. I wish I could go back and email. [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=2135.7599999999998s)]
*  Totally. Half of them. I can't stand the advice I get. Half, at least. I'm like, what the hell was [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=2139.7599999999998s)]
*  I thinking? But basically, overall, my whole thing was get the hell up and go do it. [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=2146.64s)]
*  People write to advice columns because they want to be told to do something. They want to be told [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=2157.92s)]
*  what to do. I have no compunction, neither does Dan Savage, telling them exactly what to do. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=2166.24s)]
*  Dan is brilliant because he has changed a lot of people. He has changed a lot of people's lives [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=2173.2s)]
*  who've never read his column. That's how big his impact is. He has pulled the strings behind the [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=2180.48s)]
*  scenes. He did so much for me. Do you hear that? That's got to be fulfilling. Do people come up to [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=2188.96s)]
*  you and talk about the advice? They say, you don't remember this, but in 1994, I wrote to you about [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=2197.52s)]
*  my career and I didn't know what to do. Now I'm running the whole company or whatever. [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=2205.36s)]
*  I don't think Donald was ever much for asking for advice. [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=2214.8s)]
*  No, he did ask me for it. That was how we went on the shopping thing. [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=2218.48s)]
*  I guess that's true. He was going to ask you for... [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=2222.0s)]
*  He wanted advice about buying a gift. [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=2224.32s)]
*  That feels fake. What? [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=2230.1600000000003s)]
*  What do you think? Did that feel fake? Was it all a... [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=2232.5600000000004s)]
*  No, it was a totally great scene. Hey, you're that... [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=2234.5600000000004s)]
*  No, no, no. I'm not saying that what you're saying is fake. I'm saying, [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=2238.0800000000004s)]
*  was it a pretense that he asked you to do that? Do you think... [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=2242.7200000000003s)]
*  No, I think he actually was. Then I think it developed because I was flirting my brains out. [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=2245.36s)]
*  I admit it. I'll reluctantly allow it. It was a moment in time. We all can get caught up in a [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=2252.72s)]
*  moment. Yeah, and it was hilarious. He had a sense of humor back then. No, it was [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=2262.64s)]
*  something very light turned very dark. By the way, I didn't notice this, [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=2274.3999999999996s)]
*  but Laura Miller, the great book reviewer, she said that what happened to me, [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=2281.76s)]
*  going from laughing, laughing, laughing to this very dark thing is what happened to the country. [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=2289.36s)]
*  We're all laughing, laughing. He's such a clown. He's so ridiculous. And then boom, [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=2294.6400000000003s)]
*  everything turns star. That's exactly the same scenario. [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=2300.48s)]
*  I love your facial expressions. [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=2306.5600000000004s)]
*  Yeah. I just don't like to think about it like that. But yeah, that's right, Laura. That's right. [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=2307.76s)]
*  All right. Well, here's what I'm asking you for my advice because of this, because you can see this [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=2314.0s)]
*  burden is the burden on me. In three days, I'm taking a real vacation for the first time in a [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=2318.0s)]
*  while. We're going to Europe. We're going to go to Gay Pride in Madrid. We're going to go to [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=2324.0s)]
*  Amsterdam. We're going to go to see Oasis at the end with my college buddies. And my advice [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=2330.4s)]
*  question for you is I want to go dark. I want to just not pay attention to this, but I'm worried [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=2338.08s)]
*  that I'm going to be unable to do it, to compartmentalize it, to turn it off. How do I [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=2347.36s)]
*  do it? How do I get 10 days of freedom, of peace from this? E. Jane Carroll, I'm sorry. [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=2352.4s)]
*  Of peace from this. E. Jane Carroll, do you have any thoughts on that for me? [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=2358.0s)]
*  Yes, I do. It's your brain. You make the decision. You make the decision. [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=2361.28s)]
*  Just fucking turn off your phone. You make the decision. You make the decision. I can't, [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=2372.96s)]
*  Tim, you make the decision. And then if you're going to have any respect for yourself, [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=2380.08s)]
*  you're going to not go back on it. Because how can you look at yourself in the mirror? You're [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=2387.52s)]
*  having a great 10 days. Oh my God, Amsterdam. I mean, can you imagine how wonderful this is? [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=2393.36s)]
*  I mean, can you imagine? I'm looking forward to it. Why would you even look at a headline? [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=2402.08s)]
*  I don't know. It's the job and I'm an addict. And maybe I don't have control over myself, [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=2407.68s)]
*  actually, E. Jane Carroll. Maybe it's like fentanyl. Maybe it's just a news fentanyl [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=2412.64s)]
*  that I'm dealing with. Well, you're a hard case because your job is the news. And bringing it to [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=2419.8399999999997s)]
*  people in such a way that they understand what's going on. That's what you do. Important role [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=2428.72s)]
*  today because it's happening so fast. We do need somebody to explain to us what the hell is going [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=2434.3199999999997s)]
*  on in ways that we can understand. I do not know what's going on with the bill right now. [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=2440.88s)]
*  Our next guest, Sarah Longwell is going to do that part with me. I figured we weren't going to do [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=2446.8s)]
*  Medicaid reimbursement rates with you. Excellent. Tell her hello. I love her George Conway stuff. [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=2450.8s)]
*  It's just, I mean, really. You decide it. There's no tricks. There's no trick. You can put rubber [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=2458.6400000000003s)]
*  bands around it and all that stuff. That if you're going to turn it on, you have to like turn it on, [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=2469.28s)]
*  take the rubber band off and do all that. Do you want to try that? I might have to. That's an [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=2473.84s)]
*  interesting idea. You wrap it up in paper, put a rubber band around it. Now, if you're going to [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=2479.76s)]
*  check, you have to take the rubber band off, undo the paper and then turn on the phone. Try that. [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=2484.32s)]
*  If I have to resort to that, well, I guess I won't be able to send you a selfie because it'll be [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=2489.6000000000004s)]
*  wrapped up. But I'll have my husband send you a picture of me with the phone wrapped up. [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=2494.32s)]
*  If I have to resort to that in Amsterdam, that's what I'll send it to you. [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=2498.0s)]
*  Please. Oh, I would love that. Then I'll put it all over the internet and you won't even be able [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=2502.8s)]
*  to see it because you won't be checking. I hope that is true. I really honestly, [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=2507.76s)]
*  Eugen Carrell, you're an inspiration. I'm so grateful you did this. The book is so delight. [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=2514.08s)]
*  I mean, I hate to call a book again about sexual assault in the Bergdorf Goodman dressing room [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=2520.08s)]
*  delightful, but it just is. It is. And your bravery is something that I just, [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=2525.28s)]
*  I really look up to you. So thank you for doing the pod and writing the book. [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=2531.6800000000003s)]
*  And I love being here. All right. Let's stay in touch. Let's do that zoom or maybe you mean [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=2534.8s)]
*  Robbie sometime or something. I don't know. Let's do it. I would love it. I would love it. [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=2540.0800000000004s)]
*  And I want you to have the best 10 days of your life. I'm going to do my best. I'll do my best. [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=2544.0800000000004s)]
*  I'll report back. Thank you so much. [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA5pP1cbCj0&t=2551.2s)]
