Video Description: Trump and Stephen Miller wanted a backlash against the immigration raids, because even they know that humans will respond when the federal government is snatching people off the street. But the tenor of modern protests is not going to be like the Civil Rights Movement, because activists back then were trained to suppress their natural inclination to defend themselves. Plus, the key role of culture in politics, Dems have to show that the state does good things, and it's the 10th anniversary of Ta-Nehisi's landmark book, "Between the World and Me." Ta-Nehisi Coates joins Tim Miller.

# Ta-Nehisi Coates Unleashed on Trump and the LA Riots | Bulwark Podcast
**The Bulwark Podcast:** [June 09, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM)
*  The stupidest game show host in the country got like a racist buffoon who has no redeemable [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=0.0s)]
*  qualities gets made the president and your reaction to that was, you know, my views on [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=6.72s)]
*  everything, the nature of the country pretty much same or unchanged. Then I was like, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=11.36s)]
*  then we were at, we had a different view of the country. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=16.64s)]
*  Hello and welcome to the Bulwark podcast. I'm your host Tim Miller, a little change [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=26.080000000000002s)]
*  from Bill Kristol Mondays today. You can get your Kristol fix in written form. His newsletter [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=30.0s)]
*  is out this morning arguing that we're not alarmed enough about what Trump is doing in LA. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=34.72s)]
*  But instead we got a special guest today, author and journalist is between the world and me will [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=38.72s)]
*  be released in paperback next week. An observation of the 10th anniversary of its publication. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=43.44s)]
*  It's Ta-Nehisi Coates. How you doing, man? I'm good. I'm a little sick, but I'm okay. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=48.8s)]
*  All right. What a strange world it is for you to be the stand in for Bill Kristol. You know, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=53.6s)]
*  yeah, we're practically indistinguishable. Who the hell knows how the world will turn. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=58.800000000000004s)]
*  But I want to get into the book stuff and some other bigger picture stuff. But obviously [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=65.92s)]
*  we had some news over the weekend. I want to pick your brain about with the National Guard being [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=71.12s)]
*  deployed to Los Angeles in reaction to the anti-ice protests. I guess just open-ended first. I want to [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=76.32000000000001s)]
*  hear what you make of what we're seeing out there. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=84.56s)]
*  Yeah, I think it's tough because I think there are people who probably are trying to be strategic [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=88.16s)]
*  and understand politics, who probably don't love this and don't love the visuals that they're [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=98.16s)]
*  seeing. And I think it is certainly true that Trump wants to, you know, bait a confrontation. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=106.64s)]
*  You know, he certainly did that in, you know, 2020 with George Floyd and everything. And so [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=112.8s)]
*  it's pretty clear that, you know, he's trying to create a spectacle, you know, that helps him. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=119.67999999999999s)]
*  And I know that there probably is, again, a tendency or maybe a knee-jerk reaction to dismiss [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=124.72s)]
*  what looks like, you know, the disorder of protests to deal with the very, you know, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=135.36s)]
*  real thing of having to convince people of your position and not feeling like these visuals are [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=141.44s)]
*  the best. The problem is, I think there are a number of us who have been watching [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=146.4s)]
*  ineffective and probably maybe more importantly than ineffective feeble resistance to the [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=158.24s)]
*  resistance and, you know, down to outright cowardice. And so it's like when people come [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=164.56s)]
*  into your community and, you know, they're snatching folks out of graduations or they're [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=170.4s)]
*  snatching folks when they're going to, you know, report, you know, and file the letter of the law. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=175.12s)]
*  When you have a situation in which people are being taken out of this country and thrown in [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=182.64000000000001s)]
*  the gulags and folks are laughing about it and laughing about defying judges and [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=187.28s)]
*  some of our politicians say, well, we shouldn't talk about this, you know what I mean? Or some [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=195.84s)]
*  people who, you know, I guess a political punner say, well, you shouldn't focus on this, that the [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=200.48s)]
*  guy who was actually his senator, you know, Van Hollen, who represents him, should not advocate for him. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=204.72s)]
*  Um, people feel the very human need to do something, you know, you can't just come into [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=211.04s)]
*  people's community and inflict violence and expect that there will be no reaction, you know? These [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=219.76s)]
*  are human beings, you know, these are human beings and so these questions, you know, that [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=226.16s)]
*  necessarily arise and I understand them, you know, of strategy and tactics, etc. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=231.44s)]
*  Um, it's very hard to ask people to not be human beings, you know, to not have human reactions, [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=237.6s)]
*  you know? Yeah, it's, um, on the, you know, kind of instigation side of it, you know, it's funny, [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=245.12s)]
*  the, of all places, the Wall Street Journal editorial board this morning wrote this sentence, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=252.64000000000001s)]
*  which is, I think, half insightful about the situation. They wrote, it's fanciful to think [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=258.08s)]
*  that raiding restaurants to snatch busboys or Home Depots to grab stock clerks won't inspire [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=262.72s)]
*  a backlash. Um, the correct part was the second half of the sentence. They're correct that that [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=267.76000000000005s)]
*  would inspire a backlash. I think maybe their incorrect part was that there are people around [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=273.6s)]
*  Trump that desire for that not to be the case. I think that's actually the point of what they're [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=278.40000000000003s)]
*  doing. But, you know, that, like, if even the folks sitting over there at News Corp, you know, [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=283.92s)]
*  can see that this is a natural human reaction, like, I hear you, it is hard to begrudge that [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=294.40000000000003s)]
*  reaction. Like, on the other hand, you know, like burning up waymo's and waving Mexican flags, [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=302.56s)]
*  I don't understand what really what that is achieving either, right? And so, like, it's, [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=308.88s)]
*  it's tough to kind of navigate how to balance those. I don't know that it's strategic, though. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=313.92s)]
*  You know what I mean? I don't know that it is, you know, the fact that some Google people sat back [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=318.64000000000004s)]
*  and said, this is going to get us, you know, to this place, you know, in the next, you know, [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=324.48s)]
*  in this period, we're going to do this, we're going to do that. You know, one of the things [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=331.36s)]
*  people don't talk about is enough with the civil rights movement, right? Like, they look at the [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=334.88s)]
*  nonviolence, and they look at, you know, what appears to be the discipline of it and the suits [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=339.28s)]
*  and the, you know, the hats and, you know, say, well, why can't we do that? But if you read the [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=344.23999999999995s)]
*  history, first of all, what they were doing was tremendously inhuman in the sense of they were [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=349.67999999999995s)]
*  training themselves to not defend themselves. This is not, again, a very, very natural human [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=353.91999999999996s)]
*  reaction. You know, somebody hits you, you try to stop them from hitting you. That's a pretty, [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=358.47999999999996s)]
*  you know, natural thing. And so they were disciplining themselves to, A, not do that. And [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=361.67999999999995s)]
*  then they were constantly dealing with people who, you know what I mean, didn't feel like that was [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=366.48s)]
*  how they wanted to live, that somehow that assaulted their dignity, that, you know, that [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=372.96000000000004s)]
*  assaulted, you know, the sanctity, you know, of their body. This was a constant, constant, [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=377.52000000000004s)]
*  constant, constant tension, you know, right up to the point where Martin Luther King gets killed, [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=383.36s)]
*  right? And we end up with riots. And is it the case that, you know, you could make, you know, [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=387.44s)]
*  maybe more political progress, you know, if folks dressed in suits and all, you know, [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=392.96s)]
*  waved American flags and carried copies of cars? I mean, possibly, possibly, you know what I mean? [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=399.84s)]
*  I will say that not necessarily. I don't know that that would, we're given where we are right now, [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=405.03999999999996s)]
*  but I understand the argument for it. But I just, I just think like we have to build into our politics [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=408.79999999999995s)]
*  a tolerance for the idea that people will have human reactions and then we have to calculate [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=416.4s)]
*  accordingly. You know what I mean? That doesn't mean that, you know, folks don't, you know, try [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=422.32s)]
*  to strategize, but kind of looking at these people and saying, why don't you do X, Y, and Z? Because [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=425.04s)]
*  this always happens. You know what I mean? It always happens. I think it would happen with any [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=430.8s)]
*  community, you know? Well, I guess, I mean, obviously, there's some limits to any parallel, [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=434.32s)]
*  particularly civil rights parallel, but maybe the missing ingredient here is, to your point, [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=439.28s)]
*  about kind of the limp resistance coming from the more, whatever you want to call it, [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=447.36s)]
*  establishment, normal sect. If that is missing, then there's a void that is filled. You know [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=451.76s)]
*  what I mean? You needed, again, this is really reductive, but you needed Malcolm and Martin. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=457.92s)]
*  You know what I mean? You needed both. You know? [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=463.76s)]
*  Rob Markman Yeah. And I think what that means is then when you have this kind of limp resistance, [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=465.84s)]
*  it's like the established channels completely lose legitimacy. So what am I left with? What am I [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=471.28s)]
*  supposed to do? Am I supposed to just let these people just come in here and do this to my [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=478.0s)]
*  community and not do anything? And I don't think that's a position anybody would want to be in. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=481.68s)]
*  Chris Bounds What is your sense of alarm, just as far as, [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=486.8s)]
*  and I think it seems like things had died down a little bit overnight, but just how quick to the [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=490.4s)]
*  trigger these guys were in the Trump administration with a National Guard deployment, that they put [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=495.52s)]
*  out a press release, 500 Marines from the 2nd Battalion in 29 Palms, California are prepared [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=500.48s)]
*  to deploy. I mean, it does feel like they want to do that. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=505.6s)]
*  Rob Markman Oh, they definitely do. Yeah. I mean, I wasn't surprised. Again, if you go back and look [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=510.08000000000004s)]
*  at 2020, maybe they were a little slower in 2020 because they had this visual of George Floyd to [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=514.72s)]
*  contend with. But I mean, they were sending people with masks in and with the badges covered up. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=520.72s)]
*  And this was not ICE. This was not a matter of people who weren't citizens. This was deployed [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=527.44s)]
*  in general against citizens. And so I'm not surprised by that. They want to portray an image [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=532.56s)]
*  of this country being at war. And Trump is the defender of order. While he looted the country, [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=541.68s)]
*  by the way. Chris Bounds [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=550.9599999999999s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, to me, the difference between 2020 is obviously not Trump because his impulse is the [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=552.0s)]
*  same. But it's like, instead of having Mark Esper or whatever in charge of the military, [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=558.48s)]
*  some guy who's not perfect has got his own flaws, but like, you know, doesn't want to be, [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=565.44s)]
*  you know, doesn't want his kids to see him as the guy in the history book that sent the military in [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=570.16s)]
*  after, you know, Black Lives Matter protesters in the streets. He's got a weekend talk show host [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=574.24s)]
*  running the military now. Right. And so I got to me, I think that is what makes that's what makes [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=578.08s)]
*  my concern level higher now than about the potential for state violence than maybe looking [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=584.24s)]
*  back. I don't know if you feel the same way. Chris Bounds [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=594.24s)]
*  I think you're right. I totally agree. I thought this when Trump won, though. I mean, I just like, [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=596.32s)]
*  it's anything can happen. Yeah, anything can happen. Chris Bounds [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=602.88s)]
*  Um, one more thing on the Trump or on this part of it. So this is happening now in LA, [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=607.6800000000001s)]
*  the specter of we're, you know, coming up this weekend. We've got our, we've got our [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=613.52s)]
*  tank or birthday parade, the birthday boy gets a tank parade through the city in DC. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=617.92s)]
*  So you spent some time there. I went to Howard. I don't know if you have any thoughts on that [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=624.56s)]
*  visual, the inverse visual, I guess, from the way Mo's on fire. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=628.24s)]
*  Chris Bounds It's bad. It's bad. I do think it's one of [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=633.76s)]
*  these things that we have to reckon with, which is someday Trump will not be president. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=640.88s)]
*  Chris Bounds Are you sure? [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=649.4399999999999s)]
*  Chris Bounds Yeah, I am sure that I'm not sure that, [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=650.8s)]
*  you know, how that's gonna happen. At some point it will, you know, [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=653.8399999999999s)]
*  Chris Bounds The AI is happening really fast. Is it possible [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=657.12s)]
*  they could like put like, what is it? Futurama, they could put his brain in a thing like Richard [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=659.76s)]
*  Nixon and make him a permanent president. Chris Bounds Yeah, maybe so. Maybe so. But [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=664.56s)]
*  barring some, you know, grand AI, you know, innovation, I think what is happening is like, [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=668.7199999999999s)]
*  there's significant damage being done to like, expectations, norms, legitimacy, etc. I actually [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=677.1199999999999s)]
*  think that damage started when people began to believe that somehow, well, when we as a country [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=688.56s)]
*  began to believe our own hype, which is to say, if we say the Senate is the greatest deliberative [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=696.64s)]
*  body in the world, then it must be. And we don't have to do anything to kind of make that true, [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=701.28s)]
*  you know, make that the case, you know, when folks really began to believe that this wasn't a country, [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=707.92s)]
*  you know, run by fallible human beings, that there were ghosts in the machines that, you know, [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=713.28s)]
*  could guide and thus the institutions did not have to be protected. You know, it didn't have [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=716.72s)]
*  to be an amount of caretaking, you know, done that really left it vulnerable. And what is happening [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=721.6800000000001s)]
*  now, you know, is, you know, the next guy, whoever that is, after Trump, you know, can say, I want [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=726.8000000000001s)]
*  a military parade to, you know, I can loot the country to I can have my own crypto coins and [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=732.32s)]
*  crypto business to, you know, because that's what it is now. You know, and so I think as frightening [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=736.72s)]
*  as you know, Trump is, and as frightening as he is right now, I mean, I think he probably will go [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=745.36s)]
*  down. You know, certainly, it's this case so far as the most impactful president of my lifetime, [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=752.48s)]
*  you know, and that is scary. Yeah. It's, it's an interesting question, right? Like this, how, [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=758.96s)]
*  how much of this is irreparable? I think that's another thing that kind of goes back stuff you've [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=769.44s)]
*  written about in the past. I mean, we've had dark times that then, you know, things get a little [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=774.32s)]
*  better and then backslid and you know, we could go through all the historical examples of that. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=778.88s)]
*  But you know, there's certain things that, you know, you know, something changes, the country [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=783.36s)]
*  makes a choice, they go down a path. And like the other path is then becomes closed, right? [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=792.0s)]
*  There's certain things that are not fixable, like there, you know, Trump won't always be president. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=797.84s)]
*  You know, maybe we can, the next president can come in and put in some reforms to prevent [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=802.24s)]
*  future presidents from having crypto grifts like we did after Watergate or whatever. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=806.72s)]
*  But like, how does that happen though? Like, how does that like, like, how do those reforms happen, [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=811.52s)]
*  given what the Senate is, given what the political parties are, like, like, how does that even happen? [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=816.0799999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I guess, well, I guess you asked, I'm gonna answer the question with a question, [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=823.4399999999999s)]
*  what do you think? I don't know. It's hard. I guess that's my, that was the point of bringing it up, [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=827.76s)]
*  is that I just, it's hard to see along some of these vectors, things getting better, [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=832.24s)]
*  at least in the short to medium term, you know, because of putting them back in again, right? [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=837.36s)]
*  I do think it was potentially repreparable, at least some of the damage from the first term. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=843.2s)]
*  But now, you know, it is hard to like, kind of envision a way, you know, back to a politics [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=849.2s)]
*  that looks more like what it was like before. And but then I guess there's a question of like, [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=860.08s)]
*  is that, do you want that? All right, like maybe something else emerges out of it. I don't know. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=863.12s)]
*  Yeah, I will hope something else emerges out of it. Because I don't think, again, I don't think [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=869.5200000000001s)]
*  Trump just magically appears. Right. You know, I think there were currents, and I think there were [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=873.36s)]
*  things that were already happening that made impossible, you know? And so that probably has [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=877.76s)]
*  to be dealt with to begin with. I also think, you know, and I don't know where you are on this, [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=883.36s)]
*  because I know you're, you know, maybe even at this very moment going through your own political [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=891.12s)]
*  evolution, as all good citizens and thinking people should be, by the way. You know? [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=895.92s)]
*  Nothing wrong with changing your mind, man. People never change their mind that I'm much more [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=903.6s)]
*  suspect of. I was like, I always said to people, I was like, if the stupidest game show host in the [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=909.28s)]
*  country got like a racist buffoon who has no redeemable qualities gets made the president. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=914.5600000000001s)]
*  And your reaction to that was, you know, my views on everything, the nature of the country, [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=921.2s)]
*  pretty much same or unchanged. Then I was like, then we were at, we had a different view of the [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=925.52s)]
*  country. You know what I mean? So anyway. No, no. So I just say that to say that I do think [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=930.8s)]
*  people have to have some positive vision of the state. Like that has to happen. Like at some point, [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=938.16s)]
*  people will have to feel like the state itself, the government, not America as an abstract concept, [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=945.04s)]
*  but the government is itself good for something. And it would be helpful if that something was not [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=952.8s)]
*  just violence. So for instance, if it was not just the cops or the military, like there has to be some [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=958.88s)]
*  positive articulation of the state. And I think that that is important because when you are asking [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=964.72s)]
*  people to go out and vote for something, when you're asking people to go out and support [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=972.4s)]
*  something, or, you know, when you're in a situation like we are right now, where something is being [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=976.56s)]
*  taken apart, you know, like I've heard a number of people say, look, most Americans don't care about, [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=980.32s)]
*  you know, what happens to USAID. Like most people don't care about, you know, this. That's our [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=985.36s)]
*  failing that they don't care. Right? Like that's not just a, you know, a fait accompli. You know, [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=990.48s)]
*  the fact that a matter is, you know, there have been certain political decisions to talk about [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=997.52s)]
*  the state in a certain way, to talk about the government in a certain way, to portray it in a [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=1001.04s)]
*  certain way that has made it easier, you know, to believe that taking, you know, taking it apart [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=1005.52s)]
*  can somehow be a good thing or a positive thing. What I'm trying to say is there are narratives [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=1010.96s)]
*  that happen before this, you know, great action happens that we all, you know, deploy. And so [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=1015.6s)]
*  I think, you know, if we are trying to get either back to something or, you know, probably in my [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=1021.6800000000001s)]
*  preference, forward to something, there has to be some sort of positive articulation of what [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=1026.08s)]
*  you're defending. Because if your position is just, I am just slightly less skeptical [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=1033.68s)]
*  at a stake than this guy. Yeah. You know, I don't think that works, you know. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=1040.96s)]
*  And I guess this gets to a conundrum that the Democrats have, in particular in the Trump era, [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=1047.76s)]
*  which is that at some level, a positive articulation of the state is a defense of [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=1052.96s)]
*  the status quo. Right? It doesn't have to be a full-throated defense of it, but it has to be a [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=1060.32s)]
*  defense of like, what is good about America, right? Whether it be the institutions or, you know, [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=1064.4s)]
*  liberal democracy or pluralism, right? Like it has to be the rule of law, right? Like, okay, [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=1069.92s)]
*  these are things that America has done that is good. But Democrats find themselves being defenders [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=1075.8400000000001s)]
*  of a status quo that people don't like. And that takes us back to the first thing you mentioned, [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=1083.28s)]
*  which is you end up kind of having a limp pushback. So how do you, how would you navigate that? [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=1090.0s)]
*  Somebody called you and said that they want to be the standard bearer of this, and they want you to [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=1096.72s)]
*  help them find some words for it. Like, what would you even say? [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=1101.28s)]
*  So let me just say upfront that I'm somewhat in tension with the advice I'm about to give, [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=1105.9199999999998s)]
*  right? And this is why I'm not in electoral politics. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=1110.48s)]
*  There is a long history of African-American leaders, both asserting, I can't believe I'm [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=1115.52s)]
*  saying this, both asserting the greatness of America and like the flaws at the same time. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=1122.8s)]
*  You know what I mean? So when Martin Luther King goes to, you know, the Marshall, he says, [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=1129.84s)]
*  you know, I just, I'm just, you know, you know, the check has come back. You said X, Y, and Z [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=1132.96s)]
*  is true. I think that's great. I think those things you were standing for are great. You're [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=1137.36s)]
*  not doing them. You know what I mean? And so it doubles as kind of a defense of the country. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=1140.72s)]
*  You know what I mean? It was a statement, you know, a positive affirmation of the idea of [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=1146.8s)]
*  what it should be. And then at the same time, a real articulation, you know, of what is actually [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=1151.6s)]
*  happening. If you sent me grimacing at that idea a little bit, it's probably because as I [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=1157.6s)]
*  have myself changed over the past, you know, five to 10 years, particularly, [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=1167.6s)]
*  my politics are probably becoming a little bit more international. And so I am now always just [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=1172.6399999999999s)]
*  concerned about making sure, you know, this country is just in terms of its treatment of [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=1179.04s)]
*  its citizens, but that it really is a just actor on the world stage. And maybe you're getting this [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=1184.56s)]
*  from me, but I feel that oftentimes we are not. Yeah, right. And maybe, I don't know, I mean, [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=1194.72s)]
*  maybe there is somewhat of an answer in that to like this, you know, political conundrum that [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=1202.24s)]
*  the Democrats have themselves in, like maybe there is a way to talk about like the flaws and [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=1208.48s)]
*  the mistakes and the things that we need to change while like uplifting maybe not the state, but the [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=1216.96s)]
*  people, the nature of the American people, you know, the nature of the American people in the [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=1224.56s)]
*  experiment. See, I'm scared to do that. I think that's how we get here though. I think that's [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=1228.72s)]
*  exactly how we get here because like, I don't want to like personalize this, but [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=1234.8s)]
*  the thing I think about all the time, like I think about, I wrote a piece on Barack Obama [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=1244.1599999999999s)]
*  at the end of his presidency, right? And he granted, he's very kind and granted me, you know, [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=1249.2s)]
*  a lot of time to interview and talk with him. And I wrote this, so it's not like I'm breaking any [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=1253.76s)]
*  news, but the thing I remember him saying most out of that interview, out of, you know, everything [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=1257.84s)]
*  he said and all the articulate things he said was, you know, Trump can't win. And he can't win [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=1262.16s)]
*  because there just isn't a history in this country of, I guess what he actually said was, [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=1268.88s)]
*  normally with a couple of exceptions, the American people respond to people with a positive vision. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=1277.0400000000002s)]
*  And not a negative vision. And he was, you know, that wasn't a lie. You know what I mean? Like he [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=1284.0800000000002s)]
*  really did at that point in time believe that he may not now, but he really did believe that. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=1287.44s)]
*  And I think about that a lot because I think it is a manifestation of [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=1291.84s)]
*  like how some of this conversation about the experiment and about the people deludes us, [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=1302.0s)]
*  allows us to ignore the fact that we are still human beings. And we are still subject to, [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=1309.28s)]
*  you know, all of, you know, the flaws and all of the impulses and all of the darkness and all [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=1315.36s)]
*  of the things that are in the soul of human beings. And so it is certainly possible to, [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=1319.52s)]
*  you know, to build, you know, as Trump has proven, a political movement off of the darkest parts of [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=1326.08s)]
*  us, you know? And that is unfortunate, you know what I mean? But I think if we can face that, [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=1331.76s)]
*  you know, like my worry is that we feel that there is something in us, in our bones that makes us [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=1338.48s)]
*  invulnerable to this sort of rhetoric. And I think we would, you know, do well to dispense with that. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=1342.8799999999999s)]
*  Well, let's talk about that. It is a little bit kind of what I want to get into in the book, [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=1349.12s)]
*  too, in a minute. But like, what does facing that look like? It is interesting you say that about [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=1353.04s)]
*  President Obama because I agree with you. I think that he believed that. Like, I think that he [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=1358.8799999999999s)]
*  believed that of all the flaws of the American people, like that, you know, that the American [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=1363.04s)]
*  spirit was stronger and that there was something about the country's, you know, aspirations that [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=1367.28s)]
*  made them reject, like, the most dark elements of Trumpism. And there are a lot of us, you know, [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=1373.2s)]
*  that woke up a couple months ago and were like, fuck. Like, we went from, it went from, like, [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=1382.0s)]
*  we had this realization, right, that was like, we went from thinking, we made a mistake, [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=1391.1200000000001s)]
*  Hillary actually got more votes, we weren't prepared, you know, we didn't do the right [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=1398.8s)]
*  things, we didn't make the right arguments, we didn't have the right standard bearer. And like, [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=1402.96s)]
*  it was excusable and it's fixable to thinking, oh, no, like, yeah, this is bad. Like, things are, [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=1406.1599999999999s)]
*  the country is bad, maybe, like, at its core. And so how does, like, so when you say, okay, [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=1413.9199999999998s)]
*  to make things better, you have to face that. Like, what does that look like? Because there's [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=1420.24s)]
*  a part of you that says, well, maybe I should just relent into despair then, and just say, [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=1424.96s)]
*  fuck this, and kind of become like them, right? I don't know, become a mirror image of them [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=1429.92s)]
*  is maybe the right, I think that's a rational reaction. So I don't know, how do you process [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=1434.64s)]
*  that, that challenge? Because you've been processing it long before, I reread the book [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=1439.8400000000001s)]
*  last night, you were talking about all this stuff 10 years ago. I mean, but that's the political [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=1443.92s)]
*  tradition, right? Like, I mean, like, I just, you know, I say this all the time, but [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=1449.36s)]
*  African Americans in this country, as a community, have been enslaved in this country longer than [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=1455.28s)]
*  they have been free. So what that means is that, or, you know, on these shores, I guess, you have [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=1460.3999999999999s)]
*  your pre-daily for the country organized. But what that means is that to the extent that, you know, [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=1467.12s)]
*  people cared about human rights or anything like that, like the idea that people's children [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=1473.6799999999998s)]
*  shouldn't be sold off because of the color of their skin, that people shouldn't be worked [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=1478.16s)]
*  against because of the color of their skin, that women should not be subjects to industrialized [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=1481.0400000000002s)]
*  rape and sexual assault. I mean, for most of us, we were just kind of like, eh, you know, I don't [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=1486.72s)]
*  love it, but eh, you know what I mean? Like, you know, me, obviously, you know, so many of our [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=1492.48s)]
*  founding fathers was, you know, like, they owed their existence to that, and it took a war that [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=1497.3600000000001s)]
*  killed 20% of the military age white male population in the South to get rid of it. I mean, [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=1503.28s)]
*  that's a high price. It's a really, really high price. And so what that means is not that, you [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=1508.32s)]
*  know, America is, you know, as a state or as a country, is somehow worse than all other countries [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=1514.48s)]
*  or states in the world. What it means is that we have just as much capacity for looking away [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=1519.28s)]
*  from evil as everybody else. And yet, if you look at the political tradition that comes out of that, [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=1527.84s)]
*  it's not really a despairing tradition. You know what I mean? These are people who are, you know, [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=1533.3600000000001s)]
*  are kind of facing the worst of it, you know, in terms of, you know, America. And I think for, [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=1538.0800000000002s)]
*  you know, complicated reasons, sometimes good, sometimes bad, the answer rarely is this thing is [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=1543.52s)]
*  totally and completely corrupt. We need to abandon it. Sometimes that's the answer. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=1550.4s)]
*  And some of that, you know, I, you know, I very much identify with, but certainly the mainstream [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=1556.16s)]
*  position of the politics is not that, you know what I mean? And so I think on one level, [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=1560.88s)]
*  the Black tradition really does grapple with, you know, the dark heart of humanity that is here and [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=1569.8400000000001s)]
*  is very much present, you know, in America and has always been, you know, present, while at the same [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=1574.8000000000002s)]
*  time trying to, you know, advance it, you know, and again, I don't think that's because there's [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=1580.3200000000002s)]
*  anything bone deep about Black people in this country. It's just the nature of our experience [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=1585.2800000000002s)]
*  here and what we've had to, despair isn't really an option, you know what I mean? Because it's like, [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=1590.48s)]
*  despair is like, oh, you know what I mean? I, you know, just allow, you know, it's like, [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=1594.72s)]
*  they sold my son, you know, from Virginia down to Mississippi. And so am I going to completely [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=1601.52s)]
*  abandon all efforts to find him? That's what despair is. So I can't betray him by doing that, [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=1607.1200000000001s)]
*  right? Like we have people at stake, you know what I mean? It's very intimate with us. And so to [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=1612.96s)]
*  despair is to like, you know, abandon people, you know, which I think is a bit much for us. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=1617.52s)]
*  Yeah. And this is the thing that kind of pisses me off sometimes in thinking about the conversation [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=1623.68s)]
*  around Trump voters think about how to process all this is like, there's a lot of this excuse making, [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=1629.12s)]
*  right? It's like, there's a lot, there's economic pain, there's resentment, like the factory towns [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=1633.84s)]
*  got hollowed out and, you know, that, you know, there was fentanyl and, and I got, there's, [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=1639.2s)]
*  there's some truth to all that. Like you hear all that and you think, well, okay. But, you know, [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=1644.32s)]
*  I mean, black folks went through way worse, worse than all this. And, and, and the last, [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=1651.52s)]
*  in the last generations, I know one of the things I was reading from you recently, I forget which [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=1657.04s)]
*  article it was in was, oh, you're like, if anybody should be angered about the devastation wrecked [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=1660.0s)]
*  by the, by the financial sector and a government that declined to prosecute the perpetrators, [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=1664.3999999999999s)]
*  it's, it's the African-Americans, the housing crisis was one of the primary drivers in the past [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=1669.2s)]
*  20 years of the wealth gap. Right. And you didn't see this radicalization, right? Like at a community [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=1673.44s)]
*  level, right? Individual level, but like at a community level, you didn't see this. Okay. What [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=1678.64s)]
*  we really need to do is put in charge our most comically evil, you know, standard parlor and [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=1681.6000000000001s)]
*  punish the perpetrators. But that's what it has been, what you've seen from, you know, a lot of [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=1689.2s)]
*  folks on the mega side. And I just don't like, okay. So what, what is the lesson there? It kind [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=1694.4s)]
*  of sometimes it takes you to a bad place. When you think about the lesson is that they were [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=1702.24s)]
*  successful in, in putting Donald Trump in. I think it is hard to accept that culture is [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=1705.84s)]
*  an extremely important part of politics. That there, there, there is not going to be a politics [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=1714.8s)]
*  that doesn't have a cultural component to it. You know, that, that, that just isn't, you know, [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=1723.52s)]
*  I was talking to somebody a couple of months ago, you know, who I, you know, actually just, you know, [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=1727.52s)]
*  I think, you know, further to the left and they were making the point, you know, I think, you know, [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=1732.72s)]
*  it was an astute political point that, Hey, you know, I don't, you know, I won't go out and talk [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=1737.68s)]
*  about, you know, say, you know, trans rights or immigrant rights, you know, to this person over [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=1742.72s)]
*  here, I will focus on the things that we have in common economically, you know what I mean? And try [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=1747.44s)]
*  to build the coalition there. It's not that I'm, you know, anti-trans or anti, you know, but, you [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=1751.84s)]
*  know, I'm trying to build a coalition and coalitions have to be built on the things that are shared. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=1757.1200000000001s)]
*  I said, yeah, that makes sense. But what happens like when your opposition starts attacking those [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=1760.96s)]
*  people, right? Like that, that, that, that really is, you know, I get it. Hey, you don't want to [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=1767.28s)]
*  highlight it and talk about it. You know, I understand that, you know, I mean, that's not the, [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=1771.68s)]
*  you know, the point of, you know, how you get elected. But when people decide that they want [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=1775.04s)]
*  to talk about it, you know, what do you do then? You know, and I probably am one [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=1779.8400000000001s)]
*  that feels that it's, it's, it's immoral to see bullying and to look away from it. And not to [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=1788.0800000000002s)]
*  mention, you know, as some people are now pitching, jump in on it. You know what I mean? Like I don't, [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=1799.68s)]
*  I don't, and it's, it's tough, man, like, like to accept that a group of people would, if someone [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=1804.64s)]
*  would turn over the entire state, because somewhere in the country, there's a high school [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=1814.24s)]
*  track athlete who is transitioning and maybe one first place, like that, that would be enough. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=1825.04s)]
*  I mean, that's scary. Yeah. Like that's, that's really scary. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=1834.0s)]
*  I also struggle with the premise of the argument because like the economics of the Trump voter [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=1838.08s)]
*  is better than most people throughout the world. You know, like the French haven't turned to a [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=1842.64s)]
*  Trump, the German, like we did better than the European kind, you know, and so I, it just, it [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=1846.64s)]
*  doesn't work for me as a unifying theory that it's just the economics, like the cultural part, [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=1853.0400000000002s)]
*  the cultural battle, like is, is a much clearer to me, like rationale for him. [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=1857.8400000000001s)]
*  Let me also just advance that a little bit too. I mean, there are people I think whose politics [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=1865.76s)]
*  I probably, you know, share in terms of what they want to see in terms of what the social safety net [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=1871.04s)]
*  should be in this country. But when you look to Europe, where the social safety net is a lot [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=1875.6s)]
*  stronger, and you talk to black people over there and you talk to Arabs, you know, Arab people over [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=1880.72s)]
*  there, they do not feel that the social safety net has been necessarily been an anti-racist endeavor. [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=1887.6s)]
*  In other words, it has not expunged, you know, those feelings, you know what I mean? It really [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=1895.28s)]
*  hasn't, which is to say that, you know, you can deal with all of that economic stuff in the way [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=1899.12s)]

*  listen, not a ton of liberalization and cutter in the U.S. There's like a lot of economic prosperity. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=1908.4799999999998s)]

*  Right. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=1934.0800000000002s)]
*  Right. Time for some life talk, life insurance talk, that is. You probably haven't, but do you [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=1939.44s)]
*  know how much you're paying for it or how much is being covered? Odds are you're paying too much for [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=1943.76s)]
*  too little. And did you know if you receive life insurance through your job and you're unexpectedly [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=1948.72s)]
*  laid off, you could suddenly be covered for nothing. It's scary to think about, but it's [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=1953.76s)]

*  I want to get into a couple more of the elements from your book we've been touched on. But first, [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=2028.4s)]
*  there's this other book out there that has people kind of a flame abundance. I'm sure you've been [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=2037.68s)]
*  hearing the chatter about this. As we wrote this, as we wrote this yesterday, but the theory of power, [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=2041.44s)]
*  and I was like, man, I have to get Tanasi's reaction to this because I don't really know [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=2047.44s)]
*  where you'll take it. But he wrote this. Because I guess to set this up, someone on the left had been [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=2052.32s)]
*  criticizing him saying that the book does not have a clear view of power and that the right way [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=2057.44s)]
*  for the left to gain power is to create enemies, particularly in the billionaires and the corporate [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=2061.6s)]
*  leaders. And this was his pushback to that. My view of power is more classically liberal. [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=2066.88s)]
*  In his book, Liberalism, the Life of an Idea, Edmund Fawcett describes it neatly. Human power [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=2073.04s)]
*  was implacable. It could never be relied on to behave well. Whether political, economic or social, [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=2077.2000000000003s)]
*  superior power of some people over others tended inevitably to arbitrariness and domination, [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=2083.68s)]
*  unless resisted and checked. To take this view means power will be ill-used by your friends, [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=2089.12s)]
*  as well as your enemies, by your opponents, as well as by your neighbors. From this perspective, [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=2093.7599999999998s)]
*  there are no safe reservoirs of power. Corporations sometimes serve the national interests, sometimes [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=2097.6s)]
*  betray it, the same is true of governments, unions, churches, et cetera. What do you make of that? [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=2101.44s)]
*  Rob Markman I mean, that seems right to me. [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=2108.08s)]
*  Edmund Fawcett There's a lot of people that are very mad about that online. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=2109.76s)]
*  Some that are like, no, that's not accurate, actually. And it's a false equivalence between [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=2114.4s)]
*  these groups. Rob Markman I haven't read the column. So maybe it's like something around the [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=2120.96s)]
*  column that I'm missing. Let me just say that. While I followed the debate, I haven't had the [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=2124.48s)]
*  chance to read Ezra's book. I actually am still a little confused in terms of what the lies of the [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=2133.2s)]
*  debate actually are to be frank with you. Edmund Fawcett Here's why I asked you about it. I saw [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=2139.3599999999997s)]
*  it to put you on the spot. I asked you about it because I saw the Ezra tweet when I was reading [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=2142.96s)]
*  an Atlantic article you wrote about Tony Juitt. There was a bit in that where you were talking [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=2148.48s)]
*  about power. And you were writing about how there's this arc of, more arc of history that [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=2152.8799999999997s)]
*  was bending toward Justice, the Obama view. And Juitt was basically saying, no, people do not pay [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=2160.24s)]
*  the price for their ills. And that the only way to make things better is to gain power. And so, [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=2167.52s)]
*  anyway, that's why I was curious whether you had thought through that question about the right way [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=2176.0s)]
*  to view gaining power. Edmund Fawcett Yeah, I love that quote. That's actually from his book, [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=2186.08s)]
*  Postwar. And one of the things that that book is very, very clear-eyed about is the means by which [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=2190.96s)]
*  what we call Europe today was established. Our rosy-eyed view of how the West greeted the [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=2200.88s)]
*  survivors of the Holocaust and dealt with the implications of the Holocaust and the implications [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=2211.36s)]
*  of World War II. And what he's talking about at that point is actually ethnic cleansing. [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=2214.72s)]
*  And how there's some journalists who believing in the divine justice of the world believes that [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=2221.52s)]
*  people will pay for that. And Tony is just like, no, there's no evidence that anybody ever paid. [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=2227.9199999999996s)]
*  Sometimes the bad guys just get away with it. You know what I mean? And that, [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=2236.08s)]
*  I read that. So I think Between the World and Me was published in 15, because we're 10 years, [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=2241.44s)]
*  so we're in 115. But really, Between the World and Me comes out a case for reparations. And so I've [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=2246.32s)]
*  read that in 13, before I went into the case for reparations, actually. And one of the things that [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=2251.52s)]
*  conditioned me for it was just a view of the world and a view of history. Because I do think, [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=2257.52s)]
*  certainly within the African-American tradition, and I think this is because of perhaps our [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=2264.0800000000004s)]
*  relationship with Christianity and the force with which Christianity has exerted itself in our [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=2267.68s)]
*  politics and among our greatest leaders, in fact. That there is some sort of, at the end of the day, [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=2274.48s)]
*  this will work out. The arc of the universe is long, but bends towards justice. And [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=2281.44s)]
*  I guess Tony was probably one of the first people I read that was like, [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=2289.6s)]
*  no, the arc is bent. People have to bend it. It does not bend. There's no gravity. There's no [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=2293.36s)]
*  anything. And in fact, to the contrary, if anything, the inertia is on the side of evil, not good. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=2303.2s)]
*  And so that was just a revelatory moment. And probably all of my writing proceeds from that. [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=2312.7999999999997s)]
*  Let's take it to the Between the World and Me then. You wrote just earlier that, I think you said [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=2322.96s)]
*  something like in the five, 10 years since your views on it have evolved in some ways. So, [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=2327.2s)]
*  how so? I guess. What do you want to say? Well, I mean, a big one is, you know, and I've [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=2334.4s)]
*  talked about this quite a bit, it's probably case for reparation. So I should explain the [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=2337.84s)]
*  relationship between those two things. I was at the Atlantic for 10 years and somewhere around [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=2341.2s)]
*  2012, 2013. I mean, that job was so cool, man. The coolest thing was I was a blogger and I would [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=2348.8s)]
*  write maybe twice a year or once a year, like these big pieces for the magazine. And what that meant [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=2356.96s)]
*  was I just had so much time to read. I just had just tons of time to just read and absorb. And [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=2361.36s)]
*  because of what the blogosphere was then, I would often write about what I was reading. And then I [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=2367.04s)]
*  would have this feedback with the people that were commenting and they would say, well, you should [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=2371.36s)]
*  read this, you should check out that. And I would go check out that. And so I was like in this, [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=2375.36s)]
*  you know, I think this hyper period of growth. And I don't know that I knew it then, but [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=2379.6s)]
*  much of my political journey at that point was really just to answer the question of why was it [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=2386.8s)]
*  that in every single socioeconomic indicator you looked at black people were typically, [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=2392.2400000000002s)]
*  you know, somewhere at the bottom. And I only say, you know, somewhere, you know, to include [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=2398.6400000000003s)]
*  indigenous Americans in that calculus. You know, why was that so consistent? And at the time, [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=2402.96s)]
*  you still hear this sometimes, but less so now. You know, there was a huge argument for culture, [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=2410.08s)]
*  et cetera, which never passed my smell test. Yeah. [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=2414.8s)]
*  Right. Baggy jeans. [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=2417.04s)]
*  Yes, yes, yes. Baggy jeans. Both your pants, right? [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=2419.44s)]
*  Yeah, both your pants and that'll solve it. [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=2421.84s)]
*  I mean, you should pull up your pants, but I don't think it's why. [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=2427.28s)]
*  I don't know. I was at World Pride this past weekend. A lot of people were doing well, [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=2430.0s)]
*  economically, and had their pants down. Right, it was fine. It was fine as it turns out. [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=2433.76s)]
*  But I feel like I started to get answers to that question, you know, and that really led me to a [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=2440.32s)]
*  case for reparations. And the real breakthrough for me was that I was able to articulate it for [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=2446.7200000000003s)]
*  my editors in such a way that they understood it and not just understood it, got excited about it [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=2450.1600000000003s)]
*  and backed it and did everything. And so that was a remarkable thing for me. And between the [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=2454.48s)]
*  world and me came out of a need to express emotionally, which really an empirical case [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=2460.64s)]
*  in case for reparations. And so those two things happened and two really big things came out of [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=2467.36s)]
*  that. The first was that, I don't even feel comfortable articulating this, but a level of [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=2473.84s)]
*  fame accrued to me that I did not expect. It was not George Clooney fame, but it was make [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=2481.84s)]
*  Ta-Nehisi uncomfortable fame, which made me look at you at the airport, you know, when you're just [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=2488.48s)]
*  trying to read a book. Yeah, like yesterday, like I just got off a plane from Denver yesterday. [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=2494.7200000000003s)]
*  And you would think I'd be happy about this. I mean, I guess I should be, but just do it. This is [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=2499.1200000000003s)]
*  like, you know, man, you know, I knew I recognized you and then I saw your name and I love seeing [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=2502.2400000000002s)]
*  you on democracy now and I love your books. Thank you. And while I appreciate her, I really, [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=2508.8s)]
*  really do. There's a part of me that just kind of wants to put on sunglasses and go like this, [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=2513.2000000000003s)]
*  right? And go on, you know, not that she did anything wrong, but I'm saying that I was [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=2517.2000000000003s)]
*  uncomfortable with the amount of that. And what it did was it meant that a number of critiques, [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=2521.36s)]
*  you know, began to come in, you know, which is fair and what should happen. And part of that is [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=2527.76s)]
*  linked to, you know, the second thing, which is that one of those critiques was the case for [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=2534.8s)]
*  reparations and you know how I wrote about Israeli reparations in that. And it was said to me in a way [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=2538.0800000000004s)]
*  that forced me to take it seriously. And I spent some time taking it seriously. And, [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=2548.48s)]
*  you know, my book that just came out, the message that came out of that, [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=2555.52s)]
*  that in some ways is an attempt to reconcile myself to Palestinians, to the impact of my work, [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=2558.88s)]
*  you know, in that community, to Israel, to Zionism. But I have to tell you, it is also [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=2568.2400000000002s)]
*  one of those moments where I guess I realized even I, you know, like how naive I was about the [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=2577.76s)]
*  country I lived in, you know, and where it had its fingerprints on it and what we did. And so that [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=2585.84s)]
*  goes beyond Israel. Like then you start looking at everything, you know, you start, Kim Burns has [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=2591.44s)]
*  this documentary, which he put out years ago on the Vietnam War, but I just happened to watch it, [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=2596.8s)]
*  you know, recently. And you see things, it's a great documentary, but you see things like that [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=2602.8s)]
*  and you say, well, okay, if this was true of us in this moment, what is our basic nature then? Like [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=2608.7200000000003s)]
*  what else have we done? What else have I missed? What else am I not seeing? You know, and so that's [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=2615.92s)]
*  kind of the path I've been on. I wonder, I don't know where you're going to take that. And I think [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=2620.2400000000002s)]
*  that the personal reflection is important. Obviously it's something I've been going through. [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=2627.52s)]
*  I'm curious about the external though. You know, like this whole sort of world, like evolves, not [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=2632.16s)]
*  out of your book alone per se, but kind of out of a lot of things that are happening around that time, [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=2638.88s)]
*  particularly kind of with Black Lives Matter and racial justice. And, you know, when I was [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=2644.0s)]
*  reading the book last night, one thing that struck me is like a couple of times you write critically [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=2649.84s)]
*  about like accepting the invention of racecraft in the book. And like you write about this sort of, [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=2655.6s)]
*  and there's this tension, right, between making racial identity and like the racial prioritization [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=2661.36s)]
*  like a prime focus versus like rejecting the false construct a bit. And, you know, again, [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=2668.16s)]
*  it was 10 years ago, so I didn't really rereading it now. That struck me because like that a lot of [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=2674.3199999999997s)]
*  the folks, you know, in the ensuing decade have leaned in way more to like the kind of racial [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=2680.48s)]
*  hierarchy argument side of this, you know, which is not, which obviously is there in your work as [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=2689.84s)]
*  well. And so I don't know, I just, I'm wondering, did you watch all of that with any, [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=2695.52s)]
*  did it evolve your view at all? Or did you think that was cool? I don't know, like what did you [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=2701.6s)]
*  make of kind of all of the conversation around that in the ensuing decade? So that's a great question. [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=2706.8s)]
*  And I'll say two things. The first thing is there's a very subtle shift that's being made [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=2712.72s)]
*  in this president between the world and I really had to do it when I was doing [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=2717.7599999999998s)]
*  case for reparations because the argument in case for reparations is not that black people should [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=2721.04s)]
*  get reparations. It is that victims of enslavement, Jim Crow should get reparations. There's a very [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=2725.7599999999998s)]
*  subtle difference there. The point is not the color of your skin. The point is I can prove that [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=2736.24s)]
*  somebody injured you and you should be paid for that. Just like if, you know, you're walking down [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=2741.2799999999997s)]
*  the street and the cops jump on you and beat the hell out of you and you sue the city. The city [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=2746.0s)]
*  should repair you. It is connected deeply to the injury, not to your skin color. And that's a [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=2749.52s)]
*  subtle thing. You know what I mean? And so what you're talking about, that is present [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=2758.56s)]
*  in between the world and me also. And it's present whenever I think the line in between the world and [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=2765.52s)]
*  me is race is the child of racism, not the father. In other words, it's the racism that's real. It's [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=2769.36s)]
*  the thing. Somebody wants to do something to you. They call you the thing and then you become the [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=2774.64s)]
*  thing in their eyes. You know, now you have a decision about whether you accept that or not. [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=2779.52s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? And so it was always important to me not to accept it. I think the [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=2783.6s)]
*  problem comes in in the second part. So that's a very nuanced thing that I have to go through and [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=2788.3199999999997s)]
*  complicated to go through. I think during that same period, some of us, some of us decided that [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=2792.0s)]
*  social media was an effective place to convey nuanced ideas. I think that was a mistake. [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=2801.76s)]
*  Okay. I actually think that was the mistake. In what way? [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=2808.0800000000004s)]
*  When I write, I am ridiculously careful. I don't just throw things out. I don't just lob things [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=2816.1600000000003s)]
*  because I recognize that many of the things that I am saying are things that people are not really [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=2824.96s)]
*  going to want to hear. Even people who are sympathetic to me. There's a part of me that's [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=2829.12s)]
*  really Ta-Nehisi. You're going to make me question this again. And so it's really, really important [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=2832.7999999999997s)]
*  that I be as thorough as I possibly can. I be as nuanced as I possibly can. I be as direct and [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=2837.92s)]
*  articulate as I possibly can. There's a phrase in that book, the people who think themselves white, [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=2844.88s)]
*  that I actually adopted from James Baldwin, that I repeat over and over again. And I'm not being [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=2851.2s)]
*  sarcastic when I say that. I am saying that this is an invention. That we really aren't different. [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=2856.08s)]
*  There really is no bone. There's nothing bone-deep. There's nothing. There's nothing. [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=2863.2799999999997s)]
*  You know what I mean? There is a fiction and a narrative and things that have come out of that [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=2867.6s)]
*  that have made us different, but it's not a real thing. It took forever for me to figure out how [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=2871.36s)]
*  to say that in a way that I felt true to me. You know what I mean? It took multiple drafts and [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=2876.56s)]
*  going and looking over sentences again and again. And somebody who is trying to take that level of [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=2883.36s)]
*  care, because I believe that's the level of care that we have to take, if we want people to take [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=2889.6000000000004s)]
*  our ideas seriously, that person probably should not have the ability to immediately try to [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=2893.1200000000003s)]
*  articulate that, press a button, and send it out to a million people. Those two things are in tension [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=2901.52s)]
*  with each other. I would argue they're actually contrary to each other. [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=2908.16s)]
*  So I know that there are... Well, I'll just speak for me. It takes so much work and so much effort [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=2911.84s)]
*  to say the thing in a way that is true to what I actually feel that I'm seeing. And I am not capable [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=2919.84s)]
*  of doing that in a tweet, Instagram, Blue Sky, whatever. It's just not... The medium is not [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=2926.72s)]
*  suited for that. And so what happens is then there are either people who, fair-mindedly, [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=2934.0s)]
*  don't get the nuance of what you're saying. And so that becomes a problem. And there are other [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=2941.68s)]
*  people who are completely unfair and are not legitimate. And then they use this butchered [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=2945.44s)]
*  version of you. And that becomes who you are. I think when you're coming with narratives and [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=2952.08s)]
*  ideas and themes and theories that are outside of what people are used to and what the mainstream [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=2959.44s)]
*  is, you got to be patient. You got to be patient with yourself and you got to be patient with them. [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=2963.84s)]
*  That doesn't mean that you got to be less radical or not aggressive or not say what you think, [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=2968.56s)]
*  but you need to make damn sure that you're saying what you think in the best way you possibly can. [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=2973.44s)]
*  Kevin Duffield It's interesting to put social media on that because... And there clearly [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=2977.76s)]
*  has been a backlash. I don't like what you ascribe it to and how much [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=2982.32s)]
*  of it was already there versus how much is backlash. But at some level, the Trump movement [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=2989.28s)]
*  and other this rise of more explicitly racist young folks like the Gropers and stuff like this, [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=2995.52s)]
*  it's not as if those people did not exist in 1996. They just weren't talking about it in [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=3003.84s)]
*  quite as an upfront way. So there's some backlash. And so to point to social media as the... I guess, [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=3008.8s)]
*  is that what you're saying? You think that just the nature of the discourse, the social media [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=3017.12s)]
*  was the driver of that, do you think? Or was there going to be a necessary backlash [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=3021.2799999999997s)]
*  no matter what? Anytime there was more... [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=3025.7599999999998s)]
*  Rob Markman There's never been a moment... Look, when Obama got... We should have known. [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=3028.16s)]
*  There have never been moments of racial progress in this country where there was no backlash. [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=3034.3199999999997s)]
*  So that was going to happen. I guess the thing I'm more referring to is probably [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=3038.88s)]
*  some of the writers and maybe even activists who are of accord with me in terms of my politics, [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=3043.44s)]
*  in terms of where I would like to see the world, who I think maybe articulate themselves too much [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=3050.7999999999997s)]
*  over social media. It became their main way. And actually what they were saying was quite [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=3057.7599999999998s)]
*  complicated and important and significant, but I don't know that a tweet is the best way to do it. [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=3063.12s)]
*  Tim Cynova So I guess one more thought about that [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=3070.32s)]
*  evolution over the last 10 years, because I look at it and I want you to go ahead and tell me that [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=3076.5600000000004s)]
*  this is moderate Tim being misguided about the nature of these things. Please feel free to say [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=3080.88s)]
*  that. But I look back at the 10 years and look, my daughter's like, I've adopted a daughter. And [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=3087.36s)]
*  one of the coolest things about that... Rob Markman How old is she? [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=3091.6000000000004s)]
*  Tim Cynova She's seven. [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=3094.0800000000004s)]
*  Rob Markman Okay. [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=3094.6400000000003s)]
*  Rob Markman Congratulations. [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=3095.36s)]
*  Tim Cynova So in this moment... [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=3096.6400000000003s)]
*  Rob Markman You've made it seven years. [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=3097.2000000000003s)]
*  Tim Cynova Yeah, she's amazing. And we have made it seven years. And here's the cool thing about [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=3099.04s)]
*  it, that she grew up in this moment, is that my parents and my husband's parents who are from the [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=3102.9599999999996s)]
*  suburbs and from rural America, respectively, and have like a combined eight black people in the [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=3111.9199999999996s)]
*  counties where they lived, right, growing up. Like they now, I think in a large part to the change [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=3118.56s)]
*  that we've seen over the last 10 years, can go buy her kids books that have little black girls [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=3125.52s)]
*  as the main character and dolls. And it's easy for them, right? Rather than having to go out and do [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=3131.36s)]
*  it. And they kind of get why it's important in a way that they, I don't think maybe would have [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=3138.72s)]
*  20 years ago, right? So there's been progress in this kind of area of recognition and platforming [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=3142.64s)]
*  or whatever identity that has been positive. And then there's been this other element that's like, [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=3152.96s)]
*  well, you know, we're gonna have at schools now, we're going to re-separate people, [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=3158.64s)]
*  and have groups of black kids and white kids in different classes, or we're going to have [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=3164.56s)]
*  these things where we rank, you know, the intersectionality and the different [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=3168.48s)]
*  levels of oppression, if you're this and that group combined versus that and that group combined. [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=3173.28s)]
*  And to me, it kind of like feels like there was some really positive elements. And then there were [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=3178.16s)]
*  some elements that like lend itself to a more potent backlash. And I don't know if you [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=3184.16s)]
*  look at the period and feel that at all, or I think I'm totally off base about it. [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=3192.48s)]
*  Rob Markman No, I don't think you're totally off base. I think all [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=3196.96s)]
*  movements had their excesses. And I think all movements have their fools, [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=3200.08s)]
*  you know, who are part of those movements, you know, and sometimes those fools, you know, have [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=3207.04s)]
*  power. And sometimes those excessive people have power and they do things that are not smart, [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=3212.08s)]
*  and are not in service of the ideals that they claim to be serving. I think that the difference is [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=3217.36s)]
*  Rob Markman So I'm off two minds about this, you know, on the one hand, I feel like, again, like [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=3226.16s)]
*  what I was saying before is that when you are the person that's seeking to revolutionize something, [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=3231.6s)]
*  when you are telling a group of people, you want to go in front of a group of people and say, [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=3236.64s)]
*  everything you have, all of your material progress in the world and all your mother's material [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=3240.64s)]
*  progress, grandma, that all generate is rooted in the destruction of somebody else's stuff. And [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=3246.3199999999997s)]
*  after that, you have to understand that's gonna be hard for people to take. [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=3251.52s)]
*  Rob Markman Yeah. [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=3257.12s)]
*  Rob Markman So yeah, that's true. You know what I mean? And so what that means is, again, I really, [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=3258.0s)]
*  you know, have to stress this. It doesn't mean that you don't say it, though. But you just have [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=3264.88s)]
*  to remember how difficult that would be for you to hear. You know what I mean? And then you have to, [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=3270.4s)]
*  A, say it in the most truthful way you can. You know what I mean? And weirdly enough, I believe [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=3275.04s)]
*  this, you know, even though I write hard and write aggressive, you actually have to say it in the [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=3281.84s)]
*  most compassionate way you can say it too. Now, compassion to me means something different probably [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=3284.8s)]
*  than it does to a lot of other people. But some people, compassion means you, you know, you talk [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=3289.2s)]
*  soft to people and you rub their back. And for me, it means that you address them like adults, [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=3292.96s)]
*  you address them respectfully, but you're very direct, you know, with them about what is what. [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=3297.44s)]
*  And I think all political movements don't exist under that burden, though. Certainly MAGA doesn't. [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=3302.48s)]
*  You know what I mean? Like they can say, excesses are the point for them. You know what I mean? [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=3312.16s)]
*  Like, you know, going over the line, that's the whole point. I mean, you know, to do that, [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=3315.6s)]
*  yet for us and for people, you know, who really seek this kind of, you know, bone deep change in [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=3319.68s)]
*  the country, that's not a luxury we have. You know, that's not a luxury that we have [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=3326.4s)]
*  had. And so are there people out there, you know what I mean, who said and did certain things, [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=3332.32s)]
*  you know what I mean? And articulate themselves in certain ways. And if there's a level of vagary [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=3340.1600000000003s)]
*  that's coming into my language right now, it's because I was never able to measure like what was [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=3344.32s)]
*  what and how much, you know, was, you know, like what portion of this was actually true. In other [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=3349.2000000000003s)]
*  words, what portion of this was real and what portion of it was being ginned up. You know, [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=3354.0s)]
*  I'm not saying no portion of it was real, but it was always, because I'll be honest, like a lot of [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=3357.2000000000003s)]
*  the people who I was hearing that from were not people who I would say. [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=3361.84s)]
*  You've a lot of respect for their point of view. [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=3369.6800000000003s)]
*  Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. I would not consider them, you know what I mean? Now, something I did, I was like, [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=3371.52s)]
*  this is truly some dumb shit. Like, you know what I mean? And I would, you know, have no problem with [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=3376.0s)]
*  that. But no, I don't think you're wrong, man. I don't think that is incorrect. I think, [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=3379.6000000000004s)]
*  I think there were people that did not want 2020. I mean, here's okay. So here's an example. I think [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=3386.88s)]
*  about, let me make this, maybe I can make this a little bit more tangible, right? Okay. [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=3396.96s)]
*  Folks are really upset about defunding the police, right? Yeah. Like that was, and that became a [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=3402.32s)]
*  political flashpoint. Like it became a thing that people said this person wants to defund the police. [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=3407.04s)]
*  How many actual people running for office in Congress, in Senate, whatever said, I want to [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=3411.92s)]
*  defund the police? I don't think many said it. You know what I mean? It was, it was an activist [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=3419.28s)]
*  crime. Some mayors and prosecutors. Some mayors and prosecutors. Did they use that language? I mean, [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=3426.56s)]
*  and you can tell me they did. I mean, I'm just curious. Did they say, I want, I'm running on [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=3431.28s)]
*  defunding the police? Yeah. I guess I'd have to go back to the archives. I mean, like there were [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=3434.16s)]
*  some functionally, you know, that they were with that crowd, you know, I guess. With that, [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=3438.16s)]
*  with that crowd. See, that's what I mean though, right? Like, like I could be with that crowd, [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=3447.6s)]
*  you know what I mean? Like, oh, yeah, I sympathize with what you're saying, but maybe I would say it [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=3451.68s)]
*  differently. You know what I mean? Like, but see, actually even I'm not, you know, trying to go [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=3454.64s)]
*  squish you on this. In fact, I think like what you're saying makes the point, right? Like you [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=3458.88s)]
*  have to worry about what crowds you're with. Yeah. But your opposition really doesn't. Yeah. [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=3462.64s)]
*  You know, they didn't walk around with open racist. Who cares? You know what I mean? Like, [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=3467.6800000000003s)]
*  it really, it really doesn't matter. You know what I mean? And so that's like, there's a weight you [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=3470.96s)]
*  labor under to be on point, correct. You know what I mean? At all times. I feel like as a writer, [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=3475.28s)]
*  this serves me because it actually forces me to re interrogate everything I write. It forces me out [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=3482.1600000000003s)]
*  of certain mediums, you know, again, at certain places, I just don't go to talk and I just don't [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=3488.0s)]
*  because they don't serve that. And so it really concentrates me. But I do understand that, you [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=3492.24s)]
*  know, I don't know, I guess I go back to where we started at the, at the beginning here, you know, [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=3496.4799999999996s)]
*  people are human. Yeah. People are human, you know, and sometimes they're unwise and how they, [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=3502.72s)]
*  you know, articulate things and think about things and say things. And they say things that, [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=3507.04s)]
*  you know, maybe get them an applause and not necessarily about the work that they claim to be. [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=3511.12s)]
*  Two other little items from the book. And when I read it last night, I was like, I thought about [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=3518.16s)]
*  it differently than I would have in 2015. Dr. Mabel Jones, my favorite character, God love her, [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=3521.92s)]
*  lost her son, LSU grad, I should shut that out. She's unbelievable. She wrote, she said when you're [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=3526.7200000000003s)]
*  talking to her compared America to Rome, glory days long ago past, and those were sullied and [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=3532.64s)]
*  we can't get the message. We don't understand that we're embracing our deaths. This was you to your [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=3537.36s)]
*  son later in the book, you wrote, I do not believe that we can stop them being the kind of American [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=3541.76s)]
*  power structure because they just will ultimately stop themselves. [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=3547.28s)]
*  Both of those things seem a lot more acute than maybe they did in 2015. [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=3552.96s)]
*  That was harsh. [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=3557.84s)]
*  Was that not in your spirit of compassionate writing? [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=3561.92s)]
*  No, it wasn't my spirit of compassionate writing. Cause I think like your compassion begins with [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=3565.6800000000003s)]
*  honesty. Yeah. You know, I think actually people can feel that. I think people can feel when you're [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=3569.6000000000004s)]
*  trying to hurt them and when you're trying to be straight with them. Yeah. I mean, again, [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=3573.6s)]
*  I think what I got in the back of that writing was, I said earlier that I started with case [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=3578.0s)]
*  for reparations. I had done at that point, I did so much research for that work that what became [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=3582.72s)]
*  clear was that the standard sort of liberal articulation of this of America as a fundamentally [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=3587.44s)]
*  good country, fundamentally in its bones good, that just made some mistakes, some significant ones, [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=3595.68s)]
*  but some mistakes was false. It was false. Those things that are dismissed as mistakes [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=3601.76s)]
*  are actually core to what the country is. And if you take them out, you actually don't have a country. [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=3610.1600000000003s)]
*  And so that can't help, but reformulate how you feel. And so that I can be completely, [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=3616.48s)]
*  maybe a little clearer about what I mean when I say that. [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=3623.36s)]
*  I think, you know, when I was writing case for reparations, [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=3627.68s)]
*  I was writing to a reader who probably believed [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=3634.16s)]
*  that slavery was a thing that happened in this country alongside everything else. In other words, [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=3639.12s)]
*  if slavery didn't happen, you could still have an America. And what became clear is fundamentally [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=3646.48s)]
*  that is not true. Like fundamentally, you know what I mean? Like you look at your institutions [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=3652.8s)]
*  that date back from that period, it was tough in 1850 to assemble a large amount of money and not [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=3658.8s)]
*  have your fingerprints somewhere on slavery. It was that big of a thing. You know what I mean? [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=3665.04s)]
*  And then that followed through into, you know, and this was the heart of that, I say, you know, [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=3671.28s)]
*  the GI Bill and all of the reforms then, which were only possible by excluding [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=3676.32s)]
*  African-Americans. They went in the past. You just wouldn't have had them. You know? And so [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=3682.8s)]
*  when you start accepting that about the country, you say, oh, oh, this is who, you know, if you [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=3688.0800000000004s)]
*  just think about it as a person, and now you're getting an accurate biography of who that person [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=3692.0s)]
*  is. And you say, oh, so where is that person probably going in 10 years? You know? And so [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=3696.48s)]
*  like for that book, it just, it fundamentally caused me to fundamentally reassess what was [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=3705.76s)]
*  possible, what was likely possible. You know what I mean? In terms of what the country could do. [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=3710.4s)]
*  That was before Trump too. I wrote that before. Yeah, right. That's what I'm saying. It's just, [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=3715.6s)]
*  it's so stark now, right? This, like the element of stopping themselves. It probably felt a little [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=3719.36s)]
*  overwrought, honestly, in 2015. That's what everybody told me. That's what everybody told [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=3724.8s)]
*  me. That was the critique of it. They were like, this dude is hopeless. He's overdoing it. He's [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=3729.36s)]
*  despair. Come on, man. To me, this feels kind of like modest now. It's kind of, this is like a [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=3733.36s)]
*  median bulwark article. No, man. That was people were like, no, this dude's gone way too far. What [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=3737.6s)]
*  is wrong with him? All right. Real quick, two things real quick. Our culture editor, Sonny Bunch, [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=3743.7599999999998s)]
*  demanded that I ask you if the black Superman movie is dead. I know nothing about this world. [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=3747.04s)]
*  I guess you have a whole other life where you do comic books and movies and stuff, [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=3751.92s)]
*  and this is not my world. I don't care about what happens in magical creatures, but other people do. [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=3756.08s)]
*  So I have to ask. [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=3762.88s)]
*  Are you sure you care? [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=3764.2400000000002s)]
*  So I guess that the answer I can give is that it's still in development. Other people have said that, [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=3767.2000000000003s)]
*  so with more power than me. So I don't think I'm going beyond what's been publicly said. [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=3772.8s)]
*  I don't even know what the weight of that question is, to be honest. Literally, I was like, I asked [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=3777.2000000000003s)]
*  some other folks, I was like, is there anything I should ask them? So he's like, you have to ask [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=3781.6800000000003s)]
*  them what the black Superman movie. So anyway, I'm for a black Superman. I don't know. We saw a lot [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=3784.2400000000002s)]
*  of backlash to that lesbian kiss and Buzz Lightyear though, and the black little mermaid. So you never [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=3791.6s)]
*  know what the ramifications of that might be. All right, last one then. So the book is framed, [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=3796.56s)]
*  right, as to your son, right, Samori? It's written to him. Was it advice to your son, would you say, [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=3801.8399999999997s)]
*  or more of an explanation for your son of your perspective? You're rereading it. You're like, [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=3810.3199999999997s)]
*  obviously your backstory could not be more different than mine, and your experience could [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=3818.48s)]
*  not be more different than mine. So I found myself throughout thinking about it as a father, [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=3822.4s)]
*  it's been like, there's just a lot of history and life experience that I just do not bring to this [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=3826.88s)]
*  job that you did, right? And so I guess my question for you is, if you have any advice [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=3833.68s)]
*  for me or for my child? No, you know what I think? I think you're both right and you're wrong. You're [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=3840.08s)]
*  right in the point of, you know, obviously just on its face, you know, our backgrounds are very [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=3846.0s)]
*  different. Having said that, I do believe that anybody who's had to live a significant portion [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=3852.48s)]
*  of their life or their entire life, outside of what the dominant culture and politics [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=3862.16s)]
*  articulates itself as the ideal, as the archetype, probably has some level of insight [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=3872.56s)]
*  into that culture that people who have not don't, you know? And so that was all between the world [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=3881.44s)]
*  and me was, right? Like it was like, okay, there's this umbrella of humanity and human rights. [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=3887.76s)]
*  I am from a group of people that for their history have in general been outside of that. What are my [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=3893.76s)]
*  insights on it? You know what I mean? And so I suspect that- Well, you can give me advice without [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=3898.96s)]
*  you don't have to attack me. No, I'm not. I'm not. I know you're not. You don't have to be like, [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=3907.92s)]
*  yeah, bro, you're right. You don't know anything. I appreciate that. I know some things. I didn't [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=3912.96s)]
*  think I knew nothing. I'm just saying, you know, maybe there's also some part that's black, that's [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=3917.28s)]
*  dark to me, right? That I just, it was not in my field of vision and I'm learning about it. [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=3923.6s)]
*  You probably know more than you think. That's the first thing I was saying. And then like, [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=3929.12s)]
*  you have to remember, like most of my insights actually come from taking a much harder, more [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=3933.92s)]
*  skeptical look at a story that I already knew. You know what I mean? Or thought I knew, you know, [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=3939.36s)]
*  it did not come for instance, I'm going to go spend some time on some reservations and, you know, [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=3943.84s)]
*  that would have been a worthwhile endeavor, but it did not come from that. I mean, it actually came [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=3947.68s)]
*  from, you know, it was a deeply internal mission that allowed me to externalize. Man, I guess, [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=3952.4s)]
*  why am I resisting this question? I don't enjoy the notion of the idea that people write books [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=3959.28s)]
*  that other people perceive as insightful. Like you just wrote the book, like you just wrote a book [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=3971.84s)]
*  and you were insightful in that moment. You know, it doesn't mean that you're insightful about life. [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=3976.64s)]
*  And not only that, not only that, not only that, there are people who can't write books or don't [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=3982.56s)]
*  write books or haven't yet who have their own stories and their own experiences. And then there's [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=3991.12s)]
*  insight that is drawn from that too. And that's equal. You know what I mean? And sometimes more. [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=3996.88s)]
*  And just cause you wrote the book doesn't mean that you have it more. Like I began my professional [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=4000.32s)]
*  career as a journalist. And part of being a journalist is you sit down and you listen to [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=4005.52s)]
*  people and you make yourself stupid, you know, and oftentimes they have insights into life [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=4009.68s)]
*  that, you know, just would never occur to you. And so I really do go back to what I was saying. [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=4017.12s)]
*  I'm just saying, I think like, how do you have a conversation with your daughter explaining how [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=4022.0s)]
*  different the world is that she's growing up in terms of how it looks at LGBT people and how it [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=4030.24s)]
*  looked at you? Like, I imagine that's going to be a little abstract to her. You know? And yet [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=4037.6s)]
*  I imagine there are also lessons and experiences, you know, from that, from having lived through that [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=4044.72s)]
*  that are probably also important. Does that make sense? [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=4050.24s)]
*  Yeah, sure. [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=4053.68s)]
*  All right. I don't want to assume too much. [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=4054.88s)]
*  No, no, no. I was the one. It's all good. I hear that, man. It's, you know, we're all on a journey [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=4056.96s)]
*  and just trying to navigate through it, you know? And I feel lucky that I have been able to [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=4066.4s)]
*  go through different kinds of things and experiences that opened my perspective onto [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=4075.52s)]
*  different, you know, items that maybe I wouldn't have, right? Had I just been straight or I just [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=4078.88s)]
*  had a family that's monoracial, whatever. But like with that comes like challenges and awakenings [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=4083.28s)]
*  and all that. And so anyway. [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=4093.44s)]
*  Oh, I do have one piece of advice. [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=4096.96s)]
*  Yeah. Okay, great. Perfect. We can leave it on that. [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=4098.32s)]
*  Right. If you have the ability and the power at any point to live [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=4100.4800000000005s)]
*  for some period of time outside the country and with that to raise a kid who is not monolingual [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=4106.56s)]
*  and maybe already on that, I don't know. That's a great thing. It's a great thing. [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=4115.12s)]
*  Outside the country. [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=4120.32s)]
*  The best thing I ever did for my kid. Best thing. [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=4120.96s)]
*  That is good advice. And who knows, I might be thrust out of the country anytime now. [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=4123.12s)]
*  So that might make it easy on me. Man, I really appreciate you. This is so fun. It's good to meet [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=4127.92s)]
*  you. And let's do it again sometime. All right. All right. Thanks, brother. [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=4134.0s)]
*  All right. We'll see you soon. All right. Thanks so much to Ta-Nehisi Coates. I really appreciate [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=4137.84s)]
*  him coming on the pod. I want to have a bonus segment for you guys. On Friday, we did a live [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=4141.44s)]
*  show and fundraiser, Free Andri, in support of immigrant defenders, which was the legal effort [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=4148.0s)]
*  helping the Venezuelans that have then disappeared to that hellhole in El Salvador. And we had a [[01:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=4154.48s)]
*  little bit of fun. If you want to go watch the whole show, which included some pretty raunchy [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=4161.84s)]
*  gay jokes, some annoyingly funny material from Sarah, who I think was just adamant that she was [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=4166.88s)]
*  going to outshine me and love it, who think we're the jokesters. So if you want to go see all that, [[01:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=4175.28s)]
*  the comedy, go to the YouTube page and you can check it all out there. But for podcast listeners, [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=4180.08s)]
*  I wanted to share with you the serious parts of the show. I interviewed Lindsay Toslowski, [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=4187.84s)]
*  who's the lawyer representing Andri and a handful of other of the Venezuelans. And boy, she's just [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=4193.599999999999s)]
*  amazing. And we appreciate her work so much. It was great to finally meet her in person. We've [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=4200.96s)]
*  been DMing for a while now. So I've got that segment. And then at the very end of the show, [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=4205.36s)]
*  I took off my jokester hat and gave a rant about why this specific case has upset me so much [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=4211.12s)]
*  and why we want to do everything that we can to continue to draw attention to it in the hopes [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=4219.2s)]
*  that we can eventually prevent these men from being disappeared for no reason except the cruelty [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=4225.04s)]
*  of the folks in this White House. So I hope you enjoy both of those segments as much as possible. [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=4232.88s)]
*  If I make you cry, sorry. And we will see you all back here tomorrow with our usual [[01:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=4240.08s)]
*  Bill Crystal Monday, but on Tuesday. So stick around and we'll see you all back here soon. [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JOrQ0R54MM&t=4246.56s)]
