Video Description: While Trump and his administration are the ones politicizing the rule of the law, ignoring due process, and annihilating democratic norms, it's Republicans leaders saying and doing nothing in response that poses a bigger threat to our country and democracy. Meanwhile, when it comes to the Middle East, we don't know who Trump is talking to—or listening to. Plus, when Bush 43, McCain, and Jeb pushed for immigration reform, the romantic idealism of Aaron Sorkin, and the sounds of kids and dogs. (An unfiltered) Nicolle Wallace joins Tim Miller.

# Nicolle Wallace Unfiltered: Silence of Republicans Is the Bigger Threat | Bulwark Podcast
**The Bulwark Podcast:** [June 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M)
*  It is true that neither party is perfect. It is also true that only one party is trying to [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=0.0s)]
*  erode our democratic principles and norms. So anyone that makes an argument to me about [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=5.84s)]
*  principles, like what are you talking about? I mean, I never agreed with everything that [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=10.56s)]
*  Republican parties stood for either. Hello and welcome to the Bullock podcast. I'm your host, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=15.120000000000001s)]
*  Tim Miller. Could not be more delighted to be here today with the host of Deadline White House [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=26.56s)]
*  and MSNBC. She's got a new podcast as well, The Best People with Nicole Wallace. It's Nicole [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=30.64s)]
*  Wallace. I finally get to turn the mic on you. It's terrifying. I'm thrilled. I felt horrible [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=36.64s)]
*  because I was like, when do I get to turn the mic on you? And you're like, you've never formally [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=42.48s)]
*  asked me. You've never asked me. This is my first. I think I did. I don't know, Pat. I got to be a [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=45.599999999999994s)]
*  tougher booker. No, I think there was a cool factor that I don't, I mean, I've not been on a [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=50.88s)]
*  lot of podcasts. John Heilman is the only one that invites me on his podcast. I don't think it's the [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=56.96s)]
*  cool factor. I think people are scared because you're doing two hours a day. You've got a newborn. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=60.800000000000004s)]
*  I'm like, do I want to bug Nicole? You know what? I mean, I've anchored the last two Saturdays and [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=66.4s)]
*  I'm entering this mode of like always on. Like your endurance picks up when you do more. Yeah. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=71.52000000000001s)]
*  All right. I want to talk to you about your news life. We got to do a little actual news first. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=77.52000000000001s)]
*  Okay. Sure. This morning, we've had like since yesterday's podcast, we've had a ceasefire [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=80.88s)]
*  announcement, more bombings, another temporary ceasefire, more bombings. So it's a little tenuous [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=88.24s)]
*  right now. I did a TikTok with Sam Stein on YouTube if people want to watch that. But the latest we [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=94.39999999999999s)]
*  have the president, I don't usually place Trump's voice on the podcast, but we're going to make an [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=99.19999999999999s)]
*  exception for this one because he uses one of the podcast's favorite words. He's talking about his [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=103.91999999999999s)]
*  frustration with the fact that Israel and Iran did not follow the greatest ceasefire ever that he [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=108.56s)]
*  had announced on his social media feed. Let's listen to him real quick. So I'm not happy with [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=113.84s)]
*  them. I'm not happy with Iran either, but I'm really unhappy if Israel's going out this morning [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=118.64s)]
*  because the one rocket that didn't land that was shot, perhaps by mistake, that didn't land. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=124.24000000000001s)]
*  I'm not happy about that. You know what? We basically have two countries that have been [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=130.0s)]
*  fighting so long and so hard that they don't know what the fuck they're doing. Do you understand that? [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=137.2s)]
*  Maybe true of everybody involved kind of. I don't know, does Ayatollah know what he's doing? Does Trump? [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=146.23999999999998s)]
*  Does Hexa? There's always a projection, right? I mean. What have you made about this whole 12-day [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=151.28s)]
*  saga? Well, I feel like Bill Barr gave us bullshit because it was a direct quote and now Trump has [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=157.04s)]
*  given us, you know, they don't know what the fuck they're doing and now we can just quote him. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=163.6s)]
*  So for that, I'm grateful. I think that we have to be careful not to become amnesic, right? [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=168.32s)]
*  Like this is a guy who couldn't pull off the egg roll without annihilating norms and ethics laws. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=176.0s)]
*  And so we have to be really, really careful about what he says about the Middle East. Like, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=182.79999999999998s)]
*  I get that he's the president. He's the commander in chief. He's the only one we have. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=190.0s)]
*  But I'm uneasy broadcasting his tweets and his comments on a newscast because I don't know if [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=195.52s)]
*  he knows what he's talking about. Yeah. I mean, and we saw that last night and I was up laying in bed [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=202.72s)]
*  doing the unhealthy thing where I'm scrolling social media while also being in bed. So you're [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=209.6s)]
*  doing that. And we're like coming up on that where the ceasefires was supposed to be. And he is [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=214.08s)]
*  sending out a bleat about how great and brilliant everything was and how it's the best ceasefire [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=219.6s)]
*  ever, you know, in one post. And then the next post I see is like four dead in Israel because an [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=225.68s)]
*  Iran missile broke through the Iron Dome, right? So it's like in real time, he's giving fake [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=231.68s)]
*  information. Yeah. And I think it's for it's for another draft to figure out if he knows it's false [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=238.32s)]
*  at the time. You know, I don't know. But he would have the ability to know if I'm correct. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=245.2s)]
*  Correct. But he, I mean, I'm like, I think it was when we're living dog years, but I think it was [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=251.28s)]
*  four days ago that he broke with his hand picked Intel chief. So it's unclear where he's getting [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=255.92s)]
*  his information. It's unclear if it's coming from US national security agencies or elsewhere or [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=262.8s)]
*  the media. I mean, I don't, I don't, it's, it's completely unclear who he's talking to and who [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=269.92s)]
*  he's listening to. Ed Bill Crystal, me and Bill Crystal were going back and forth yesterday and [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=277.68s)]
*  he's a little bit, I don't know, his old neocon muscles are flexing a little bit right now. And [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=282.08s)]
*  he's like, you know, I don't like Trump, but the mullahs are so bad and the Iranian people deserve [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=286.96s)]
*  freedom and we don't want them to have nukes. And if it's a tailored strike, maybe that's a good [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=292.8s)]
*  thing. Maybe it weakens Iran more. Is there any of your old, old muscles flaring in that direction? [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=299.44s)]
*  I mean, I, I put all those muscles out to pasture. But I think a clear headed analysis, [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=306.8s)]
*  I mean, Alyssa Slack center Slack and had this analysis that she'd been in Iraq and the Iranians [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=313.76s)]
*  have the blood of US soldiers on their hands. I mean, they've been a threat and a danger and, [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=320.72s)]
*  and they've, they've, they're, they're an adversary. And that's clear. But I think we're in a tricky [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=327.76000000000005s)]
*  zone where we're trying to sort of sift through the chaos and the mayhem and find little flecks [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=339.04s)]
*  of gold. I mean, sure, there will always be them. And the other one is thank God, all the men and [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=345.28000000000003s)]
*  women of the military that carried out this operation came home safe. I mean, that is, [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=349.68s)]
*  that is truly a wonderful aspect of all this. But I'll leave that to others. I mean, I think [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=354.88s)]
*  my focus is on what happens next. You know, what happens today, what happens tomorrow. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=361.92s)]
*  And, and again, I think it's stupid to compare Trump to other presidents. It's fair to compare [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=367.84000000000003s)]
*  Trump to the last time he was president. And there is no one like Mark Milley around him. I [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=373.92s)]
*  mean, he seems to be listening to General Cain, his chairman of the Joint Chiefs, but he doesn't [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=380.40000000000003s)]
*  say the same thing that he says Trump's analysis. The night of the strikes was that we had, quote, [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=384.48s)]
*  obliterated their program. Cain went out the next morning and didn't say anything close to that. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=389.28000000000003s)]
*  And the assessment hadn't even taken place when Trump addressed the nation. So I, there will [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=393.36s)]
*  always be, you know, flecks of gold in that little thing of sound we sift, we sift through. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=399.04s)]
*  And that's a good thing. But I, I think that the bigger picture is, is what keeps me up at night. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=405.20000000000005s)]
*  **Matt Stauffer** Yeah. I'm going to make you list all the things that keep you up at night at the [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=411.20000000000005s)]
*  very end. A couple of other news things I want to do. Lisa Murkowski was on Galen Drewk's podcast, [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=416.0s)]
*  and credit to Galen because he was really relentless in questioning her about a topic [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=424.0s)]
*  that has been something that I've been wondering for a while, which is why she isn't considering [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=428.88s)]
*  it's not becoming a Democrat, you know, teaming up with Angus King and creating some independent [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=432.96s)]
*  caucus within the Senate. He asked her about it. I want to play you just, it went on for like six [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=438.72s)]
*  minutes. I just want to play a couple of little bites from it and get your reaction. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=443.28s)]
*  **Matt Stauffer** Say Democrats win three seats in the next midterm election in the Senate. And [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=445.84s)]
*  they say, we're going to let you pass bills that benefit Alaskans if you caucus with us. You don't [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=452.08s)]
*  have to become a Democrat. You can be an independent, but if you caucus with us and provide the sort of [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=456.71999999999997s)]
*  fourth vote that we need to get from where we are now, and you can pass legislation that helps [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=463.52s)]
*  Alaskans, would you do it? **Lisa Murkowski** [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=469.28s)]
*  That's my primary goal. I have to figure out how I can be most effective for the people that I serve. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=471.36s)]
*  That's, that's why I'm going to continue to do a really hard job because I want to try to help [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=476.79999999999995s)]
*  people. My part, my problem with your, with your hypothetical is that as, as challenged as I think [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=480.96s)]
*  we may be on the Republican side, I don't see the Democrats being, being much better. And, [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=491.59999999999997s)]
*  and they've got not only their share of problems, but quite honestly, there's, they've got some [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=498.64s)]
*  policies that I just inherently disagree with. **Matt Stauffer** [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=505.03999999999996s)]
*  She goes on to kind of, after he asked again and again, to kind of say, well, I'm open to it. I, [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=507.76s)]
*  I'm not, it was, it was kind of a Jim Carrey. So you're saying there's a chance answer there a [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=511.76s)]
*  little bit, but I don't know. I, that just kind of lets me feeling cold. I'm like, I don't, I don't [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=516.8s)]
*  even really know what she's talking about. Like what is that? **Lisa Murkowski** [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=521.6s)]
*  Look, I mean, 2015 is calling and they want their like BS, why can't you be a Democrat response back? [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=524.24s)]
*  Like he's now orchestrated an insurrection against the U S Capitol. You ran for your life. I think [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=530.88s)]
*  there's footage of it because of Trump. The Republicans did nothing when he pardoned all [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=537.04s)]
*  the insurrectionists that made you run for your life. He's put people atop the FBI and the Pentagon, [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=542.24s)]
*  who generously speaking are inexperienced, accurately speaking are completely unqualified. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=548.8s)]
*  They were opposed. I mean, I think she opposed one or both of them. So the idea that their [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=556.3199999999999s)]
*  policy, she's not totally psyched about on the Democratic side is ludicrous. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=561.6800000000001s)]
*  And it's, it's, I think Trump is what he is. I think the Republicans are the bigger threat to [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=565.84s)]
*  the country at this point. **Jayson Kline** [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=571.2800000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I don't, it's kind of crazy. And how do you process all of it? I just look at her and I'm like, [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=572.5600000000001s)]
*  we've now, we're now in year nine or 10 of Trump and one Republican, Jeff Van Drew of New Jersey, [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=578.0s)]
*  has switched parties from Democrat to Republican. None have gone the other way. And now we've had [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=583.6800000000001s)]
*  Liz, Janie and Adam Kinzinger who like, we've had people who showed courage and then retired Jeff [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=588.96s)]
*  Lake. But I just, I don't, I can't process like why, like what, what do you think is really holding [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=593.12s)]
*  her up? I guess is my question. Could it possibly be energy policy? Like what could it be? [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=600.96s)]
*  **Sue Leach** I think the policy thing is ludicrous. I think there's a nostalgia [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=605.2800000000001s)]
*  for the old days and a delusion of the snapback theory, which you heard a lot during Trump 1.0. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=609.44s)]
*  Well, Trump will leave and we'll snap back to normal Republican stuff. Normal Republican stuff [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=615.2800000000001s)]
*  has an appeal to normal Republican voters for almost two decades now. I mean, it's, it's why, [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=620.8000000000001s)]
*  you know, it's why Trump won the primary in 16. And so the idea that they're waiting to get back [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=627.0400000000001s)]
*  to doing, I don't even know what they think the normal stuff would look like. I mean, [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=634.32s)]
*  Portman was normal and he's gone and he went along with all of Trump's stuff and Corker was [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=638.4000000000001s)]
*  pretty normal and he's gone. And, you know, I, I think it's this belonging, this affinity to stay [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=643.84s)]
*  in the club you've always been in, but I think it's delusional to think that it's ever going to be [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=651.6800000000001s)]
*  what it was when you joined it. **Jayce Schaefer** [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=656.88s)]
*  And I don't know about you, this whole thing has been pretty easy to me. Like I get thanked [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=658.4s)]
*  sometimes by liberals, like on the street, like you're so courageous. I'm like, not really, [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=663.52s)]
*  actually. Like he was a total clown. It wasn't even a close call. It was ridiculous. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=668.56s)]
*  Had it been a closer call, maybe I would have been a coward too. You know, maybe I would have [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=673.52s)]
*  gone along with somebody that was unqualified too, but in a, in a more close run hypothetical, right? [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=677.28s)]
*  So I don't think it's, you know, so it's hard for me as far as the book, it's hard for me to kind of [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=684.3199999999999s)]
*  process like, why is it so hard for all these people? Like, why is it so hard for Bob Corker [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=689.04s)]
*  and Lisa Murkowski? Like, what, what do you think the reason is? **Sara Kelly** [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=694.4799999999999s)]
*  Well, I used to, I used to really anguish about it. But think about this, there has never [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=697.36s)]
*  been a book reported out by a reporter from Capitol Hill or a political reporter that shows [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=704.88s)]
*  anyone from JD Vance to Mitch McConnell, to Boehner saying anything privately that's different from [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=711.44s)]
*  what you and I say. Mitch McConnell quote, Trump is a despicable human being, the most despicable [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=718.5600000000001s)]
*  human being, Kevin McCarthy in that book by **Matt Stauffer** [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=723.52s)]
*  Thompson Martin. **Sara Kelly** [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=728.16s)]
*  Yeah. Impeachment was too slow. He wanted them to look at the 25th amendment, JD Vance, America's [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=728.96s)]
*  Hitler, cultural heroine. So where I used to anguish, you know, how do they not see what I see? [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=735.52s)]
*  The people who loathe him the most are the people who have completely sacrificed their integrity, [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=742.4s)]
*  their honesty and their faith to what was real conservatism. And so that gives me some relief [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=748.24s)]
*  that at least I'm telling the truth about it. **Matt Stauffer** [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=755.44s)]
*  Yeah. You never listen to Lisa Murkowski and think, you know, she's making a point. Maybe I [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=757.84s)]
*  should be hedging a little more. **Sara Kelly** [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=762.0s)]
*  No, no. And I also think it's so lame. It's so lame. If you're a partisan, you are on a side [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=763.52s)]
*  because you believe in things. For me, what I believed in, I, and people will sneer at this, [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=771.52s)]
*  but I believed in the democracy stuff. I think Liz Cheney did too. And the idea that if that was [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=777.2s)]
*  your sort of path into being a Republican, that you don't see Trump as a threat to democracy as [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=784.0s)]
*  you're off ramp from it is ridiculous. **Matt Stauffer** [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=790.1600000000001s)]
*  I want to do the way you believe in it because I get this question a lot too. What, [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=793.44s)]
*  I didn't know you until after all this, like we both worked for Jeb, but like in different eras, [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=796.6400000000001s)]
*  right? **Sara Kelly** [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=801.0400000000001s)]
*  Because I'm old. **Matt Stauffer** [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=801.9200000000001s)]
*  Yeah. You're older than me. You are old. You look great though. We both worked for McCain, [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=803.0400000000001s)]
*  but in different eras of McCain. Like we never overlapped. And so I didn't kind of know you until [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=806.72s)]
*  all that Trump stuff happening. So what do you get? Like thinking back to baby Nicole, college [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=810.48s)]
*  Nicole, like why were you a college Republican? What drew you to it? **Sara Kelly** [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=815.6s)]
*  So I wasn't. So I wasn't. I was a college journalism nerd. I squatted in all of the [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=820.0s)]
*  journalism classes at UC Berkeley and I wasn't politicized by Berkeley. A lot of people either [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=827.36s)]
*  really embrace Berkeley's liberal history or don't see themselves in it. And I think there [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=834.4s)]
*  was a college Republican party there. I wasn't, I wasn't part of any of that. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=842.88s)]
*  **Matt Stauffer** Oh yeah. My friend was a Berkeley college Republican. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=846.9599999999999s)]
*  It takes a special type of contrarian to want to be a Berkeley college Republican. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=849.12s)]
*  **Sara Kelly** But it happens, but I spent my college years interning [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=852.3199999999999s)]
*  at local television stations. I worked this like overnight shift, like 2 AM to, [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=855.76s)]
*  you know, through the morning shows until they took the national morning shows. And I covered [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=861.76s)]
*  the OJ Simpson trial. I covered the earthquakes and the fires in the Bay area. I used to hop in [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=868.0s)]
*  the van and run around with local great. **Matt Stauffer** You are old. You covered the OJ Simpson [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=872.64s)]
*  trial. **Sara Kelly** I cut sound. I cut sound when I was in college from the night before's [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=877.52s)]
*  testimony. I think I was 18 or 19. And it would make up these like six minute [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=884.48s)]
*  saw chunks on the local news before the national news. So I was like a TV news nerd. And when I [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=892.72s)]
*  graduated from Berkeley, I went to Medill. So I went to Northwestern and I was local reporter. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=902.48s)]
*  And then after sort of shooting, actually there were a couple of stories that I just, [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=908.0799999999999s)]
*  I couldn't handle being the first person on accidents. I just, I couldn't take it. And so [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=912.64s)]
*  sometimes I would, I had the scanner and sometimes I would get there before the ambulance and I [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=917.3599999999999s)]
*  couldn't, I couldn't take that. And so I thought local news isn't for me. And so I moved to [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=923.3599999999999s)]
*  Sacramento and interviewed with the Republican and a Democrat the same week. And the Republican [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=928.8s)]
*  hired me. And that was how I became a Republican president. **Matt Stauffer** This is such a 90s story. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=936.0799999999999s)]
*  This is like people, young people really do not get this, but like that was so, Michael Lewis wrote, [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=940.64s)]
*  when I was writing the book, I had my, I didn't read political books because I don't know about [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=946.8s)]
*  you, because I like live it. And so I hate reading them. And so I never did. And so, you know, my [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=950.88s)]
*  editor was like, you've got to read a bunch of political books and tell me which ones you like [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=955.6s)]
*  so we can create a model. And there was this old Michael Lewis book from the 1996 campaign. It's [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=958.7199999999999s)]
*  like Lost to History. It's called Losers. And it was about all the losing candidates. And it was, [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=963.1999999999999s)]
*  it was so good. And he was so contemptuous of the fact that like the strategists on both sides of [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=968.08s)]
*  both parties, like could have been totally indistinguishable. And like they could have [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=974.08s)]
*  switched sides very easily. And they got into politics because they liked politics as a game. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=977.5200000000001s)]
*  And I, you know, I was like the number of people I know who worked for, I mean, you, I think, [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=982.88s)]
*  worked for Republicans and then voted against McCain and then voted for Obama in 08. Like [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=988.48s)]
*  there are still prominent Republicans around who privately told me they voted for Obama. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=994.0s)]
*  Yeah, because I think to do it, you are idealistic. You're more Aaron Sorkin than the [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=997.92s)]
*  Federalist Society. Right. And so I watched the West Wing and I had this romanticized view [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=1003.28s)]
*  of people doing the right thing. And I have an email relationship with Aaron Sorkin saying, [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=1010.72s)]
*  he ruined all this for me. You know, I keep waiting for someone to put the crime bill in the [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=1015.12s)]
*  drawer because it doesn't do anything to fight crime. You know, he, he totally romanticized [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=1018.96s)]
*  with the West Wing and the American president, what, what it would be. But I, [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=1024.64s)]
*  yeah, so I started working for Republicans in California. I never worked for Pete Wilson, [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=1029.2s)]
*  but it was sort of at the end of his time. And so George W. Bush was thrust onto the scene as the, [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=1032.72s)]
*  as the opposite in terms of immigration instincts to Pete Wilson. And so it's pretty funny that [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=1041.04s)]
*  the party has circled back around to Pete Wilson who couldn't make his way out of New Hampshire [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=1048.88s)]
*  after elevating, you know, George W. Bush and John McCain, who essentially believed in something [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=1053.3600000000001s)]
*  much closer to amnesty. Yeah. The immigration thing is to me, I don't know, sometimes left people [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=1059.2800000000002s)]
*  are like, you, you were hoodwinked or whatever. And I was asking McKinnon about this on the show [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=1065.5200000000002s)]
*  last week. And I was like, I don't think so. I like, there was, there was a fight was in the party, [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=1068.96s)]
*  right? Like there was a genuine kind of patriotic strain. Like it was almost jingoistic kind of like [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=1073.36s)]
*  pro immigrant because we're so great. Like, like less like kind of human humanitarian, but also [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=1080.3999999999999s)]
*  because the U S is so great. We want people who are fleeing communism, fleeing other countries to [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=1086.1599999999999s)]
*  come here. And that to me was like kind of my origin story. I like really bought all that and [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=1090.4799999999998s)]
*  was moved by it. That's part of the reason why this switch has been so like easy for me. Like, [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=1096.1599999999999s)]
*  what do you think going back to all that? And you were there with Bush and both bushes, I guess, [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=1101.52s)]
*  like how earnest was that? Like the more compassionate pro immigrant pitch in those days. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=1105.76s)]
*  So it played out within the second Bush administration. So Bush goes to address the [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=1112.0s)]
*  nation on comprehensive immigration reform in Oh five. And that speech had more drafts than that [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=1118.08s)]
*  year's state of the union address, which was the first year after his reelection. And I think that's [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=1124.72s)]
*  a reflection of the tug of war even within the administration. And I spent enough time with Bush [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=1130.64s)]
*  at that point. I was his communications director in the second term and he had a very, [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=1138.64s)]
*  I think he saw it the way you just articulate the Reagan is the last president to really do sweeping [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=1143.3600000000001s)]
*  amnesty. And I think Bush saw immigrants as vitally important, totally persuadable. If he made, I think [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=1147.8400000000001s)]
*  he believed he could make a case about conservatism to any immigrant family and try to win their [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=1158.48s)]
*  hearts and minds as a Texas governor. He, they weren't other eyes to him. I mean, he saw them as [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=1163.2s)]
*  part of the community, part of the faith community, part of the economy. Bush was never a fan of people [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=1169.04s)]
*  having to return and then get in line because he knew that nobody would do that. Bush also had an [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=1179.2s)]
*  extraordinary amount of comprehension and compassion for anyone who put their children [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=1184.56s)]
*  on a bus or on a train or sent them to America for a better life. I mean, he thought that was in some [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=1189.9199999999998s)]
*  ways, just this incredible statement about what America was to a mom or dad who wanted to send [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=1195.12s)]
*  their kids to America for the American dream. So Bush saw immigration the way Reagan did, the way [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=1202.48s)]
*  I think you and I see it, and was defeated and undermined by his own party [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=1211.1999999999998s)]
*  in trying to do comprehensive immigration reform. And there was a way to do it with [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=1217.6799999999998s)]
*  Democrats, but Cheney having served in the ranks with the House Republicans was not a fan of that. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=1221.6799999999998s)]
*  But Tony Snow was the White House press secretary. And so I had the job of booking Bush, Cheney, [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=1228.4799999999998s)]
*  and Tony Snow on conservative talk radio, which was the driver for the podcast era. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=1236.32s)]
*  And I remember booking Tony, who I adored, and Bush and Cheney with Rush on with Hannity on with, [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=1241.9199999999998s)]
*  I think Mark Levin was one of the people. And really trying to make the case. And I don't [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=1251.2s)]
*  think any of them really supported it, but they let us make the argument. And I think it was [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=1263.12s)]
*  Bush's first window into how nativist and isolationist the party was becoming even during [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=1270.1599999999999s)]
*  his second term. So what about you? Do you look back on that and feel like I should have seen it [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=1277.6s)]
*  a little earlier? Oh, I mean, I did see it. I did see it. And I think the only Republican I worked [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=1282.56s)]
*  for after that was McCain who saw it. It was the issue, I think, on which Bush and McCain agreed [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=1288.3999999999999s)]
*  the most vociferously and agreed from this really deep how they saw America place. So I've never [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=1292.4s)]
*  worked for anyone who was conflicted about this. I think McCain and Kennedy saw comprehensive [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=1299.92s)]
*  immigration reform the way Bush did. I mean, oddly, Rubio did for a minute also, but then became. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=1307.1200000000001s)]
*  Do you look back on it or you conflict about anything else? I mean, I was watching. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=1312.96s)]
*  I'm conflicted about all of it. I mean, I'm conflicted about being part of Pail Land. I'm [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=1317.44s)]
*  conflicted about it. I was watching the Mauritanian this weekend and I was like, oh, God, I mean, [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=1320.88s)]
*  I don't know. That was a movie about one of the guys that was in Guantanamo that may be wrong. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=1328.48s)]
*  I don't know. You'll never know. But yeah, look, and I think that I think just keeping your mouth [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=1332.24s)]
*  shut and letting people who paid the ultimate price for the country because of the foreign policy [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=1337.6000000000001s)]
*  decisions that Bush made is the path I've chosen. I mean, I've been on the air, obviously, [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=1344.24s)]
*  the last week and every bad comparison is a comparison back to the decisions made by my [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=1350.56s)]
*  old boss in that region. So yeah, I'm conflicted about all of it. I mean, if you don't get older [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=1357.92s)]
*  and wiser and platform your own sort of internal regrets and things you do differently with twice [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=1363.92s)]
*  as many years under your belt, there's something wrong with you. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=1372.72s)]
*  Pete Slauson Amen to that. I always think the stupidest criticism people have of me is like, [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=1375.2s)]
*  you've broken your principle. You've changed. I'm like, you haven't changed. We elected the stupidest [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=1380.32s)]
*  person in the country president twice. It hasn't changed your view on anything. It doesn't seem to [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=1385.6000000000001s)]
*  make you a very deep thinker in that case. Nicole Zichal Right. And like the idea that [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=1390.8s)]
*  it is true that neither party is perfect. It is also true that only one party is trying to [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=1396.64s)]
*  erode our democratic principles and norms. So anyone that makes an argument to me about [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=1402.4s)]
*  principles, like what are you talking about? I mean, I never agreed with everything the [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=1407.2s)]
*  Republican Party stood for either. Pete Slauson [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=1411.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=1413.68s)]
*  Pete Slauson Lying in seafood can sometimes be a challenge. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=1414.72s)]
*  You want to make sure you got something fresh. You're going to the store. You don't know when [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=1420.16s)]
*  you're going to cook it. You know, maybe like me, you get distracted. Besides, you're going to do [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=1423.2s)]
*  takeout that night. We've got a sustainable solution for you. It's the wild Alaskan company. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=1427.68s)]
*  It's the best way to get wild caught perfectly portioned to nutrient dense seafood delivered [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=1432.3200000000002s)]
*  directly to your door. Trust me, you haven't tasted fish this good. We got a bunch of different [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=1436.88s)]
*  varietals. There was both sockeye and coho salmon, a Pacific halibut, Pacific rockfish. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=1442.0s)]
*  And I mean, the box was so big, I had to give some of it to my neighbors because, you know, [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=1448.72s)]
*  they're only the three of us. This isn't the JVL households. We don't have 100 people here. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=1452.72s)]
*  Let me tell you, it was amazing. I did a sous vide on one of them. I think it was a Pacific [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=1457.6000000000001s)]
*  halibut. I did a little baking action on another one. Kid liked it. Husband liked it. Podcast host [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=1463.28s)]
*  liked it. Family approved. The fish is 100% wild caught, never farmed. It's nutrient rich and full [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=1470.0s)]
*  of flavor. It's frozen fresh off the boat to lock in taste, texture and nutrients like Omega-3s. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=1475.92s)]
*  So get on board. Not all fish are the same. Get seafood you can trust. Go to wildalaskan.com [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=1481.92s)]

*  Do you have any old Jeb stories for me from the early days? [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=1500.96s)]
*  So I was his first press secretary when he wins governor the first time. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=1504.88s)]
*  And I went and interviewed for the job. I worked in California politics and I knew a bunch of folks [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=1510.24s)]
*  who'd worked for his dad. So that was my connection to his world after he wins. And I went out there [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=1515.68s)]
*  and interviewed and it was right after Lawton Childs died. And so, and you know, Jeb, he's just [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=1523.36s)]
*  always kind of walking around unstaffed and like taller than everybody. And so I went and interviewed [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=1528.8s)]
*  questions from people, strangers, generalists, whatever. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=1533.76s)]
*  Yeah. And I interviewed with his chief of staff, Sally Bradshaw and his communications director, [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=1536.72s)]
*  Corey Tilley. And they were amazing. And I have no idea to this day what they saw in me. But then [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=1543.44s)]
*  Jeb, I guess heard that I spoke Spanish and so came in and started talking to me in Spanish. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=1550.08s)]
*  And he felt like he really owed to the Cuban community in South Florida his victory. And so [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=1553.52s)]
*  like that I spoke Spanish and I got that job. I arrived in Tallahassee with like a comforter [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=1560.4s)]
*  in my suitcase and had to find a place to live. It was very intrepid when I looked back. But [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=1566.5600000000002s)]
*  because of the sunshine laws, the press secretary always has to travel with Jeb. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=1572.16s)]
*  So I went everywhere with him and he played a lot of golf and he played one day with Tiger Woods. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=1576.16s)]
*  And so I went with Jeb and Tiger Woods had gone to Stanford and I'd gone to Berkeley. And so we [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=1582.64s)]
*  like kind of like six degrees. And the Nike commercial, he wasn't flirting. Tiger Woods [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=1588.96s)]
*  never flirted with me. But on his backswing, that Nike app is out that said, I am Tiger Woods. So [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=1594.72s)]
*  he was, you know, it's not the backswing. And I said, I am Tiger Woods. And Jeb looked at me like [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=1599.52s)]
*  he wanted to fucking kill me. And Tiger Woods started laughing. And I was like, see, that was [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=1604.24s)]
*  funny. You're old. So that was my golfing with Jeb story. But you can see. He's easy to get along [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=1609.36s)]
*  with on the road. He's like zero maintenance. The plane was so scary and old. I was always afraid [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=1614.4s)]
*  I was going to plunge to my death. And he just sort of like did his emails and he called his laptop [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=1621.3600000000001s)]
*  his wooby and was always emailing back a constituent about something. And he was really easy, really low [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=1626.16s)]
*  maintenance. I love Jeb. He was so easy to hang out. It was so funny and private. I never like really [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=1631.2800000000002s)]
*  couldn't translate it on the debate stage. And private like that is just some people. I hear [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=1635.76s)]
*  Hillary's like that. I've never gone to hang out with Hillary. There are others. The thing with [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=1640.0s)]
*  Jeb that's funny that I think about in your context is he really, I think, was kind of surprised [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=1643.28s)]
*  by the direction of where everything was going. And so I got to kind of live it with him firsthand, [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=1650.24s)]
*  like first running and then seeing how crazy the magas had gotten. And like he's getting out of it [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=1655.36s)]
*  because he'd been out of kind of day-to-day politics for a while. And people are saying crazy shit to [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=1660.48s)]
*  him all the time. And he's like, look at me. And it's like, what are they even talking about? [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=1664.8s)]
*  And so he saw that change on the one hand. And then he kind of saw your radicalization on the [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=1668.24s)]
*  other hand, because you did the post-interview with him. And I remember the moment where you [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=1672.48s)]
*  guys were talking about McCain and Palin or something. And you're like, yeah, I didn't even [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=1676.96s)]
*  vote for John McCain. And he was like, what? You didn't even vote for John McCain? And I just, [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=1680.08s)]
*  I like the kind of extinction of the Jeb Republican. I got to live with him. And it's sad. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=1686.64s)]
*  Also, it was kind of amusing at the same time. Yeah. So I spent a lot of time with their parents [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=1693.68s)]
*  in 16. I went up to Kenny Bunkport. Yeah, I got there too. It was really nice. I think two or three [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=1699.68s)]
*  times during the 16 campaign. And in some ways, that was like a better lens for me because they [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=1704.5600000000002s)]
*  become so close to the Clintons that I don't think they were as allergic to the idea of Democrats [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=1711.92s)]
*  in 15, 16. And they might disagree with this. I've actually never talked to either of them about it. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=1717.6000000000001s)]
*  But I think that 41 especially because of his, I mean, you've been there. He valued diplomacy [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=1722.8s)]
*  as a principle. And I think he valued his role as America's diplomat and president as much as [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=1732.3999999999999s)]
*  anything that he was ever a part of. And so I think they were able to get to Hillary Clinton in 16 [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=1738.48s)]
*  a lot easier than or at least George HW Bush easier than his than his than Jeb or [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=1744.72s)]
*  George W. And so I don't think he was as jolted by what had happened. And Barbara Bush was like, [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=1752.6399999999999s)]
*  in some ways, the most astute political observer in the whole family. Like I remember talking to [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=1762.8s)]
*  her after oh eight and she understood not just not just how challenging Palin was as a candidate, [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=1767.36s)]
*  but what it meant that the party responded the way they did to Palin. So yeah, I think as a family [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=1773.76s)]
*  they felt it all. And they felt a lot of at least 41, the 41s felt a lot of it. And I really was [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=1784.48s)]
*  never able to draw Jeb out on how he felt about any of it. But I think the 41s felt a lot of it. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=1793.68s)]
*  They were more feelings oriented. Jeb was more like his dad really. And you get more [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=1798.72s)]
*  feelings oriented as you get older. Barbara W is more like Barbara. I got to spend just a little [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=1802.8s)]
*  bit of time with them both. And couldn't they like the level of clear eyed they were about all this. [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=1806.8s)]
*  I mean, and and I didn't I would only get to your half the convo. But Jeb would call his dad a lot [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=1812.08s)]
*  like during the campaign, like from the car. And I didn't have to actually hear what was on the other [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=1816.8s)]
*  side of the phone to get a sense from what 41 was saying about Trump and, and what the movement of [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=1822.72s)]
*  the party and so on. And their political assessment of our viability was also right on at least at [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=1827.76s)]
*  least Barbara's was. They I mean, look, their political assessment of our weakness in 05. I mean, [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=1834.16s)]
*  when I was George W. Bush's communications director, they consumed a lot more of the punditry [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=1840.16s)]
*  and the press coverage than he did. And so we heard from them a lot. And they they were brilliant [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=1846.8799999999999s)]
*  political minds. I miss them. All right, one more oldest one more Republican thing, then we'll stop [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=1854.88s)]
*  with old Republican shit and do a little bit more business. People get the the Mondale listeners of [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=1860.5600000000002s)]
*  the podcast are getting bored with this. I told you there's only like 17 people. Luckily, they're [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=1867.8400000000001s)]
*  bought more cod ass consumers for the most part. Have you seen the story of Matt Gates, his mom [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=1875.6000000000001s)]
*  yelling at him? I was texting with your friend Sally Bradshaw. He mentioned earlier Jeb's old [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=1880.0800000000002s)]
*  chief of staff about this this morning. So I do need to mention this. I was on as I was mentioning [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=1884.08s)]
*  last night, I was scrolling social media in bed, which I shouldn't be doing. This is what I do [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=1888.96s)]
*  though. Or after midnight, if I can't sleep, I was on TikTok, shouldn't be on TikTok. I don't even [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=1892.48s)]
*  have TikTok. That's how old I am. It's I mean, it's the Chinese and you shouldn't have it children. [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=1896.96s)]
*  But also the Chinese have done a really great job. My algorithm just feeds me only things I care about. [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=1903.4399999999998s)]
*  They're very good. They've figured it out. And among the things I care about was there's this [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=1910.3200000000002s)]
*  young woman who was on an airplane sitting behind Matt Gates. And she is videotaping him feverishly [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=1915.1200000000001s)]
*  texting on his phone. And Matt Gates has admitted this is him already this morning. And he Matt [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=1923.0400000000002s)]
*  Gates and his and he has old man fought on his phone. I don't know. He might need some bifocals. [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=1927.8400000000001s)]
*  I recommend Williamson. Yeah, see, it's huge font. And so you can see it all clearly. And Mrs. Gates [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=1931.92s)]
*  is is chastising him for going against Trump on the war. Wow. And they're going back and forth. [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=1939.84s)]
*  And he's like, you're gonna lose your job in the media. You're already out of Congress. [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=1946.96s)]
*  That's amazing. Yeah. She's like, don't be criticizing the president or his actions. He's [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=1951.28s)]
*  trying to keep us safe. Maga will turn on you. And the whole thing is a is a funny and also kind of [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=1955.52s)]
*  sad encapsulation of like what we've all seen. Right. I sent I've treated it Matt this morning. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=1963.12s)]
*  I was like, Oh, a family member is mad that you're not fully full. You know, a Fox watching family [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=1969.28s)]
*  member is upset that you're not fully on board with Donald Trump. Like, welcome to the resistance. [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=1974.8799999999999s)]
*  We've all been there. I don't know. We've all been like, how do you process all that? Well, [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=1978.72s)]
*  I mean, I think the I think the intervention in the Middle East is a real thing. I mean, [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=1983.2s)]
*  I think that Matt Gaetz speaks for probably more Magda voters than his mother does. [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=1988.08s)]
*  I didn't think I'd ever find myself defending my gates. But I mean, I think that a lot of what [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=1994.1599999999999s)]
*  turned off the base of the Republican Party at the end of the Bush era, and you and I both [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=2000.1599999999999s)]
*  dealt with this in a political context, was support for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=2004.72s)]
*  And so I think part of, you know, part of it is just voters found Trump really entertaining. [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=2010.1599999999999s)]
*  They liked everything that that offended a lot of the rest of us. But they also agreed with him on [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=2015.44s)]
*  not getting involved in wars in the Middle East. And so this is the ultimate betrayal. This and [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=2023.44s)]
*  making everything more expensive through his asinine trade war, are the ultimate political [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=2029.04s)]
*  betrayals. It's kind of like the what's the phrase like, the immovable force, the unstoppable object, [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=2034.56s)]
*  whatever it is, the movable object unstoppable force, one of them. And with the voters, right, [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=2040.8s)]
*  which is being demonstrated in this Gates family text, right, where it's like, on the one hand, [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=2046.32s)]
*  it's just slavish cultishness, devotion to Trump. Yeah. On the other hand, it's this kind of the pure [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=2051.7599999999998s)]
*  maga id of, oh, the old establishment Republicans did us wrong. Yeah, kind of who wins that battle [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=2056.96s)]
*  that I mean, that's a that's real, I think. Totally. And I think the the the sort of veil on top of all [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=2064.32s)]
*  of it is the fear factor. And it ties the Murkowski stuff to the Gates, you know, mother stuff to, [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=2073.2000000000003s)]
*  you know, because they're so thuggish to their own. There is a real fear to either opposing Trump, [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=2079.28s)]
*  even if it's to actually stick up for what Trump was originally about, or to, you know, criticize [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=2085.36s)]
*  anything he does, even when it looks pretty boneheaded. I'm sure you get this. What do you say [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=2092.0s)]
*  to people who come to you and like, I'm guessing you get this much side deal, which is like, [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=2096.72s)]
*  I listen to you because I've got maga family members and like, you're, you're kind of a stand [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=2101.28s)]
*  in for them as like a sane person, who like I can disagree with on whatever certain policies sometimes. [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=2106.0s)]
*  Like, what do you say to the like that, like how you deal with the cult, like cult side of it? Well, [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=2113.6s)]
*  I think you have to look, I think you have to love your family, no matter who they support and [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=2119.84s)]
*  vote for. But I think you have to have like a menagerie back there. We have babies, Mike Schmidt [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=2124.88s)]
*  walked through and as many animals there's animals. Three Vigilas today. So I have two Vigilas. [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=2130.48s)]
*  Oh, Vigilas. Vigilas are nuts. They're baby gates, so they might make an appearance. And then I have [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=2135.44s)]
*  a third, I have my ex-husband's Vigilas who were babysitting for the day. So I've got three little [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=2140.08s)]
*  brown dogs. They're so cute. They're Hungarian, right? They're Hungarian pointers. Yeah, they're [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=2145.04s)]
*  so cute. Little fascist dogs. We joke with them about Orban. They got out. But they're, they're [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=2148.8s)]
*  three, four and 10 and they're just, they're huge personalities. And so someone is, my son and Mike [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=2155.92s)]
*  are probably leaving. And so they're probably wailing. Got it. Yeah. There's a, I'm sorry, [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=2161.36s)]
*  there's a lot of background noise. I know it's great. Anyway, people want, people want Nicole [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=2166.56s)]
*  Wallace unfiltered. They want to see what's happening in your life. You know, you have this [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=2170.72s)]
*  love. I promise you, there's a lot of love for you out there. Oh, that's so nice. It's so nice. [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=2175.12s)]
*  I hear about it all the time. If I texted you every time somebody's like, will you tell Nicole [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=2180.24s)]
*  Wallace? I hope she's doing okay. So nice. You'd stop responding to my texts. So nice. So anyway, [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=2184.08s)]
*  you said you got to love your family members. Oh, so you got to love your family members. But I think [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=2190.08s)]
*  you have to protect yourself from the gaslighting. And I think like this is the work for therapists, [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=2193.4399999999996s)]
*  not cable news hosts, but I think that they have now been marinating. Look, like I think it really [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=2198.0s)]
*  started with the birth certificate, right? Like if you're really MAGA, you've been along for a lot [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=2204.88s)]
*  of the journey. And so it started with like the delusions about, you know, Obama and Eric Holder. [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=2210.64s)]
*  And I remember doing Chris Wallace's show when I wrote a novel and he, he, he was such a sweet guy. [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=2217.52s)]
*  And he said to me, I was on because I'd written a novel and he let me join the Sunday, [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=2224.56s)]
*  his Sunday show panel and I was going to get to plug my novel, but I had to sort of do news of [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=2229.2799999999997s)]
*  the day with him. I said, sure, sure. And he said, you've been out for a while. We're going to talk [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=2233.8399999999997s)]
*  about the fast and the furious. And I was like, what is that? This was when it was sort of a right [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=2239.52s)]
*  wing thing and hadn't really burst, you know, it becomes more of a mainstream political story. And [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=2244.56s)]
*  it becomes stuff that the Obama White House has to deal with. And it, but this is early, early. And [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=2251.04s)]
*  you think about all of the seasons, right? That MAGA voters have watched, started with the birth [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=2258.3199999999997s)]
*  certificate. It went through fast and the furious. It went through all of the lies they've been fed. [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=2264.48s)]
*  And so how I deal with it is that I don't deal with it. I don't talk politics. [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=2273.4399999999996s)]
*  There's so much that Trump has politicized now that it's like, it leaves you kind of talking [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=2279.2s)]
*  about the weather and family and stuff that has nothing to do with the world, but that's- [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=2285.12s)]
*  Well, it's good NBA finals. [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=2289.9199999999996s)]
*  Sports, yeah. I mean, we deal with, but you know, my team is pretty political. So they don't always [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=2291.52s)]
*  love my, but no, I mean, really it is. It's a lot of sports. [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=2299.52s)]
*  Cause you're two of the lawyers, right? [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=2302.16s)]
*  Yeah. But it's a lot of, it's a lot of sports. And, and I do have a piece where, you know, [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=2304.1600000000003s)]
*  with, with my family, like it's just politics and I love them to death and we just don't talk about [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=2312.1600000000003s)]
*  it. Yeah. All right. On therapist questions. So as you mentioned this, this is maybe a job [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=2316.5600000000004s)]
*  for your therapist. I remember we talked, we had a talk on set, I don't know, maybe around Christmas [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=2322.7200000000003s)]
*  time. So it was pretty soon after. And I was like, I don't know how I'm going to do this. Like out [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=2329.28s)]
*  of, I basically said to you, how are you going to do it? I just, I don't know how I'm going to [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=2337.6800000000003s)]
*  wake up and care about these f*****g people every day. I hate them. They're horrible. I kind of want [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=2341.6000000000004s)]
*  them to fail and I, but I don't want the country to fail. And how, how, how can I possibly like [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=2346.88s)]
*  bring myself to care about this? Like if this was not my job, I would just totally turn off everything [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=2351.84s)]
*  and start reading sat gay novels and just pretend like it doesn't exist. I swear to God, that's what [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=2355.76s)]
*  I would do. This was, I had a different, if my husband was independently wealthy or something. [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=2360.0s)]
*  And I don't know, it's I've come around on it, but I guess I want prejudices with your answer. How do [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=2364.7200000000003s)]
*  you, how did you process that? Well, I remember that conversation. And I think the hardest thing [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=2369.76s)]
*  for me about his victory was that everything he was going to do that threatened the democracy [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=2376.4s)]
*  was stuff he said he was going to do. So it's like, it's not like, oh, they didn't believe me with my [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=2387.52s)]
*  warnings. They didn't believe him. And I thought that was such a mindf**k. Like he ran on retribution. [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=2392.7200000000003s)]
*  He ran on charging Liz Cheney and Mark Milley with treason. He ran on turning the FBI and the DOJ [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=2400.16s)]
*  inside out. He ran on putting people like Tulsi Gabbard in charge of national security. And so [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=2408.3999999999996s)]
*  he ran on mass deportations. To me, he ran on the dehumanization of people in this country illegally [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=2414.96s)]
*  and won. And so that felt like a blow to me. What I have found is that, and Alicia Menendez said this [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=2422.6400000000003s)]
*  to me, like, just bear witness. Like what our viewers need us to do is bear witness. And I have [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=2433.2000000000003s)]
*  found that that was the best advice I got. And then a lot of people reached out to me and said, [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=2438.0s)]
*  what do we do? And I said, just take care of your people. Like check on your people. Check on them [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=2443.36s)]
*  every day in the beginning. People that you think are going to be really upset. And then [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=2449.28s)]
*  just try to see them more. And I feel like those two things are enough. And it's really satisfying. [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=2453.6000000000004s)]
*  And I actually find doing my job, just holding up a mirror, is easier than it was in Trump 1.0 [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=2461.6800000000003s)]
*  because he's doing it all in the open. There would be stories that would break in the Times and the [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=2466.88s)]
*  Post. And we'd run through our standards department. And because it was the Times and the Post, [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=2472.56s)]
*  we were always allowed to use them. But you were relying on what felt like really, and my [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=2477.68s)]
*  husband did a lot of that reporting. I mean, this is almost, and I'm not saying there isn't [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=2485.04s)]
*  important reporting, but this is almost all out in the open. So we're holding up a mirror and saying, [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=2489.9199999999996s)]
*  this is what we're getting. And I find that as a cable host, the easiest kind of job. We're just [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=2495.52s)]
*  webcam covered. We're just showing what's happening. And then I think as my colleague, [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=2504.24s)]
*  Rachel Maddow is doing, showing the reaction is really satisfying. Showing that the American [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=2507.6s)]
*  people in year one, before your term are out in the streets in historic numbers is incredible. [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=2512.3199999999997s)]
*  But it's probably the second piece. And that's where the conversation, I think emanated from [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=2517.3599999999997s)]
*  our conversation. I find myself, have you been like whitewater rafting, where they tie all the [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=2522.56s)]
*  rafts together? I feel like we're on the rapids, but our rafts are all tied together. The food [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=2528.0s)]
*  might fly out and one raft might tip over, but we're all tied together. So someone will come and [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=2533.2s)]
*  get us. And so I do kind of feel like I'm on one of those chartered whitewater rafting trips, [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=2537.68s)]
*  where we're all tied together and it's bumpy. And we knew it was going to be bumpy, [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=2543.7599999999998s)]
*  but we're all kind of in it together. Does that make sense? [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=2550.08s)]
*  **Matt Stauffer** It does. And it doesn't feel like you're, I mean, [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=2553.12s)]
*  it's interesting you say all that because I watch you and it's like, [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=2555.6s)]
*  doesn't seem like you're mailing it in up there. You're still feeling all the feelings, [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=2559.12s)]
*  you're still doing it and showing everybody and passionate about it. And that is kind of a [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=2563.68s)]
*  challenge in itself. There are people in media that are mailing it in. [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=2567.7599999999998s)]
*  **Samantha Nguyen** Well, I love, so I also think like I had this real shift in my relationship [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=2570.88s)]
*  with my viewers during COVID, where I stayed home for a year and a half. My son stayed out [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=2575.7599999999998s)]
*  of school for a year and a half. So it was like me in the basement, into the camera, to the viewers. [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=2579.84s)]
*  And what they gave back to me was just life-changing. I mean, we celebrated a [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=2584.4s)]
*  life well-lived every day, someone that died from COVID. And I don't know, I just, I meet viewers of [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=2589.28s)]
*  the show in the street all the time and it makes my day when people say they watch. Like maybe it's [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=2596.32s)]
*  coming to these jobs as a second career, that you don't feel like you're entitled to an audience, [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=2601.76s)]
*  you don't feel like you're entitled to have these jobs. And so you feel more grateful for them. But [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=2607.04s)]
*  I don't know if more is the right word. I feel completely inspired by having two hours to fill [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=2613.2799999999997s)]
*  every day. **Matt Stauffer** Well, you're booing me because it's been easier than I thought. I needed [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=2619.2s)]
*  your little pep talk because I was worried about it. All right, let's get to it. **Samantha Nguyen** [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=2623.12s)]
*  I mean, don't you feel the same way? **Matt Stauffer** I know. I actually, I've ended up [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=2627.2799999999997s)]
*  being the same way. I was in a pretty dark place when we had that conversation between the election [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=2630.56s)]
*  and maybe two days after the inauguration. The inauguration was pretty hard for me. I think I [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=2634.72s)]
*  was on your show on inauguration day and I'm like lashing out. I'm like, why are we acting like this [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=2640.24s)]
*  is normal? Like what in the fuck is happening right now? **Samantha Nguyen** You and Michael Steele, [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=2643.9199999999996s)]
*  we're like, why are we covering this? **Matt Stauffer** Yeah, like what is this? Like we're [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=2647.7599999999998s)]
*  calling him sir. We're like grading it. Like we're figure skating judging it. And like the billionaires [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=2651.04s)]
*  are like, what is happening? So anyway, I was a little, but I'm with you. I don't know. I've been [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=2655.68s)]
*  very, it's awesome to hear from people. I love the audience. It is fulfilling. It's been more [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=2660.8799999999997s)]
*  fulfilling than I thought to just go out there and just say whatever you think. **Samantha Nguyen** [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=2665.52s)]
*  My audience loves you. I think because, because you haven't sugar coated the journey. **Matt Stauffer** [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=2668.64s)]
*  Yeah. Just feel like what I ended up saying to folks here was I'm just going to care what I care [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=2674.24s)]
*  about. I'm going to care about what I care about and talk to you about that. And so if there's [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=2679.2s)]
*  stupid Trump stuff and I'm not going to pretend to be outraged about it, you know, and we're going to [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=2683.04s)]
*  be on a remote and some days I'm going to be angry and some days I'll be sad. And some days I'll be [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=2687.7599999999998s)]
*  laughing at pointing and laughing and we'll just do all of it. Let's just feel all the feelings. [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=2691.2799999999997s)]
*  **Samantha Nguyen** Yeah. [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=2694.7999999999997s)]
*  **Matt Stauffer** All right. Let's do big picture Trump stuff then I'll let you go. What scares you the most? [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=2695.12s)]
*  **Samantha Nguyen** Oh, everything. I mean, I'm scared. I remember the first day I read about the [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=2699.3599999999997s)]
*  deportations to El Salvador of the, of the alleged Trande Aragua members for whom no evidence was [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=2706.24s)]
*  ever presented that they had anything to do with Trande Aragua. And I remember saying to Mike, like, [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=2716.08s)]
*  I wish I didn't feel so gutted and I wish I could stop thinking about these guys being scared in [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=2723.12s)]
*  El Salvador. And then I was somewhere, I was in, I was in Westchester. It's usually a baseball trip [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=2728.32s)]
*  that has me in. I don't know what I was doing, but I, we stopped to get something to eat and I saw the [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=2736.0s)]
*  paid ads that Homeland Security was doing in front of the deportees who were now prisoners [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=2741.68s)]
*  in, at Zicot. And I was gutted. And I think I'm sometimes scared by how much [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=2750.0s)]
*  anguish I feel over how they're treating human beings. But I think that if you [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=2759.92s)]
*  abandon the anguish, then you carry out horrible things against human beings. And so, I don't know, [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=2767.52s)]
*  maybe that's, maybe that's just too circular and not very satisfying. But I'm scared about how much [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=2773.52s)]
*  it bothers me that he's, that so many people are suffering. And I spent some time with folks close [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=2779.6s)]
*  to former President Obama after the election. And, you know, I said, well, what's our guess on [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=2784.4s)]
*  what happens? And they kind of said, look, it's, it's that zero chance that it's catastrophic. [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=2791.2s)]
*  It's far more likely that we kind of muddle through, but a lot of people are gonna suffer. [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=2795.44s)]
*  And I'm scared of all that suffering, of witnessing it, of doing it justice, of [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=2800.64s)]
*  covering it responsibly. And I refuse to accept that there's a quorum that wants to see people [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=2808.72s)]
*  suffer. I just refuse to accept that. What's your level of alarm that, you know, I use the term [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=2816.4s)]
*  pro-democracy coalition and people are always like, oh, it could be the end of democracy. And [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=2823.7599999999998s)]
*  that's, I always, I get frustrated with that conversation because it's like, you either have [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=2827.84s)]
*  democracy or you don't when it's much more nuanced than that. Like, what's your level of alarm that, [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=2831.28s)]
*  like, the whole system crumbles over the next three years? Well, he's not suddenly, totally [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=2835.44s)]
*  competent, right? So he's not like, he's not like good at any one thing. The military is still great. [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=2842.96s)]
*  And so, you know, it appears that the military carried out, carried out a plan, executed a plan [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=2850.6400000000003s)]
*  as it was written out. But he's lost more in court than I think, probably like the last 10 [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=2856.96s)]
*  presidents added together times two. I mean, I haven't done the math, but, you know, he's running [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=2863.84s)]
*  up against a lot of things that are illegal. I try not to get ahead of the story in terms of where [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=2869.28s)]
*  will we be in three and a half years. I've never covered his, you know, I'm gonna run for another [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=2875.52s)]
*  term because you can't run for another term. And to do that, you're making all these assumptions [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=2882.8s)]
*  that there's no more constitution, there's no more courts. But my alarm in the moment is really [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=2887.36s)]
*  around Republicans green lighting anti-democratic practices. It's around Republicans green lighting, [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=2896.1600000000003s)]
*  the politicization of SDNY. And I know we had to move on because so much has happened, [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=2902.7200000000003s)]
*  but these were a bunch of Federalist Society lawyers of an SDNY that were bringing Eric [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=2907.68s)]
*  Adams case. And the fact that email, email Bova and all these folks at DOJ ran out a bunch of [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=2912.7999999999997s)]
*  conservatives and Mitch McConnell said nothing, his whole reason for like swallowing it with, [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=2918.8799999999997s)]
*  with, you know, swallowing his pride and swallowing his integrity. When it came to Trump was about [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=2924.24s)]
*  remaking the judiciary. So he sits there silently when, when the Trump administration runs out the [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=2929.8399999999997s)]
*  kind of people that he's sort of had an affinity for through his entire career. So it's the silence [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=2936.32s)]
*  of Republicans around the politicization of the rule of law and the indifference to due process [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=2942.0800000000004s)]
*  and the, all the rhetoric around ignoring court rulings that I find the scariest. [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=2950.0s)]
*  Adam Tate Yeah, that's good. That's not here on fire. That's not what your opponents would say [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=2955.44s)]
*  about you. That's right. I think that's an appropriately it's like, it could be very bad. [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=2959.92s)]
*  There are a lot of concerning warning signs and we'll, we'll be here to monitor how it plays out. [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=2964.0s)]
*  That's a healthy way to deal with it. Well, what do you think? [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=2967.92s)]
*  Adam Tate That's what I think. I, my answer to that question is like, I don't know, [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=2970.08s)]
*  is what you tell me, and I mean, you being the audience, what percentage chance you think [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=2974.64s)]
*  that it is that he tries to do another term or that he tries to end democracy. [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=2980.08s)]
*  And I think that anyone he asked that question to their answer is somewhere from like 1% [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=2984.48s)]
*  to maybe the most tedious riddled people say 80%. Right. But like, if your answer is 1%, [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=2988.96s)]
*  that's still very bad. And we're in a very bad place. Like the answer isn't zero where it's been [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=2996.24s)]
*  for our entire parents lives in our lives. And, and that's alarming to me. And, and I think that [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=3001.84s)]
*  you can be alarmed and be vigilant without, without being like hysterical, you know? [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=3008.16s)]
*  Yeah. And look, I mean, I think in defense of the people who are hysterical and alarmed, [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=3013.84s)]
*  nothing has held, right? Like he was impeached twice. [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=3019.76s)]
*  Adam Tate The most hysterical people have definitely been more right than the most [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=3022.64s)]
*  sanguine people. [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=3025.76s)]
*  Amy Quinton Correct. And this is why when people trash the left, [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=3026.7200000000003s)]
*  like the left's been right about most things when it comes to Trump. [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=3031.28s)]
*  Adam Tate His biggest political weakness, you think, is his incompetence, [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=3035.68s)]
*  like the biggest vulnerability. [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=3038.8s)]
*  Trump's biggest political weaknesses is indifference to the cost of things. Because [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=3040.5600000000004s)]
*  there are a ton of voters who voted for him out of economic anxiety. [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=3045.36s)]
*  Adam Tate Yeah. All right. You've got a new pod. I want to hear about that. And then I have one [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=3049.84s)]
*  final special rapid fire question. So the new pod, why are you doing it? You're busy enough. [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=3055.6800000000003s)]
*  You've got two kids now. You're doing baseball tournaments. You're doing weekend anchoring, [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=3060.0800000000004s)]
*  two hours. You're like, I need something else. I want to beat Tim Miller in the podcast rankings. [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=3064.2400000000002s)]
*  What was the motivation for this? [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=3068.24s)]
*  Amy Quinton So much said to me, get off my lawn. I wanted to do more when he won. I went to, [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=3070.56s)]
*  Rashida was still the president of MSNBC. And I wanted to do more. I think Rachel had the same [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=3079.12s)]
*  instinct. She went out and anchored the first hundred days. I wanted to do more. Nobody that [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=3083.7599999999998s)]
*  I worked for or with thought a third hour was a good idea. I don't know how Joe and Mika do it, [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=3090.24s)]
*  but they have a village and it's different when it's one hour. So I also- [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=3095.36s)]
*  Adam Tate I'm happy they didn't give you a third hour. That would have been more time [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=3102.1600000000003s)]
*  for more obligations for me. [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=3105.28s)]
*  Amy Quinton You would have spent a lot more time on television. But I also, I take the note that [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=3106.88s)]
*  the media, I mean, Megan Kelly talked about this in an interview with the New York Times. I think [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=3113.76s)]
*  she's right. This is how people want to hear the news from you. And they don't want it separated [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=3118.0s)]
*  from your opinions. And you do a better newscast than I do in terms of really like singling or [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=3123.68s)]
*  paring it down to things that you know your audience cares about, giving them the news and [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=3132.3199999999997s)]
*  the context. And I think I wanted to be in the space without trying to replicate what I do on [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=3136.16s)]
*  the show. And then I actually think the best people was Trump's best brand. I think in 16, [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=3142.0s)]
*  the way he wins the first time is by acknowledging that people might not be totally comfortable with [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=3147.7599999999998s)]
*  a guy who's never done anything in politics. And so he promises his base, I'll bring in the [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=3153.52s)]
*  best people. And then he kind of sort of does it with Mattis and Millie and- [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=3159.44s)]
*  Adam Tate Reince doesn't count, but you know, some happy happy. [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=3164.4s)]
*  Amy Quinton But to his supporters, they look like Mattis looks like he's at Essential Casting. And [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=3169.36s)]
*  the people that he brings in, he can at least sell it to half the country that they're the best [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=3176.48s)]
*  people. And I think when he picked Matt Gaetz, he had clearly abandoned the brand. And I thought [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=3181.68s)]
*  that was the most, like to me, the most amazing thing about tapping Matt Gaetz wasn't that he was [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=3187.12s)]
*  investigated, right, for child sex trafficking, or that he had sent like so many videos of himself [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=3193.04s)]
*  having sex around on his phone that Mark Wayne Mullin was like, yeah, he could talk about how he, [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=3198.96s)]
*  I mean, I don't even want to say it's not because I'm approved, but because it's disgusting mental [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=3204.96s)]
*  images. But the whole idea that the best people have been abandoned and we know the best people, [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=3209.36s)]
*  right? And the people you talk to, they're the people I get to talk to. So I wanted to [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=3216.08s)]
*  sort of reappropriate the brand, the best people, and then bring some of the wisdom that I get from [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=3220.8s)]
*  people that maybe don't want to come on the show, don't want to be embroiled in the daily news cycle [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=3225.52s)]
*  in the podcast. [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=3230.96s)]
*  Adam Tate That's been cool. I was listening to Doc Rivers this morning. [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=3231.6s)]
*  Amy Quinton He's so cool. [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=3234.0s)]
*  Adam Tate I gotta get his digits from you. [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=3234.6400000000003s)]
*  Amy Quinton He's so cool. [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=3236.56s)]
*  Adam Tate And it is, I'm glad you mentioned the short-lived Matt Gaetz nomination. I don't think [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=3238.08s)]
*  that anybody, not that we were looking forward to Matt Gaetz being attorney general, we weren't, [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=3242.16s)]
*  but the concept of him as nomination was something that we aligned on as bringing us a little bit of [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=3247.3599999999997s)]
*  joy during the inter-race. [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=3252.72s)]
*  Amy Quinton But you look at Pam Bondi, like in the [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=3254.16s)]
*  hindsight, I'm not sure he would have been worse. [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=3256.64s)]
*  Adam Tate Oh, no way. Clue of witness then. Yeah, [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=3258.3999999999996s)]
*  I'm with you. It's like the cash situation. It's like actually the most incompetent people are a [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=3261.9199999999996s)]
*  better bet for us because they don't know their way around. It's a little harder for them to do [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=3266.32s)]
*  jobs. Yeah, yeah. Cash Patel year three is alarming. Now we're back to the, what's the [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=3271.2000000000003s)]
*  scariest question, Nicole? All right, final thing. Mount Rushmore. I like to ask people to give us [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=3276.2400000000002s)]
*  a Mount Rushmore. You get the Mount Rushmore of Deadline White House guests. [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=3281.92s)]
*  Amy Quinton Who are my guests? [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=3285.52s)]
*  Adam Tate Yeah, which of your guests would you put on the Mount Rushmore of your guests? [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=3288.6400000000003s)]
*  Amy Quinton Anyone that watches could, you tell me who they are. You watched my show [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=3292.48s)]
*  every day. You're on it. Clare Weissman [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=3296.24s)]
*  Adam Tate There you go. Ouch. That is, there are some people that are hardest hit right there. [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=3304.72s)]
*  We're not going to name them, but I will be sending them this clip. [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=3310.08s)]
*  Amy Quinton No, but I would just say that we, the show is built around the reporters. [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=3312.3999999999996s)]
*  Adam Tate John Howman didn't make it, for example. [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=3316.3999999999996s)]
*  Amy Quinton John Howman is too busy for me a lot of days, but you never say no. Clare never says no. [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=3318.08s)]
*  Eddie Gland never says no. And Andrew Weissman never says no, no matter where you guys are. [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=3323.76s)]
*  No, Howman is a media empire in his own right. He doesn't need to be on the Deadline White House. [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=3328.8s)]
*  Adam Tate Some people hardest hit there. I'm just going to leave it at that. I am saying no to you, [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=3334.1600000000003s)]
*  actually. I'm going on vacation, a real vacation. I'm not doing any Deadline White House from Madrid. [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=3338.6400000000003s)]
*  Clare Weiss Say no. [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=3344.6400000000003s)]
*  Adam Tate I'm saying no. One week. You're going to have to survive one week without me. [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=3345.76s)]
*  Clare Weiss We will be here when you get back. I mean, [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=3348.88s)]
*  I think Deadline White House is like that sports bar that has to have like a good turkey burger [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=3352.0s)]
*  and a real salad and be open every night. Like we'll be there. We'll be here when you get back. [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=3356.56s)]
*  Adam Tate I look forward to being back. I really appreciate you always having me on. [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=3360.48s)]
*  It's a delight. It's been a great joy of this horrible era is getting to know you. And I [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=3363.68s)]
*  appreciate you doing the pod. Clare Weiss I love you so much. Thank you so much for having me on. [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=3369.52s)]
*  Adam Tate We'll see you Nicole. Give my love to the kiddos and we'll see you on TV. [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=3372.8s)]
*  Clare Weiss Sorry they were so loud. [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=3375.6s)]
*  Adam Tate I don't know, maybe in a couple hours, probably. Whatever Clare tells me. [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=3376.8s)]
*  That's Nicole Wallace. We'll be back here tomorrow with another one of my favorite guests, [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=3381.2s)]
*  not as good as Nicole, but he'll be pretty good. So we'll see you all then. Peace. [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ax5LVXe4M&t=3384.72s)]
