Video Description: Trump would like nothing more than images from Los Angeles of tear gas and balaclava-clad anarchists throwing bottles at Marines to complement video of himself in the stands at his military parade, saluting the troops amid a field of flags. That's part of the reason why he chose LA to federalize the Guard—home to numerous adversaries who willingly take his bait. And while tanks are going to roll through DC, wrecking its streets for the big birthday boy, Israel is going after Iran like it went after Hezbollah. Meanwhile, Kristi Noem handled the Padilla incident like a little fascist, and it only just occurred to Trump how the deportations will affect farms and hotels. Plus, a "Les Miz" correction, a 'Godfather' goof, and fighting words over The Beach Boys v. Lou Reed.
Tom Nichols joins Tim Miller for the weekend pod.

**The Bulwark Podcast:** [June 13, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY)
*  We're going to liberate the city. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=0.0s)]
*  That's what we have troops in the streets right now. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=2.92s)]
*  And we're liberating the city from the socialist mayor. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=5.48s)]
*  I mean, that is pretty, it's comical, but it's dark. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=8.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=13.44s)]
*  And it's also, it's, um, Orwellian duck speak, right? [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=13.72s)]
*  I mean, it's just, it's duck lips, I think. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=17.080000000000002s)]
*  Easy. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=20.64s)]
*  Hello and welcome to the board podcast. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=22.119999999999997s)]
*  I'm your host Tim Miller. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=30.4s)]
*  Glad to welcome back one of your faves, professor emeritus at the naval war [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=31.6s)]
*  college is a staff writer at the Atlantic. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=34.36s)]
*  His books include the death of expertise. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=36.04s)]
*  It's Tom Nichols. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=38.04s)]
*  What's up, man? [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=38.8s)]
*  Hey, Tim. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=40.239999999999995s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=40.84s)]
*  Good to be with you. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=41.32s)]
*  Um, a reminder to listeners to check out our bulwark takes podcast feed for [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=42.4s)]
*  breaking news because we've had a, another fucking insane 24 hours. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=46.64s)]
*  Um, Israel, uh, executed a devastating attack on Iran. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=51.120000000000005s)]
*  The DHS raids are escalating Trump's talk going again. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=54.28s)]
*  But, uh, so we'll get to all that. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=57.480000000000004s)]
*  Uh, but I think we've got to start with the scene at the federal building in LA [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=59.04s)]
*  where DHS security wrestled democratic Senator Alex Padilla to the ground and [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=62.72s)]
*  handcuffed him after he tried to interrupt Kristi Noem's press conference with a [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=68.36s)]
*  question. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=72.12s)]
*  Um, boy, it was quite the scene, Tom. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=73.24000000000001s)]
*  I've got a lot of thoughts. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=76.32000000000001s)]
*  What was your, what's your top take on what we saw yesterday? [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=77.2s)]
*  Well, you know, I, um, I used to study Eastern Europe, uh, back, you know, in [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=80.4s)]
*  the day, I don't want to live there. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=85.04s)]
*  Uh, because this is really, I mean, this is, um, kind of Balkanized politics, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=87.4s)]
*  rough housing and, and, um, you know, fascistic authoritarian strong-arming. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=95.68s)]
*  I mean, you don't, I'm sorry, you know, she knows who Padilla is or she should. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=102.08s)]
*  Um, my colleague, David from had a great line on social media. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=106.08s)]
*  He said, you know, what was she supposed to do? [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=109.32000000000001s)]
*  She stops. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=111.0s)]
*  I see my friend, Senator Padilla is in the audience. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=111.48s)]
*  I'll be happy to take your question as soon as I'm done speaking. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=113.92s)]
*  But instead everything with this, with this bunch is, um, you know, uh, a, um, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=117.24000000000001s)]
*  a chest thumping show of force. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=123.80000000000001s)]
*  And so, um, it's shameful, embarrassing as a country, frightening, uh, that people [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=125.44s)]
*  would rough, you know, manhandle a U S Senator. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=134.12s)]
*  I mean, it's, it's, uh, it's, um, it's a disgrace all around. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=136.64000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, it really is. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=141.48000000000002s)]
*  And look, you know, for some folks, I haven't saw some of our folk in the [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=142.28s)]
*  comments section on, on the board yesterday, they were like, well, you [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=146.48000000000002s)]
*  know, should a sender really be doing that? [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=150.04s)]
*  And, and we can, we can talk about that. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=152.48000000000002s)]
*  Um, I, I, I, for one was happy he was doing it, but I understand there's [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=154.64000000000001s)]
*  going to be some, some people who want more decorum in their political leaders. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=158.16s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=161.76s)]
*  Maybe that's where you land, Tom, but [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=162.08s)]
*  here's how images work. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=164.08s)]
*  I don't know what he did because I didn't come into the story until I saw the [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=165.24s)]
*  clip of a bunch of guys wrestling him to the ground. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=170.52s)]
*  So, you know, that this is something we can, I'm sure we'll talk about this [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=174.76000000000002s)]
*  later, but this is something I keep trying to get across to people [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=179.04000000000002s)]
*  about the protests in LA. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=180.88s)]
*  They don't, you don't control those clips. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=182.12s)]
*  And, you know, uh, when I finally saw, you know, Padilla going in and yelling, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=184.84s)]
*  and I'm like, yeah, you know, I used to work for a Senator. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=189.76000000000002s)]
*  I wouldn't let my boss do that. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=192.16s)]
*  You know, I would've, I would've stopped him from doing that, but, but that's [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=194.24s)]
*  doesn't then excuse everything that happened after it being a boor is not [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=197.35999999999999s)]
*  an excuse for authoritarianism. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=202.07999999999998s)]
*  And this is like the area where I can bring some expertise to the table. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=204.76s)]
*  We bring you in for your Russian and Eastern European expertise. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=207.51999999999998s)]
*  We'll have a lot of that and your war college expertise. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=210.2s)]
*  I've disrupted press conferences before, so I know, so I know this was, this [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=212.84s)]
*  was my game back in my rat fucker days. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=216.56s)]
*  Um, I've been on the side where I was the press aid to a candidate having a [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=219.2s)]
*  press conference who was getting disrupted. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=223.6s)]
*  And I've been on the side of being a disruptor at a press conference and [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=226.0s)]
*  never has anybody put their hands on anybody in any of those situations. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=230.32s)]
*  And then afterwards, the DHS says, well, they didn't know who he was. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=234.68s)]
*  He didn't identify himself screaming. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=238.36s)]
*  I'm Senator Alex Patia at the beginning. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=240.32s)]
*  And then, and then the next question is, well, maybe the cops didn't believe them. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=243.04s)]
*  And there are a couple of issues about number one, it's inside a federal building. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=247.48000000000002s)]
*  So he was escorted in there by an FBI agent and by security. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=250.68s)]
*  So, you know, there should have been some context clues. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=254.0s)]
*  You know, it wasn't like, it's not like you're on a street corner or it could [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=256.56s)]
*  be some random cook, and even if you were, it doesn't, he didn't really [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=258.8s)]
*  present like a random cook. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=262.2s)]
*  He looked like an older. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=263.40000000000003s)]
*  Senatorial, like senatorial looking man named Padilla. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=264.76s)]
*  I guess so context. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=268.24s)]
*  And also this didn't happen in Maine. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=269.40000000000003s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=272.24s)]
*  I mean, he's in his own state where he was the secretary of state and the [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=272.52s)]
*  U S senator. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=275.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=276.88s)]
*  You know, and we're the ranking members of this committee and then they push [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=277.40000000000003s)]
*  them into the hallway and again, so then you're like, okay, well, if people, if [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=279.6s)]
*  they're like, oh, well, they just didn't believe them, then at that point it's [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=283.36s)]
*  okay, then maybe it's appropriate to be like, can you show me your ID, sir, or [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=285.56s)]
*  something? [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=288.8s)]
*  Can you, can you prove it? [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=289.16s)]
*  But they didn't do that. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=290.52000000000004s)]
*  They get them out in the hallway. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=291.44s)]
*  Then they push them under the ground. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=292.24s)]
*  They handcuff them. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=293.48s)]
*  They tell us aid to stop filming. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=294.20000000000005s)]
*  Um, even though you're at a press conference. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=296.36s)]
*  And so it was far outside the bounds of what we've seen at these kind of press [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=299.08000000000004s)]
*  conferences before. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=304.76s)]
*  And I think it comes also within the broader context. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=305.52s)]
*  I just played on yesterday's pod before all this happened, that clip of Chris [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=307.68s)]
*  Murphy from a month ago, questioning Kristi, no, I'm talking about how the DHS [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=311.0s)]
*  is out of control. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=315.15999999999997s)]
*  There's they're acting lawlessly. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=315.88s)]
*  They're spending money. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=317.15999999999997s)]
*  They don't have their, their, their agents are acting thuggishly with people. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=317.76s)]
*  So it's a trend. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=321.68s)]
*  It's not just some one-off security guy that got a little too out of, out of [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=322.64s)]
*  pocket. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=326.88s)]
*  And I know people think that I, some of these positions are, you know, oh, I [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=327.36s)]
*  became never Trump. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=331.0s)]
*  And, you know, now I'm, uh, you know, I've adopted all of these kind of hair on [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=332.12s)]
*  fire left. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=337.64s)]
*  I was calling 15 years ago, uh, for disestablishing DHS because I was exactly [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=338.91999999999996s)]
*  worried about this, that it's, it was an unnecessary panic response to nine 11. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=346.12s)]
*  It creates its own kind of internal. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=351.67999999999995s)]
*  I mean, how many internal security forces does one democracy need? [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=354.28s)]
*  Uh, you know, I'm sorry. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=358.84s)]
*  But especially when you see the, you know, like clips in front of these federal [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=360.48s)]
*  buildings, it's like LA police, there's the I there's ice, there's homeland [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=363.92s)]
*  security, there's secret service, secret service. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=368.40000000000003s)]
*  I mean, you know, Jesus Christ, the, you know, the, the, the freaking Kremlin [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=371.16s)]
*  doesn't have this much security all the time around it and they need it. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=376.32s)]
*  Uh, so, you know, this is this, but this is, as Bob Dylan once said, you [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=380.52000000000004s)]
*  get a lot of knives and forks, you got to cut something. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=384.68s)]
*  And, uh, I just went there on Dylan, by the way, that's kind of weird for me, [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=387.47999999999996s)]
*  but, um, but, you know, when you've got this many security forces, you know, with [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=391.91999999999996s)]
*  training that probably isn't the best with a bunch of guys that are being [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=398.03999999999996s)]
*  brought in from various other agencies and given badges, you're going to have, [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=402.2s)]
*  you know, it's, you're going to have these kind of mini militias inside of these [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=407.35999999999996s)]
*  organizations. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=412.44s)]
*  And in theory, the person who should be riding herd on all this is the secretary. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=413.32s)]
*  But like, heck Seth, like others, she is way in over her head, way in out of her [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=418.64s)]
*  league. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=425.76s)]
*  Um, you know, she, she has never run anything, uh, of any consequential size. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=426.59999999999997s)]
*  This is also, this was all supposed to be just TV to own the lips, not actually [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=432.88s)]
*  running a department. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=438.03999999999996s)]
*  And now we see what happens when you, you know, hire people that are [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=439.32s)]
*  telegenic ostensibly and tell them to run big departments. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=443.08s)]
*  And, and, uh, it's just shameful. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=448.08s)]
*  You're right. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=450.6s)]
*  I mean, ostensibly carrying a lot of, carrying a lot of weight, a lot of weight [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=451.0s)]
*  there, but, you know, um, but, you know, that's why Trump hires people. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=455.24s)]
*  He sees them on TV. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=459.64s)]
*  He likes them on TV. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=460.96s)]
*  And, uh, you know, this, this was just disgraceful. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=462.88s)]
*  And I think that kind of permissiveness about, uh, force and kind of that, you [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=466.4s)]
*  know, sort of punch first, ask later, forget about IDs that that all comes [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=472.96s)]
*  from the top. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=477.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=478.0s)]
*  Well, we are talking LA, not New York, but, uh, it was a good reference. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=478.79999999999995s)]
*  Anyway, the, um, the other thing about that's fascistic about it. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=481.56s)]
*  Did I say New York? [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=485.35999999999996s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=486.08s)]
*  No, Bob Dylan. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=486.47999999999996s)]
*  Oh, Bob. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=487.64s)]
*  Sorry. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=488.84s)]
*  Um, uh, the, the other thing about it that's fascistic and feels like an [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=489.12s)]
*  Eastern European authoritarian country is that, you know, that you have Christy [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=494.44s)]
*  and her new face on TV immediately after talking about how he didn't represent, [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=498.28s)]
*  I didn't identify himself, Trisha McLaughlin, our little spokesperson's [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=502.04s)]
*  putting that out, DHS is putting it out. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=504.88s)]
*  And it's like, why just the, the telling us not to believe our lying eyes, right? [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=507.04s)]
*  Like if you, one thing, if it was just like, you know what guys, I, it's a, [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=513.88s)]
*  it's a tense moment. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=518.56s)]
*  Um, my, my security team was doing their best to protect me. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=520.2s)]
*  Obviously we shouldn't have handcuffed a U S Senator. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=524.56s)]
*  Um, you know what? [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=527.24s)]
*  I was happy to meet with them afterwards. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=528.4s)]
*  It still would have been chilling and felt un-American for it to even get to that [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=530.28s)]
*  place, but that would be an appropriate response. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=533.72s)]
*  And then Mike Johnson's like, Padilla should be censured. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=536.0s)]
*  You know, like, [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=539.24s)]
*  well, Mike, John, uh, Mike Johnson, but what I was going to say, and you, you [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=540.4s)]
*  know, you, you know, this from, again, from working in the world of politics and [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=545.64s)]
*  optics, the power move would have been to do what you just said, to say, Hey, [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=549.56s)]
*  you know, would never have done that, you know, to be gracious, right? [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=554.4s)]
*  To be magnanimous. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=557.72s)]
*  Course I would never want that to, you know, happen to Senator Padilla. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=559.56s)]
*  And instead they look weak. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=563.52s)]
*  They run to, you know, their favorite outlets and they kind of turtle up and [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=565.3199999999999s)]
*  hunker down and, and that, um, I, in a way, I think that's actually better [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=570.04s)]
*  because it shows that these things happen not out of strength, um, but out of [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=574.76s)]
*  weakness. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=579.52s)]
*  Um, and, and I think, uh, you know, it almost, I mean, in a way I'm kind of glad [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=580.72s)]
*  she didn't apologize or try to explain it because I think it just put, it just [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=584.96s)]
*  underlines it and underscores just how incompetent these people really are. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=588.84s)]
*  I want to play because I think it's pretty telling. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=592.4399999999999s)]
*  Uh, if you listen, this clip I'm about to play is what Kristi Noem was saying [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=595.64s)]
*  right as Padilla is interrupting her. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=599.64s)]
*  Now it doesn't, it doesn't appear like Padilla is actually engaging on the [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=602.24s)]
*  merits of what she's saying, but, but still the coincidence, um, is pretty [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=605.24s)]
*  jarring, I think. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=610.9200000000001s)]
*  So I just want to listen to Kristi Noem at the press conference. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=611.9200000000001s)]
*  And increase our operations in this city. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=614.6400000000001s)]
*  We are not going away. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=617.1600000000001s)]
*  We are staying here to liberate this city from the, uh, socialist and the, um, [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=618.96s)]
*  burdensome leadership that this governor and that this mayor have placed on this [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=625.36s)]
*  country and what they have tried to insert into the city. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=629.84s)]
*  So I want to say thank you. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=633.64s)]
*  You're here to be in the background there. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=635.36s)]
*  We're going to liberate the city. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=636.72s)]
*  That's what we have troops in the streets right now, and we're liberating [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=639.64s)]
*  the city from the socialist mayor. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=643.24s)]
*  I mean, that is pretty, it's comical, but it's dark. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=645.6800000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=650.1600000000001s)]
*  And it's also, it's, um, Orwellian duck speak, right? [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=650.48s)]
*  I mean, it's just, it's the- [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=653.84s)]
*  Duck lips, I think. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=655.32s)]
*  Easy. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=657.36s)]
*  Uh, you know, it's- [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=658.56s)]
*  She chose them, but she chose them. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=660.0799999999999s)]
*  I went into the, went into the office and pointed at the picture of Daffy and was [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=661.56s)]
*  like, I want that one. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=665.24s)]
*  Sorry. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=666.3199999999999s)]
*  Continue. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=666.88s)]
*  So as I was saying, um, uh, it's, it's that assembling of, of approved phrases, [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=668.0s)]
*  you know, California socialist, you know, invaders, liberation, what, what, what, [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=674.16s)]
*  what, what, and, and it's just, it's meant to like ping dopamine receptors in [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=681.4399999999999s)]
*  them in the faithful, you know, it doesn't mean anything. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=686.68s)]
*  Uh, and she doesn't, I'm sure she doesn't believe it. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=690.1999999999999s)]
*  And, but it's, but it's, I, and I think this is the problem for a lot of the [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=694.4399999999999s)]
*  people in LA that are trying to protest this, this, as far as Trump's concerned, [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=699.28s)]
*  this is an away game. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=703.12s)]
*  This is all just fodder to generate stuff that he's going to export back, you [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=704.4399999999999s)]
*  know, and into the bloodstream of the rest of America. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=709.8399999999999s)]
*  So, you know, socialist liberating from socialist lead. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=712.88s)]
*  But of course that also sounds like the DHS secretary saying, I'm here to [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=716.5999999999999s)]
*  overthrow the local government of California. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=719.8399999999999s)]
*  Yes. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=721.8399999999999s)]
*  Right. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=723.4s)]
*  And I, you know, you should be a little careful about that kind of rhetoric. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=725.24s)]
*  I would say, and I, the senator from California who's trying to represent [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=728.12s)]
*  his own constituents who didn't vote for the militarization of their streets to [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=732.5999999999999s)]
*  liberate them, uh, out there trying to engage and the reaction is to handcuff them. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=736.4s)]
*  And I think that context is important. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=742.44s)]
*  I thought conservatives were all about the 10th amendment and local control [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=744.6800000000001s)]
*  and small government and, you know, limiting executive overreach and not [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=748.2s)]
*  having the deep state extend its military tentacles throughout the blah, blah, blah. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=752.6800000000001s)]
*  You know, it just goes to show you that, that when I, on that, on these issues [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=757.72s)]
*  where, um, and I suppose this is why I still bristle every time people say, well, [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=762.2800000000001s)]
*  they're conservatives and you're a conservative, there is nothing [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=766.0400000000001s)]
*  conservative about this situation. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=768.88s)]
*  This right wing, far right wing radicalism is indistinguishable from, from [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=771.6s)]
*  the kind of left wing radicalism that if, you know, a bunch of, you know, like [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=776.36s)]
*  John, so the president of my old school B used to call me a bunch of short pants, [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=781.72s)]
*  communists took over the government. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=785.8s)]
*  They'd be doing the same thing. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=788.48s)]
*  They'd be saying, we're here to liberate, you know, the people of California from [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=790.32s)]
*  this fascistic, you know, uh, police state. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=793.48s)]
*  It's the same, it's the same dynamic with just different labels on it. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=796.88s)]
*  Yeah, right. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=801.7199999999999s)]
*  I started the, I like, there's no apt comparison, but just like, just, [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=802.04s)]
*  just work with me here. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=805.76s)]
*  Let's say there's a red state somewhere that was, uh, you know, uh, discriminating [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=806.92s)]
*  against trans folks in a way where trans folks felt like they were, um, unsafe. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=812.4799999999999s)]
*  And president Kamala Harris had decided I'm going to actually, I'm going to [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=818.92s)]
*  actually nationalize the Arkansas national guard and we're going to put troops on [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=823.0799999999999s)]
*  the streets of Little Rock to protect the trans kids at the high school, at the [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=827.52s)]
*  local high school. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=833.56s)]
*  I mean, it's a kind of a silly metaphor because it doesn't quite work in the [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=834.4399999999999s)]
*  reverse, but talk about accusations of communism. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=837.48s)]
*  Of course. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=840.5999999999999s)]
*  Fox would be like apoplectic. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=841.48s)]
*  It'd be like a government takeover of the American state. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=843.0799999999999s)]
*  Let's think about where there's a lot of other illegal immigrants. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=846.4s)]
*  Texas. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=850.04s)]
*  Right. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=851.16s)]
*  Uh, Arizona, you picked LA because the one thing, and I, and I wrote about this [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=853.5999999999999s)]
*  a few days ago, he picked LA because he has a genius for picking the right fights. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=859.0s)]
*  And he picked, when I, when I used to teach strategy to military guys, we had [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=863.88s)]
*  an expression that we used, um, for lucking out and getting a kind of a dumb [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=867.4s)]
*  enemy, um, which is that he, he chose LA because it also has a cooperative [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=872.9599999999999s)]
*  adversary in it. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=878.8399999999999s)]
*  Right. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=880.7199999999999s)]
*  It has an adversary that, that doesn't just take his bait, but rushes into the [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=881.0s)]
*  traps that he sets, um, you know, with open arms and he knew what would happen. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=886.48s)]
*  And so, you know, I mean, so far he, this is getting scripted out exactly the way [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=892.24s)]
*  he, he thought it would, um, and people, you know, are playing, are playing into [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=897.12s)]
*  it, but it does, it really shows you the, that this is that the modern Republican [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=903.24s)]
*  party, the, whatever it's become now, not the thing that you and I knew 20 years [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=908.88s)]
*  ago, but it's become about power, just the raw exercise of power, not about [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=914.0s)]
*  principle, not about ideology, not about conservatism. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=918.4399999999999s)]
*  It's about a group of people who have, um, carried around a lot of resentment [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=921.16s)]
*  and feeling like they should be the people in charge, you know, getting [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=927.88s)]
*  picked up in the limos every morning. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=931.84s)]
*  And that's all it's about. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=934.16s)]
*  It's just, I mean, there's no, there's no overriding philosophy of government. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=935.64s)]
*  I mean, I suppose if you had to look around in this, in this coterie of people [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=940.0s)]
*  for somebody who actually believes in what they're doing, it's probably [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=945.16s)]
*  somebody like Russ Vow. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=948.1999999999999s)]
*  The rest of them are just, you know, um, where's my limo, uh, who's bringing my [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=950.04s)]
*  lunch, um, and, you know, tell me what I have to say to, to stay in this job. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=956.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=961.72s)]
*  We will get to some prime examples of that on Israel, but just a couple more [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=961.92s)]
*  things in LA. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=964.56s)]
*  Uh, and on the immigration stuff, because it's also not about, obviously [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=965.88s)]
*  about small government or constitution or individual rights. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=969.88s)]
*  I like what's happening right now is continuing to happen in LA is absolutely [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=972.52s)]
*  like the, the, the fact that they're not producing more crazy waymos on fire [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=977.24s)]
*  videos just continues to, to, um, I've demonstrate how ridiculous what is [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=982.84s)]
*  happening right now is like, we currently still have federal military on the [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=989.1999999999999s)]
*  streets of Los Angeles for no legitimate reason. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=993.44s)]
*  And so what they're doing now is essentially creating a perimeter for ice [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=996.7600000000001s)]
*  rates. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1001.8000000000001s)]
*  So we've got two different types of, to your earlier point, federal law [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1002.9200000000001s)]
*  enforcement, one going, you know, going in and harassing unarmed people because. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1006.8000000000001s)]
*  You know, they're being racially targeted because they're suspected of [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1013.0s)]
*  being undocumented immigrants. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1015.4000000000001s)]
*  And then you've got dudes with, with guns, like standing around, creating [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1017.4000000000001s)]
*  a semi-circle around them. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1020.8000000000001s)]
*  And I still think that part of the reason that they're doing that is that, um, they [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1021.92s)]
*  want people to rush that perimeter. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1026.56s)]
*  And in fact, when, when they're not getting that response, what's Trump's answer? [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1029.24s)]
*  Well, I'm going to send more Marines. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1034.12s)]
*  Right. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1036.12s)]
*  You know, like I'm not getting the allergic response I want. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1036.6s)]
*  And then, and then he sends more Marines and then people, you know, it's almost a [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1039.12s)]
*  symbiotic relationship at this point. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1042.52s)]
*  The best idea I heard about what to do in LA, someone said, yeah, instead of [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1044.92s)]
*  flying, you know, Mexican flags and yelling at the, you know, burning way, [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1049.56s)]
*  Mo's and yelling at the national guardsmen have a bunch of these guys don't [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1053.04s)]
*  have enough food and places to sleep. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1056.6399999999999s)]
*  Have a bunch of taco trucks or food trucks show up, put out some really great [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1058.76s)]
*  food, say, this is for you guys and leave. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1063.36s)]
*  Uh, and you know, cause they don't want to be there. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1066.0s)]
*  They don't know why they're there. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1069.8799999999999s)]
*  And I think that's the most powerful part of this is that when it's over, what you [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1071.1599999999999s)]
*  want is a bunch of military guys who said, why was I there? [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1075.12s)]
*  You know, what was the point of this? [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1078.9199999999998s)]
*  So just for kicks, I was just going to keep going on LA since LA is on fire. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1081.0s)]
*  Pretty circadian. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1085.84s)]
*  Maybe you can chime in in case I'm missing anything here. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1086.52s)]
*  She's out in LA. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1088.9199999999998s)]
*  Um, I just pulled up while you're talking NBC, like the local LA four. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1090.1999999999998s)]
*  So I'm like, maybe I'm missing something about what is happening in LA. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1095.1999999999998s)]
*  Um, the top stories right now on, on NBC four, number one, downtown LA businesses [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1099.36s)]
*  miss out on customers due to city curfew. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1104.6799999999998s)]
*  Over 30 farm workers detained by ICE in Ventura County, sparking widespread fear. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1108.7199999999998s)]
*  Like I, and the Padea story. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1113.52s)]
*  I, and it's like, we have, we have troops on the streets for what? [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1115.76s)]
*  I, it was like that LAPD, one of the biggest police departments in the [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1120.0s)]
*  country couldn't handle this. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1123.12s)]
*  Like, I can't believe what a sheep you are. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1124.32s)]
*  You're going to, you're going to totally believe that lame stream media stuff. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1126.7199999999998s)]
*  When there are socialists taking over and leading a Mexican invasion force [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1130.08s)]
*  in the streets of Los Angeles. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1135.4399999999998s)]
*  I mean, what you think that is that right? [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1137.6399999999999s)]
*  Okay. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1139.68s)]
*  Let's maybe, that's what I hear is going on. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1139.92s)]
*  Maybe CBS has CBS Los Angeles says something on this. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1142.96s)]
*  No, uh, uh, one suspect was arrested for throwing a can at a deputy [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1146.76s)]
*  during the downtown protest. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1151.1599999999999s)]
*  Not great. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1152.52s)]
*  A socialist can. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1153.44s)]
*  Don't throw cans of deputies. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1155.0s)]
*  Don't do that. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1156.8799999999999s)]
*  But if that's the number two story, again, it doesn't seem like it's a city on [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1158.08s)]
*  fire that requires the federal government to liberate it. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1161.92s)]
*  All right. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1164.8s)]
*  Um, I just, um, a couple of other immigration stuff. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1165.1999999999998s)]
*  Um, uh, the Trump, it does seem to be tacoing a little bit on, uh, at least [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1168.08s)]
*  certain kinds of deportations. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1175.52s)]
*  I don't know if you saw this. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1176.84s)]
*  Um, he said, our great farmers and people in the hotel and leisure business have [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1177.8s)]
*  been stating that our very aggressive policy on immigration is taking good [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1182.8799999999999s)]
*  long time workers away from them. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1186.28s)]
*  With those jobs being almost impossible to replace, um, they're being replaced [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1188.32s)]
*  by the criminals that Biden brought in apparently, um, uh, GT Thompson, the [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1192.8s)]
*  chair of the ag committee, uh, real ones who listen might remember GT Thompson [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1198.64s)]
*  as the person that voted against, uh, the codification of gay marriage. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1203.0s)]
*  I believe it was either the week before or after attending his son's gay wedding. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1207.64s)]
*  Um, he's the house ag chair on the Republicans. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1211.68s)]
*  Um, they need to knock it off. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1214.08s)]
*  Um, GT Thompson told reporters of the, of DHS, let's go after criminals and give [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1216.08s)]
*  us time to put process in place so we don't disrupt the food supply chain. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1221.6s)]
*  So there's some concerns in red America. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1225.8799999999999s)]
*  We got some phone calls from people who own hotels and Donald Trump, [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1229.04s)]
*  such as the president. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1235.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1236.8799999999999s)]
*  Uh, and, uh, you know, suddenly, um, I mean, you can write this script, right? [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1237.7199999999998s)]
*  People calling up and saying, listen, uh, I understand you had to say stuff to get [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1245.3999999999999s)]
*  elected, but you're about to arrest, you know, a lot of people that actually keep [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1248.88s)]
*  the economy functioning here, including my business. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1253.8000000000002s)]
*  And that, and that's always when Trump backs down to some rich guy calls him and [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1257.0800000000002s)]
*  says, Hey, uh, not my, not my industry. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1260.6000000000001s)]
*  Okay. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1263.5200000000002s)]
*  Uh, okay. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1264.16s)]
*  Sorry. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1264.7600000000002s)]
*  Uh, so the other thing I think when you talk about tacoing, you know, if going [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1265.88s)]
*  back to why this is happening in LA, it's happening because in everywhere else in [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1271.6000000000001s)]
*  the courts, Trump's losing. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1277.16s)]
*  And he's, he wants to change that narrative. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1280.6000000000001s)]
*  Um, he's underwater. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1283.28s)]
*  The only thing people really agree with are deportations. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1284.72s)]
*  And, you know, if you ask that question, ask me, am I in favor of sending people [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1287.88s)]
*  home who are here illegally as a general answer? [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1293.68s)]
*  Yes, of course I am. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1296.8000000000002s)]
*  Of course. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1298.8400000000001s)]
*  You know, it's a sense. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1299.6000000000001s)]
*  It's this obvious answer of saying, if someone's breaking the law and they're [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1300.64s)]
*  here, you know, illegally, should they be sent back to their country of origin? [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1303.4s)]
*  The, for most people, the default answer is yes. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1307.2s)]
*  And then yes, but with due process, with some understand it, with some compassion, [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1310.28s)]
*  with some understanding, with input from the community, you know, that, that not [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1315.16s)]
*  every person here illegally is a light. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1319.44s)]
*  They're not all MS 13. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1321.44s)]
*  They're not all, you know, uh, um, um, armed robbers, uh, that, you know, do [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1322.92s)]
*  this in a sensible way at, with a lot of input from the local level he's [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1329.8400000000001s)]
*  underwater on everything else. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1335.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1337.64s)]
*  Including how it's being done, you know, that, and so he wants this. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1338.76s)]
*  He wants these images. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1343.32s)]
*  He wants to be able to say, look, I know you don't like this, but these people [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1344.72s)]
*  really are just a foreign army. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1349.56s)]
*  And, you know, I, I will, I know I'm a broken record on this. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1352.3600000000001s)]
*  I'll put the plea in one more time. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1356.1200000000001s)]
*  Don't give him the video that he wants so badly. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1357.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1361.24s)]
*  I mean, this is the thing that frustrates me is like, Oh, hotel magnet is upset [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1361.56s)]
*  that the hoteliers are losing their staff. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1366.72s)]
*  It's like, Oh, won't somebody think about the poor hoteliers who can't staff [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1370.08s)]
*  their kitchen and, you know, and it's like the ag committee chair is upset [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1374.12s)]
*  about the rich farmers that are calling him and, and, and, you know, none of [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1378.76s)]
*  these guys it's never like, you know, maybe I should consider if in the one [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1383.32s)]
*  area that I know very well, hotels in Trump's case, farms and GD Thompson's [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1388.28s)]
*  case, this is big, this is being handled haphazardly. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1393.04s)]
*  Maybe it's also being handled haphazardly across all of the other verticals as [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1396.48s)]
*  well. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1400.8s)]
*  You know, that never seems to sink in with anybody. [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1401.08s)]
*  Maybe it's, it's a problem. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1403.04s)]
*  Stephen Miller saying I want 3000, I want 3000 people a day. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1404.48s)]
*  Well, you know, the problem is that when you say that they're going to go [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1408.6s)]
*  hunt where the ducks are. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1412.44s)]
*  They're going to go try and find the biggest concentration of people where [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1414.36s)]
*  they can think that some percentage of them, you know, because let's not, it's [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1417.68s)]
*  very important not to stereotype here either. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1422.48s)]
*  Not everybody works on a farmer and hotels, an illegal immigrant, but they're [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1424.04s)]
*  going to go and say, what's the, what are the chances that I'm going to be able to [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1428.0s)]
*  make my quota, you know, what are these, they're not going to walk through, you [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1432.28s)]
*  know, South Central LA and say, all right, you know, everybody show me your ID. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1436.5600000000002s)]
*  Duck call. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1441.32s)]
*  But they're going to, they're going to go to places where they can say, all right, [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1445.64s)]
*  I know you people are out where everybody, everybody down in the kitchen, [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1450.28s)]
*  everybody over here in the utility room. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1453.28s)]
*  All right, you, you, you, and you, because it becomes, and this, and this actually [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1455.3600000000001s)]
*  happens in authoritarian countries on a lot of levels when it comes, when they're [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1459.76s)]
*  looking for those, I just say, you know, put a bunch of people together. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1463.88s)]
*  I got to file a report. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1467.72s)]
*  I have paperwork that I need to finish. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1469.24s)]
*  So you, you, you, and you, you're under arrest. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1471.0s)]
*  Let's go. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1473.56s)]
*  And they're not actually doing the policing or the work that makes people safer, [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1474.64s)]
*  which is what Trump promised, right? [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1480.0s)]
*  I'm going to, I'm going after the criminals and it's, and it's, you know, I'm, [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1481.68s)]
*  I'm glad that innocent people are not going to get swept up in this, but there [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1486.56s)]
*  is a part of me that wants, uh, that, that wants Americans to see as many of them [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1492.04s)]
*  have already said, Hey, wait a minute. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1499.52s)]
*  I didn't vote for this. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1501.32s)]
*  I thought they were going to take the bad immigrants. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1503.32s)]
*  No, right. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1506.56s)]
*  Steven Miller doesn't care about that. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1507.44s)]
*  Steven Miller has, you know, some kind of, I mean, somebody must have really [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1509.44s)]
*  humiliated him in high school about immigration or something, but this is his [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1515.92s)]
*  thing and he's not, he doesn't care about that. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1520.24s)]
*  And so once you set this machinery in motion, it will become, you know, just [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1522.56s)]
*  this kind of clockwork of must find people, must arrest, must process, find [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1527.48s)]
*  arrest, process, find arrest process. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1533.04s)]
*  And that's what, and that Trump and other people just didn't think through what [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1534.72s)]
*  that looks like on a daily basis. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1538.76s)]
*  And now they're finding out. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1540.44s)]
*  And the other gathering place, just the last thing on this is the courts, you [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1541.52s)]
*  know, and I will put in the show notes. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1544.92s)]
*  It won't really translate to audio, but I was watching a video this morning that [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1546.2s)]
*  our buddies at Tennessee holler put up of this guy is an Afghan interpreter. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1549.4s)]
*  Who's like going in for his normal court check-in, who's getting, who is getting [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1552.96s)]
*  cuffed and taken out and he's shouting, I helped the military for three years. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1556.96s)]
*  Right. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1561.6000000000001s)]
*  And so like, that's the other way. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1561.8000000000002s)]
*  Like it's the, it's the opposite actually of going after criminals. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1562.8400000000001s)]
*  They are gathering up the people that are showing up, that are [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1566.0400000000002s)]
*  trying to do the right thing. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1568.8400000000001s)]
*  Right. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1570.24s)]
*  It's, but it's easy because they have got to make a quota of people who are here [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1570.48s)]
*  illegally, I'll just wait for the good ones to obey the order to show up and [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1574.68s)]
*  explain themselves and take them away. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1580.84s)]
*  Because really who wants to go deal with a bunch of criminals? [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1582.9199999999998s)]
*  Um, all right over to Israel and Iran. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1586.32s)]
*  I just, who knows we're 12 hours into this at the time of taping this. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1588.9599999999998s)]
*  So, you know, uh, obviously there, this is a developing situation. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1593.48s)]
*  Things could happen by this afternoon, but at least that for the first wave, [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1597.24s)]
*  just an unbelievable, an unbelievably effective decimation of Iranian [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1600.76s)]
*  targets from Israel. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1607.4399999999998s)]
*  Um, you, you began your article for the Atlantic last night, uh, Israel's [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1608.84s)]
*  bold, risky attack. [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1612.36s)]
*  Um, uh, you compared it to the Godfather Briss. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1613.9599999999998s)]
*  Let maybe talk about that a little bit. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1618.28s)]
*  First of all, it was a christening. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1619.9599999999998s)]
*  Excuse me. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1621.8s)]
*  Christening the Godfather. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1622.24s)]
*  Briss. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1624.56s)]
*  Right. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1624.9199999999998s)]
*  Obviously. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1625.1599999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1626.1999999999998s)]
*  That's what I just need a little more coffee. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1626.8s)]
*  She exists, Tim. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1629.1599999999999s)]
*  But, uh, yeah, the baptism, the Catholics do the, do the whole circumcision. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1632.08s)]
*  It's just, we don't have like a little, we don't have a ceremony around. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1636.48s)]
*  Wow. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1640.72s)]
*  Uh, but, uh, I had Israel on the mind. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1641.72s)]
*  We're talking about Israel. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1646.0s)]
*  Anyway, sorry. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1647.64s)]
*  I'm just keep digging. [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1648.24s)]
*  Okay. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1649.08s)]
*  Anyway, talk to us about the Godfather. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1649.32s)]
*  That clattering everyone heard was the shovel coming in after you. [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1651.3600000000001s)]
*  So, uh, yes, the scene in the Godfather where Michael's at the christening and [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1655.76s)]
*  his guys are wiping everybody out. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1660.04s)]
*  And the reason I brought it up is not because of the scale of the wipe up, [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1663.2s)]
*  but because Michael says afterwards, if you remember, he says to his traitorous [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1667.1200000000001s)]
*  ferret of a brother-in-law, Carlo, he says today I settled all family business. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1671.3600000000001s)]
*  And that's what it came across as Netanyahu basically saying, that's it. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1677.68s)]
*  I'm going to settle. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1681.4s)]
*  I'm going to settle all accounts here. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1682.4s)]
*  Uh, I'm going to take out the Iranians. [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1684.4s)]
*  Uh, and my, the, like I, I have mixed feelings about this. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1687.0s)]
*  I don't trust BB Netanyahu. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1691.52s)]
*  Um, I don't like to, you know, I don't like the idea of courting [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1693.84s)]
*  a major war in the middle East. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1698.4s)]
*  By the way, another musical reference people, it's one of his lesser known songs. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1699.68s)]
*  But if you're, if you're thinking about this stuff today, do yourself a favor [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1703.6399999999999s)]
*  and go play the envoy by Warren's Yvonne. [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1707.0s)]
*  Um, which was written, you know, 40 odd years ago and it practically [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1710.0s)]
*  predicted all of this, um, but. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1713.4s)]
*  Um, on the other hand, if the, if the Iranians, excuse me, if the Iranians [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1717.04s)]
*  are that close to a nuclear weapon, uh, and the Israelis were claiming, you [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1722.52s)]
*  know, weeks, um, you know, they could make the argument, look, it's a genocidal regime. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1727.3999999999999s)]
*  They've been threatening for decades to wipe us out. [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1731.72s)]
*  The, the moment of, you know, push has come to shove and we need to take this out. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1735.12s)]
*  The reason I'm a little skeptical about that, that they keep the Israelis keep [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1741.24s)]
*  saying, this is a preemptive attack, right? [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1746.72s)]
*  Like a preemptive attack is the thing you do when someone's just about to attack [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1749.0s)]
*  you, when the fist is cocked, you know, when the gun is being drawn from the [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1753.5200000000002s)]
*  holster and instead this looks like a lot more like a preventive war. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1758.16s)]
*  It's like, look, the timing is advantageous to us. [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1762.8400000000001s)]
*  Um, we know where these targets are. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1765.68s)]
*  We can get at them. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1768.0s)]
*  We're going to do this on our schedule. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1769.28s)]
*  And so we're just going to, you know, execute an attack with, um, if not [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1771.28s)]
*  strategic surprise, operational surprising, not that these Ronny and [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1775.56s)]
*  didn't know that something was coming one day, but they didn't know it was coming [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1779.48s)]
*  today. [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1782.1599999999999s)]
*  And so they, and the, and also the breadth of the targets says, says to me [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1782.6s)]
*  at this point, and again, we're working on. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1786.92s)]
*  Partial information 12 hours in, but this doesn't look like we're just going to [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1789.68s)]
*  take out the nuclear program and, and this threat to our existence. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1793.92s)]
*  That when you kill the entire general staff and you do this big sweep of [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1798.16s)]
*  leadership, that, that looks like a regime change operation. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1802.52s)]
*  I mean, that looks like really just kind of knocking the struts out of [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1806.52s)]
*  the government everywhere. [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1810.76s)]
*  And, you know, I'm an American, I would not miss the Iranian regime, but I'm [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1812.44s)]
*  also not comfortable with, you know, putting the entire middle East in flames [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1817.6000000000001s)]
*  at a, at a touching moment like this. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1823.56s)]
*  So that's my kind of squishing. [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1826.36s)]
*  I'll react to that, but I just, you had me on the Warren Zivon song. [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1829.6s)]
*  So I had to pull it up. [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1832.36s)]
*  Nostradamus nuclear arms in the middle East, Israel's attacking the Iraqis a [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1834.04s)]
*  little off Syrians are mad at the Lebanese. [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1838.08s)]
*  But then you go into verse two things got hot in El Salvador, El Salvador. [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1840.32s)]
*  How about that? [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1845.56s)]
*  CIA got caught. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1846.28s)]
*  Couldn't do no more of all the sides. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1847.6s)]
*  Um, the, um, the breadth of the attack. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1850.24s)]
*  And, and I guess I just want to caveat on about to say is my operating [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1855.84s)]
*  assumption is about circumcisions, Tim. [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1860.96s)]
*  It isn't my operating assumption about all things Middle East when [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1863.96s)]
*  it comes to Middle Eastern. [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1868.52s)]
*  And you're going to, you might get mad at me about this because it's a little bit. [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1870.2s)]
*  I'm a little bit on the death side of the death of expertise on this. [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1872.72s)]
*  All the Middle East experts have been wrong about everything my whole life. [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1876.4s)]
*  Like everybody, like everybody keeps being wrong. [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1879.96s)]
*  Um, and so, and everybody's very reactive to the last thing. [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1883.12s)]
*  Well, this thing didn't work. [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1887.56s)]
*  So we shouldn't do it anymore. [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1888.76s)]
*  And it's like, uh, you know, and, um, and I, nobody predicted Assad was going [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1889.8799999999999s)]
*  to fall, he fell in two days. [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1893.72s)]
*  We're going to be out of Iraq in two minutes. [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1895.04s)]
*  We're in there for a decade, right? [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1896.76s)]
*  Like you could just go down the list. [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1898.08s)]
*  I've heard like the Obama people will be like, we were right about the [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1899.32s)]
*  Iranian nuclear deal. [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1903.44s)]
*  Well, it turns out that that Iran ended up being emboldened and there's a lot [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1904.76s)]
*  of terror that comes out of it, right? [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1908.76s)]
*  Like, Oh, no matter which side of it you're on, like you've got some X marks, [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1909.84s)]
*  um, as far as the Middle East. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1914.48s)]
*  And so I have a skepticism of all of the experts telling me what's going to happen. [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1916.6399999999999s)]
*  I do not again, disbelieve my lying eyes though. [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1921.8s)]
*  And Israel has, has over the course of the last year executed. [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1925.04s)]
*  Like some of the most effective pinpoint military operations against Hezbollah [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1930.12s)]
*  and Iran, not talking about what's happening in Gaza, but against Hezbollah. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1934.6799999999998s)]
*  And now in Iran that you've seen, and I don't know, maybe like the, the [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1937.36s)]
*  conventional wisdom that, okay, if Israel does this, it's going to lead to some [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1943.1999999999998s)]
*  wider war and Iran's going to escalate. [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1948.56s)]
*  That might turn out to be wrong. [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1950.8799999999999s)]
*  I don't like Iran. [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1952.28s)]
*  They might be successfully incapacitate them. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1953.12s)]
*  And if so good, if so good riddance to, [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1956.36s)]
*  Yeah, but I still think that if the Israelis are going ahead on this, on the, on [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1959.36s)]
*  the pretext, let's not even say pretext on the, um, rationalization, the, you [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1965.1999999999998s)]
*  know, the platform of being a preemptive strike, then they're going to have to [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1970.8s)]
*  come up, they're going to have to show a certain amount of necessity here. [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1974.32s)]
*  Because otherwise it looks like the kind of thing we did with Iraq, which, you [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1979.6799999999998s)]
*  know, really poisoned the well for 25 years of saying, we just don't like this [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1985.28s)]
*  regime and it's got to go. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1989.8s)]
*  And, um, you know, I, I supported that at the time I said, I remember at the time [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1992.6399999999999s)]
*  thinking the world's two day, uh, you know, from nine 11 rogue nuclear weapons, [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=1997.48s)]
*  massive rogue state, you know, a big rogue state in Iraq. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=2002.72s)]
*  Um, I, I sort of was where Tony Blair was and, you know, Bush and a lot of [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=2006.24s)]
*  others saying it's the world's, there, this many dangerous moving pieces. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=2011.24s)]
*  One of them has to go. [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=2015.56s)]
*  Um, now that could be the argument for Iran. [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=2017.56s)]
*  Problem is I also worry about how much this is fused personally to Netanyahu's, [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=2022.08s)]
*  you know, domestic problems. [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=2026.36s)]
*  Um, so, you know, again, there's kind of a trust issue there. [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=2028.28s)]
*  Um, and you, and you're right. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=2031.76s)]
*  It could, you know, this could be the beginning, the beginning of the end of a [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=2033.48s)]
*  lot of strife, uh, in the middle East because the Iranians are the source of so [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=2037.6399999999999s)]
*  much of it. [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=2041.6399999999999s)]
*  The Middle East, you know, with the Syrian regime fell, like they don't really [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=2041.96s)]
*  have a state ally in the, in the region. [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=2045.36s)]
*  Anyway, I don't, you know, TV, we'll see, we'll, we'll continue to cover it more. [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=2048.08s)]
*  I just, I've, well, I guess I'll go back to Trump. [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=2051.12s)]
*  I just want to say, like, say one more thing on this about the effectiveness [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=2054.48s)]
*  while we're talking about it. [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=2057.4s)]
*  It just is also noteworthy to me. [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=2059.56s)]
*  Like my main takeaway from last night is we seem pretty on serious to me right [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=2061.56s)]
*  now, and obviously having a fucking former drunk TV, weekend TV host at the [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=2066.7599999999998s)]
*  head of the secretary of defense is, uh, is your prime example. [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=2071.4s)]
*  It's not just the Trump administration. [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=2075.16s)]
*  I, if you just go back to the last few administrations, uh, Jamie Weinstein [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=2076.7200000000003s)]
*  tweeted this Israel haters will want to frame Israel successes as the product [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=2081.52s)]
*  of American support or, you know, and then he goes on, but when have you seen [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=2085.12s)]
*  us pull off operations as large as successful as the pager op with Hezbollah [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=2089.44s)]
*  and the current Iran strike? [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=2093.16s)]
*  This is remarkable. [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=2094.36s)]

*  Well, I didn't know, but I kind of knew, but what a great thing they did. [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=2186.7200000000003s)]
*  But I'm sorry they did it, but we were going to negotiate, but they did a great, [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=2189.88s)]
*  I mean, it's [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=2193.6s)]

*  He was sitting there last night and Rubio puts out a statement that's like, [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=2196.96s)]
*  we didn't coordinate with this. [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=2200.08s)]
*  And then it goes extremely well. [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=2201.56s)]
*  And this morning Trump's calling reporters. [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=2202.96s)]

*  I mean, you know, my, my colleague, David Graham had this great piece about a [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=2218.4s)]
*  year ago that I keep coming back to, which is that Trump never asked Trump a [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=2222.7200000000003s)]
*  hypothetical because he never says no. [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=2227.6000000000004s)]
*  Right. [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=2231.6800000000003s)]
*  So if you say to him, uh, were we involved possible, we were involved in [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=2232.28s)]
*  this, uh, we possible, we looked at it very strongly. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=2235.96s)]
*  You know, he never, he never says, look, you know, we're in touch with, you [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=2239.5600000000004s)]

*  or as an American citizen, I just want to know what my government knows and [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=2253.72s)]
*  what's going on while, while the, while Israel has launched a major operation [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=2257.6s)]
*  against a country of 70 million, very dangerous people, you know, or I shouldn't [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=2264.08s)]
*  say that of 70 million people led by a very dangerous government leader. [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=2270.3199999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=2273.64s)]

*  And instead you get, uh, you know, well, we, you get, you get, um, you get these [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=2279.2s)]

*  of pulls your, it weakens your confidence that anybody knows what's going on. [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=2310.24s)]
*  And he's gutted the national security council. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=2314.7599999999998s)]
*  Rubio is doing, you know, four jobs. [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=2317.0s)]
*  Um, I, our ambassador to the re to, to Israel is, uh, I mean, you know, [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=2319.44s)]

*  You know, a former governor, but also a guy, you know, hocks supplements. [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=2329.8s)]
*  The guy who is the point man on the post a deal with Iran that we were working on [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=2334.48s)]
*  before the bombing started as an, as a New York real estate man. [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=2337.7200000000003s)]
*  That's also the point man on the Ukraine, Ukraine negotiations, which he's where [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=2341.76s)]
*  he seems to really admire Ukraine, Israel, and it goes to the other stuff. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=2346.0800000000004s)]
*  Like again, like the 700 troops or whatever we have in LA are probably not, [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=2351.28s)]
*  we're not probably going to be needed to be on call in case there's escalating [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=2355.92s)]
*  war in the middle East, but again, like, is this the stuff we should be thinking? [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=2359.72s)]
*  You know, like you have, like when you have a weekend Fox news host running [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=2363.12s)]

*  And, and what we have is a guy that has been, that was at a baseball game in LA. [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=2370.3999999999996s)]

*  to the streets of DC tomorrow. [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=2385.04s)]
*  I think like the unserious of that, the unseriousness of that and the perniciousness [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=2386.9599999999996s)]
*  of what's happening in LA, like split screened with what is happening with [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=2392.12s)]
*  in Tehran, like it's pretty disheartening. [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=2397.8399999999997s)]

*  I'm not used to that. [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=2483.04s)]
*  I mean, I, you know, I came of age when the United States was at the peak of its [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=2483.7999999999997s)]
*  power, uh, from the mid eighties to the, to the, uh, late nineties. [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=2488.92s)]
*  And, uh, you know, and remained powerful ever since, but Nat this past 10 years or [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=2495.44s)]
*  so, um, it really is disturbing. [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=2500.6s)]
*  And I'm going to throw some of the shade on Barack Obama for this as well, because [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=2504.68s)]
*  of what he did in the middle East, that increasingly this retrenchment, this [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=2508.6s)]

*  States doesn't matter. [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=2518.16s)]
*  You know, when I, when I used to teach political science, we would talk about [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=2519.16s)]
*  how do you define power? [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=2522.24s)]
*  And one of the definitions of power is that other people must take you into [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=2523.68s)]
*  their calculations. [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=2526.64s)]

*  out of these calculations because we have an administration again, for the second [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=2535.04s)]

*  Um, do you have, [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=2614.52s)]

*  I mean, it's, I, you know, this, oh no, no, it's about the army. [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=2619.24s)]
*  It's their 215th anniversary. [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=2622.2s)]
*  The army wasn't going to do this. [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=2623.6s)]
*  You know, the army was not going to throw itself a parade, spend $40 million, [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=2626.16s)]
*  wreck the streets of DC that will have to be fixed. [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=2632.16s)]
*  This is Donald Trump. [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=2635.64s)]
*  A lot of what you're seeing in this, in this second Trump term is Trump saying, [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=2638.28s)]
*  they told me I couldn't have these things the first time around. [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=2642.56s)]
*  And now I'm in charge. [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=2645.6s)]
*  Now I'm going to get the stuff I want and I'm getting my parade for my birthday. [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=2646.96s)]
*  Because, because uncle Jim Mattis and mean cousin Mark Esper didn't let me [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=2651.96s)]
*  have it the last time and, um, he's just determined to do that. [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=2657.08s)]
*  And I think in a more nefarious way, I mean, Trump is very childlike in a lot of [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=2662.04s)]
*  ways, but I think there is a, there is a darker thing going on here. [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=2666.4s)]
*  And that is he, he's, he will be happy to have the split screen of patriots, [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=2671.0s)]
*  you know, saluting, going by the stand, uh, rendering colors to the commander [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=2676.8s)]
*  in chief, all that stuff with, uh, a bunch of stupid kids throwing bottles. [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=2681.04s)]
*  At the Marines in Los Angeles. [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=2687.16s)]
*  He lives. [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=2690.36s)]
*  I know there are a lot of people, a lot of liberals, a lot of people on the left [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=2691.96s)]
*  who say that split screen will destroy him. [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=2695.04s)]
*  That will be, he will hate. [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=2697.2s)]
*  No, that split screen is what he's aiming for because it will say to America [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=2698.52s)]
*  patriotism, glory flags, good. [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=2704.3199999999997s)]
*  Donald Trump. [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=2709.16s)]
*  That's what Donald Trump's world is like. [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=2710.3199999999997s)]
*  Alex Padilla and Gavin Newsom and Karen Bass, um, you know, kids in balaclavas [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=2712.64s)]
*  throwing rocks at our, at our, uh, valiant Marines. [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=2718.52s)]
*  He's, he's, I think that's, I think these two things are happening together, uh, [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=2721.76s)]
*  for a reason, because as you keep pointing out to him, there was no actual. [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=2726.6000000000004s)]
*  Triggering event, no forcing function in LA to require the [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=2731.84s)]
*  Marines to go into the streets. [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=2736.36s)]
*  So this is, this was timing that was purely at the white house's discretion. [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=2737.7200000000003s)]
*  I agree with you on the imagery, but like the, it just makes them look so small. [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=2741.88s)]
*  Like it just is such a little baby mushroom deck thing to do. [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=2747.48s)]
*  It's like, we're going to have a military parade. [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=2750.6s)]
*  We didn't do anything. [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=2752.88s)]
*  I don't like in the context of the Israel attack on Iran, it's [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=2754.28s)]
*  like, what are we celebrating? [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=2757.4s)]
*  What did you do? [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=2759.16s)]
*  You've abandoned our friends in Ukraine. [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=2760.2000000000003s)]
*  We, you know, we left Afghanistan. [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=2763.16s)]
*  We haven't won any wars recently. [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=2766.0s)]
*  Like you haven't done anything good to merit a parade or useful or nothing [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=2768.88s)]
*  that is worth worthy of honoring, like of having some sort of celebration. [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=2774.28s)]
*  Like it's just for your ego. [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=2779.44s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=2781.92s)]
*  And I guess maybe people don't see through it, but it's just, it's really, I [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=2782.28s)]
*  just, you could feel it looks even more embarrassing than it would have already [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=2785.6800000000003s)]
*  in the context of such a massive disconnect. [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=2789.32s)]
*  Because to me, having watched Trump, you know, for, I mean, I, I, I [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=2791.6400000000003s)]
*  remember I went to grad school in New York. [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=2797.0400000000004s)]
*  I remember Trump, you know, years ago, but every time I see Trump, especially [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=2798.7200000000003s)]
*  over the past 10 years, everything he does to me projects, he's a bully and [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=2803.48s)]
*  bullies, while they look impressive, you know, as a, as a show, they've, they [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=2808.84s)]
*  always project fear and insecurity and weakness. [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=2813.92s)]
*  And, and I've, the great disconnect in the American perception is I think a lot [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=2819.04s)]
*  of us look at Trump and say, he's afraid. [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=2823.32s)]
*  He's got the, even down to the body, like Joey tightens up the shoulders [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=2825.68s)]
*  and the hands come together. [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=2829.04s)]
*  It's very much a kind of an anxiety thing. [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=2831.0s)]
*  And other people look at him and say, what a man, what a strong guy. [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=2834.36s)]
*  And I just, I'm like, I wrote this piece years ago and I, and I'm pretty sure [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=2837.7200000000003s)]
*  Trump read it because he came out swinging against the Atlantic the next [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=2842.6s)]
*  morning after it ran about how Trump is just the unmanliest president, right? [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=2846.7200000000003s)]
*  Guy wears bling, puts on makeup, watches TV all day, you know, complaints and [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=2851.32s)]
*  bitches and moans and deflects responsibility. [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=2857.6s)]
*  And, and I, I guess I, I'm just stunned at how people sort of, um, remember how [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=2860.96s)]
*  they used to smear Vaseline on the lens and Star Trek to make all the women [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=2869.16s)]
*  beautiful, right? [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=2872.52s)]
*  Carrie Lake is still doing that. [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=2873.44s)]
*  Huh? [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=2874.64s)]
*  Carrie Lake's still doing that. [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=2875.3199999999997s)]
*  And, and I mean, it's just like, like Trump supporters like smear the Vaseline [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=2877.0s)]
*  on the lens, they put the, they put the smoke over the smoke filter over the [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=2881.44s)]
*  lens and they say, wow, this guy who weighs about 239 pounds, uh, you know, [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=2884.92s)]
*  is really manly and tough. [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=2890.96s)]
*  And I think that's just, I think Trump knows to make a more serious point, Trump [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=2892.96s)]
*  knows that, that people buy that image. [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=2897.2400000000002s)]
*  And so he does everything he can to surround himself with the kind of cheap [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=2899.56s)]
*  festoonery of patriotism and that kind of patriotic symbolism, because it [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=2905.2400000000002s)]
*  props up that image to us, to the rest of us. [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=2910.96s)]
*  It looks like, you know, like you keep saying, and a lot of us feel the same way. [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=2913.68s)]
*  You know, it looks like a little boy playing with toys. [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=2917.88s)]
*  I always say he thinks of the army as toy soldiers. [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=2920.44s)]
*  Um, but he does it. [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=2923.4s)]
*  And I think, you know, his opponents have to take him seriously about this. [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=2926.12s)]
*  He doesn't because it works with a certain number of people and not just the [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=2928.96s)]
*  MAGA base, this is a war for public opinion. [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=2933.7200000000003s)]
*  It's a war of images. [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=2936.44s)]
*  You were a political consultant. [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=2937.48s)]
*  You know this better than anybody that, that people don't parse words and spend, [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=2938.64s)]
*  you know, read 1500 words to get through this. [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=2945.4s)]
*  They see those images. [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=2947.7599999999998s)]
*  And for most Americans, the image, you know, Marshall McClellan was right. [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=2948.8799999999997s)]
*  The medium is the message. [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=2953.3599999999997s)]
*  Well, on that point, and you just gotta, I guess you just gotta admit that it [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=2955.2s)]
*  worked, even though again, it was, it just darkened my spirit. [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=2959.4s)]
*  I got a chill down my spine watching the Fort Bragg speech, but we talked about [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=2963.12s)]
*  this with Hurtling on Wednesday, but since that conversation, there's been some [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=2966.84s)]
*  new reporting by folks like military.com and some of the other folks that cover [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=2970.32s)]
*  the military, something that Hurtling said that we suspected it was not [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=2975.7200000000003s)]
*  confirmed that there was a memo that went out that dictated what types of [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=2979.4s)]
*  soldiers could be there. [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=2984.32s)]
*  No fat guys. [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=2985.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=2987.1200000000003s)]
*  No fats, no Dems is how I summarized the memo basically. [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=2987.4s)]
*  And so that went out, which at some ways makes me feel a little bit better, I [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=2992.0s)]
*  guess, because I was a little shook by just the degree of raucousness of the [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=2997.64s)]
*  approval, like the idea that maybe there's some other soldiers that just didn't show [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3002.6s)]
*  makes me feel just only the tiniest bit better, but a little. [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3005.96s)]
*  We also had a reporting this morning ahead of the rally. [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3010.04s)]
*  Army officials raised alarms over the plan for a vendor to sell Trump branded [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3012.28s)]
*  merch on site, including MAGA chain necklaces, a white privilege credit card [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3018.08s)]
*  and other stuff. [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3024.7599999999998s)]
*  They were overruled. [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3025.96s)]
*  That was that they were allowed. [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3027.0s)]
*  Well, and that's the question overruled by whom? [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3028.6s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3033.32s)]
*  But the base commander, I assume Hegseth. [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3033.7599999999998s)]
*  Well, the base commander is a Colonel. [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3036.88s)]
*  And I suppose, you know, if I were the army chief of staff, there's a scary [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3038.6s)]
*  thought, you know, especially I taught all those years for the Navy. [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3046.04s)]
*  So even talking about running the army, you know, it's like just anathema. [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3049.72s)]
*  But someone senior should say, you know what? [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3053.8s)]
*  This thing was a complete shit show. [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3055.8s)]
*  Our our soldiers acted with total unprofessional behavior. [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3058.32s)]
*  We allowed a partisan vendor on the premises, fire the base commander. [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3062.72s)]
*  Now, if Hegseth can countermand that and put him back, and that's when you quit. [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3067.32s)]
*  That then you say, if I can't fire a Colonel who basically allowed somebody in his [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3072.36s)]
*  commit, you know, I don't know that this Colonel allowed it, but it's his base. [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3077.28s)]
*  Everything that happens at Fort Bragg, that's his call. [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3081.28s)]
*  That's his responsibility. [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3084.08s)]
*  And if you can't hold accountable that guy or who maybe there needs to be, you [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3086.2000000000003s)]
*  know, somebody below him, somebody should be fired for this because that it it [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3093.08s)]
*  it broke tradition and it probably broke the law. [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3100.04s)]
*  And it certainly contravened army regulations. [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3103.0s)]
*  And, you know, having worked in the DOD for 25 years where people were always trying [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3106.2799999999997s)]
*  to get me fired over regulations, I'm pretty sure I know what those are. [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3111.08s)]
*  You know, pretty, you know, it's a new thing. [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3115.52s)]
*  I've seen some people on Twitter trying to get you fired as well. [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3118.3199999999997s)]
*  It's not regularly been there, done that. [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3121.72s)]
*  Oh, yeah. So let me ask you about the culture. [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3124.84s)]
*  My point is, if Hegseth overrules them, that's the moment you say, if I'm not in [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3126.7599999999998s)]
*  charge, if I'm an army officer who's not in charge of my subordinates, then I guess [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3130.8799999999997s)]
*  it's time to go. [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3135.0s)]
*  Yeah. So then let me ask about why that isn't happening, because you were you and I [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3136.2799999999997s)]
*  asked hurtling about this. [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3139.64s)]
*  I forget if it was an article or on social media you posted about, like, where are [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3140.7999999999997s)]
*  the generals? It wasn't an article for the Atlantic. [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3143.48s)]
*  It was an article for why are more people speaking out? [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3144.9199999999996s)]
*  And, you know, hurtling, who's very good and clear eyed about, you know, his values [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3147.8799999999997s)]
*  and what the military culture should look like. [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3154.64s)]
*  And unlike a lot of other retired officers is speaking out publicly. [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3156.64s)]
*  Yeah, he is. [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3160.0s)]
*  And but even you can sense with him, like there is something about the military [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3162.0s)]
*  culture that is different, right? [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3167.96s)]
*  Like where he is like he's at certain times carefully choosing his words. [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3169.8399999999997s)]
*  And I think it's very easy to see what he thinks. [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3174.12s)]
*  And like, you know, by listening to him. [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3177.16s)]
*  And I'm grateful that he came on that he's speaking out. [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3179.16s)]
*  But so many others aren't talking at all. [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3181.64s)]
*  Right. Like you hear nothing from that. [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3183.84s)]
*  Us. You hear nothing from any of these people, Kelly. [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3185.48s)]
*  What am I missing? Like, why? [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3189.88s)]
*  Look, I'm a soft handed, you know, sedentary civilian. [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3191.6800000000003s)]
*  So but my spending between the teaching I did and other stuff, I spent about 30 years [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3197.88s)]
*  working with the professional military. [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3206.0s)]
*  And one of the things that I admire about them, aside from their patriotism and [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3208.1600000000003s)]
*  their love of country and their service to America, from the very beginning. [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3213.76s)]
*  Like when they become senior noncoms, you know, sergeants, chiefs or lieutenants, [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3221.28s)]
*  captains, majors, one of the things that has drilled into them is the lives of [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3226.6800000000003s)]
*  these men and women under you are your responsibility. [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3231.4s)]
*  You are responsible for the literally for the life and death of people who are [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3236.36s)]
*  following you. And you have to maintain that unit cohesion. [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3240.92s)]
*  You have to maintain that authority. [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3245.96s)]
*  You have to you have to know that when you all go somewhere, you go together and [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3247.88s)]
*  you're going to offer your lives up for each other. [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3251.7200000000003s)]
*  And so they it's not part of the military culture. [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3254.6s)]
*  And I say this as an outside observer and I say it admiringly, it's not part of the [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3258.12s)]
*  military culture to say, hey, we got to deploy to L.A. [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3261.92s)]
*  Who's pissed? Who doesn't want to fucking do this? [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3265.96s)]
*  You know, no, but that's not I it's been driving me crazy watching people on social [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3270.08s)]
*  media. These Marines just say they're not going to go. [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3275.84s)]
*  No, it doesn't work that way. [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3278.68s)]
*  In part, not just because you're getting orders from your superiors, but because [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3280.64s)]
*  these are all your friends and comrades in arms, they're going to get deployed. [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3284.44s)]
*  You're going to say, well, good luck, Bill. [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3288.04s)]
*  Screw you. I'm not going with you. [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3290.2400000000002s)]
*  I'll let you go. You support those folks. [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3291.56s)]
*  And I think when you get to very senior levels, kind of like kind of job, you know, [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3294.84s)]
*  Mark Hurling had. You're worried that that you don't want to start pushing over [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3299.12s)]
*  dominoes that that then fall and disrupt the chain of command and that kind of [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3304.84s)]
*  cohesion. I'm not speaking for Mark, by the way, and I know him and I admire him [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3311.2799999999997s)]
*  greatly, but I'm not speaking on his behalf here. [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3315.16s)]
*  And so the part of that culture is. [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3318.72s)]
*  That and also at very senior ranks to say, how do I defend the [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3322.68s)]
*  apolitical tradition, George Washington's tradition of the army by speaking up and [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3328.44s)]
*  becoming political? Right. [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3334.96s)]
*  They feel mousetrapped by that. [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3337.56s)]
*  It's like if you if you say, I'm going to stand up and defend the traditions of the [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3339.28s)]
*  army by criticizing the commander in chief, their answer, I think for a lot of [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3344.08s)]
*  those guys would be to say, at which point I have become part of the problem. [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3349.16s)]
*  Now, my answer to that, and I have spoken with many of them, you know, off the record, [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3353.2s)]
*  you know, just to have called and or contacted me, express their concerns. [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3359.76s)]
*  My answer is these are this is an extraordinary moment. [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3364.64s)]
*  I said I was on I was on. [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3368.56s)]
*  Nicole Wallace's show the other day, and I and I I sort of kind of on very emotionally, I [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3372.88s)]
*  said, if there was a time to speak out, this is it. [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3378.52s)]
*  This is it's now this is this is now because I have never seen and I've been to a lot of [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3383.12s)]
*  military events in my career. [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3389.4s)]
*  I have never seen a bunch of young enlisted people standing behind a president hooting [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3391.88s)]
*  and yucking it up and imitating his dance moves and, you know, jeering the governor of [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3398.12s)]
*  California. This is out of control. [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3404.44s)]
*  I mean, this is really this is this is really dangerous stuff. [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3406.48s)]
*  It's obscene. It's an offense to the greatest traditions of the American civil military [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3410.7200000000003s)]
*  relationship. And I think, you know, I understand the reticence of all those generals and [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3416.44s)]
*  admirals who say if I speak up, I'm part I become part of the political issue. [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3420.6s)]
*  But there is a time to I think there's a time to speak up to say, look, I don't care what [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3427.2000000000003s)]
*  Donald Trump's politics are. [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3431.7200000000003s)]
*  I care that he allowed orders to be issued to put partisans behind him. [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3433.1600000000003s)]
*  And I would object to any president doing that because, you know, I'm a general, I'm an [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3437.8799999999997s)]
*  admiral, I've had to lead these people. [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3443.24s)]
*  And I think it's just I think it's just time. [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3445.4399999999996s)]
*  But there that reticence you're seeing, Tim, it comes from a place of principle. [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3448.12s)]
*  Now, I'll just finish by saying because, you know, this is all too much happy talk and [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3454.4399999999996s)]
*  you and I are usually much darker. [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3458.9199999999996s)]
*  There's also just a lot of rank, careerism and cowardice taking over some of these folks. [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3460.72s)]
*  And that's just well, yeah. [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3466.88s)]
*  And I to your point, which was really well stated there at the end of just about how [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3468.48s)]
*  this is an extraordinary moment. [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3472.32s)]
*  It's how I also you know, that that's more in your wheelhouse. [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3474.04s)]
*  Right. Like I feel a little bit more reticent to be like generals should speak out right [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3476.6s)]
*  now, because I don't I just I it's hard for me to understand all their considerations [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3480.64s)]
*  and all that. It was disgusting. [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3485.52s)]
*  I guess just as an American, I like the notion that what the American military should be [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3487.08s)]
*  and the fact that they serve the country and are here to protect the fake news that they [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3491.24s)]
*  were booing and jeering and to protect the people of California, that they were jeering [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3497.24s)]
*  their elected officials like that feels wrong. [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3501.8399999999997s)]
*  But it's wrong and it's against army regulations. [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3504.72s)]
*  Yeah, it does feel wrong. [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3507.3999999999996s)]
*  And it does feel like the type of thing that you'd speak out against. [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3508.7599999999998s)]
*  And that's just circling back to the top. [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3511.12s)]
*  That's how I felt about the Pidea thing. [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3513.7599999999998s)]
*  Right. Like it's at some point there's times where it would feel gauche and silly for [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3515.52s)]
*  a senator to just interrupt a press conference and do that. [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3520.72s)]
*  But I don't know, man, if the Department of Homeland Security is sending masked [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3525.0s)]
*  agents onto the streets of your city and they're and they're hassling your constituents [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3529.9199999999996s)]
*  and they're they're doing it extra judicially and they're doing it in a manner that is [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3535.3999999999996s)]
*  against the Constitution and they're bullying and you are their representative. [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3541.2799999999997s)]
*  Sometimes this is just a moment where it calls for this. [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3545.04s)]
*  You got to stand up and say no. [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3547.8399999999997s)]
*  You know, and I'm glad on this going back to the Pidea thing. [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3549.28s)]
*  You know, I've been I've been pretty hard over about saying don't go out there and [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3553.2400000000002s)]
*  get into a pissing match with the National Guard. [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3557.0s)]
*  On the other hand, Alex Pidea. [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3560.0400000000004s)]
*  Standing in front of Kristi Noem saying I want answers as the as the senator from [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3563.8s)]
*  California. Absolutely. [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3567.44s)]
*  That's exactly what should be happening. [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3570.2400000000002s)]
*  There should be a lot more politicians there and in Washington saying, no, it's not [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3571.8s)]
*  business as usual. We're not just going to keep going on here. [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3576.44s)]
*  Interestingly enough, yesterday, district courts said Trump has to return control [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3579.68s)]
*  the guard back to the governor. [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3586.28s)]
*  And that was stayed until I think it was stayed. [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3589.2000000000003s)]
*  There's a night night ruling that they're going to look at on Monday, I guess. [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3591.7200000000003s)]
*  Well, there's until until we know if the president is actually going to obey the order [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3595.64s)]
*  of a court to return control of the guard. [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3601.12s)]
*  There are a few issues in American politics more important than that right now. [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3603.9199999999996s)]
*  And everybody should be focused on that. [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3608.48s)]
*  And I'm by everybody. I mean, elected officials should be focusing every, you know, [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3610.2s)]
*  every chance you get to say, I want to know if the president's going to follow the [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3613.68s)]
*  lawful orders of federal court to return the guard to the jurisdiction of the [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3616.64s)]
*  governor. Real quick, rapid fire. [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3620.7599999999998s)]
*  One one one funny thing and two two things that are off, you know, just into our [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3624.9199999999996s)]
*  musical side of interests with Tom Marco Rubio put out a statement yesterday. [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3631.0s)]
*  Did you see this? Not the one where he said we weren't involved in Israel. [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3636.36s)]
*  He put out a different statement. He put out two pretty shameful statements. [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3638.8s)]
*  Here's this one. I just want to read it to you. [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3641.68s)]
*  We lose you. On behalf of the American people, I want to congratulate the Russian [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3642.96s)]
*  people on Russia Day. [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3649.0s)]
*  The United States remains committed to supporting the Russian people as they [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3651.52s)]
*  continue to build on their aspirations for a brighter future. [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3655.32s)]
*  We also take this opportunity to reaffirm the United States' desire for [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3658.64s)]
*  constructive engagement with the Russian Federation to bring about a durable peace [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3661.16s)]
*  between Russia and Ukraine. [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3665.7200000000003s)]
*  It's our hope that peace will foster more mutually beneficial relations between our [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3667.2000000000003s)]
*  countries. I swore I thought that was fake. [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3670.8s)]
*  I thought it was fake. [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3673.76s)]
*  And I went to the State Department website to make sure for people that don't know. [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3675.08s)]
*  June 14th is like Russia Day. [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3681.2000000000003s)]
*  It's a new holiday, post-Soviet holiday. [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3684.32s)]
*  And normally that's exactly. [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3687.28s)]
*  Again, this is the Secretary of State. [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3690.2000000000003s)]
*  If Russia had a non neo-fascist government, that's exactly the thing you should send. [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3692.1200000000003s)]
*  Sure. But not today. [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3698.28s)]
*  You know, they were kidnapping our allies' children and bombing indiscriminately [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3700.0s)]
*  cities. Somebody standing next to Rubio should have handed him the piece of paper [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3704.8s)]
*  that says do not congratulate. [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3708.88s)]
*  Yes. [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3711.12s)]
*  But it just shows you, first of all, it shows you that. [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3713.16s)]
*  Unlike the first Trump term, they've managed to wipe out a lot of the competent [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3718.2799999999997s)]
*  staff. This is a classic kind of staffing error. [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3723.12s)]
*  Yes. [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3726.7999999999997s)]
*  Marco Rubio. [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3727.24s)]
*  And remember, Rubio is supposed to be the best of the cabinet nominees, cabinet [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3728.3199999999997s)]
*  appointments. Marco Rubio has probably not spent a lot of time sitting around [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3732.7999999999997s)]
*  thinking, you know, what should I write on Russia Day on June 14th? [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3737.24s)]
*  You know, this is somebody, some staffer. [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3741.04s)]
*  This problem got staffed out and it's like, doesn't anybody at Foggy Bottom know [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3743.72s)]
*  what they're doing? [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3750.08s)]
*  No. [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3751.2799999999997s)]
*  Was there not one person in the room to say, maybe not today, sir. [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3751.6s)]
*  Maybe this isn't the year to congratulate someone. [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3757.8799999999997s)]
*  This isn't the year. [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3759.08s)]
*  We can send a, you know, you could send a message that says we [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3760.64s)]
*  congratulate the Russian people on Russia Day. [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3765.7599999999998s)]
*  We look forward to them returning to, you know, the fraternity of democracies or [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3768.72s)]
*  something, but instead as if nothing's happened. [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3773.7599999999998s)]
*  You know, it's just remarkable. [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3779.2s)]
*  It's not remarkable. [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3783.2s)]
*  It's shameful. [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3784.04s)]
*  It's shameful. [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3784.64s)]
*  It's shameful. [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3785.7999999999997s)]
*  There you go. [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3786.16s)]
*  All right. [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3787.2799999999997s)]
*  Into musicals. [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3787.56s)]
*  I'm sorry to correct. [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3788.3199999999997s)]
*  I hope you're going to use the envoy as your outro music today. [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3789.72s)]
*  I might. [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3792.56s)]
*  Well, I had a different idea. [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3793.16s)]
*  We'll talk about it. [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3794.04s)]
*  Maybe the envoy. [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3794.72s)]
*  We'll see. [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3795.3599999999997s)]
*  Who knows? [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3796.16s)]
*  Maybe we'll have two musics today. [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3796.52s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3798.2s)]
*  Maybe we'll have it. [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3798.56s)]
*  Could you do it? [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3799.04s)]
*  Was there a spot for a intermission? [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3799.8s)]
*  We'll have to think about that. [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3802.12s)]
*  Andrew Wiseman yesterday. [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3803.48s)]
*  I hate to correct guests, you know, when they're not here to get corrected. [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3805.12s)]
*  And so I listened with love and appreciation, Andrew Rice. [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3809.32s)]
*  When I have to correct him, I received so many messages about this. [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3812.16s)]
*  He was wrong about the plot of Les Mis saying it was happening during the French [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3814.68s)]
*  revolution. [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3819.72s)]
*  It was happening. [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3820.28s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3820.88s)]
*  As I mentioned on yesterday's podcast, I don't do musicals. [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3822.32s)]
*  I don't do musical theater. [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3825.44s)]
*  I couldn't have named a character in Les Mis. [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3826.32s)]
*  I couldn't have told you what country it happened in. [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3827.96s)]
*  I know nothing about it. [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3829.76s)]
*  And so in this case, I was unable to correct him live. [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3831.2400000000002s)]
*  And I just wanted to let say that. [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3835.32s)]
*  So I guess I'm sure you have some expertise on this. [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3837.52s)]
*  Les Mis takes place during some other French conflict. [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3839.96s)]
*  I have not seen. [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3842.0s)]
*  I believe I know that it does not take place during the French revolution, but I [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3843.44s)]
*  have never seen Les Mis. [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3849.76s)]
*  Okay. [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3851.56s)]
*  And I, by the way, unlike you, this is a weird thing, Tim. [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3852.0800000000004s)]
*  I'm very into musical theater. [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3856.56s)]
*  I know. [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3858.0s)]
*  I'm totally a Broadway guy. [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3858.48s)]
*  That's a weird gap for you. [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3859.76s)]
*  And so here's this last one. [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3861.2400000000002s)]
*  I don't know if you're going to agree with me on this or I suspect you'll shame me, [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3862.84s)]
*  but Brian Wilson died. [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3866.48s)]
*  RIP. [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3867.76s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3868.1600000000003s)]
*  Okay. [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3868.76s)]
*  I'm just going to whisper it. [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3870.84s)]
*  I hate the Beach Boys. [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3872.8s)]
*  I hate the Beach Boys. [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3874.32s)]
*  And I went through a phase. [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEjVGwkXVgY&t=3876.0s)]
