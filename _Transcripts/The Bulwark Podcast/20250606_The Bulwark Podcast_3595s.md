Video Description: Elon went nuclear, accusing Trump of being a pedo, taking credit for his election victory, and calling for his impeachment. Trump in return may try to destroy Musk's businesses, or worse. While the public feud is entertaining—Thursday was one of the best days for Twitter and Steve Bannon—their meltdown is also frightening. It shows that we are at the mercy of two emotionally unstable men who can blackmail each other. Of course, Republicans and Fox desperately want the clash to end, because for starters, it could complicate the passage of a tax and spending bill that only Stephen Miller can love. Plus, JD is still a wimp, and Howard Lutnick is still a fool. Sam Stein joins Tim Miller for the weekend pod.

*  Yeah, not to the extent that Elon had it was [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=663.7s)]
*  definitely pouring through my veins. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=665.7s)]
*  I was excited about it. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=667.4s)]
*  And so now the J to breathe, you know, I think [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=668.6s)]
*  that there's some people that are more excited. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=671.8s)]
*  Bill Crystal is a downer this morning. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=673.3s)]
*  He's feeling more like that Trump will come out of [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=674.9s)]
*  this ahead. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=677.1s)]
*  Like what do you what's your bill? [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=677.5s)]
*  Bill convinced me. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=678.8s)]
*  I gotta be honest. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=680.0s)]
*  I mean, Bill definitely convinced me. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=681.6s)]
*  So Bill's take is that once the Trump has I think [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=683.8000000000001s)]
*  this is Bill's word Trump has Elon's balls like [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=688.2s)]
*  in a vice. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=691.6s)]
*  Oh crystal said Trump. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=692.5s)]
*  Yeah, but you can read it in morning shot. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=693.8000000000001s)]
*  Do you not edit? [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=695.6s)]
*  I just I had no I edited it. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=696.2s)]
*  What I edit is I had and he has big balls, but [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=698.9000000000001s)]
*  Bill took that out. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=701.8000000000001s)]
*  So big balls the person big balls person. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=703.7s)]
*  Fuck bill. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=706.1s)]
*  No, but I bills convincing because I think here it [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=707.0s)]
*  means basic like Trump could at any moment just [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=710.5s)]
*  you know what we are going to nationalize Space [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=713.3000000000001s)]
*  Force and by the way, you know, we need to launch [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=715.6s)]
*  an investigation into this because you know, we [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=718.1s)]
*  don't want someone so unstable, you know running [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=720.7s)]
*  these companies who's a government contractor and [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=723.3000000000001s)]
*  like there's plenty of government levers. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=725.2s)]
*  If you're sitting there being like, well, that [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=726.8000000000001s)]
*  would be really abusive of the government for [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=728.3000000000001s)]
*  Trump to do something like that. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=730.3000000000001s)]
*  I beg you to look at what Trump's done. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=731.2s)]
*  So, you know, I think you like my don't know if [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=734.4000000000001s)]
*  you don't rationalize to recognize that he's he's [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=738.3000000000001s)]
*  kind of screwed here and Elon's cards. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=741.1s)]
*  I think he basically played yesterday. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=742.7s)]
*  You are a pedophile anywhere in the FC. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=745.4000000000001s)]
*  He threw like the hey, I don't know. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=747.6s)]
*  Does he have a bigger haymaker than that? [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=749.2s)]
*  We don't know. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=752.8000000000001s)]
*  He's got some pics. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=755.7s)]
*  I mean, we don't vote is the black guy. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=756.6s)]
*  Maybe Trump punched him. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=758.2s)]
*  You know, who knows? [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=760.4000000000001s)]
*  I think there's a lot of stuff behind the scenes. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=761.2s)]
*  We don't know exactly what he could have and he's [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=762.5s)]
*  in sleeping at Mar-a-Lago in the White House. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=763.9000000000001s)]
*  That's so I don't know. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=766.2s)]
*  He might have insight on Trump's private behavior [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=767.2s)]
*  that other people don't have. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=769.6s)]
*  So I think he could have more cards. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=770.7s)]
*  I want to it's a compelling case that I think Trump [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=772.6s)]
*  certainly is going to win the Elon fight in the [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=775.8000000000001s)]
*  sense of like who ends up with more political [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=778.9s)]
*  power like it's a Trump has a base of support. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=780.6s)]
*  Like just as we were joking earlier the idea that [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=782.8000000000001s)]
*  some rich Silicon Valley guy is going to start a [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=785.0s)]
*  party of moderates. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=787.4s)]
*  It's like we tried that buddy. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=788.4s)]
*  It's called the Innovation Party. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=789.7s)]
*  It's going to be Zuckerberg and Jim Van Dyke. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=791.2s)]
*  Yeah, we've been down the road. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=793.3000000000001s)]
*  Andrew Yang tried it like that. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=794.7s)]
*  So I don't think that's going to work. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=796.9s)]
*  I think that the political base wants the mega [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=798.1s)]
*  culture war stuff. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=799.9s)]
*  But I don't I think that the threats to Trump here [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=801.0s)]
*  are also pretty real. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=804.5s)]
*  And I know that you know, you might want to diminish [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=805.6s)]
*  it. And this is maybe a my critique of your old [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=809.3000000000001s)]
*  pals in the mainstream media is like it's hard. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=812.7s)]
*  It's hard to contextualize this stuff appropriately [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=817.1s)]
*  because it's so crazy. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=819.7s)]
*  And you're just like, how do I cover this? [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=821.1s)]
*  What do I do? [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=822.5s)]
*  But it's like Donald Trump's top advisor and top [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=823.3000000000001s)]
*  donor, the key man that helped him get elected [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=827.8000000000001s)]
*  thinks that he should be impeached and removed from [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=831.9000000000001s)]
*  the presidency. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=834.1s)]
*  Yeah, like that is a massive story. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=834.9000000000001s)]
*  And I do I think it's I'm not saying it's not I [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=837.0s)]
*  know. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=839.4000000000001s)]
*  I know you don't think it is but it's like because [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=839.7s)]
*  of like they benefit from the clownishness of this [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=841.4000000000001s)]
*  right? [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=844.5s)]
*  You know, I mean if this is like let's just imagine [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=844.8000000000001s)]
*  a different a different world. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=846.4000000000001s)]
*  We're like six months into the Biden presidency. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=847.6s)]
*  Who would be the Eli? [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=851.5s)]
*  I'm a good one. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=852.3000000000001s)]
*  No. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=853.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=853.9000000000001s)]
*  Or I was thinking somebody closer advisor Anita [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=854.3000000000001s)]
*  or McDonald and or something. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=856.6s)]
*  Yeah, sure. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=858.1s)]
*  Whoever some Biden advisor says writes writes an [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=858.4s)]
*  op-ed that's like I think that the president should [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=862.8000000000001s)]
*  be impeached and removed. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=865.9s)]
*  He doesn't have his faculties. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=867.1s)]
*  He's been lying to you about his health and like [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=868.4s)]
*  on a pedophiles. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=871.3000000000001s)]
*  It is on a pedophiles playlist. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=872.9s)]
*  Like I do think that the front page story of the [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=875.1s)]
*  post the next day would be Biden's top advisor calls [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=878.3000000000001s)]
*  for impeachment and removal. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=881.8000000000001s)]
*  Yes, and that didn't happen today. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=883.3000000000001s)]
*  Was it on the front page? [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=885.0s)]
*  I mean, there's plenty stories, but you're right. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=886.1s)]
*  It's kind of like a campfire kind of way, right? [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=888.6s)]
*  And so anyway, I think that that and alone is we're [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=891.5s)]
*  so conditioned to the circus with Trump that it's [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=894.1s)]
*  like, oh, well, it's another chapter. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=896.3000000000001s)]
*  But if you object in this, I think I said this [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=898.1s)]
*  online the other day when it was all transpiring [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=900.2s)]
*  was like I'm deeply genuinely like entertained [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=903.2s)]
*  by all this. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=907.2s)]
*  I'm also like really really frightened by it. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=908.8000000000001s)]
*  Like it's incredibly concerning that the that [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=912.1s)]
*  these two men who are incredibly the most powerful [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=915.2s)]
*  two men in the world probably among them really [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=918.2s)]
*  are are so emotionally unstable have so much [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=921.3000000000001s)]
*  potential blackmail over each other are so distracted [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=925.5s)]
*  like again, I like Friedrich Mertz was in the [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=928.7s)]
*  Lincoln bedroom. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=932.3000000000001s)]
*  All this was happening just as a quick aside. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=933.1s)]
*  The Chancellor of Germany did you and we can imagine [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=935.0s)]
*  being this guy and he's back to have some tea. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=937.6s)]
*  Yeah, he's like, yo, I'm trying to like save Ukraine [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=940.5s)]
*  and sounds like hold on. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=942.8000000000001s)]
*  I'm going to threaten the government contracts of [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=944.4s)]
*  space and then it's um and then like we didn't [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=946.5s)]
*  begin the circus things like we're not even going [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=949.5s)]
*  to talk about it. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=951.6s)]
*  But yesterday with Mertz he was like you must have [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=952.2s)]
*  been really upset when the Nazis lost and I was [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=954.8s)]
*  like, holy shit, but like that doesn't register. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=956.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=959.6s)]
*  Anyways, my point is if there's something underneath [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=960.1s)]
*  all the show is some really like obvious sirens [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=962.6s)]
*  about where we are as a society. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=968.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=970.5s)]
*  No, the society isn't a bad place and so is the [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=970.8s)]
*  White House. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=972.4s)]
*  I guess I'm going to so that's just in a vacuum in [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=972.8s)]
*  any other world. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=976.6s)]
*  The idea that your top advisor and say you should [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=977.9s)]
*  be impeached and removed and a pedophile is very [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=979.6s)]
*  bad for you politically. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=981.9s)]
*  Maybe that will help for Trump's. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=983.4s)]
*  Polls are going to go up. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=985.8s)]
*  You know, it's never really happened. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=986.6s)]
*  Karl Rove, I don't believe ever accused George [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=988.1s)]
*  W of being a being a pedo. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=990.1999999999999s)]
*  So, you know, anyway, I think that also the [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=992.5s)]
*  political power, you know, this political fight [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=996.6999999999999s)]
*  between the techno fascists and the MAGA is like [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1000.5s)]
*  it's real. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1004.4s)]
*  There's like a power show. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1005.0s)]
*  Like Trump obviously has more political power in [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1005.8s)]
*  the sense of there are more voters who care about [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1008.5999999999999s)]
*  him, right? [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1010.5s)]
*  Like if he if there was a primary between Trump [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1011.0s)]
*  and Musk, he would win 85 to 15 or 90 to 10. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1012.8s)]
*  But like power in the different sense, like not [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1017.3s)]
*  the direct voter sense, like, you know, obviously [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1021.0999999999999s)]
*  there's a lot of influence in Silicon Valley. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1024.1s)]
*  It benefited Trump a lot that he had all of these. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1026.0s)]
*  I know that it gave the Democrats this opportunity [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1029.3999999999999s)]
*  to be like oligarchs or whatever, but also like [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1031.5s)]
*  really helped Trump that the owners of all the [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1033.8999999999999s)]
*  biggest communications platforms were sucking up [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1035.8s)]
*  to him and that these huge donors were the [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1037.8s)]
*  VCs. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1040.3s)]
*  It's a different type of oligarch too. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1040.6s)]
*  It's like these guys represent the future. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1044.0s)]
*  They're innovation oligarchs, not old banker [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1046.3s)]
*  oligarchs. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1049.6s)]
*  So it felt like a little different politically. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1050.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1052.3999999999999s)]
*  And so I think it gave him a lot of some benefits, [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1052.8s)]
*  you know, just direct benefits and like how their [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1055.8999999999999s)]
*  platforms treated him, etc, etc. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1058.1s)]
*  But also like future political opportunity for [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1060.1999999999998s)]
*  Mago, right? [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1062.6s)]
*  This idea that like you could coalesce, you know, [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1063.6s)]
*  the cletuses and the evangelical Christians and [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1066.3999999999999s)]
*  like the traditional Republicans and also add in [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1069.5s)]
*  these kind of non like ideological really like [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1072.5s)]
*  tech bro kind of crowd like that was an important [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1076.5s)]
*  add to the Trump coalition this time for 2016. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1079.3s)]
*  And that definitely feels in threat right now. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1082.6s)]
*  So it's funny that you're just articulating it. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1084.8999999999999s)]
*  Out loud, but it's bringing me back a little bit [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1088.1s)]
*  to what Democratic politics actually used to be, [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1090.8999999999999s)]
*  which is this you have this pretty wide tent. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1093.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1095.6s)]
*  And usually the main players either have to sort [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1096.0s)]
*  of align themselves with the moneyed interest or [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1098.6s)]
*  the populists and that was not always the case [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1100.3s)]
*  necessarily with Republicans, but this is the [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1104.0s)]
*  result of an expanding coalition. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1105.8999999999999s)]
*  And so, you know, Trump's Trump's real talent has [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1108.1s)]
*  been he's managed to bridge the two and I don't [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1111.3999999999999s)]
*  know that might be the ultimate thing here is [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1114.3s)]
*  like it might not be bridgeable anymore because [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1117.4s)]
*  really it's like, you know, you have Steve Bannon [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1120.1000000000001s)]
*  basically telling Trump that he doesn't fag need [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1122.1000000000001s)]
*  to nationalize Space Force and oh by the way, [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1124.0s)]
*  maybe deport Elon Musk like at this point and [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1125.8000000000002s)]
*  then yeah, we're going to get into that. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1128.4s)]
*  So but that that is true and it and it's forcing [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1129.9s)]
*  and may force these the Republican lawmakers to [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1134.2s)]
*  kind of take a side in this fight in a way that [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1136.8000000000002s)]
*  they haven't really had to choose this type of [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1139.3000000000002s)]
*  stuff before a couple other I think top implications [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1141.5s)]
*  of where Musk has a little bit more some power. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1145.5s)]
*  Number one is it I guess is Politico your old [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1149.7s)]
*  pals are reporting that there's gonna be a call [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1151.7s)]
*  today. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1153.4s)]
*  They're gonna try to do a truce. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1153.7s)]
*  Yeah, but that's been kind of debunked has it. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1154.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1156.6s)]
*  So Trump made a couple first of all, this is fun [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1156.9s)]
*  because Trump's like calling every reporter in [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1159.6s)]
*  DC whose phone number he said he's calling today [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1161.2s)]
*  so far just that we know he's called Bob Costa [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1164.2s)]
*  Dana bash Dasha Burns and Jonathan Karl. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1167.7s)]
*  So at least four people they've talked to Trump [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1171.1s)]
*  on your phone on do not disturb you might want [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1172.7s)]
*  to leave it on just in case. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1174.9s)]
*  Misty I know and each and each call is telling [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1177.5s)]
*  every single porter. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1180.9s)]
*  I'm not even thinking about Elon which is like [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1181.9s)]
*  self-refuting. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1185.6000000000001s)]
*  Don't worry. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1188.1000000000001s)]
*  I'm not thinking about just telling you I'm not [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1188.5s)]
*  thinking that I said like we're looking for the [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1189.8000000000002s)]
*  guy don't know did it but he's he's also dismissed [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1192.3000000000002s)]
*  the idea that he's gonna have a phone call with [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1195.4s)]
*  the lens. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1197.1000000000001s)]
*  I don't think there's going to be that today and [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1197.5s)]
*  I also just so generally my guess my point was [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1199.8000000000002s)]
*  even if they did get to a truce I think is possible. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1202.0s)]
*  Who knows that they would try to it's not really [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1204.6s)]
*  sustainable for starter and this I think goes to [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1208.2s)]
*  the Elon psychology. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1211.4s)]
*  Well in I have all there have been kind of two [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1213.4s)]
*  schools of thought on the lot from the start. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1215.0s)]
*  There was one that this was a huge corruption [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1217.2s)]
*  scheme and that he wanted from his AI whatever to [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1220.0s)]
*  gather as much information as possible from the [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1224.0s)]
*  government. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1225.7s)]
*  He wanted to expand Starlink and he was using this [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1226.3s)]
*  to enrich himself and there's maybe some overlap [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1228.9s)]
*  between these theories like that was his core [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1232.8s)]
*  church and then there's another theory which is [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1234.6s)]
*  that his brain has been broken by his own app and [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1237.0s)]
*  like the fact that his you know daughter was trans [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1240.3s)]
*  and then he gets on X and that he is he's doing [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1243.3s)]
*  all these drugs and that his brain is broken and [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1245.7s)]
*  and he is just a rabid poster and he ended up [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1249.0s)]
*  getting radicalized in Maggot and that's why he's [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1251.7s)]
*  doing this. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1253.8s)]
*  He doesn't actually give a fuck about his companies [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1254.2s)]
*  or the money and I was always more in camp to he [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1255.8s)]
*  just to me reads like somebody is completely [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1259.3s)]
*  unstable and has lost his mind and I know some [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1261.9s)]
*  of these people have some of them in my life people [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1265.1000000000001s)]
*  who have gone taking the megapill rather than [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1267.1000000000001s)]
*  somebody who's like really strategically trying [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1269.7s)]
*  to manipulate the government and if that is right [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1273.4s)]
*  if the theory that his brain is broken is right. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1276.4s)]
*  He can't trust because he wants online all day and [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1279.0s)]
*  so something's going to happen that like they can [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1282.7s)]
*  have a short-term truth and something will happen [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1284.8000000000002s)]
*  that we will joke you were joking about this when [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1286.6000000000001s)]
*  he said something about posters posters are going [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1288.3000000000002s)]
*  to post. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1290.2s)]
*  Yeah, he loves a poster. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1290.9s)]
*  He loves going to post and so that's their cases [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1292.2s)]
*  of reformed posters that you know, Nira. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1294.5s)]
*  Nira is the only one I can think of off the top [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1298.7s)]
*  of my head here in tandem. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1300.3s)]
*  She's kind of getting back in the game a little bit [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1301.4s)]
*  real don't know she was center for American [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1304.2s)]
*  progress was an epic kind of Hillary poster Neo [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1305.6000000000001s)]
*  Liv Hillary poster like really really strong game [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1308.9s)]
*  and then went toward for Biden and Schilt. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1312.3s)]
*  So maybe but I don't think I don't I don't believe [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1314.4s)]
*  that that Nira was doing like a ketamine meth [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1316.9s)]
*  snowball. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1319.4s)]
*  And so it makes I don't I think it's it was easier [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1320.6000000000001s)]
*  for her to reform maybe than the one you don't [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1322.8000000000002s)]
*  really know Nira then and so I don't I don't see [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1324.5s)]
*  it and this bill and so this takes me on a second [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1329.1000000000001s)]
*  point, which is that this bill is going to continue [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1331.4s)]
*  going through right and it's got it. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1333.2s)]
*  It's created real political problems. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1335.7s)]
*  So I like does it mean that it will pass? [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1337.1000000000001s)]
*  I don't know but like it's made it much more froth [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1338.9s)]
*  and you don't really think that Elon is like on [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1342.2s)]
*  Twitter 20 hours a day is going to not shitpost [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1344.8000000000002s)]
*  this bill as it continues to go through the process. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1348.5s)]
*  Obviously he's going to keep shitposting it. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1350.7s)]
*  No and there's certain Rubicon's he's cross that [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1352.5s)]
*  you can't uncross like shame on you if you support [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1354.4s)]
*  this film. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1357.4s)]
*  Yeah, call your lawmaker. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1358.0s)]
*  But I was thinking more like once you say this man's [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1360.0s)]
*  on the Epstein list, like I don't think you can put [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1362.6000000000001s)]
*  that genie back in a bottle. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1364.8000000000002s)]
*  I also think the thing and the VP did say Trump [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1366.1000000000001s)]
*  might be Hitler. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1369.3000000000002s)]
*  That's true. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1370.3000000000002s)]
*  It's possible to get the genie back in the bottle [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1371.0s)]
*  is Trump. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1372.6000000000001s)]
*  I think that's true. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1373.0s)]
*  I guess the he did. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1374.0s)]
*  I think that kind of got lost a little bit in this [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1376.2s)]
*  but probably something that will bother Trump is [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1380.2s)]
*  that he claimed credit for Trump winning and Trump [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1381.9s)]
*  does not ever want to hear something like that. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1384.5s)]
*  So, you know, I think Trump will be a grieved at it [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1387.0s)]
*  about that. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1389.8s)]
*  I think ultimately like the effect on the bill is [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1391.3s)]
*  not that it's going to like convince lawmakers to [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1393.8s)]
*  vote against it. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1397.3s)]
*  I think and you know, I talked about this. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1398.1000000000001s)]
*  I think what it does is it creates a bit of space [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1399.5s)]
*  for lawmakers who are already not for it to say, [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1403.8s)]
*  you know what? [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1406.6000000000001s)]
*  I kind of agree that we need to do more and like [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1407.1000000000001s)]
*  maybe we should pump the brakes a little bit and [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1409.7s)]
*  like let's get more deficit reduction here and [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1411.5s)]
*  and then does Elon going so crazy make that actually [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1414.3s)]
*  harder for some of the Republicans? [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1417.4s)]
*  Yes, there's a surely. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1419.5s)]
*  Yeah, if he's like totally out there was like narrow [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1421.7s)]
*  focus on the deficit, maybe the you know, the [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1424.9s)]
*  Freedom Caucus guys might have been like I'm with [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1427.8s)]
*  the line, but it was like Trump is a pedophile should [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1429.4s)]
*  be removed from office. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1431.7s)]
*  Yes, I think that's right. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1433.3s)]
*  I mean, he runs out there like his takes on Trump [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1434.8s)]
*  are now more extreme than any MSNBC primetime. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1438.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1440.8s)]
*  There's nobody on MSNBC primetime who said that Trump [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1441.2s)]
*  should be removed. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1444.8s)]
*  And you said that you might get like Trump might [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1446.0s)]
*  go after the network. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1448.1000000000001s)]
*  It's like, yeah, it would be bad. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1449.1000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, it was it's not something that normal people [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1451.8s)]
*  say. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1454.6000000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1454.9s)]
*  So Republicans, it's hard. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1455.1000000000001s)]
*  It makes it harder for them to be with them. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1456.2s)]
*  But it but but he is still rich and he does still [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1457.5s)]
*  have the capacity to like amplify X in your favor. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1461.1s)]
*  If you so let's say you're just like random Freedom [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1464.6999999999998s)]
*  Caucus member who isn't in love with the bill and [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1467.1s)]
*  you now you can now say, okay, you know what? [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1469.5s)]
*  I agree on the principles that he's talking about [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1471.8s)]
*  and then must starts boosting you and he makes you [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1474.1s)]
*  into a hero. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1476.3999999999999s)]
*  He throws a bunch of money behind you. [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1477.0s)]
*  I'm not saying it's going to happen, but that now [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1479.0s)]
*  that is a component of this legislative debate. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1481.1s)]
*  I think it's also we discussed this a little bit [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1484.0s)]
*  before us all went down with with the glaciers, but [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1485.8s)]
*  yesterday, but he is very focused on how do you [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1487.8s)]
*  raise the salience of this bill because his point [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1490.7s)]
*  is like this is unpopular. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1493.1000000000001s)]
*  So if you get to the Democrats thinking on this [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1494.4s)]
*  like well, that's the taxes for the rich and and [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1496.1000000000001s)]
*  cutting Medicaid is not popular. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1499.4s)]
*  And so does just Elon talking about how awful it [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1501.2s)]
*  is make people who otherwise wouldn't even be [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1503.8s)]
*  paying attention to this like aware of this bill? [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1506.1000000000001s)]
*  Maybe that's helpful or harmful for the bill. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1508.9s)]
*  So the issue for Democrats, I think that with [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1511.0s)]
*  Elon, he doesn't like about this bill is not what [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1513.0s)]
*  they give a shit. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1514.8s)]
*  I mean like they have a say for taxes. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1515.6000000000001s)]
*  Sure. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1517.4s)]
*  But just like he's not even talking about attention [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1517.7s)]
*  to an unpopular thing is maybe you got but if you [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1519.8s)]
*  don't like being like it is just irresponsible for [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1522.0s)]
*  us to cut Medicaid like this, right? [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1524.3999999999999s)]
*  Democrats like hell yeah, it's fine. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1526.1s)]
*  But that's not what he's saying. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1528.0s)]
*  And so it becomes a little bit of a bank shot. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1529.0s)]
*  I think Edgar and rigger in today's morning shots [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1531.1s)]
*  sort of made the case. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1533.3s)]
*  Well, you can make it about like these two, you [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1534.3s)]
*  know, men who are in a dick measuring contest are [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1537.2s)]
*  just basically trying to figure out how to like [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1540.8999999999999s)]
*  really small rule of contest. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1542.8999999999999s)]
*  That's like preschool. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1546.0s)]
*  You can't get regulation size. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1547.8s)]
*  Okay. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1551.4s)]
*  It's a mom and pop. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1553.3s)]
*  Where was I going? [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1556.3s)]

*  their general unpopularity. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1566.1s)]
*  But I don't know. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1568.8s)]
*  I mean Democrats Democrats should be like look he [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1570.4s)]
*  thinks Trump's on the Epstein list investigate and [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1573.3s)]
*  I think the oversight committee is doing that. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1576.0s)]

*  It's three and he line the only guys out there. [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1600.5s)]
*  I guess I'm a little bit I was in your camp yesterday [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1604.2s)]
*  on like this isn't that helpful for Democrats [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1608.0s)]
*  because it's focusing on the dead and deficit rather [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1610.3s)]
*  than the real unpopular stuff. [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1612.1s)]
*  But I don't know man part of this now. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1614.2s)]
*  I just think it trickles out into the world in a [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1616.9s)]
*  way that it wouldn't have otherwise and the like [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1619.6s)]
*  people who do not really care. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1622.1s)]
*  How do they view it? [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1624.4s)]
*  Yeah, they just they start to be like wait a minute. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1625.6s)]
*  Okay. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1628.0s)]
*  So what is this thing that they're fighting about [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1628.1s)]
*  and it's like increases the debt of time and it [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1630.0s)]
*  cuts taxes for rich people and it cuts Medicaid [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1632.0s)]
*  like who's for that? [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1634.1s)]
*  I get like Stephen Miller is really like the only [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1635.2s)]
*  person who seems passionately for this bill [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1637.3s)]
*  I can tell and so I just I think that if you get [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1639.9s)]
*  that out into the ether more I don't know. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1644.2s)]
*  I think maybe it could be an opportunity for the [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1646.6s)]
*  opportunity is to just sow dissent in the Republican [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1648.2s)]
*  ranks, right? [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1652.1s)]
*  It's like, you know, get them get the party's base [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1652.7s)]
*  upset with Trump for abandoning fiscal concernism [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1655.3s)]
*  and you know, if you divide the opposition and [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1659.0s)]
*  that's your benefit. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1661.6s)]
*  I don't think it's like, oh, we're going to like [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1663.0s)]
*  turn people into like staunch defenders and Medicaid [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1665.3s)]
*  because one of the you know, I don't think that's [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1668.1999999999998s)]
*  really what I think it also puts a little bit of a [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1669.8999999999999s)]
*  damper on like Republicans going around talking [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1674.3s)]
*  about how great it is. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1677.3s)]
*  Yes, 100% so that's that's their sales pitch. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1678.1999999999998s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1681.3999999999999s)]
*  So that that's the so division things like if you [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1681.8999999999999s)]
*  have even like 10% 20% the party it's like actually [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1683.8s)]
*  this book kind of sucks. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1686.8999999999999s)]
*  I agree with Elon. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1687.8s)]
*  Yeah, then it becomes more problematic and then [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1688.6s)]
*  you'll start to see in the polls that it you know, [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1691.4s)]
*  the popularity of the bill goes down and then that [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1693.1000000000001s)]
*  creates its own news cycle and you start seeing a [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1695.3000000000002s)]
*  little bit of snowball effect, which is why I [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1697.6000000000001s)]
*  think they're trying to rush this thing through. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1699.4s)]
*  I mean they need they cannot spare any time on [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1701.3000000000002s)]
*  this. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1703.2s)]
*  Okay, a couple side plots. [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1704.7s)]
*  Yeah, journeys. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1706.4s)]
*  Okay, JD Vance the vice president who is who's [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1707.3000000000002s)]
*  the like the human that most represents the kind [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1710.4s)]
*  of concentric the overlapping circles. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1714.0s)]
*  Yeah, between the tech fascists and the he's in [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1716.3000000000002s)]
*  the van die. [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1719.2s)]
*  He's right in the middle of the Venn diagram and [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1719.6s)]
*  so his it's a little bit of a tricky sticky wicked [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1722.6s)]
*  for him politically because he's got to stay with [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1726.3999999999999s)]
*  his patron Trump. [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1729.6999999999998s)]
*  But you know, I mean assuming that there's an [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1731.1999999999998s)]
*  open primary in 2028 and like he's going to want [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1734.8999999999999s)]

*  So how does he play this? [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1741.3s)]
*  He's posted two posts about this one tweet was a [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1742.8999999999999s)]

*  soon as I saw that my heart sank because I was [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1752.5s)]
*  like God this means I have to spend two hours [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1754.3s)]
*  watching JD Vance and Theo Vaughn. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1756.0s)]

*  I'm proud to stand beside him. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1769.0s)]
*  You notice who wasn't mentioned in that. [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1771.5s)]
*  We want no it was kind of limp. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1773.3999999999999s)]

*  I would expect more from my VP. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1788.3s)]
*  He's earned the trust of the movement and I guess [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1789.7s)]
*  what he's trying to say is like people should [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1792.3s)]
*  stick with Trump. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1794.9s)]
*  I guess that's what he's trying to say is like [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1795.8s)]
*  again. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1797.4s)]
*  What is that? [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1798.0s)]
*  I mean that's that's like a very defensive defense [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1798.6s)]
*  of Trump. [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1801.2s)]
*  It's like if you really you should have said Elon's [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1801.6s)]
*  totally wrong. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1804.5s)]
*  Trump is the man and this is bullshit and I'm [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1805.7s)]
*  sad that Elon's having this breakdown. [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1808.4s)]
*  I mean that would be a normal statement. [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1810.2s)]
*  But yeah, I don't know. [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1811.6000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, it also feels like it could be said about [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1814.3000000000002s)]
*  kind of anybody. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1817.0s)]

*  I don't know if it will actually like in the end [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1822.8000000000002s)]
*  what will matter for JD is if this administration [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1825.3000000000002s)]
*  is a total disaster or not and if he can stay [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1828.7s)]
*  in Trump's good graces. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1831.6000000000001s)]

*  are essentially the two things that matter to him. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1837.3999999999999s)]
*  Like I don't think that like at the end of the [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1839.3999999999999s)]
*  day if I expect the next three years to be a [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1841.2s)]
*  total fucking shit show and that people be ready [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1845.3s)]
*  to move on I could be wrong from that. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1847.1s)]
*  I've been wrong before. [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1848.8999999999999s)]
*  We'll see. [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1849.8s)]
*  But let's let's assume it's let's assume it's [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1850.6s)]
*  just normal crazy. [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1852.3999999999999s)]

*  But mega people's lives are materially hurt and [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1881.1s)]
*  Trump sticks with him and Trump steps aside [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1883.6s)]
*  normally and he runs. [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1886.1999999999998s)]

*  You know what I mean? [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1890.5s)]

*  pretty clear. [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1897.7s)]
*  He's got a stick with Daddy Trump and it would [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=1898.1000000000001s)]

*  around dude is on NPR this morning. [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=2320.1s)]
*  He's like doing rubbing his nipples between the [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=2322.6s)]
*  three shirts. [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=2325.7999999999997s)]
*  He's hated Ilan for a long time and so he loves [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=2327.2999999999997s)]
*  us and so he was trying to put on a fourth collared [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=2329.5s)]
*  shirt. [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=2332.2s)]
*  It got so hot. [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=2332.5s)]
*  He was chiming in on how Elon should maybe be [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=2334.3999999999996s)]
*  deported and there's another strange alliance [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=2338.8s)]
*  Congressman Adam Smith of Washington also suggested [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=2342.9s)]
*  he say that a little bit over his skis, but I don't [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=2345.9s)]
*  know. [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=2350.5s)]
*  I do think there is similar. [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=2351.0s)]
*  I feel similar to this as I do about the Epstein [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=2353.2000000000003s)]
*  situation. [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=2355.2000000000003s)]
*  Like it does seem to me to be true that Ilan was [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=2356.0s)]
*  an illegal immigrant in the country and maybe the [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=2359.5s)]
*  HS should look into that in the same way that it [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=2362.3s)]
*  does seem to be true that Donald Trump was involved [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=2364.5s)]
*  in a very deep with Jeffrey Epstein and maybe has [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=2367.9s)]
*  covered up some of his involvement and that should [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=2370.6s)]
*  be looked into. [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=2372.3s)]
*  I kind of think that those are both legitimate that [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=2372.9s)]
*  they're trolls and legitimate. [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=2375.4s)]
*  What do you think? [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=2377.5s)]
*  I mean, do I have to respond? [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=2378.6s)]
*  I think I'm not ready to go down these. [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=2381.6s)]
*  You don't think the DHS Secretary Kristi Noem [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=2386.3s)]
*  should look into Ilan's immigration. [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=2388.7000000000003s)]
*  Okay on a on a from from Missouri or do I think do [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=2390.1s)]
*  I think I would enjoy watching it all transfer? [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=2394.8s)]
*  Yes, I would I would go and get another, you know, [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=2396.7s)]
*  seltzer and some popcorn. [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=2399.2s)]
*  I'd sit back and hit refresh on X. [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=2401.0s)]
*  I think when we have the government like targeting [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=2403.6s)]
*  critics and deporting them, that's a problem. [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=2407.1s)]
*  But you know, maybe I'm like I'm against that. [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=2409.6s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, I'm against the government targeting [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=2412.0s)]
*  critics and deporting them. [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=2414.6s)]
*  Again, I will say though that that they've set a [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=2415.7999999999997s)]
*  policy. [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=2419.0s)]
*  They have what's good for the goose, right? [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=2419.7999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, and their policy is basically like no [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=2422.1s)]
*  exceptions on immigration rules. [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=2425.4s)]
*  Does it apply to people who came here lately but [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=2428.0s)]
*  have since become citizens? [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=2430.1s)]

*  Look, we didn't see it when he was at Doge, but it [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=2442.8s)]

*  What was your best? [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=2480.0s)]

*  then and it was it was a by far it's hard to even [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=2488.4s)]
*  think of a close second. [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=2491.7s)]
*  Honestly, that one was so much better than everything [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=2492.6s)]

*  It's like a guy that when I go to parties in DC like [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=2742.6000000000004s)]

*  NASA administrator job and that was an Elon guy and [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=2758.5s)]
*  he did it because he showed Donald Trump that the [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=2761.8s)]
*  guy had donated to Democrats and Trump didn't like [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=2763.4s)]
*  that. [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=2765.7000000000003s)]

*  He's not a fucking king. [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=2834.5s)]
*  They're having no Kings rallies that day. [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=2836.0s)]
*  People should go June 14th to... [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=2837.2999999999997s)]
*  We got to discuss how we're going to cover it at the [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=2839.1s)]
*  site. [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=2840.9s)]
*  I'm going to be in New Orleans at the protest. [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=2842.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=2844.9s)]
*  Maybe go live. [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=2845.9s)]
*  Yeah, sure. [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=2847.1s)]
*  Nobody's invited me to speak yet. [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=2848.7999999999997s)]
*  But we'll see. [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=2849.9s)]
*  My other side thing I mentioned is before we came [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=2855.4s)]
*  and you're less excited about this than me. [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=2857.6s)]
*  So maybe I'll just do it. [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=2859.0s)]
*  But Trump's did a bleat this morning about how Jerome [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=2859.8s)]
*  Powell should cut rates again, but a very direct call [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=2863.6s)]
*  from the cut rates that Europe's already cut. [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=2867.7s)]
*  We should cut. [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=2869.6s)]
*  We need to it'll be a big boom. [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=2870.2s)]
*  And I just I this is going to a bad place. [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=2872.2s)]
*  And I think that that my my reasoning here is that [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=2875.2s)]
*  yeah, Trump does this stuff a lot. [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=2881.3s)]
*  There's a lot of bluster and all this but he's in a [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=2883.1s)]
*  pickle where with this bill and all the and the [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=2885.6s)]
*  trillions that are going to debt like interest rates [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=2889.5s)]
*  are going to be high his whole presidency. [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=2892.1s)]
*  Like that's just true. [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=2894.4s)]
*  And so I do think that like eventually this is going [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=2896.4s)]
*  to come to a head and like these guys cut rates a [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=2899.4s)]
*  little bit and it probably wouldn't matter that much [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=2902.0s)]
*  actually and that gets into the kind of econ dork [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=2904.1s)]
*  stuff. [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=2906.4s)]
*  But yeah, and that's that's the reason to not cut [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=2906.7999999999997s)]
*  rates is you want an area in the quiver, right? [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=2908.9s)]
*  Right when you're going to need it. [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=2910.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=2911.9s)]
*  And so I just think that like the whole and when you [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=2912.6s)]
*  listen to like a buddy Joe Weisenthal and I bought [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=2915.7000000000003s)]
*  like all these econ dorks like the worst case [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=2918.3s)]
*  scenario essentially is like Trump getting rid of [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=2920.3s)]
*  Powell just you know, because of how that would [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=2923.0s)]
*  roiled the markets and what the downstream effects [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=2925.8s)]
*  would be and I just like that feels to me like a [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=2928.3s)]
*  little more likely today than yesterday. [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=2931.1s)]
*  I guess it's all I'm saying. [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=2933.0s)]
*  I am. [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=2933.9s)]
*  Yes, maybe. [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=2934.6s)]
*  I mean, he's always been deeply frustrated with [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=2935.7000000000003s)]
*  Powell and he makes it publicly known. [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=2938.0s)]
*  There was a recent Supreme Court case that seemed [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=2940.8s)]
*  to suggest that they would stand up the independence [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=2943.1s)]
*  of the Fed, but you don't know until you don't know [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=2945.4s)]
*  right and like who knows what Trump's capable of [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=2947.7s)]
*  if he gets mad if the economy goes south. [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=2950.9s)]
*  I think that's what you know, this is we don't [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=2952.8s)]
*  appreciate this part enough and this is what I [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=2955.8s)]
*  think, you know, even with all the must drama. [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=2957.9s)]
*  It's like this is the shit that's happening when [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=2959.9s)]
*  things are relatively stable. [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=2962.1s)]
*  Right. [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=2963.8s)]
*  That's the scary part for me is like things are not [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=2964.2s)]
*  bad. [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=2967.5s)]
*  I mean if they are bad, it's because Trump made [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=2968.1s)]
*  them bad himself. [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=2970.3s)]
*  So it's not like but when things do get bad and [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=2971.0s)]
*  they get bad in every presidency really external [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=2973.2000000000003s)]
*  force, correct news, you know, like the Russian [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=2976.2000000000003s)]
*  invasion, like some stuff having all that stuff [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=2979.3s)]
*  predated and I'll create him all the Liberation [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=2981.2000000000003s)]
*  Day stuff was of his own making and then he backed [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=2983.9s)]
*  off of it. [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=2985.8s)]
*  Right. [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=2986.2000000000003s)]
*  But when things do get bad and they will because [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=2987.0s)]
*  it oh, that's just how it works. [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=2988.9s)]
*  Like then we don't really know what Trump is [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=2990.8s)]
*  going to do and what he's capable of. [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=2994.3s)]
*  And so while it seems incredibly dramatic and off [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=2995.9s)]
*  the rails right now and it is I'm like a little [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=2998.9s)]
*  bit anxious a little bit really anxious for what [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=3003.6s)]
*  happens when it when the external stuff because [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=3006.2000000000003s)]
*  things are more rickety like obviously COVID [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=3009.1s)]
*  and all that was really bad. [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=3011.4s)]
*  But like when COVID hit and like that was, you [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=3012.4s)]
*  know, the big crisis of his first term. [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=3014.8s)]
*  Things are pretty good. [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=3017.2000000000003s)]
*  I like the Trump part the drama the craziness his [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=3018.4s)]
*  behavior. [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=3021.1s)]
*  I did get impeached before COVID but that was [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=3021.5s)]
*  something like geopolitically and economically [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=3023.9s)]
*  is really sure. [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=3026.0s)]
*  Like there were not like, you know, huge disruptions [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=3026.8s)]
*  overseas or had been a terrorist attack economically. [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=3030.8s)]
*  We were pretty stable here, right? [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=3033.1s)]
*  Yeah, like things are much more rickety now than [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=3034.3s)]
*  that. [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=3037.1s)]
*  I guess is my point just like the US economy is way [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=3037.3s)]
*  more rickety than was in 2019 the global environment [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=3040.1s)]
*  like there are a lot more hot spots a lot more [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=3044.3s)]
*  bullshit happening than there was back then. [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=3046.3s)]
*  So anyway, I'm with you. [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=3049.0s)]
*  All right. [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=3050.3s)]

*  But like then I step back and I'm like living [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=3465.7s)]
*  through something really dark. [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=3468.0s)]
*  Yeah, I want to let's close with that because [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=3469.7s)]

*  So I get older. [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=3481.9s)]
*  I'm getting soft. [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=3483.0s)]
*  And yesterday Jiminy was cricket in my ear. [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=3485.2s)]
*  He's like you shouldn't enjoy this as much. [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=3489.7999999999997s)]
*  Like things are still really bad. [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=3492.5s)]

*  And that's fine. [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TNfIN17Ks&t=3519.9s)]
