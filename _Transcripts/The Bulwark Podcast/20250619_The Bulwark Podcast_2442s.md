Video Description: It’s a reunion! Tim Miller sits down with Mark McKinnon, host of “The Circus.” Because half the country so desperately wanted Trump back, we may now be on the verge of attacking Iran because the fake peacenik president wants some credit for Israel's military accomplishments against Tehran. Meanwhile, decent, hard-working people are being swept up by his anti-American deportation policy, consumers—and home buyers— are continuing to pay for his boondoggle tariffs project, and even Republicans are getting nervous about his big, ugly bill.

# “It’s Going to End Catastrophically” Trump’s Second Term is ALREADY a Disaster (w/ Mark McKinnon)
**The Bulwark Podcast:** [June 19, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s)
*  Have you caught the Tucker and Ted interview? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=0.0s)]
*  I've played it maybe a hundred times. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=2.88s)]
*  I have it on a loop. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=6.16s)]
*  It's better than catch, man. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=7.2s)]
*  It's better than catch. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=8.64s)]
*  Hello and welcome to the Bulldog Podcast. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=17.6s)]
*  I'm your host, Tim Miller. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=19.2s)]
*  Happy Juneteenth. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=20.56s)]
*  And for all the wokes out there, the DEIs, the women in the audience, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=21.76s)]
*  I just want to say I'm well aware it's been a sausage [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=25.76s)]
*  fast around here lately. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=29.2s)]
*  I've been trying my best to get a mix of viewpoints, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=30.72s)]
*  but sometimes the schedules just don't work out. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=33.76s)]
*  We had a cancellation late last night. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=35.519999999999996s)]
*  I got out my binder full of women guests to find somebody good. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=37.92s)]
*  And it was late night. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=42.16s)]
*  And so I had to go to my, I had to just call my comfort food [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=43.44s)]
*  and emergency backup. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=46.0s)]
*  The parade of dicks will continue. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=47.68s)]
*  But the good news is I found somebody who's in touch with this feminine side. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=49.120000000000005s)]
*  He was a media advisor. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=53.120000000000005s)]
*  Thelma Louise. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=55.92s)]
*  We called each other Thelma Louise. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=57.04s)]
*  It's close enough. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=58.64s)]
*  He was a media advisor for W. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=59.44s)]
*  McKinnon and Richard's. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=61.36s)]
*  He was the co-creator, co-host of the circus. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=62.4s)]
*  It's Mark McKinnon. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=64.32s)]
*  Hey, I'm Kat. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=65.2s)]
*  How you doing, man? [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=65.76s)]
*  Hello, my friend. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=66.48s)]
*  Good to see you. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=67.28s)]
*  Thank you for doing this. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=68.16s)]
*  It's been too long. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=69.2s)]
*  I want to talk about the news with you, but I've just, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=70.4s)]
*  I kind of want to just pick your brain first, like biggest picture. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=73.12s)]
*  So it was just about whatever, five months ago that we had the inauguration. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=76.16s)]
*  Like, what have you made of it? [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=82.0s)]
*  Well, it's met my worst expectations on every level. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=84.56s)]
*  And I mean, it just, I mean, the greatest fear was that, you know, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=88.56s)]
*  Trump would truly be unleashed. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=92.24000000000001s)]
*  You know, it was bad enough round one, V1, V2, as just, you know, Trump on steroids [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=96.4s)]
*  without any kind of oversight or anybody around him, any real adults in the room. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=102.32000000000001s)]
*  My view is just that I'm not sure how or when it's going to end catastrophically, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=107.92s)]
*  but it's going to end catastrophically. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=113.52000000000001s)]
*  And the only question is how bad is it and can we recover from it? [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=115.04s)]
*  I don't know if that's going to be because we bomb Iran or if it's because of the tariff [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=120.0s)]
*  economic policy, but it's going to go south. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=126.4s)]
*  I mean, you just can't have somebody this disconnected from reality and adult [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=129.44s)]
*  supervision and, you know, American presidency in the year 2025 and expect [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=136.8s)]
*  that things are going to be okay. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=141.12s)]
*  They're not. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=142.0s)]
*  You don't think there's adult supervision at the Pentagon? [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=143.04s)]
*  You're not, you're not feeling comfortable with a weekly talk show co-host running [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=145.20000000000002s)]
*  the military at this moment? [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=149.76000000000002s)]
*  Well, you know, I just was reading about this guy named General Eric Corilla, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=151.52s)]
*  who's the US sent commander, central command. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=157.12s)]
*  Apparently he's kind of like in charge now and the head says kind of deferring to him [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=160.96s)]
*  and people actually think he knows what he's doing. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=165.04000000000002s)]
*  They call him the gorilla. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=167.20000000000002s)]
*  I was encouraging until I got to the nickname. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=169.84s)]
*  Yeah, that's the problem. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=172.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=174.32s)]
*  Where, what are his instincts going to be? [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=174.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=176.08s)]
*  What is, yeah. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=177.28s)]
*  I mean, you said that like, it's going to end badly. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=178.96s)]
*  I agree with that. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=180.96s)]
*  I guess there's really, you know, there's a range though. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=181.6s)]
*  Right. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=184.8s)]
*  And you're, you're more of a level headed than me. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=185.36s)]
*  You're always a little calmer. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=188.32s)]
*  When we were, when we were riding around covering the stuff for the circus. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=190.96s)]
*  And so I'm just, I'm hoping maybe you can call me or maybe not. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=194.56s)]
*  Maybe it'll make me more worried. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=197.76s)]
*  Like, what is like, how's your level of alarm at this moment? [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=198.96s)]
*  I'm an eternal prisoner of hope, as you know. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=201.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=204.88000000000002s)]
*  But well, listen, I, I think it's going to be really bad. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=206.48000000000002s)]
*  I think we will recover. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=211.36s)]
*  I think it may take years or decades. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=212.72s)]
*  But in a macro, I'm at peace with it in a macro sense, because I think that [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=217.76000000000002s)]
*  for the long term equanimity of most American voters in America, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=224.4s)]
*  this had to happen. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=230.88s)]
*  And let me, let me explain that for the, for the long arc of the story, because I think that [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=232.96s)]
*  in order for at least half the country to come to terms with the wreckage, [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=241.2s)]
*  they had to see the wreckage. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=247.76s)]
*  They had to experience the wreckage. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=248.8s)]
*  And if, if Harris were president, no matter how things went, as we know, things went, [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=251.04s)]
*  they weren't that bad under Biden, but they were, [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=256.08s)]
*  they were certain that it was apocalyptic. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=258.96000000000004s)]
*  Imagine what it'd be like under Harris. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=261.04s)]
*  So no matter what she would have done, half the country would have hated her. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=262.64000000000004s)]
*  Half the country would have said, you know, we're going to hell. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=266.08000000000004s)]
*  The only way that that half of the country is ever going to reconcile [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=268.56s)]
*  the decisions that they made by voting for this guy is to realize [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=272.96000000000004s)]
*  the damage that he does to their own lives, which I, which again, I think is, is, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=276.40000000000003s)]
*  is inevitable. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=280.48s)]
*  So we're going to have to get through that. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=281.92s)]
*  But I think ultimately that's going to bring most of the country back together to recognize, [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=283.12s)]
*  you know, we do need to, you know, the government's here for a purpose and the, [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=287.76s)]
*  you know, it's not the enemy. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=292.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=293.44s)]
*  I thought you were going to go a different place with that. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=294.48s)]
*  You said equanimity because the one thing I think is true about the culture, [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=295.92s)]
*  everybody is it, is it David French? [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=302.16s)]
*  She says that somebody has a good observation about how everybody feels like they're losing. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=304.24s)]
*  Everybody feels like their own side is losing. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=307.44s)]
*  Right. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=309.52s)]
*  And, and I understand why that is because in different across different vectors, [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=310.16s)]
*  both sides have been losing depending on how you look at it. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=316.08s)]
*  And, but like, but if you just look at it from like a cultural arc standpoint, [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=318.88s)]
*  like I think conservatives, right wingers, I do, I feel I think correctly that they're [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=325.76s)]
*  getting their ass handed to them. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=333.35999999999996s)]
*  And like they, they did, you know, they had the spring. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=334.96s)]
*  In what way? [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=337.35999999999996s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=338.23999999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=338.71999999999997s)]
*  I'll explain it. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=338.79999999999995s)]
*  Like they had the spring court and Congress. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=339.44s)]
*  And so I know that this feels like, what are you talking about? [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=341.28s)]
*  Like, you know, but culturally institutionally, right? [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=343.84s)]
*  Like that the universities, the, the, the movies corporations all having pride floats, [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=348.64s)]
*  you know, just like there was a cultural shift that was more towards the, whatever you want [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=355.52s)]
*  to call it, the laughter more, it's more really like elite global, you know, kind of culture. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=359.84s)]
*  And, and, and, and there've been like some big wins. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=366.47999999999996s)]
*  I know it doesn't maybe feel that way for some people, but like between gay marriage [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=370.08s)]
*  and like healthcare, like across a lot of areas that racial awareness, right? [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=373.91999999999996s)]
*  Like there'd been a lot of wins. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=379.91999999999996s)]
*  I know it wasn't like we got into perfect, but there'd been, there'd been a lot of change [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=381.12s)]
*  in a period of time. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=385.59999999999997s)]
*  And to me, the equanimity might be the, like they got one. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=387.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=392.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=393.03999999999996s)]
*  Well, that's kind of, that's, that's a little, well, that's kind of the flip side of the [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=393.28s)]
*  argument that I'm saying that both the consequences and we, we won, we got it, you know, and we, [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=396.96s)]
*  we caught the car and you know, we got the Supreme court that we want a lot of other things. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=401.84s)]
*  And so, yeah, that, that's a, that's a, that's a nice counterbalanced view. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=407.59999999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=410.96s)]
*  They got the little middle finger, his tiny stubby middle finger that they wanted. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=411.35999999999996s)]
*  And like, now we'll see if that makes them happy. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=415.35999999999996s)]
*  Okay. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=418.0s)]
*  Let's talk about what's going on in Iran, which may, which may be the catastrophe that [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=419.52s)]
*  you're talking about may not be. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=423.52s)]
*  You said the green room, you had a broad theory of the case of what was happening there. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=424.8s)]
*  So let's just start with that. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=427.68s)]
*  Yeah. I think that, uh, we'll very soon see how wrong this could be, but I think he's made a [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=429.04s)]
*  decision. I think he's made a decision to go in and support Israel with, with air cover and the [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=435.68s)]
*  bunker busting bomb, whatever it is for the following reasons. One, I think the notion of [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=441.2s)]
*  Donald Trump Peisnick is just a complete mythology. It's not who he is. He did it [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=447.28000000000003s)]
*  politically because it served his interest to be the anti-war guy, the no more forever wars [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=453.12s)]
*  because of Biden and Bush and back down the line. But, but, but [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=459.12s)]
*  he was just everybody's stupid guy. And so I had the, had the presidents before him been anti-war. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=462.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=467.52s)]
*  You would have been like, you guys are so stupid. We should have been doing 100%. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=467.68s)]
*  But think about what his instincts really are. Military parades, shooting protesters. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=471.68s)]
*  He loves offense. He loves military. He loves strongmen. He loves Putin. I mean, he loves all [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=476.4s)]
*  the authoritarian military guys around the world. That's A. B. He wants to be a winner and, [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=481.36s)]
*  and he wants credit for, you know, and, and he looks at what's happening right now. And so far, [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=488.40000000000003s)]
*  it's been really successful in terms of what Israel has accomplished over the last couple of [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=493.92s)]
*  weeks. And I think he's saying, geez, you know, this is working out pretty well and I want some [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=500.40000000000003s)]
*  credit. Now suddenly we not, not they. And so I think he's bought in and I think Netanyahu's [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=504.72s)]
*  driving him like a truck. Yeah, for sure. I mean, I don't, I, that's not, can't even be a controversial [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=511.44000000000005s)]
*  point at this point that Netanyahu's driving this, right? I mean, I hear what you're saying, like he [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=519.12s)]
*  wants you on the winning side. Imagine the conversations he's having with Trump. It's like, [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=524.72s)]
*  they've got, they've got the capacity. If we don't do this, it's going to be on you that we [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=528.4s)]
*  didn't do it. And if we do do it and we wipe it out, you're going to get credit for this. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=532.72s)]
*  Right. Yeah. Um, when, when [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=537.12s)]
*  you were on with, um, and I'm going to, we have a former ambassador to Israel and Biden's Middle [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=540.72s)]
*  East guy Dan Shapiro coming on in segment two to talk about this a little bit more, um, kind of [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=545.6800000000001s)]
*  giving them more what the Israeli perspective is on, on, on doing this and how they've been effective. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=549.2s)]
*  Um, but I was interested in your, I was watching you, you were on with, uh, with Scarborough before [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=555.12s)]
*  this and my buddy, J Mark, J Mark doesn't even give a fuck about TV. By the way, this is a total [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=560.0s)]
*  aside. He's slouching. He's making faces. Like he's, he's just, he's like the kid in the classroom [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=565.6s)]
*  doing spitballs now on TV. It's hilarious watching it. Anyway, I was watching you cause I wanted to [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=572.64s)]
*  hear what you all were talking about and Scarborough made a point that was, um, uh, things in Iraq seem [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=576.8s)]
*  to be going pretty well the first couple of weeks too. Um, and, uh, I thought that was an insightful [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=582.8s)]
*  point. Um, so I don't know what you, you kind of, well, I have a lot of muscle. I have a lot of [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=588.08s)]
*  muscle memory about that because I remember it very well. And, you know, it's sort of the fog of [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=593.2s)]
*  history that people forget what it was like in the moment. But, um, you know, when we went in, [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=598.72s)]
*  it was, it was not like a divided country or divided cabinet or anything. And it was like a [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=605.2s)]
*  hundred percent or 99, 99 senators voted to go in, you know, it wasn't like this was a debate. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=610.96s)]
*  We were all in and every, it was like, everybody was there. And by the way, one of the interesting [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=620.16s)]
*  things about the Bush library, this really cool is he has something called the decision points [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=625.92s)]
*  center in the presidential library and they picked five issues. It was like Katrina, Iraq, [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=631.76s)]
*  the financial crisis couple more. And they put you in the chair and they say, here's the information [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=639.76s)]
*  the president had at the time. What decision would you make? And I forget what the number is, [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=644.24s)]
*  but it's something like 88% of the people that go through there did exactly what president Bush did [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=648.3199999999999s)]
*  at that time with that information. So, but, but the Ben Rhodes, uh, you know, Obama's, uh, uh, [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=653.2s)]
*  national security. Oh, great. Well, well, maybe I think I saw this from your podcast. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=660.08s)]
*  I stole it from you. This is where you want to be in the culture, McKinnon, where you're on top of [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=666.88s)]
*  the news. Yeah. My interviews are just consuming you on your feet. It's just osmosis, man. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=670.88s)]
*  Anyway, I think he said it on your, on with you. He said, the problem is [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=679.1999999999999s)]
*  that it could be a catastrophic success. Yeah. Right. So you have this incredible [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=686.24s)]
*  success of dropping this on the blows up the nuclear facility and then saying you succeed. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=692.08s)]
*  And then yet catastrophic consequences. Now what? Because you haven't, I mean, [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=697.76s)]
*  what does regime change in Iran mean? I don't know. Yeah. The, um, just, there's one more thing. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=702.08s)]
*  I'm going back to that Bush point. I just want to linger on that for a second. Since you were there, [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=708.08s)]
*  like, or around it at least the, um, like that moment, like the shock and awe, it's like, [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=712.56s)]
*  there is like a hubristic moment where people can get caught up in this stuff, right? Where it's [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=718.64s)]
*  like, I was like, we got this, you know, and you do, and that is something to think about right now [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=722.8s)]
*  in the Israel scenario, because there's kind of like a good reason kind of for Israel to be [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=727.4399999999999s)]
*  hubristic. It's pretty astonishing what they've done. Yeah. And I think that goes to your point [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=730.48s)]
*  that the people get sort of caught up in that success and these guys were the smartest military [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=735.04s)]
*  people in the world. And these guys are on their heels and you know, let's, let's take them out [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=738.96s)]
*  while we can. You know, we're rolling, let's go. And you just kind of get caught up in them in the [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=743.6s)]
*  momentum. Guys, I'm coming up on a vacation and I want it to be carefree. You know, you want to [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=747.52s)]

*  What the fissures though, and then maybe the disagreements have you caught the Tucker and Ted [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=818.0s)]
*  interview. I played it maybe a hundred times. I have it on a loop. I'm going to loop over here. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=822.88s)]
*  Well, good. How about a hundred and one? Cause I played one clip from it yesterday and I was like, [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=829.6s)]
*  yeah, I need one more. I'm not done with it yet. So let's listen. Let's listen to a different [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=836.48s)]
*  part of the exchange. So good. It's so good. It's interesting. I'm trying to derail my questions, [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=840.0s)]
*  but calling me an anti-Semite, which you are. I did not. Of course you are. And, [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=844.32s)]
*  and rather than be honorable enough to say it right to my face, you are in a sleazy feline way [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=848.16s)]
*  implying it or just asking questions about the Jews. I'm not asking questions about the Jews. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=853.68s)]
*  I have, there's nothing to do with Jews or Judaism. It has to do with a foreign government. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=858.16s)]
*  Isn't Israel controlling our foreign policy? That's not about the Jews. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=862.16s)]
*  You said, I'm asking- And by the way, [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=865.12s)]
*  you're the one that just called me, I think, a sleazy feline. So let's be clear. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=866.7199999999999s)]
*  It's sleazy to imply that I'm an anti-Semite, which you just did. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=870.0s)]
*  No, I just said why is that the only question you're asking? You answer it. Give me another reason. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=874.0s)]
*  If you're not an anti-Semite, give me another reason why the obsession is Israel. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=877.92s)]
*  I am in no sense obsessed with Israel. We are on the brink of war with Iran. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=882.3199999999999s)]
*  And so these are valid questions. But you're not asking- [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=886.24s)]
*  Wow. I didn't even hear that question. It gets better and better. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=889.04s)]
*  That one's been lost in the shuffle, man. That's incredible. What, sleazy feline? [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=893.12s)]
*  Yeah, the glove fits. I don't know. Sleazy feline, not too bad. What do you, [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=901.12s)]
*  how deep do you think, is this personal? How deep do you think the rift is? Is Tucker kind [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=906.56s)]
*  of on an island? What do you think they make of this? [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=911.76s)]
*  Well, if he's on an island, it's a largely populated island of Magites. He and Bannon, [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=915.68s)]
*  I think that they, whatever you say about those guys, I think they have a pulse, [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=921.76s)]
*  the true pulse of the core Maga base. And I think this is where they are. They really are an [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=926.96s)]
*  isolationist group. And Tucker, I don't think Tucker will just believe anything. It's not like [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=933.36s)]
*  he has an ideology, but I think maybe, I don't know, maybe say his name thing about Bannon. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=941.84s)]
*  But I mean, that was, that's some high level entertainment there. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=946.16s)]
*  I liked his little, he dipped into the William F. Buckley there in the middle for like two words. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=950.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=956.16s)]
*  What? I felt like he was on a firing line there for a second. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=956.8000000000001s)]
*  Yeah. It's just, I mean, it was such an ambush. You know, he like looked up the population right [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=962.24s)]
*  before the interview. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=966.4s)]
*  It wasn't ambush, but there were some, there's some legit points, you know? I mean, [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=968.8000000000001s)]
*  Ted makes a little bit of a legit point about Tucker's, you know. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=974.72s)]
*  No, I mean, this is an interesting historical demarcation because I mean, look who's in this [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=978.64s)]
*  coalition. It's not just Marjorie Taylor Greene and Tucker Bannon. It's Elizabeth Warren. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=985.44s)]
*  Right. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=991.2s)]
*  It's a really interesting coalition. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=992.64s)]
*  Tommy Vitor over there on Pod Save America. I was listening to them the other day and he [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=994.24s)]
*  has strange new respect for Tucker, it turns out. So, you know, and sometimes when a person is [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=997.6s)]
*  right, they're right. And it's to be right for the right reasons. You know what I mean? [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=1003.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=1007.6800000000001s)]
*  For the wrong reasons. I want to talk about immigration with you a little bit because [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=1008.24s)]
*  I think like me, you know, you, you know, when you were a Republican in good standing, [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=1012.88s)]
*  like kind of bought the, maybe, I don't know what, actually, I only asked this question. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=1020.7199999999999s)]
*  Was it BS? Was the compassionate conservatism stuff BS? Was that a, was that a, a, [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=1025.44s)]
*  like just a marketing thing or did folks really believe it? [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=1031.92s)]
*  I guess. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=1035.92s)]
*  No, I, I, listen, I believed it and I think George Bush believed it and that's part of what drew me [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=1036.24s)]
*  over the bridge. And then I mean, I was there in Texas and saw him embracing immigrants. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=1041.04s)]
*  Saw him on the border. I mean, that, he can't fake that stuff. I mean, he was, you know, [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=1044.6399999999999s)]
*  speaking Spanish to them and embracing them. And, and by the way, it was his sort of compassionate [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=1048.56s)]
*  version of immigration and trying to fix the system that I, I fully supported and that he, [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=1054.0s)]
*  you know, he wanted to campaign on that. And a lot of people are saying, you know, [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=1062.6399999999999s)]
*  that's a third rail. You can't do it. Blah, blah, blah. And he said, you know, [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=1065.04s)]
*  top, this is what I believe. And you're going to, so, but the interesting thing about it, Tim, [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=1067.9199999999998s)]
*  is that, uh, you know, that was, you know, that was 25 years ago. So that's, you know, like a [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=1071.52s)]
*  third of my life that we've been talking about this with zero action, you know, which is amazing. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=1080.48s)]
*  When you think about, I don't think anybody disagrees that, or very few that it's not a, [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=1087.36s)]
*  it's not an issue that needs to be addressed. And the only question is how do you address it? [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=1093.28s)]
*  What's the fix? [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=1097.28s)]
*  I'm happy to hear you say that. It was one of my failed projects was I was going to go, [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=1098.48s)]
*  I was probably going to lean on you to help me with this. I was pitching it as a podcast, [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=1103.84s)]
*  like back before I started doing this podcast, where I was going to go interview all the [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=1107.12s)]
*  OGW people and try to like answer this question. Like, was this real? Cause like, [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=1110.4s)]
*  I thought it was real as a kid. I was drawn to it. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=1115.04s)]
*  What did you think about Jep's view on it? [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=1117.12s)]
*  Oh no, he was genuine about the immigration stuff, though. I think that you could explore [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=1119.52s)]
*  all that and be like, okay, well, what are the limits to the compassion, right? And I think that [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=1123.44s)]
*  there are layers to explore, you know, there for sure. But I mean, he was definitely at least on [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=1128.48s)]
*  criminal justice issues and on immigration issues, very legit. But then it's like these [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=1134.16s)]
*  questions of you make these sacrifices and alliances and you know, what are the priorities? [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=1139.28s)]
*  Anyway, I thought that'd be an interesting thing to explore, but I bought into it and felt that it [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=1143.28s)]
*  was genuine. And so I can, it's been a real betrayal. Like the one thing when people have [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=1148.64s)]
*  like, you've changed your views and everything. I was like, I don't know. I feel like I've been [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=1155.6000000000001s)]
*  totally betrayed. Like they sold me from Reagan all the way through McCain on Shining City on a [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=1158.72s)]
*  Hill and this is the good part of America, et cetera. And like now we're the fucking nasty, [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=1165.3600000000001s)]
*  like we're with China. Like we have the nastiest immigration policy in the world. So I just, [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=1170.8000000000002s)]
*  that is the thing that has hit me the hardest. Maybe because maybe the betrayal is part of it. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=1177.1999999999998s)]
*  The humanity element is also part of it. But what, like, if you, as you've watched kind of [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=1180.8799999999999s)]
*  what they've been doing across all of the different elements with immigration, like what has [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=1186.1599999999999s)]
*  grabbed you the most? Well, at the core of it, the hypocrisy and you can take it this sort of [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=1191.12s)]
*  issue by issue by how Trump has discarded sort of, you know, the historical Republican approach on [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=1199.52s)]
*  these issues to, but I mean, for example, like I was on the, I was on the Bush appointed me to [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=1205.84s)]
*  the broadcast board of governors, which oversees voice of America. You know, that's all about [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=1216.6399999999999s)]
*  pushing the freedom agenda around the world and Trump's cut that. That's how much more Republican [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=1220.3999999999999s)]
*  can you get than that idea and that you would shut that down. So on the immigration side, [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=1225.28s)]
*  at the very core of this, and we were seeing it now in the, in the, you know, with the ag sector, [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=1230.32s)]
*  particularly is that these are people, I mean, they're here for the most American of reasons, [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=1235.04s)]
*  you know, and these are like, you know, really religious people, hardworking people, you know, [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=1242.0s)]
*  they're not criminals. They are, they may not have their papers, but by God, they are, you know, [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=1248.8s)]
*  patriotic, America loving people working their asses off. And I think that that's, you know, [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=1255.68s)]
*  that's the thing that gets me in the end is that it's just, it's, it's, [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=1263.36s)]
*  when you get to the core of this, it's very anti, it's very anti-American. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=1267.28s)]
*  Anti-American, it is, it's un-American. I keep saying it. I was reading the local paper this [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=1270.96s)]
*  morning. We're going to do a little local news segment on this with New Orleans, because this [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=1276.24s)]
*  struck me just, this just really made me sad. And this stuff has happened all over the country. And [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=1279.12s)]
*  there's this kind of ongoing debate about, you know, is Trump just targeting blue cities, you [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=1284.4s)]
*  know, and this is part of some fight. And I think it is that like, he's trying to escalate fights, [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=1292.24s)]
*  obviously, with, with, you know, sanctuary cities, quote unquote, and with blue governors. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=1296.96s)]
*  But the policies are way more far reaching than that. And here we are in Louisiana, [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=1301.6000000000001s)]
*  and we've got Kenner, which is suburb of New Orleans, is 30% Hispanic, they canceled their [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=1306.4s)]
*  Hispanic Heritage Festival because they're worried about an ICE raid. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=1313.04s)]
*  Yeah. Oh, yeah. I saw that. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=1315.84s)]
*  Talking about un-American. And then, and then another local story in the, in the, [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=1317.36s)]
*  in the paper, check out NOLA.com, subscribe and support them, doing real journalism, is a, [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=1322.8s)]
*  a flood control project job site was raided. You know, it's like, really? I mean, how much more [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=1328.24s)]
*  self-harm can you be doing than we're going to, we're going to deport the people that are working [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=1336.32s)]
*  on a construction project to help with flood control? It feels like New Orleans could use [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=1341.36s)]
*  some infrastructure related to flood control. And probably if we can get people who are willing to [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=1346.4799999999998s)]
*  come work here and help us with that and do so and follow the rules, it seems like that's probably [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=1351.4399999999998s)]
*  a win-win. Yeah. And, and you know, the, the, the tension now that's happening in the administration [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=1356.6399999999999s)]
*  is that, you know, the ag secretary went and weighed in heavily. And then of course, Stephen [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=1363.04s)]
*  Miller and Kristi Noem jumped in to reverse the reversal. But the, the problem is that [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=1367.44s)]
*  Miller and company have come up with this number of 3000 deportations per day to meet a mark of [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=1375.44s)]
*  1 million per year. And so the orders have been, and then the interesting, interesting stories [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=1380.48s)]
*  about the demoralization in Homeland Security and ICE, you know, these, these, you know, [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=1387.04s)]
*  well, people who went in for the right reasons are having to go arrest, you know, really good [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=1394.08s)]
*  people and they're not criminals. And the, the, the notion that they sold was not that we're going [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=1398.3999999999999s)]
*  to go round up hardworking people who just didn't have papers. We're going to go round up all these [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=1403.36s)]
*  gang members and criminals where they're just that the problem is they, there aren't 3000 a day of [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=1408.24s)]
*  them to do that. Yeah. So that pulls up all the, you know, these really good people. There's some [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=1413.4399999999998s)]
*  economic impact on that too, but I want to play one more thing because it's been going around [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=1419.76s)]
*  and it's from the first term and I just, I feel like there's something here. I don't know. Maybe [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=1423.6799999999998s)]
*  all these guys have been broken by 10 years of Trump, but a much younger looking Joe Rogan, [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=1430.7199999999998s)]
*  I don't know if you've seen this, this clip has been going around. He's it's during the child [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=1436.6399999999999s)]
*  separation stuff. And I want to show you how he was talking about this back then. Broke the law, [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=1440.7199999999998s)]
*  shouldn't have fucking come over here if you didn't want to get your kid separated. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=1445.36s)]
*  If you were in the presence of a woman who came over here from Guatemala and she's poor [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=1448.88s)]
*  and she's starving and they're taking her baby away and she's wailing and screaming from a primal [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=1456.0s)]
*  place in her DNA that the one thing she loves more than anything is being taken away. A baby! [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=1463.92s)]
*  If that doesn't freak you the fuck out, you're not a part of the team, man. You're missing it. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=1469.92s)]
*  You're missing it. What's what are we here for? We're here for a hundred years of whatever. That's [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=1474.3200000000002s)]
*  what we're here for. If you want to spend a hundred years saying, oh, you should have [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=1478.16s)]
*  fucking broke the law. I don't want you on the team. You're an asshole. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=1481.3600000000001s)]
*  Occasionally Rogan kind of. Yeah. And I just, I just, I keep banging this drum because I'm like, [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=1488.4s)]
*  man, I think that Democrats and whoever commentators, comedians, podcast, bros should [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=1493.1200000000001s)]
*  be in these spaces making these arguments. I think that. Was that a recent clip? [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=1499.0400000000002s)]
*  No, no, no. It was from the first term. Well, but I do. I mean, I heard Rogan do something [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=1504.64s)]
*  similarly recently. So I mean, he, he, he does sort of like, you know, on occasion figure out the [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=1509.8400000000001s)]
*  humanity of stuff. Humanity, you know, sort of ekes through occasionally. And these stories like [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=1516.16s)]
*  are still high. Like we don't have a child separation policy right now, but like the [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=1520.96s)]
*  stories are still happening. I don't know. I get this shit sent to me all the time, like, um, [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=1524.96s)]
*  because I'm, I'm so obsessed with it. And I tell people, I was like, don't send me [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=1528.8000000000002s)]
*  national news stories and memes. I've seen all those already, but if you have a local news story [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=1531.76s)]
*  about something that's happening in your community center to me, because I think that stuff's [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=1537.12s)]
*  breaking through Tim. And I think that the, there's a repetition about it. And so I know that the, [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=1540.16s)]
*  the political, you know, circle around Trump is like, you can do anything you want on immigration. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=1546.56s)]
*  You're bulletproof on it. Don't worry about it. But the reality is that those numbers are now [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=1552.56s)]
*  south is even as immigration numbers, which is obviously as strong as the strongest issue. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=1557.52s)]
*  Yeah. But, but the, but the fact is that Americans, no matter how strongly they feel about [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=1563.6s)]
*  deporting people who are bad people, they're not in, I mean, they have a real sense of fairness, [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=1568.6399999999999s)]
*  a about deporting people that shouldn't be deported, uh, to a prison in a foreign country. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=1575.76s)]
*  They don't think that's right. Uh, and also, you know, deporting people that, [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=1582.08s)]
*  that don't have any criminal background. I mean, they do draw a line. Yeah. And like the two, [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=1587.1999999999998s)]
*  the two stories I was, I was representing people sent me, like one was a guy. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=1592.3999999999999s)]
*  It's the wife of a military guy. And she got kind of tricked her a little bit to get, to get her to [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=1595.76s)]
*  show up to a appointment. And then the other one was the wife of a pastor who had kids here. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=1602.72s)]
*  Yeah. And then there was one just the last day or two about the Afghani interpreter guy, [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=1608.72s)]
*  you know, who's like, who's for this, a pastor's wife who's been here since 1998 [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=1613.52s)]
*  is getting sent back to Mexico. Well, I think those are the kind of stories that, that get, [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=1619.28s)]
*  you know, get real sticky. Like you said, especially people read about local stories. [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=1623.3600000000001s)]
*  They're like, wait a minute, what is, what's going on here? I didn't sign up for this. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=1627.84s)]
*  I want to go back to the econ side. Now chamber of commerce, Tim and MCAT can come out. Um, [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=1631.84s)]
*  because in addition to the humanity, there's the econ side. Uh, Matt Iglesias posted this. I think [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=1635.28s)]
*  it was people are like, what, how the there's this housing market issues right now, like there's [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=1639.2s)]
*  softness and like costs are going up and people are like, why? And, um, and, and Iglesias just [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=1645.12s)]
*  summed it up this way, pretty simply. He goes, well, we're raising financing costs for things. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=1650.6399999999999s)]
*  Higher national debt's going to increase interest rates on everything. We're raising building [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=1654.56s)]
*  material costs directly with tariffs and indirectly with like these workside worksite [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=1659.04s)]
*  raids, where like, if you have fewer people, you know, that you're going to increase the labor [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=1666.24s)]
*  costs. And I, and I, I think that like, unlike the first term Trump is, is like walking into a [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=1671.44s)]
*  little bit of an economic pickle this time, like the, like the stuff that he wanted to do, the guys [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=1676.56s)]
*  around him didn't really let him do. Like we focus on that in the context of the authoritarian stuff, [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=1681.36s)]
*  but it's also been true in like the economic policy stuff. I don't know. Well, that's overstated. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=1686.56s)]
*  Well, I, I'm just a shallow media guy and I, I, I am not an economist and I flunked econ 101, [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=1691.2s)]
*  but, but even I, that's why, that's why you're the pertinent. You're like representing the man [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=1697.9199999999998s)]
*  of the people here concerned about your, you know, the whole tariff obsession from the very [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=1703.28s)]
*  beginning, it just struck me as insane. You know, I mean, it's, it's Trump somehow read something [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=1709.36s)]
*  about something that happened in the late 1800s and just sort of transpose it to modern day without [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=1716.32s)]
*  realizing what the different circumstances and, and it became this, this sort of magic one, much [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=1723.12s)]
*  like the wall was in 16, you know, the wall is going to solve everything. We're going to build [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=1730.6399999999999s)]
*  the wall and Mexico is going to pay for it. Terrace is kind of the same thing. He just, he just [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=1735.6s)]
*  somehow latched onto this notion that, you know, that the countries are going to pay for it. There [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=1741.6s)]
* 'd be no, you know, no, the consumers here wouldn't have to pay for it, which is, you know, [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=1745.92s)]
*  there's no economists in the world that say that that's true. And so he just, he found a couple of [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=1750.3200000000002s)]
*  nutballs, Peter Navarro and a lot of making a couple of others that, you know, that like the egg [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=1756.16s)]
*  them on and just walked into this crazy tariff thing that, you know, Scott Besant, I mean, I think [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=1761.2s)]
*  history will go down as showing that he saved us from true economic catastrophe. I mean, had those [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=1767.44s)]
*  initial tariffs. Oh, I hate to hand it to Scott Besant. We've got gay on gay crime with Scott [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=1772.8s)]
*  Besant, you know, I don't, I can't, I can't do it, but that's fine. The gays did a good one there. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=1779.84s)]
*  Just saved us. I'm not, I'm not endorsing him across the board, but in that moment, [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=1787.84s)]
*  in that moment, you know, he pulled us back. He certainly is smarter than Howard Nutlick, but [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=1792.0s)]
*  low bar, but he certainly is. Okay. Media guy question then on Econ. The punch poll, the DC, [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=1797.68s)]
*  the little congressional news outlet that follows Congress. They have a take up this morning of just [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=1806.16s)]
*  about how some Republicans on the Hill and they're well-sourced there are starting to panic a little [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=1812.48s)]
*  bit about the polling numbers around the big, beautiful bill and how it's not popular and how [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=1818.3200000000002s)]
*  they don't have a message on it yet. Now the Democrats message is clear. How about that for [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=1823.6000000000001s)]
*  a change of pace? The Democrats have a clear message and the Republicans are, are flailing [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=1827.04s)]
*  on their message a little bit. What do you make of all that? I think that this could be the [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=1831.44s)]
*  catastrophe that, that, that, that implodes the whole of Trump second term. I just, you know, the, [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=1838.08s)]
*  of course, the irony that you can appreciate given where you and I both come from is this notion that, [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=1846.08s)]
*  that the Republicans actually cared about the deficit. Yeah. And the, they're the ones you look [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=1851.76s)]
*  historically who's driven it up. Well, Clinton brought it down, you know, I mean, you kind of go [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=1857.8400000000001s)]
*  through the democratic presidents, they got things sort of right-sided and then you'd stack up Bush [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=1863.68s)]
*  and especially Trump. I mean, he's driven up the deficit three, five, six times. And, you know, [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=1868.64s)]
*  we're into territory now where, again, this is where the economists come in. The bond markets [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=1875.28s)]
*  are freaking out. And so if this bill goes through, to me, it just feels like they're driving it off. [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=1879.92s)]
*  They're driving off the cliff. Yeah. Okay. My old Republican has to come in for a second. Joe Biden [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=1884.48s)]
*  did not do a good job on the debt and deficit, but okay. Sometimes, sometimes the Democrat listeners [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=1889.2s)]
*  were like, you got to give us credit. And I was like, okay, I'll give you credit for the work in 1999 [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=1894.0s)]
*  and Barack Obama's Barack Obama's failed effort with, with, with John Boehner and Simpson-Bowles. [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=1899.6000000000001s)]
*  It was a good, it was a good intentioned effort, but it didn't land. But yeah, [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=1905.76s)]
*  no, I hear you. That was COVID. Bush and Trump have been a nightmare. Everybody's been a nightmare [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=1909.68s)]
*  on it. Where, well, Elon, I wanted to get your, pick your brain on Elon because, [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=1913.3600000000001s)]
*  Elon sent a tweet a couple, maybe a week or two ago now that I felt like it might've been an [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=1920.0800000000002s)]
*  MCAT bat signal. He was like, do we, maybe the 80% in the middle should create a party [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=1925.1200000000001s)]
*  that gets rid of all these guys on the extremes. And I was like, did you get a phone call from, [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=1932.0s)]
*  from Elon? Did he, did he try to shake your tree a little bit? Oh yeah. Yeah. Well, this is, [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=1936.56s)]
*  this has been my obsession for, for many, many years. There's just no, you know, there's this [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=1942.96s)]
*  quaint notion that, that there should be a, an alternative to, you know, to Coke or Pepsi. We [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=1948.1599999999999s)]
*  should have seven up a Red Bull. And, and I've been, you know, tilting at these. Elon, who you [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=1954.24s)]
*  imagined as the standard bearer for that. No, but I'll take whoever we can get. There's just a [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=1960.32s)]
*  steep hill and a big rock, you know, come on in the water's water's really chilly. So, but, but [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=1964.56s)]
*  listen, I listen, it's not, I mean, Elon's not what gets me excited about this notion. It's looking [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=1972.3999999999999s)]
*  at what's happening with Gen Z and you know, they, they are just radically opposed to kind of the [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=1978.24s)]
*  institutional parties and looking for an alternative in a different way. And, and you know, [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=1984.1599999999999s)]
*  that's on both sides of the aisle. So, you know, it just seems, it, of course the barriers and I [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=1989.92s)]
*  can, I could go on for hours about, you know, the experience of meeting the buzzsaw of trying to do [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=1996.5600000000002s)]
*  an effort like this, cause it's, it's almost impossible. Well, why don't you do it? I get, [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=2002.48s)]
*  I did a Reddit ask me anything yesterday. Yeah. Go and check that out on our politics. Yeah. And [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=2006.4s)]
*  I do like any time I do one of these, you get this question. Why not a third party? Why doesn't it [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=2010.96s)]
*  explain why it hasn't worked? Well, um, a, I'll start off with, I think, I think there's huge [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=2016.1599999999999s)]
*  opportunity there. I think there's a huge desire for it. This, just that the system is really rigged [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=2024.8799999999999s)]
*  against it, just in the sense that in order to, you have to get on the ballot in 50 States. And [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=2029.76s)]
*  in order to do that, you have to raise just the most recent example was about $50 million. [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=2035.76s)]
*  Uh, so, you know, well, Elon's got 50 million, so he could do it, but there's not a lot of [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=2042.0800000000002s)]
*  Elans around. And so, and then once you do that, you have to go around all these States and get on [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=2047.92s)]
*  the ballot. And in every one of these States, there is a Democrat or Republican secretary of state [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=2053.84s)]
*  who's going to do everything they can to question your signatures, throw up roadblocks, [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=2060.0s)]
*  file lawsuits. So it's an incredibly difficult thing to just get on the ballot and do all of that. [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=2065.36s)]
*  Um, uh, and there've, there've been a couple of different efforts over the last, uh, you know, [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=2071.92s)]
*  couple of cycles or several cycles, uh, all of them kind of flamed out for different reasons. [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=2078.2400000000002s)]
*  But again, you know, I, I, I, people always say to me, you know, third party is never going to [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=2084.2400000000002s)]
*  happen because it's never really successfully happened before. And it's like, you know, [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=2088.88s)]
*  nothing happens in politics until it does. And, uh, you know, [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=2092.2400000000002s)]
*  what do you make of my answer? My answer is folks is this, there are two possible ways. And, um, [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=2097.5200000000004s)]
*  neither of them have really been tried. One is cause it's hard and it's a lot of work, [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=2101.76s)]
*  which is just starting state legislators and local races and just like build from the ground up. [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=2106.8s)]
*  And that's a lot more work than, than like doing a, than starting a group and going on TV. Um, [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=2112.96s)]
*  and I think that might not work, but it's worth a try. And the other one is a, [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=2118.88s)]
*  fuck you billionaire who has like insanely weird views. Like, like not what you would think, [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=2121.6000000000004s)]
*  not like, oh, I'm socially moderate and fiscally conservative. Like they, like this person would [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=2127.2s)]
*  have totally wild views that are not out in the public that nobody's taking on right now. Like we [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=2132.3999999999996s)]
*  should ban AI and also I really love guns and I don't know. You know what I mean? Like totally [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=2137.6s)]
*  per oath. Yeah. Like those are the only two paths. Like I agree. And I just, I'm really skeptical [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=2142.24s)]
*  about the first one. I just think it's gotta be kind of Moses leading out of the desert. And it's [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=2147.2799999999997s)]
*  gotta be from the top. I mean, doing the, I mean, I understand the local state, but just to do that [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=2151.84s)]
*  is exponentially harder than the alternative. Right. Anyway, we went down to sidetrack, [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=2158.7200000000003s)]
*  but I was, I got intrigued. People are really interested in it. So it's worth talking about. [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=2163.5200000000004s)]
*  I wanted to, uh, though, when I brought up Elon initially, um, I just like the feud. Do you have [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=2167.92s)]
*  any hot takes on the few? Cause it's ongoing. Elon, people are like, oh, it's over now. But Elon [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=2174.0s)]
*  tweeted yesterday calling Trump's like head of personnel, Sergio Gore, this guy, I know he used [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9NBFkALT-s&t=2179.12s)]
