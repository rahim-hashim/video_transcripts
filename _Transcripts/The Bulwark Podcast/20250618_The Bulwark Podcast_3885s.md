Video Description: Iran is in a vulnerable spot for a variety of reasons, and Israel sees this as a stars-aligning moment to decapitate the Iranian state. But if the U.S. helps out, we'll face the same questions we did with Iraq and Afghanistan: Who will run the place? As Tucker had to embarrassingly school Ted Cruz, Iran is a giant country. And it could descend into civil war or chaos—and America could be drawn into the 'catastrophic success' of regime change. Plus, MAGA fissures over foreign policy, Tulsi can't be trusted on Iran, and Dems really need to seize this black helicopter moment of masked agents snatching and arresting people, including elected officials. Ben Rhodes joins Tim Miller.

# Trump’s Iran Lies EXPOSED! (w/ Ben Rhodes)
**The Bulwark Podcast:** [June 18, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q)
*  Tim, I saw like someone, I think it was Newt Gingrich tweeting, what Iran needs now is [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=0.0s)]
*  a secular, moderate, inclusive democratic government. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=4.16s)]
*  I'm like, hey, yeah, sure. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=6.72s)]
*  That's what we all need. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=8.36s)]
*  We need that in the United States, by the way. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=9.36s)]
*  So I worry that they're going to do the regime change. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=12.8s)]
*  The BB is not going to stop. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=15.4s)]
*  He hates these guys. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=16.68s)]
*  Trump was threatening to kill the scream leader. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=17.68s)]
*  And that's when I'm like, this is not going to end well, because we've seen where regime [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=19.72s)]
*  change imposed from the outside goes. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=23.22s)]
*  It goes into failed states or civil wars or chaos. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=25.12s)]
*  Hello and welcome to the Bullard podcast. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=35.24s)]
*  I'm your host, Tim Miller, delighted to welcome and I think a first time guest. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=36.760000000000005s)]
*  He's a speechwriter and deputy national security adviser under President Obama. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=40.6s)]
*  He was deeply involved with the Iran nuclear deal. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=44.72s)]
*  He's now a contributor to MSNBC, co-host of Pond Saved the World and author of After [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=47.52s)]
*  the Fall, Being American in the World We've Made. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=51.56s)]
*  It's Ben Rhodes. What's up, man? [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=54.52s)]
*  Hey, Tim. Yeah, first time. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=56.040000000000006s)]
*  First time, long time. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=57.400000000000006s)]
*  As okay. Good. I'm pumped. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=58.400000000000006s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, I am pumped. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=60.52s)]
*  And hopefully you've listened to Tommy Vitor episode so you know what's going to come for [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=62.08s)]
*  you at the very end of the pod. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=65.28s)]
*  I have a special segment for World OZ. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=66.36s)]
*  I want to start. There were four reasons I wanted to get you on the pod. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=69.52000000000001s)]
*  And the last one is hilarious. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=72.72s)]
*  So I'm just going to go through them really quick. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=73.96000000000001s)]
*  Number one, your book is Bill Crystal Adjacent. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=75.32000000000001s)]
*  And we're going to get to that. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=78.12s)]
*  I don't know. I know that you don't like to accept that, but it's true. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=79.16000000000001s)]
*  Number two, I am a world, though, in Pond Saved the World and Shield of the Republic [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=82.80000000000001s)]
*  are my napping podcasts. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=86.96000000000001s)]
*  And so I appreciate that. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=88.36s)]
*  So I have you in my ear as I'm kind of waking up from naps and a genuine [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=89.60000000000001s)]
*  compliment, unlike most of the people in the blob during the Trump era. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=96.0s)]
*  You've spoken like an actual human about how awful this stuff is rather than Diplo [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=100.2s)]
*  speak. I like that. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=103.68s)]
*  And lastly, I pitched this about a month ago when it looked like Trump was going to do [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=104.92s)]
*  JPCOA to. Yeah, I thought that was funny. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=108.16s)]
*  And it seemed a little maybe funny in a different way now. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=112.56s)]
*  Less funny. So I know we start to do this when we thought there was going to be like [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=115.08s)]
*  a deal. Yeah, exactly. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=119.08s)]
*  Very much not a deal. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=121.84s)]
*  And so let's just start there with your assessment on the state of play. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=123.64s)]
*  Well, look, we're in this incredibly dangerous and volatile moment, Tim. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=129.68s)]
*  I mean, we don't know whether the United States is going to enter the war today or [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=134.04s)]
*  tomorrow. It seems like we're poised on that precipice. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=137.88s)]
*  I mean, in terms of the state of play, look, I don't think Israel had to bomb [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=141.07999999999998s)]
*  Iran right now. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=146.68s)]
*  There was no despite they've made they haven't really tried to put out some kind [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=148.51999999999998s)]
*  of credible intelligence case that Iran was just about to acquire a nuclear weapon [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=153.6s)]
*  beyond what they always say. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=159.28s)]
*  The reality is that they've been living with an Iran with a nuclear program for a [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=161.44s)]
*  very, very long time. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=166.28s)]
*  It would take Iran, you know, estimates range from months into years to both [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=168.04s)]
*  acquire enough nuclear fuel for a weapon, but also to weaponize that fuel, put it on [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=173.52s)]
*  a warhead that was not about to happen. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=178.28s)]
*  And Trump literally had an ongoing negotiation and had a meeting set up in Oman [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=180.64s)]
*  where it seemed like they were probably going to get some kind of deal. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=186.64s)]
*  And so to me, what Israel did was not some, you know, five, five, the chess move [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=189.4s)]
*  by Trump where he was running a sign up on all of us with Steve Wittgoff. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=195.84s)]
*  I mean, Trump clearly wanted that deal. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=199.16s)]
*  So they basically bombed Iran before it was necessary in a manner that put an end [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=201.48s)]
*  to diplomacy. And I've been in these some of these simulations, Tim. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=207.04s)]
*  This happens in all of them, right? [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=211.36s)]
*  They get to a point where they say, OK, we bloody their nose and now we need the US [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=212.92000000000002s)]
*  to come in and drop its big bomb on Fordo. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=217.6s)]
*  And that's where we are. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=220.84s)]
*  So you're not buying the story from the Trump administration. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=223.16s)]
*  I've been I've been intrigued. All my former friends, all the all the hawks who stayed [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=226.35999999999999s)]
*  in the Republican Party in good standing are very excited to share that story. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=231.07999999999998s)]
*  They're like Donald Trump was, you know, doing, you know, doing a ploy on the media, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=234.76s)]
*  the Iranians, where he he brought them into his little mouse trap. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=240.4s)]
*  He put some cheese in there for the Ayatollah and and, you know, and was just being bad [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=243.88s)]
*  cop or a good cop, rather. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=249.04s)]
*  You don't you don't think that's that. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=253.64s)]
*  Tim, what is more plausible to you that Donald Trump and the people around him had the [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=254.92s)]
*  extraordinary discipline to go through a total decoy, months long diplomatic effort [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=259.12s)]
*  to arrive at a deal with Iran that their Saudi and Emirati friends supported while [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=265.8s)]
*  actually laying this trap and being disciplined enough not to leak it or tell anybody [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=273.15999999999997s)]
*  about it or that Bibi Netanyahu over Trump's objections bombed those facilities. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=278.24s)]
*  Trump was watching, as has been reported, Fox News. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=285.32s)]
*  The war looked pretty good on Fox News. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=289.0s)]
*  He saw some people saying that this was a great thing. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=291.96000000000004s)]
*  And then he started calling reporters on the phone and saying, hey, actually, I've [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=295.16s)]
*  been running this up the whole time. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=299.52s)]
*  I'm for this. And then all of his hawkish circle, which is only half the circle. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=301.44s)]
*  We can get into that. It starts banging on him to drop the big bomb on Fordo. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=307.16s)]
*  And he's in a bind now because he didn't want to be here. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=312.04s)]
*  But that's where he is. I'm going to bet on the latter scenario being the one, not the [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=315.08000000000004s)]
*  Psy-Up one. I'm going to bet on the latter scenario, too. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=320.84000000000003s)]
*  When you put it like that, it seems more likely that Trump was watching Fox and thought he [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=323.16s)]
*  could get in on a winner. And and this is where I mean, maybe I'm as susceptible as [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=327.88s)]
*  Trump. And so I just I want to hash out with you. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=332.28000000000003s)]
*  You know, my old little my old neocon muscles flex from time to time, you know, and [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=334.68s)]
*  there's an element of this that I am sympathetic to from the Israel side. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=340.28000000000003s)]
*  Not really. Not the BB part. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=344.68s)]
*  Yeah. You know, I wish it was somebody else that was doing it. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=347.4s)]
*  But but from an execution standpoint, they've been in a moment where they've been [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=349.76s)]
*  attacked by Iranian proxies for a long time now on all sides. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=354.56s)]
*  And Hezbollah is weakened. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=357.88s)]
*  Hezbollah is weakened. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=359.88s)]
*  And they they began this effort with in Iran pretty effectively, you have to admit, [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=361.71999999999997s)]
*  pretty impressively took out a lot of the Iranian leaders. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=366.56s)]
*  And I don't know, like maybe this is an opportunity finally for them to disable [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=370.23999999999995s)]
*  something that's been a threat in the region. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=376.96s)]
*  Is that is that crazy? [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=379.76s)]
*  What's crazy about that? That idea? [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=381.23999999999995s)]
*  Yeah. So let me I want to meet you where you are and give that what I believe to be [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=383.88s)]
*  the most generous reason for why Israel is doing this, because it is not that, you [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=387.96s)]
*  know, they had some information that Iran was about to weaponize a nuclear weapon. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=395.68s)]
*  I mean, BB's kind of had different versions of that that he said on television, but [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=402.24s)]
*  it's not clear even what their their argument. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=406.2s)]
*  I'm not even in my generous acceptance of their plan. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=408.32s)]
*  I'm not sold on that as the Russian. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=411.52s)]
*  The generous argument, I think, would be that Iran is particularly vulnerable right [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=413.28s)]
*  now that they have essentially decimated for the time being, at least Hezbollah. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=417.6s)]
*  The U.S., frankly, under Biden took a lot of shots at those proxy groups and [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=424.52000000000004s)]
*  militias and places like Iraq. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=429.84000000000003s)]
*  Assad is gone in Syria. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=432.92s)]
*  Russia's busy. Russia's busy. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=435.16s)]
*  Absolutely. And the shots that Israel took at Iran a few months ago were kind of [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=437.72s)]
*  designed to get rid of some of their defenses and kind of soften them up for this. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=444.04s)]
*  You know, and so I think the generous view is is less about there's anything materially [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=448.64000000000004s)]
*  different in the Iranian nuclear program than it is like, hey, this is the best chance [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=454.28000000000003s)]
*  that we've had. So let's take it. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=459.52000000000004s)]
*  I still think it's a bad idea for several reasons. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=461.24s)]
*  The first is purely from a nuclear program standpoint, you cannot bomb a nuclear [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=466.32000000000005s)]
*  program out of existence. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=472.04s)]
*  And when we looked at these scenarios in the Obama years, you know, even blowing up these [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=474.0s)]
*  facilities, you kind of set it back a year and then they could just dig deep underground [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=477.72s)]
*  and decide, hey, now that we know that we're going to get bombed without a nuclear weapon, [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=484.28000000000003s)]
*  we're just going to take this whole thing covert. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=489.64000000000004s)]
*  We're not going to make a deal and we're going to go underground. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=491.56s)]
*  That's one scenario you worry about. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=493.6s)]
*  They may not do that. They could come out and put their hands up. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=495.04s)]
*  But even then, I don't know that I trust that because the lesson they've learned is like, [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=497.52000000000004s)]
*  let's go underground and get this bomb. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=501.32s)]
*  That's the first one. The second one is a wars of this scale. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=503.2s)]
*  I mean, Iran is a country of 90 million people and they're going after the Iranian [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=507.28s)]
*  leadership. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=511.76s)]
*  We famously learned that on the Tucker Carlson show last night. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=511.88s)]
*  Yeah, actually, Tucker, I think said 92. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=514.2s)]
*  But yeah, I mean, he's got a point. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=515.96s)]
*  This is a big ass country, right, and a really important country. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=518.12s)]
*  And they're kind of going after the Iranian leadership like they're Hezbollah. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=521.3199999999999s)]
*  Like, you know, we're just picking these guys off. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=524.56s)]
*  This is a state. I hate the Iranian government, right. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=527.16s)]
*  But decapitating a state is different than decapitating a terrorist organization. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=530.36s)]
*  Who is going to run Iraq? [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=534.9599999999999s)]
*  This is the same question people failed to ask about Iraq and Afghanistan and that I [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=536.3199999999999s)]
*  and the Obama. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=540.68s)]
*  George Washington of Iran is going to run Iran, Ben. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=541.04s)]
*  Come on. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=544.0s)]
*  Well, that's the thing I failed asking about Libya. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=544.4s)]
*  So I want to I want to join myself as people that didn't get this right. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=545.9599999999999s)]
*  Well, that's the thing, Tim. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=549.52s)]
*  I saw like someone I think with Newt Gingrich tweeting, what Iran needs now is a [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=550.68s)]
*  secular, moderate, inclusive, democratic government. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=554.68s)]
*  I'm like, hey, yeah, sure. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=557.12s)]
*  That's what we all need. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=558.6s)]
*  We need that in the United States, by the way. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=559.32s)]
*  But so I worry that they're going to do the regime change. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=562.2s)]
*  The baby's not going to stop. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=565.8000000000001s)]
*  He hates these guys. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=566.96s)]
*  Trump was threatening to kill the Supreme Leader. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=567.96s)]
*  And that's when I'm like, this is not going to end well, because we've seen where [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=569.9200000000001s)]
*  regime change imposed from the outside goes. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=573.36s)]
*  It goes into failed states or civil wars or chaos. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=575.36s)]
*  You get drawn in the cons. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=578.28s)]
*  So it's less that Iran is going to like defeat Israel with ballistic missiles and more [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=580.4s)]
*  like the catastrophic success that could happen if there's regime change. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=584.96s)]
*  Could basically be in a country that is bigger than Iraq, that really is important. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=588.64s)]
*  It has a lot of oil and gas. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=594.24s)]
*  So other Russia, other countries are going to have interest there. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=595.8000000000001s)]
*  China, the Gulf states. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=598.28s)]
*  I just that that is unsealing. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=600.84s)]
*  And then the last thing I just say, Tim, is that I and this is where I may be like a [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=603.5600000000001s)]
*  lefty. I just think war to solve problems when there are alternatives that are still [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=607.36s)]
*  need to be tested is just as wrong. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=615.76s)]
*  You know, there are civilians being killed in both Iran and Israel. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=618.36s)]
*  There's no international law that says you can just go bomb a country to capitate its [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=622.0s)]
*  leadership. I still believe in a world in which, you know, and I guess I'm an old [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=625.96s)]
*  fashioned guy that way that you just it's better to not normalize that. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=629.88s)]
*  Right. Because we're normalizing a lot of military force in the last couple of years. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=635.48s)]
*  And Russia and China and others, we wouldn't like it if they did it. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=641.16s)]
*  So, you know, I think that we're going to miss those norms when they're gone. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=645.52s)]
*  I love how you just casually slipped into that answer, like Trump threatening to [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=649.4s)]
*  assassinate the Ayatollah. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=652.8s)]
*  Like, that's something that's happening. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=654.12s)]
*  That happened. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=655.2399999999999s)]
*  Trump is leading out like random assassination threats. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=655.64s)]
*  The peace candidate. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=659.7199999999999s)]
*  OK, I want to push back on you one more time and then only into the Trump side of [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=661.0799999999999s)]
*  this, because I I'm like negatively polarized on basically all Middle East [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=664.16s)]
*  policy opinions. Right. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=670.64s)]
*  So if I'm listening to Newt, if you talk to me about Newt Greengritch, I'm like, [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=671.84s)]
*  that's obviously stupid. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=675.28s)]
*  But then I hear the other side and I'm like, that seems stupid, too. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=676.6s)]
*  You know, and I think that while the regime change notion, which Bill Kristol did [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=678.76s)]
*  float on Monday to the consternation of some of our listeners, I hear you like [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=683.92s)]
*  obviously was an utter disaster. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=690.0799999999999s)]
*  And that's like basically accepted across the board minus a couple of random, you [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=692.52s)]
*  know, descendants of Paul Wolfowitz at this point, like the regime change effort [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=697.04s)]
*  in the Middle East was was a failure. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=701.4399999999999s)]
*  I hear that. But like from from just the perspective of the Israeli people, right, [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=703.5999999999999s)]
*  that the appeasement with Iran strategy also didn't work. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=709.1999999999999s)]
*  Right. I mean, like the deal, the the JCPOA kind of led to them, the Iranians [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=714.04s)]
*  being a little bit more flexible financially and otherwise to support these [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=719.84s)]
*  proxies. The ballistic missile deal expired two years ago and they've been [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=723.6s)]
*  getting ballistic missiles coming at them. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=729.8000000000001s)]
*  And so I think you could understand their view. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=731.9200000000001s)]
*  They're like, I don't know, dealing with the mullahs wasn't really any better. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=734.88s)]
*  Like that that was a negative outcome for the Israeli people, at least over the last [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=738.88s)]
*  little bit and perspective. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=742.64s)]
*  Look, I you know, I would make two points here rather than kind of debate [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=744.76s)]
*  everything about the JCPOA. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=749.44s)]
*  Sure. The two points I make is, first of all, I don't think we really we tested [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=750.8800000000001s)]
*  that proposition for two or three years. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=754.6s)]
*  I mean, one of the problems we have in this country is an inability to sustain [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=757.2800000000001s)]
*  anything. Right. And and so I think it was working, at least on the nuclear side, [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=761.0400000000001s)]
*  while it was implemented. Trump was out of there by 2018. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=765.96s)]
*  That's three years in. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=768.2800000000001s)]
*  And I don't think, you know, that that I think that was working to protect the [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=769.8800000000001s)]
*  Israeli people from the threat of the nuclear program. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=777.44s)]
*  It wasn't addressing the ballistic missiles and the proxies. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=780.32s)]
*  It wasn't intended to, you know, that that was going to require other strategies [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=782.8000000000001s)]
*  and other work. So but the first point is, I I love these things that we start in [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=788.1600000000001s)]
*  Obama. I get this about Cuba, too. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=793.32s)]
*  Like, well, it didn't work. We spent for two years, you know, you got to try these [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=794.8000000000001s)]
*  things out for longer. And actually, the fact that, you know, we used to say in [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=798.1600000000001s)]
*  back in the JCPOA arguments that it's either a diplomatic settlement or a war. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=802.4000000000001s)]
*  And we were called like, you know, mean, you know, how dare you say that the [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=806.48s)]
*  alternatives were we're seeing that that's the alternative. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=810.5600000000001s)]
*  But the second point I'd make about Israel, Tim, is that I understand what you're [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=813.5600000000001s)]
*  saying about the the the enormous amount of risk that they live with from from [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=817.36s)]
*  Hezbollah, from from Iranian proxies. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=823.48s)]
*  But they were also. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=826.5600000000001s)]
*  I think relative to like their their history, going through a pretty [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=829.6400000000001s)]
*  successful period. I mean, the economy was [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=835.88s)]
*  was booming in Israel. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=840.48s)]
*  Security was was Netanyahu was prime minister and he was bragging about the [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=842.4399999999999s)]
*  security he'd brought to Israel. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=847.4s)]
*  Yes, you had not eliminated all risk to the Israeli citizenry by any measure. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=849.52s)]
*  But I don't think I mean, some some of this proxy war between Iran and Israel has [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=854.6s)]
*  been going on for for decades, you know. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=859.52s)]
*  Yeah. And October 7th is obviously October 7th is obviously a hot day. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=861.84s)]
*  The whole other conversation. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=865.84s)]
*  But but the point is that I think that that was after, by the way, the JCPOA. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=866.96s)]
*  So if we're just talking about the period of the JCPOA, I'm not sure that was a [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=871.0400000000001s)]
*  period of like huge insecurity for the Israeli people relative to other periods. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=873.9200000000001s)]
*  I think the hawks would say, well, I mean, I have and I'd like to hear you give [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=877.9200000000001s)]
*  your take on the Gaza situation, too, but because it's related to all this. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=882.76s)]
*  But like Hamas dismantled Hezbollah, dismantled Iran weakened. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=885.52s)]
*  I don't you know, you don't you don't like to hand it to Bibi on anything. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=889.76s)]
*  And this is maybe less about Bibi, but like that's not nothing. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=893.88s)]
*  The two problems ever that are one there. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=899.0s)]
*  We're judging it. We judge everything in these short term, you know, new cycles. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=901.64s)]
*  I think five, 10 years from now, the way the Bibi is doing this is going to be [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=906.4s)]
*  people will see that it has been incredibly damaging to Israel, to its [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=910.8s)]
*  international standing, to its ability to have any kind of lasting peace based on [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=914.0799999999999s)]
*  trust with its neighbors. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=918.8s)]
*  But secondly, I just think this scale of violence is wrong. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=920.88s)]
*  And I actually think it does something to a society. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=923.8s)]
*  It's connected to what's happening here in some ways in the sense of like I [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=926.8399999999999s)]
*  the it is not good to for a country to do what Israel is currently doing in Gaza. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=931.64s)]
*  Like, I actually believe that, you know, maybe it's because I've been living in [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=937.68s)]
*  California too long, but you absorb what you're doing, you know. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=942.3599999999999s)]
*  And so you're absorbing the like psilocybin, for example, and start. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=946.92s)]
*  Well, let's say we're dancing around that. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=951.52s)]
*  But the point is that it they're they're normalizing, they're rationalizing like [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=955.08s)]
*  mass scaling on a scale in Gaza that I've never like I can't remember happening in [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=961.72s)]
*  the 21st century. Right. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=967.36s)]
*  And that's not good for a country. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=968.76s)]
*  You know, even if you can say you you racked up a win against Hamas doing it in [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=970.5600000000001s)]
*  that manner, I don't think is good for Israel, the health of that society. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=975.0s)]
*  You know, yeah. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=979.12s)]
*  And and it's it's moving them further and further to the right. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=980.4399999999999s)]
*  It's moving their politics to the far right. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=983.5999999999999s)]
*  And so one of I think the problem with hawkish foreign policy people is that they [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=986.0799999999999s)]
*  in the same way, by the way, that I think the war on terror did something a little [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=989.9599999999999s)]
*  weird to our politics and and and led led to Trump in some ways, like when you kind [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=993.36s)]
*  of normalize permanent war and extraordinary authorities and the executives hands. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=998.16s)]
*  I think the erosion of Israeli democracy is not unrelated to their foreign policy. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1006.28s)]
*  And I think some of the hawkish foreign policy people try to separate it. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1012.0799999999999s)]
*  Well, I don't like what Bibi does at home. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1015.8399999999999s)]
*  But, man, I love that pager operation. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1017.56s)]
*  Maybe those things are are connected. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1020.04s)]
*  You know, yeah. Yeah, I mentioned that yesterday. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1022.76s)]
*  I mean, I'm kind of like giving a steelman argument to you because I'm like I'm [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1026.36s)]
*  genuinely torn on all this. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1029.68s)]
*  And I do think it's hard to like the middle distance. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1030.84s)]
*  It's like hard to see like what you know, and I said yesterday, I was like, [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1034.52s)]
*  have we created the next the next A.I. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1038.32s)]
*  Bin Laden, you know, through all this? [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1041.8s)]
*  Like, exactly. It's hard to know. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1043.32s)]
*  OK, I do need to, though, just to just to make sure everybody's clear about the [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1046.0s)]
*  perspective they're getting. There is a report that goes around periodically about [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1050.2s)]
*  how your nickname was Hamas Rhodes in the White House. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1054.32s)]
*  Is that true? Is that accurate? [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1057.52s)]
*  Well, the funny thing is, are you representing Hamas right now? [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1059.32s)]
*  Here's the funny thing is it like we're usually when people are dunking on me [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1062.2399999999998s)]
*  about that, they act like that was something that was discovered when it's a [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1066.1999999999998s)]
*  story that I wrote in my memoir, which is Rahm Emanuel [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1069.6s)]
*  a used like nickname, me Hamas. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1075.36s)]
*  I don't know overstated. It was for a few week period when I was there was some [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1078.6799999999998s)]
*  something going on and I was seen as pro-Palestinian. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1082.84s)]
*  And it was funny. I mean, it and horrible at the same time. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1085.9199999999998s)]
*  But it was Rahm Emanuel, right? [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1089.6s)]
*  This is how he is. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1090.76s)]
*  And he would say things like, you know, Hamas over here is going to make it [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1092.44s)]
*  impossible for my kid to get a fucking bar mitzvah in Israel. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1096.16s)]
*  You know, I mean, it was that kind of tone. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1098.96s)]
*  It wasn't like literally like I supported master or even that he like thought [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1100.8s)]
*  I actually supported them. It was Rahm. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1106.12s)]
*  Rahm gets wrapped around the axle, as all the listeners saw a couple of weeks ago. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1108.04s)]
*  You know, I'm to it. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1111.56s)]
*  All right. I want to do the Trump side of this and the internal war that you [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1114.8799999999999s)]
*  referenced earlier. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1118.76s)]
*  It's it's kind of interesting. I don't know, like to me. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1121.36s)]
*  So there's the Atlantic article where Michael Shear called Trump and they talked [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1123.92s)]
*  for a couple of minutes. Then Trump took a call from Putin, which is telling [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1128.48s)]
*  connectivity about the about where we are in our society right now. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1132.72s)]
*  But I often toggle between Michael Shear and Putin. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1135.72s)]
*  Yeah. He said he said Putin. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1138.56s)]
*  Shear was asking about the criticism from Tucker and from and from Bannon at all. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1141.0s)]
*  And Trump was basically like America versus whatever I say it is. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1144.92s)]
*  And to me, I think I hate to hand it to I think that's kind of right. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1149.24s)]
*  I don't know. I think that there is like an interesting intellectual Twitter battle [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1153.36s)]
*  going on between what the Tuckerists and, you know, whatever the Mitch McConnell [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1157.48s)]
*  crowd or however you want to put it. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1162.68s)]
*  But like in the end, isn't doesn't Trump's control of the party more personality [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1164.44s)]
*  based or do you think that there's something very deep potential fissure here? [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1169.28s)]
*  What do you think? [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1173.12s)]
*  I think there's a deep fissure because essentially [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1174.0s)]
*  what is being revealed is that there are still people that that have actual [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1179.08s)]
*  differing views within the MAGA coalition. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1183.6s)]
*  And, you know, you know, Tim, Ben, anybody, you know, bulwark like these have long [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1186.16s)]
*  been fissures in the Republican Party dating back to pre World War Two. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1191.6s)]
*  Right. There's always been a kind of isolationist strain of the Republican [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1195.44s)]
*  Party with some ugly elements and then some just kind of sincere isolationist [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1201.04s)]
*  elements. And there's always been a more, you know, whatever whatever label [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1205.24s)]
*  we're going to fix to it, but essentially expansionist or interventionist or you [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1211.68s)]
*  call neoconservative wing of the party. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1216.2s)]
*  Reagan actually pretty expertly was able to bind them together in his own [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1219.68s)]
*  personality. And Trump was probably actually less pro-Israel than Biden, [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1224.8s)]
*  though you never would have known it. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1232.1200000000001s)]
*  Listening to Tom Cotton during the Biden years. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1233.2s)]
*  Totally. I mean, Reagan, we can, you know, I mean, Reagan, Monach, and Reagan, [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1236.52s)]
*  let's just say they didn't get along. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1240.0800000000002s)]
*  And and and so Trump basically bound them together by force of personality, [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1241.32s)]
*  but he never really resolved the differences. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1246.72s)]
*  He kind of always wanted it both ways. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1249.0s)]
*  So he would talk a lot about ending permanent wars and being an antiwar guy. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1250.88s)]
*  But then he would also brag about dropping the mother of all bombs on Afghanistan [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1254.96s)]
*  or getting rid of Obama's civilian casualty standards for going after [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1259.56s)]
*  certain ISIS targets. He kind of wanted to be a tough guy and being Bibi's [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1265.36s)]
*  best buddy until he wasn't. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1270.1599999999999s)]
*  But like he wanted to be the kind of tough guy that could appeal to a certain kind [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1271.76s)]
*  of hawkish vibe, even if he didn't sign on to the whole foreign policy, while [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1275.56s)]
*  essentially still being this isolationist America first or Pat Buchanan Republican. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1280.6799999999998s)]
*  And I think what we're seeing is, you know, some of the whether it's Lindsey Graham [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1285.04s)]
*  or Tucker Carlson, like they they are see Bannon, they actually these people [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1289.44s)]
*  actually believe their views. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1294.0s)]
*  You know, now the Trump voter is going to think that whatever Trump says is as [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1295.36s)]
*  Merrick as MAGA as America first, but not these not the members of Congress and [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1300.8799999999999s)]
*  the kind of leading I hesitate to call them thinkers, but talkers in the party. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1305.8799999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I guess we have to be thinkers. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1310.2s)]
*  We while we're doing Tucker, just to show a little bit from this debate, by the [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1311.6399999999999s)]
*  time this podcast is out, I think the whole Tucker interview with Ted Cruz will [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1316.84s)]
*  be up. We did get to see two little delicious clips. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1319.9599999999998s)]
*  I picked my favorite, which I want to share with you for a second. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1322.12s)]
*  And I'm noting that, boy, there are a lot of resistance people I'm following who [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1325.6799999999998s)]
*  are having strange respect for Tucker. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1330.8s)]
*  Who do I root for here? [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1333.8s)]
*  Yeah, including Tommy. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1334.8s)]
*  But let's listen to it. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1336.0s)]
*  How many people live around, by the way? [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1338.04s)]
*  I don't know the population at all. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1339.8000000000002s)]
*  No, I don't know the population. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1342.24s)]
*  You don't know the population of the country you seek to topple. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1344.4s)]
*  How many people live in Iran? [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1348.8000000000002s)]
*  Ninety two million. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1349.64s)]
*  OK, yeah, I could you not know that? [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1350.4s)]
*  I don't sit around memorizing population tables. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1354.8400000000001s)]
*  Well, it's kind of relevant because you're calling for the overthrow of the [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1357.52s)]
*  government. Why is it relevant whether it's because 90 million or 80 million or [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1360.3600000000001s)]
*  100 million? Why is that? [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1364.3600000000001s)]
*  Because you don't know anything about the country. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1365.52s)]
*  I didn't say I don't know anything about. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1367.0s)]
*  What's the ethnic mix of Iran? [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1368.3200000000002s)]
*  They are Persians and predominantly Shia. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1371.3200000000002s)]
*  OK, this is you don't know anything about Iran. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1373.8400000000001s)]
*  So I am not the Tucker Carlson expert on Iran. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1377.3200000000002s)]
*  You're a senator who's calling the government. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1381.44s)]
*  And you don't know anything about the country. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1384.44s)]
*  You're a senator that's calling for the overthrow of the government. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1386.68s)]
*  You don't know anything about the country. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1388.8000000000002s)]
*  I mean, not bad. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1389.96s)]
*  I mean, he's got a point. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1392.24s)]
*  I mean, that's almost uncomfortable to listen to. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1394.24s)]
*  Like, even though I don't have a I don't have any empathy that I can find in my [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1396.56s)]
*  body for Ted Cruz, but it's such a roasting. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1400.56s)]
*  Yeah, ironic. It's like the the the metaphor I always use in these sort of [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1404.52s)]
*  situations, it's like the Iran Iraq war. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1407.96s)]
*  You don't know who to root for. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1409.88s)]
*  And and here it's like the Iran Iraq war, but they're arguing about Iran. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1410.96s)]
*  I mean, I will say because look, we had this people said this after the Iraq war, [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1417.2s)]
*  like people didn't even know the difference between Sunnis and Shias. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1422.28s)]
*  You know, there's a great to swear for a second. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1425.0s)]
*  There's a great one of my favorite novels, The Names by Dondelillo. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1430.36s)]
*  And there's a guy makes a speech in there about how Americans learn about countries [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1433.92s)]
*  when we're in some like crisis with them and start clipping out recipes and [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1437.4s)]
*  memorizing the religion of the country. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1440.88s)]
*  There's something to that. Right. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1443.12s)]
*  And Ted Cruz is that guy. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1444.16s)]
*  I think I'd say about Tucker, he's ideologically consistent and he's actually so [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1445.84s)]
*  dovish or whatever word you want to fix to it, isolationist, that it encompasses [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1450.72s)]
*  things that I agree with like that and things I disagree with, like not wanting [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1455.92s)]
*  to support Ukraine. Right. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1459.8s)]
*  And this is where you're going to get to my Bill Kristol adjacency. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1461.04s)]
*  But but essentially I give him credit for being ideologically consistent. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1464.04s)]
*  He applies it totally across the board. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1469.96s)]
*  You know, the same logic that would lead him to not want to go to war in Iran [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1472.8s)]
*  leads him to not want to even provide weapons to a country that's fighting for [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1477.48s)]
*  its survival against Russia. Right. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1480.28s)]
*  But that's a real wing of the Republican Party. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1482.6s)]
*  And it wasn't invented by Tucker or Donald Trump. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1484.36s)]
*  Right. I mean, it goes way, way back. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1486.48s)]
*  I mean, it's actually what the Republican Party used to be. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1488.24s)]
*  You know, and I think it's where it's going. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1491.72s)]
*  I mean, it's the most potent part of the Republican Party of the base, for sure. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1494.32s)]
*  And I just I think that Trump, you know, there is a jingoism [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1498.2s)]
*  within the Republican base, too. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1504.3999999999999s)]
*  Right. And so Trump actually navigates it quite well, I think. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1506.16s)]
*  I think that the base of the party, like instinctually, doesn't want to do [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1509.12s)]
*  foreign wars, doesn't care about these people in other places. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1513.08s)]
*  There's a little bit of a racism element in it that actually, you know, and financial. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1516.3999999999999s)]
*  We shouldn't spend money. I don't care about the sand people. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1520.4799999999998s)]
*  Right. Like you hear all that when you talk to talk to Republican voters. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1523.4399999999998s)]
*  But and also, too, they want the US to be great and strong and tough and Hulk Hogan. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1527.08s)]
*  Right. And so Trump navigates that balance a little bit better than Tucker, I think. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1531.84s)]
*  But like, that's kind of where it's going. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1536.4799999999998s)]
*  It's really it's a really important debate for the future of the Republican Party [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1538.76s)]
*  in a lot of ways, because this debate has, you know, [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1542.52s)]
*  you could argue like shaped major aspects of the last century. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1547.1200000000001s)]
*  Right. You know, I mean, FDR had to kind of quash the isolationists [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1551.52s)]
*  to get Len least pass, you know. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1555.64s)]
*  And then we kind of veered from like, you know, who lost China, Republicans, [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1557.68s)]
*  which would, you know, like find a home in the weekly standard later. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1563.76s)]
*  Right. To the kind of McCarthy paranoid, you know, we're anti-communist, [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1567.8s)]
*  but we're focused within, you know, we're focused on inside this country [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1572.6399999999999s)]
*  to bury Goldwater, Goldwater hawkishness to, you know, [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1577.48s)]
*  like we business types who want to just like [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1582.48s)]
*  keep the lid on things abroad, but don't necessarily stirred up. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1586.6399999999999s)]
*  And we could keep this going. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1590.24s)]
*  But the point is that that where the Republican Party lands on this and Reagan, [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1591.3999999999999s)]
*  what he did is he could take the evangelicals [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1596.24s)]
*  and pull them into a coalition with like the hawks [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1599.0s)]
*  and obviously bring in the kind of business community or interests. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1602.48s)]
*  And there's your modern Republican Party. Right. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1607.16s)]
*  Like and now that Reagan only George H.W. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1609.44s)]
*  Bush found the Goldilocks temperature of the soup. [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1612.72s)]
*  Yeah. Well, that's the thing. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1615.96s)]
*  I mean, it was that those three three planks, right. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1617.24s)]
*  Like that was so potent electorally, you know. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1619.72s)]
*  But Trump managed to evict the hawks [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1622.0s)]
*  while expanding out enough from, you know, the the other parts [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1626.92s)]
*  to have a winning coalition, whether that's durable or not, [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1631.72s)]
*  is hugely consequential. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1635.88s)]
*  And by the way, it's remade my party like I'm probably less [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1637.56s)]
*  in the mainstream of my own party, because I think my party's [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1640.8s)]
*  gotten more hawkish under Trump because we've kind of welcomed in, you know, [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1644.0s)]
*  these exiles. So interesting. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1647.64s)]
*  I get my back up. People talk about this. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1650.28s)]
*  I get my back up when it is said, you know, like, oh, [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1652.12s)]
*  we went too far trying to appeal to Liz Cheney. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1655.76s)]
*  And like my response to that is always like, well, I don't know. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1658.36s)]
*  Liz Cheney actually wanted to cared about winning and so volunteered her time. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1661.36s)]
*  And so maybe if like the left, the isolationist leftists [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1665.52s)]
*  like had spent more time wanting to attack Trump and less time [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1669.44s)]
*  wanting to attack Kamala, maybe they would have been more visible in the campaign. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1672.24s)]
*  I don't know. You know, it's like I get a little annoyed by that. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1675.68s)]
*  But like strategically, do you think that it has hurt the Democrats to, [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1677.96s)]
*  you know, kind of tack a little bit away from you towards this, [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1682.92s)]
*  whatever you want to call it, towards the more [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1687.28s)]
*  cool, you know, interventionist elements of the coalition? [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1689.76s)]
*  I think so. [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1693.8s)]
*  And I expect we disagree about that. But essentially, I actually don't know. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1694.96s)]
*  I don't know what I wish that they would do policy wise. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1698.76s)]
*  But like politically, I think I don't I don't know that. [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1701.8400000000001s)]
*  Actually, my instinct is that it didn't really matter at all. [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1705.04s)]
*  But I'm open to being wrong about that. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1706.96s)]
*  I don't claim to know. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1708.6000000000001s)]
*  But but here's what I think is likely, which is that I want us to have a big tent. [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1710.16s)]
*  Right. So I want, you know, Liz Cheney in the tent. [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1715.6000000000001s)]
*  That's the only way you can defeat authoritarianism anyway. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1718.8s)]
*  The question is, how much do you kind of lean into it? Right. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1721.48s)]
*  So, you know, is she you're like leading surrogate at the end. [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1723.8s)]
*  And I actually think that Democrats are often solving the wrong problem [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1726.72s)]
*  on national security. [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1730.48s)]
*  The argument I would make is that Democrats kind of got beaten [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1731.28s)]
*  really bad in 2002 and 2004 on this issue [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1734.52s)]
*  and have been in a kind of permanent defensive crouch ever since. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1737.52s)]
*  And we still think that it's like a big coup [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1741.52s)]
*  that we can like try it out like a Cheney or I mean, actually, Tim, like [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1745.8799999999999s)]
*  at the do you remember at the Democratic Convention when everybody thought [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1751.52s)]
*  the special guest on the last night was going to be like Beyonce? [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1754.16s)]
*  Yeah, and it was like Leon Panetta. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1757.0s)]
*  It was it was a hawkish Democratic secretary of defense. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1759.16s)]
*  And and and I think that misreads the electorate. [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1762.52s)]
*  I think the electorate actually doesn't want to see national security validation [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1765.44s)]
*  associated with like the war on terror era. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1769.8799999999999s)]
*  You know, I worked Barack Obama. [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1772.44s)]
*  I mean, I'll say this, like [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1774.84s)]
*  every candidate except Joe Biden since 2004 has run as an anti-war candidate. [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1776.92s)]
*  Like Barack Obama's entire campaign in 2008, right, was against Hillary Clinton, [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1781.72s)]
*  having voted for the Iraq war. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1786.48s)]
*  That's how he got elected president. Right. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1787.52s)]
*  I was just talking to somebody yesterday. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1789.44s)]
*  I was like, had Hillary voted against the Iraq war? [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1790.52s)]
*  Probably Hillary wins the primary. [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1792.92s)]
*  And we're in a whole different world. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1795.16s)]
*  Like the whole universe is different from from there. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1796.76s)]
*  Maybe Trump is a Democratic president. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1799.24s)]
*  So yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1800.96s)]
*  I certainly don't know. I think that happened. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1802.52s)]
*  Yeah, no kidding. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1804.16s)]
*  But like but like seriously, like I think I as someone who's on the inside, [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1805.2s)]
*  there's no way Obama wins out without that Iraq war vote. Right. [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1809.68s)]
*  So you have Obama twice and he's running against wars [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1812.56s)]
*  and he's willing to take heat for not getting into certain wars. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1816.16s)]
*  Then you have Trump Biden in this kind of bizarre election [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1820.8s)]
*  where I don't think he would have won without Covid. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1824.24s)]
*  And he wasn't running as like a kind of war guy either. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1827.24s)]
*  But he was the anti war. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1831.04s)]
*  So the point is that the Democrats [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1832.8s)]
*  are worried about the wrong politics on these issues. [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1836.6s)]
*  They seem to be stuck in this permanent 2002 midterm election. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1839.84s)]
*  And I wish they wouldn't do that. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1844.76s)]
*  I wish that like now I would. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1846.0s)]
*  I don't understand why the Democrats aren't saying, hey, [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1848.3999999999999s)]
*  Donald Trump said he would end all three of these wars, you know, Ukraine, [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1851.56s)]
*  Gaza, Iran, they're all getting worse. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1855.4399999999998s)]
*  And we should not go to war in Iran. [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1857.4399999999998s)]
*  Bibi was wrong to bomb Iran. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1859.8s)]
*  Like I just it's right there. [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1862.36s)]
*  It's what it's a 60 18 issue based on the polling, the U.G.P. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1864.84s)]
*  I saw and Democrats are still afraid to go there because and they think, [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1868.56s)]
*  you know, they don't want to cross Bibi or they don't want to look weak or [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1874.48s)]
*  or maybe this will work out OK. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1877.68s)]
*  And then they'll they'll they'll they'll say we were wrong. [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1879.72s)]
*  You don't see any of that. [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1883.3200000000002s)]
*  You know, like one thing I see about Republicans is that they're not afraid [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1884.28s)]
*  to take positions, you know, in the same way the Democrats are on this stuff. [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1888.4s)]
*  All right. Neocon listeners and Sarah Longwell, press the fast forward [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1893.4s)]
*  15 seconds button really quick. [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1896.0s)]

*  Trump stuff, not foreign policy related. [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1988.28s)]
*  Just because there's a political article last night that's so delicious. [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1991.52s)]
*  There's this creepy video. [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1994.08s)]
*  And I don't know if I put it on the podcast. [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1995.52s)]
*  I know me and Sam talked about it on YouTube. [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1997.32s)]
*  People can check out Tulsi did this creepy, like three minute [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=1998.76s)]
*  on video about the specter of nuclear war. [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2001.8s)]
*  Yeah. And I thought it was Russian propaganda, but it turns out maybe it was [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2004.3600000000001s)]
*  she was trying to do internal propaganda against the hawks within the administration. [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2008.1200000000001s)]
*  I don't know. Trump got pissed about it, [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2012.2s)]
*  apparently, according to the political report, started yelling at her. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2014.88s)]
*  And and then he got he got pissed again because a reporter asked her asked him [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2017.88s)]
*  about her assessment, his director of national intelligence assessment [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2022.24s)]
*  that Iran's not close to a nuclear weapon, actually, during a gaggle. [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2025.44s)]
*  And and I just I wonder what you make of all that. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2029.56s)]
*  Well, first of all, that video, [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2033.76s)]
*  when I'm in like, you know, whatever gulag they're going to send us to, Tim, [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2036.6s)]
*  if I'm in a white padded room, I think they'll just be piping that video in. [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2040.96s)]
*  And I'll be like huddled in the corner, like trying to hide from the sound of it. [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2044.3600000000001s)]
*  It's that weird and creepy. [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2047.48s)]
*  I just watched the Mauritanian. [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2050.12s)]
*  So yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly. [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2051.72s)]
*  And so I shouldn't even laugh about it. [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2053.68s)]
*  But the the I think she is just [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2055.28s)]
*  like she she's simultaneously of the, you know, [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2060.12s)]
*  isolationist or dovish wing. [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2065.2s)]
*  But she's also just a very weird person. [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2067.56s)]
*  Like like like that that video, [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2069.96s)]
*  I think was more eccentric because of it's it's just strangeness. [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2073.2400000000002s)]
*  And also, like it seemed like she just learned that Hiroshima happened or something [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2076.64s)]
*  because she's describing Hiroshima as if, you know, that like a kindergartener. [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2080.8399999999997s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. Like it was a PSA for a kindergartener. [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2084.92s)]
*  Exactly. And and so what we don't know that what we don't know behind the scenes, [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2088.64s)]
*  you can't see is just how weird is it to have Tulsi in your tent [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2094.04s)]
*  versus how much is this now? [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2098.16s)]
*  What I will say that is relevant to the broader discussion [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2099.7999999999997s)]
*  is Tulsi is also like Tucker, a true believer in this stuff. [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2104.08s)]
*  So if Trump thought that Tulsi at DNI would just give him the information he wanted, [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2107.9199999999996s)]
*  well, that might be what's not happening. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2112.44s)]
*  And I actually as someone who's warned about Tulsi a lot, I actually. [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2114.56s)]
*  I was more concerned about her, the weirdness of her views and her giving Trump [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2120.7599999999998s)]
*  what he wanted on Russia, you know, like, you know, the bad side that she has, [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2124.44s)]
*  that she would spin up fake stuff on behalf of Russia rather than not give him [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2129.2799999999997s)]
*  what he wanted on Iran. [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2132.68s)]
*  Exactly. So it didn't kind of occur to me to be like, well, actually, Tulsi, [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2133.96s)]
*  you know, really does believe this stuff. I've talked to Tulsi [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2138.3199999999997s)]
*  the way back when. And and she's just not going to give him what he wants in Iran. [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2142.0s)]
*  By the way, this is not a new thing. [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2146.2s)]
*  I mean, the George W. [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2147.7999999999997s)]
*  Bush administration famously and the New York on listeners will are already [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2149.68s)]
*  arguing with the podcast. But in 2007, they turned it off by now. [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2153.24s)]
*  Yeah. 2007, remember that Bush administration came out with this [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2156.7999999999997s)]
*  national intelligence estimate that Iran abandoned its nuclear weapons program [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2160.68s)]
*  in 2003, the effort to weaponize their nuclear program. [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2164.7599999999998s)]
*  And the neocons went nuts then saying that was the wrong assessment. [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2168.3599999999997s)]
*  But as far as I know, the U.S. [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2171.8799999999997s)]
*  intelligence community has not changed its assessment since that NIE in 2007. [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2173.72s)]
*  Wow. That that like there. [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2178.3999999999996s)]
*  Yes, there. People should be get the difference here. [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2180.04s)]
*  It's one thing to have a nuclear program to get fuel. [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2183.6s)]
*  It's another thing to kind of do the work to weaponize that fuel and put on a warhead. [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2185.48s)]
*  And so Tulsi is not she's just representing [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2189.92s)]
*  what has been the view of the U.S. intelligence community since 2007. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2192.92s)]
*  But I think what we're learning is unlike, you know, I've no doubt that Dan [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2196.36s)]
*  Bongino and Kash Patel are going to give Trump exactly the answer. [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2199.88s)]
*  She wants to every question. [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2203.48s)]
*  I don't think Tulsi is, and that might be part of what's bothering him. [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2204.88s)]
*  I want to talk about some domestic stuff and our creeping authoritarianism here at home. [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2209.88s)]
*  The arrest in New York, your way you grew up, you know, don't live there anymore. [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2214.84s)]
*  You're a West Coast man where I am in New York right now. [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2218.64s)]
*  And this video of ICE [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2221.7599999999998s)]
*  arresting Brad Lander is running from is a comptroller. [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2227.04s)]
*  It's running for mayor of New York. [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2231.08s)]
*  And it's like this there's a man in like an evil Spider-Man mask. [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2234.12s)]
*  Like you can't see any part of his face, like grabbing him. [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2238.8399999999997s)]
*  And he's being pulled and manhandled and handcuffed. [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2241.6s)]
*  And he's just always asking for is a warrant to demonstrate [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2244.3199999999997s)]
*  that they can arrest this constituent, I guess, who had shown up to ICE court, was not [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2248.36s)]
*  ducking the that was not ducking the immigration police, our new federal immigration police. [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2255.36s)]
*  Obviously, this comes on the heels, what we saw with Padilla, et cetera. [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2262.12s)]
*  What is your what's your threat level right now? [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2265.12s)]
*  What do you make of that? [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2267.24s)]
*  It's really high. And I got to say, if I had to vote here, I'm kind of a Brad Lander. [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2268.48s)]
*  You know, I love a lost cause progressive, you know, like you have to be your number one. [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2272.6s)]
*  I think he'd be my number one. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2276.7599999999998s)]
*  And I'm going to do the lost cause. [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2277.68s)]
*  Neil Lib, people ask me as I didn't say on the Zoran pod who I would put number one, [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2279.6s)]
*  it's Zellner Myrie. [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2283.56s)]
*  So we're both we'll both do our laws as candidates. [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2284.68s)]
*  We could do a trade right now. [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2287.7599999999998s)]
*  I'll put Brad to cross the doors. [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2288.7599999999998s)]
*  My threat level is very high. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2295.04s)]
*  I mean, look, I always think it's a useful exercise to step back and be like, if someone [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2296.3599999999997s)]
*  told you a few years ago that the Marines would be in the streets of Los Angeles and [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2301.8799999999997s)]
*  like plainclothes goons would be like tackling Democratic politicians and handcuffing them. [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2306.84s)]
*  We'd be like, what the fuck is going on? [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2314.1200000000003s)]
*  That's crazy. I think the degree of normalization worries me [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2315.48s)]
*  because honestly, like as you know, someone who's looked at authoritarians in other [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2320.84s)]
*  countries, like that, like we often hold up Hungary is a scary place where we have an [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2324.96s)]
*  illiberal leader because he's kind of run the playbook of consolidating kind of corrupt [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2330.28s)]
*  power over huge chunks of society. [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2334.48s)]
*  This doesn't they don't have plainclothes dudes wrestling opposition politicians as [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2337.56s)]
*  ground handcuffing them while deploying the Hungarian military in the streets of cities. [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2342.72s)]
*  Like we're past them on the spectrum here. [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2348.4s)]
*  You know, we're like past Hungary headed to Turkey, you know, and and I think we we [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2351.0s)]
*  kind of can't get our minds around that as Americans. [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2355.8s)]
*  And we still see these as like eccentric things that are happening when they're clearly [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2358.48s)]
*  not eccentric. Like this is a systematic effort to remake the use of violence in this [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2362.28s)]
*  country. And this is the point I made about Padilla. [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2367.0400000000004s)]
*  I was like, you know, in a different world, you could have made the case that this was [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2369.52s)]
*  just a couple of agents who got a little hot, didn't recognize them, acted inappropriately, [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2373.8s)]
*  you know, and they'll be reprimanded or whatever. [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2378.84s)]
*  And even Corey Lewandowski at the moment was like, guys, let's dial it back a little bit. [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2381.88s)]
*  Like, that's the more positive spin of that situation. [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2386.92s)]
*  But like, you can't it's impossible to believe that spin in the context of everything else [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2389.7999999999997s)]
*  that's happening with the military, DHS, ICE, and yes, you know, these other arrests. [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2394.52s)]
*  Yes. And that's what worries me is that this is and again, I also think that there's a [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2399.36s)]
*  sense that in some places, I mean, you know, in the non alarmist community, that this is [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2404.56s)]
*  temporary, you know, that, well, Trump said he's going to deport a bunch of people. [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2412.6s)]
*  And so it kind of looks bad. [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2417.8s)]
*  But it's someday the National Guard will go home and these ICE guys will have hit their [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2419.52s)]
*  quotas for Stephen Miller. [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2423.32s)]
*  I don't see anything temporary about this. [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2424.88s)]
*  You know, once you kind of cross the Rubicon into like normalizing troops being deployed [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2428.92s)]
*  in the street for the political purposes of the president, once you had the authority [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2434.5600000000004s)]
*  to just arrest whoever you want and maybe deport them, maybe dis-arrest them, intimidate [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2439.04s)]
*  them, at least with this administration, I don't see them like relinquishing that [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2443.56s)]
*  authority, you know. If anything, I see it creeping in further and further spaces. [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2449.52s)]
*  And again, that's we have to stop seeing these things as temporary and start being like, [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2454.6s)]
*  huh, like, what if the National Guard doesn't go home? [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2460.24s)]
*  Like, what if the ICE raids never stop? [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2462.88s)]
*  Like, what if this is just a tool of Donald Trump's power that he's when has Donald Trump [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2465.72s)]
*  ever given up something that makes him more powerful? [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2472.08s)]
*  I want to ask you what the political implications of all this and like how Democrats can fight [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2477.08s)]
*  it. But but you saying that I think maybe there's a bigger conversation should happen [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2480.04s)]
*  first. We're on cable news the other day together and you kind of you made a point that was [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2486.12s)]
*  kind of at the end of a comment that was sort of an aside. [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2491.68s)]
*  And I was like, if I have a follow up on what Ben just said, I feel like that, you know, [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2494.64s)]
*  I always move on to me or someone from my fucking bullshit or whatever. [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2498.48s)]
*  And you ended up by saying that you think there should be a real conversation about [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2501.2400000000002s)]
*  concerns that they use the Insurrection Act or whatever to impact or cancel. [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2506.08s)]
*  Maybe I remember the exact word you use elections going up in the midterms. [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2513.84s)]
*  What's your level of worry about that? [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2518.48s)]
*  Because it was one it was a rare moment where somebody said something and I was like, huh, [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2520.48s)]
*  I'm on the less alarmist side of that one. [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2524.2s)]
*  And I'm curious why Ben went there. [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2526.16s)]
*  I don't think it's likely at all. [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2530.0s)]
*  I think elections are the most complicated piece in some ways to mess with because they're [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2532.96s)]
*  administered by states and it's this kind of labyrinth of bureaucracy in a good way in [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2536.72s)]
*  this case. But the two things I'd say are one, if they were to do something to mess with [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2542.12s)]
*  either the midterms or the next election, it would be through the doorway of national [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2548.2s)]
*  security type authorities, whether under the Insurrection Act or under some other [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2556.3199999999997s)]
*  declaration of a national emergency, which they've gotten very comfortable declaring. [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2562.24s)]
*  Right. I mean, they've declared a national emergency at the border and that's justified [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2566.04s)]
*  all this other stuff that they're currently doing. [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2571.7599999999998s)]
*  But the because the scenario I give you, Tim, is it what if they they allow the midterm [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2573.7200000000003s)]
*  elections to go forward? [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2581.44s)]
*  But then afterwards, after they lose, they say, well, there's mass fraud. [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2583.1600000000003s)]
*  And so we don't think that this new Congress should be seated. [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2589.2400000000002s)]
*  Dan Bongino and Cash Patel go out and say, yes, there's fraud and we're going to launch [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2592.7200000000003s)]
*  all these investigations of it. [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2596.84s)]
*  Mike Johnson doesn't have to necessarily seat the new Congress. [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2598.64s)]
*  And then the military is kind of in the streets quashing the protests. [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2603.24s)]
*  And then the protests of the election are the basis for declaring some national emergency. [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2607.04s)]
*  Right. [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2613.04s)]
*  Some bulwark darkness here. [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2614.04s)]
*  That feels possible, if not plausible to me. [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2615.04s)]
*  You know, like, and again, not zero percent. [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2619.56s)]
*  I'm not saying maybe it doesn't feel 51 percent. [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2622.56s)]
*  So that's going to happen. [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2624.7599999999998s)]
*  It's not zero. [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2625.7599999999998s)]
*  It's an uncomfortably high percent. [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2626.76s)]
*  And the reason these protests have been so important is the more the use of the military [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2627.76s)]
*  against protest is normalized, the more possible the scenario I just said becomes. [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2634.36s)]
*  You know, they were they deployed the military in L.A. [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2641.5600000000004s)]
*  where I live because of protests that were not violent. [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2645.1600000000003s)]
*  And if that becomes normal, then all of a sudden, by the time they do that, they're [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2649.6400000000003s)]
*  going to be dead in the water. [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2655.64s)]
*  You know, by the time they do that, you know, in a couple of years, if they do it, the frog [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2656.64s)]
*  will be dead in the water, you know, to use an off to you abused metaphor. [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2662.2799999999997s)]
*  OK, well, well, that's going to keep some people up at night with some night sweats. [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2668.2799999999997s)]
*  But let's let's assume that the zero that the outcome doesn't come to pass. [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2673.08s)]
*  Yeah, we have relatively normal elections. [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2677.08s)]
*  Let's then within that construct talk about the democratic response to this. [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2679.08s)]
*  Like that picture, I'm just I'm stuck with that picture of Lander getting manhandled [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2683.12s)]
*  with the dude that you cannot even see his eyeballs like he has. [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2688.68s)]
*  He's so masked. Right. [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2692.36s)]
*  It's not like he's wearing a covid mask and he's got the full like I'm robbing a bank [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2693.7999999999997s)]
*  mask on, you know. Yeah. [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2698.92s)]
*  And I just I think that this could be something that the Democrats could get traction on [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2700.36s)]
*  and should. And there's a there's a there's another class of folks out there in the [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2707.36s)]
*  strategist class are like, focus on the Medicaid cuts or whatever. [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2711.2s)]
*  This is a loser for Democrats. [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2715.3999999999996s)]
*  I mean, not not don't talk about it, but deemphasize it. [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2716.8799999999997s)]
*  Where do you fall on that question? [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2719.9199999999996s)]
*  I fall on the like, take this on and emphasize it. [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2722.12s)]
*  Look, I hate this idea when you see Democrats online being like, you know, Trump is [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2725.3599999999997s)]
*  distracting you, you know, with he's going to war to distract you from his tax bill or [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2731.68s)]
*  something. No, no. Trump is just doing a bunch of different things. [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2737.68s)]
*  What he cares about. [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2740.08s)]
*  We can do the same. Like, I don't believe that if everybody's only talking about tax, [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2741.52s)]
*  you know, tax giveaways to billionaires, that somehow we can't deliver that message. [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2747.4s)]
*  In fact, actually, I would argue that if all we do is robotically talk about the big, [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2752.24s)]
*  beautiful bill, we'll look political. [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2758.08s)]
*  We'll look like we're a bunch of political consultants who don't believe anything. [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2760.08s)]
*  I think there's genuine reasons to do what Brad Lander did. [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2763.68s)]
*  But also, I think I said this on the same segment you were referring to earlier. [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2768.2s)]
*  I know in my familiarity with the Republican coalition, there is a genuine anti-government, [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2774.2799999999997s)]
*  you know, black helicopter kind of crowd. [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2779.0s)]
*  Yeah, go after the don't tread on me crowd. [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2781.8799999999997s)]
*  Yes. Go after those guys. [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2783.9199999999996s)]
*  You want to find a new way to have conversations with people that don't grab party haven't [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2785.3199999999997s)]
*  had a conversation with in a while. [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2788.6s)]
*  This is big government on steroids. [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2790.3199999999997s)]
*  This is the black helicopters actually landing in your community. [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2792.72s)]
*  Right. [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2795.64s)]
*  And so I think you can make a stand on principle. [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2796.2s)]
*  I'm going to reach the Joe Rogan, the O'Vann listener. [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2798.56s)]
*  Like there's a percentage of them, I think that are as a percentage of them that probably [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2800.8399999999997s)]
*  like the fucking masked man going after the libs they hate. [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2805.16s)]
*  But I think that I am pretty confident that there's also a percentage of them that are [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2808.6s)]
*  like, whoa, this is fucking this is weird. [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2812.8799999999997s)]
*  I don't like this. [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2816.2s)]
*  I don't want agents coming to my door. [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2817.04s)]
*  I think that's right. [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2819.16s)]
*  I think that's right. [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2819.96s)]
*  And I think that there's also people, you know, and it's this is anecdotal so far, so [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2821.56s)]
*  I don't want to make too much of one anecdote or two anecdotes. [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2826.72s)]
*  But there are definitely people that did not think the deportations were going to be like [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2829.08s)]
*  the waitress in the local diner has been there for 20 years or the kid on my kid soccer team. [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2833.8399999999997s)]
*  You know, they thought they genuinely believed Trump that the deportations were going to [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2840.7599999999998s)]
*  be. I talked to Van Leithen about this last night. [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2845.3999999999996s)]
*  Is that boxer is from SoCal. [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2846.9199999999996s)]
*  Ryan Garcia, who is a big Trumper, who's Mexican heritage, who has been speaking out about [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2848.6s)]
*  this. [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2854.24s)]
*  Yeah. And I think that, look, the border stuff, you can still be for like a totally secured [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2855.24s)]
*  border. Like this is so evidently going beyond that. [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2861.7599999999998s)]
*  This has nothing to do with the border, you know. [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2864.8s)]
*  I think that my brand association with Zbiotics is seemingly a little bit different from the [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2872.68s)]
*  organization with Zbiotics is seeming pretty strong these days. [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2877.24s)]
*  I feel like every time I go out to the bar, somebody comes up to me and asks me if I took [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2880.12s)]
*  my Zbiotics probiotic pre-alcohol drink. [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2885.64s)]
*  And I got to tell you, sometimes it's yes, I'm working on it. [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2888.24s)]
*  Sometimes like last night, I went to see Modest Mouse at the Orpheum here in New Orleans. [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2891.6s)]
*  Shout out to Margaret McMullen and other folks I saw out there. [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2898.52s)]
*  And I kind of wasn't familiar with Modest Mouse's game, it turns out. [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2902.6s)]
*  And I was planning on, you know, just kind of keeping it chill. [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2907.0s)]
*  Ended up having three white claws. [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2910.2000000000003s)]
*  Probably should have done Zbiotics. [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2912.2400000000002s)]
*  Zbiotics, free alcohol probiotic drink is the world's first genetically engineered probiotic. [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2913.5600000000004s)]
*  It was invented by PhD scientists to tackle rough mornings after drinking. [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2917.5600000000004s)]
*  Here's how it works. When you drink, alcohol gets converted into a toxic byproduct in the [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2921.2400000000002s)]
*  gut. It's that byproduct, not dehydration, that's to blame for rough days after drinking. [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2925.0800000000004s)]
*  Pre-alcohol produces an enzyme to break this byproduct down. [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2930.28s)]
*  Just remember to make pre-alcohol your first drink of the night, drink responsibly, and [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2933.1600000000003s)]
*  you'll feel your best tomorrow. [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2936.4s)]
*  So summer's here, which means more opportunities to celebrate the warm weather. [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2938.28s)]
*  Before that backyard barbecue brew, glass of rosé, watching the sunset at the beach or [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2943.0s)]
*  cocktail by the campfire. [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2949.2400000000002s)]
*  Don't forget your Zbiotics pre-alcohol. [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2950.32s)]
*  Drink one before drinking and wake up feeling great and ready to take on the next day and [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2952.2400000000002s)]

*  assassination, the assassination attempt, kind of the response from the right about that. [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2985.3599999999997s)]
*  I mean, there are just so many ways to go about it. [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2990.88s)]
*  Like I'm curious your thoughts on the domestic terror side, but also this disinformation [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2993.6s)]
*  and these folks living in this alternate reality where they convince themselves that it's [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=2998.0s)]
*  leftists and that might justify more violence. [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=3003.76s)]
*  I just I'd like to hear you cook on that for a couple of minutes. [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=3006.32s)]
*  Yeah, man, I this is the scariest stuff that's happening, right? [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=3008.8s)]
*  I mean, this is when you know, when you have political violence becoming normal again, [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=3013.04s)]
*  from whether it's like the troops in the streets or whether it's a vigilante guy in Minnesota, [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=3019.52s)]
*  you just don't know how you put that Pandora back in the box. [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=3024.7999999999997s)]
*  And I have to say the I'll be honest, like I don't know what to do about this because, [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=3031.44s)]
*  okay, the national security guy in me is like, well, you know, this we'd be treating this [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=3042.32s)]
*  like a radicalization problem if a Muslim did this, you know, we'd be, you know, we'd [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=3048.6400000000003s)]
*  essentially have a task force to study online radicalization and set up some, you know, [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=3053.76s)]
*  goons at the DHS to hunt over, you know, laptops and figure out what's happening. [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=3060.32s)]
*  You cannot, you know, like, that's obviously not going to happen with the Trump administration. [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=3066.48s)]
*  And these people are so stuck in the cycle of their information that the United States Center [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=3070.88s)]
*  probably believes the crazy shit that Mike Lee put out there. [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=3077.6800000000003s)]
*  I don't know that there's any alternative beyond. [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=3082.1600000000003s)]
*  I guess what I'd say is the answer to me is not to kind of make fun of it online, [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=3087.44s)]
*  which is what people sometimes do. It's to take it deadly seriously, and to just relentlessly try [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=3091.6000000000004s)]
*  to communicate the truth of things. And the other thing I've learned about this, Tim, [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=3097.2s)]
*  from dealing with Russian disinformation is the Russians were very well aware that first movers [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=3102.08s)]
*  when the information war. And so my favorite anecdote of this was when that plane was shot down [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=3106.7999999999997s)]
*  MH 17 over Ukraine, and during the Obama administration, the Russians immediately put [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=3111.8399999999997s)]
*  out all these conspiracy theories, you know, the Ukrainians shot it down, the Americans shot it [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=3117.68s)]
*  down, like, there's a crash, when clearly they had their guys had shot this plane down. Yeah. [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=3121.2s)]
*  But well, by the time the Dutch investigation was done, like two years later, to determine that, [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=3126.72s)]
*  like anybody who searched online found just a flood of Russian information, we are too slow [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=3133.04s)]
*  to go out and be like, hey, this guy was a Trump supporter, you know, so while [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=3139.2s)]
*  This is an unpopular but important point. In the democracy space, there's a lot of people that's [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=3144.0s)]
*  like, it's important for us to be extremely accurate, and to get things right and to push [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=3149.68s)]
*  back, you know, and I'm not I'm not pushing for inaccuracy. But I kind of made a similar [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=3154.56s)]
*  provocative point at one of these dumb panels that you do recently, where I was like, I don't know, [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=3158.88s)]
*  maybe our side needs people that are pushing out shit that is a little bit, a little bit reckless, [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=3163.36s)]
*  immediately, to combat it. And maybe that's wrong. I don't know. But it's like, [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=3170.4s)]
*  that's why I say I don't know. But I wouldn't at least let's surface this point. Because [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=3175.2s)]
*  while they're putting out this guy was a socialist, why can't Tim Walz or somebody like that be like, [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=3179.7599999999998s)]
*  hey, this guy, you know, whatever the best, you know, he posted all this Trump stuff, or he he [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=3184.64s)]
*  voted for Trump or he was anti gay speech in Africa, or whatever. Yeah, he gave this anti gay [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=3189.2s)]
*  anti trans speech. I mean, first of all, this guy is like weirdly made in a laboratory for 2025 [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=3193.76s)]
*  America, right? Like, private security contractor, slash evangelist hates trans people. He's posted [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=3199.04s)]
*  West Bank, Gaza, everything was in this guy's online footprint. But why not just be like beat [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=3206.8s)]
*  Mike Lee to the punch here, and be like, hey, we're still going to gather the facts, we're still [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=3212.0s)]
*  going to put out the full information. And I know people all the compromises his prosecution. Okay, [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=3216.0s)]
*  there's complexity here. I acknowledge that. I do know that one of the reasons why we constantly lose [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=3221.04s)]
*  based on my experience with Russia information wars, is it's speed wins, not truth or even volume [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=3227.52s)]
*  or efficacy. Yeah, the context I was doing this and now I remember was that plane crash, it was the [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=3233.36s)]
*  Reagan plane crash, when they immediately were out there saying like, Dei was a black woman. And [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=3238.32s)]
*  that was the reason why and I was like, why, you know, couldn't people on our side immediately go [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=3243.28s)]
*  like Sean Duffy's fault. Look at it. He's only in there for three days. And there's already a plane [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=3248.32s)]
*  crash. Anyway, we're running out of time. So I don't want to I don't want to belabor the point [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=3252.1600000000003s)]
*  of the book too long. And we did a full hour on it on at one of these conferences, which is on [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=3257.1200000000003s)]
*  YouTube, I'll put it in the show notes. So people are intrigued by this little taster, they can go [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=3263.1200000000003s)]
*  watch the whole thing. But I really loved it, the book after the fall. And, and, and because it was [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=3266.88s)]
*  a lot about you grappling with broadly our American mistakes, which is encompassing over the mistakes [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=3275.6s)]
*  of the Obama era, right? Yeah. And at the same time, looking at the threats around the world [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=3283.04s)]
*  that are increasing from China, Russia, all these little mini trumps everywhere, and saying, God, [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=3289.44s)]
*  for all of our flaws, that we should address, like what comes after us seems bad in every potential [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=3294.48s)]
*  alternative. And that was kind of the Bill Kristolish part of it on this. And so and then [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=3301.52s)]
*  you also kind of talk to these people fighting resistance. So anyway, give people just a quick [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=3306.2400000000002s)]
*  summary of that and what the lessons are. Well, yeah, I mean, I looked at how we got here with [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=3310.64s)]
*  authoritarianism in, you know, Hungary, Russia, China, the US through the eyes of [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=3317.6s)]
*  people who are opponents to authoritarianism, Hungarian opposition, actually, Alexei Navalny [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=3324.3199999999997s)]
*  was kind of my character in Russia, some pretty, you know, the Hong Kong protest movement. And again, [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=3328.88s)]
*  this is, I think, where the bulwark audience, even the Bill Kristol, bulwark audience, I believe [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=3334.16s)]
*  in liberal, liberal democracy, you might say liberal, I mean, you know, the small l liberal [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=3340.08s)]
*  democracy. I believe in open societies, I believe that a world order in Russia's image or China's [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=3343.92s)]
*  image would be worse than the deeply flawed world order of the United States the last 80 years, [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=3352.16s)]
*  right. And that's actually a pretty there's there's an important point, actually, because [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=3358.56s)]
*  there are people that don't agree with that on the last actually. Yeah. No. And I, I actually feel [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=3363.76s)]
*  like it's been unraveling, obviously, and it's getting worse out there as it unravels, right. [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=3370.72s)]
*  And actually, some of my criticism of what's happened in Gaza, I don't think Gaza could happen, [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=3378.08s)]
*  like 10 years ago, you know, part of that is actually the unraveling of the rules, [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=3383.8399999999997s)]
*  based order, you know, and so even I can even make a left wing argument for some of these things. [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=3388.0s)]
*  I think the lessons that that I take from that book are ultimately, and this is actually where [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=3394.72s)]
*  I made I have some overlap and some difference, I think, with, you know, the, the crystal wing of [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=3403.4399999999996s)]
*  the podcast listenership. The overlap is, I truly believe that what we do at home is the most [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=3410.24s)]
*  important thing to reverberate around the world, you know, and actually, this is why [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=3416.32s)]
*  in the civil rights movement, you know, some of the biggest allies of the civil rights movement [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=3425.1200000000003s)]
*  were people who were like, hey, if we want to win the Cold War, we got to stop being fucking [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=3429.44s)]
*  hypocrites here in the United States, you know, right. That was actually like a powerful argument [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=3432.96s)]
*  that people brought to bear for legislative change, and legal changes in this country. [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=3437.44s)]
*  And so, and I, that was, if you talk to Alexei Navalny, if you talk to Hungarian opposition, [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=3443.2s)]
*  you talk to these Hong Kong protesters, sure, they may have wanted certain things from US foreign [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=3448.48s)]
*  policy, but I remember Navalny just telling me like, I don't want your sanctions, I want your [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=3452.64s)]
*  example, because I've been making an argument my whole life, that a democratic society produces [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=3456.56s)]
*  leaders who aren't corrupt and put the interests of the people first. And fucking Trump gives a [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=3462.9599999999996s)]
*  taxi driver in Moscow, the immediate rebuttal, and which is basically what Putin's been saying, [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=3468.16s)]
*  Putin doesn't say his system is perfect. He just says, well, everybody's system is the same. So [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=3472.8799999999997s)]
*  you might as well have a strong man who hates kind of the same people that you do, right. [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=3477.3599999999997s)]
*  And so the first lesson is that who we are is in how we organize our own society and democracy [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=3481.12s)]
*  is the most important influence we can have in winning competitions abroad, winning the Cold War, [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=3488.3999999999996s)]
*  or winning the next Cold War, or whatever we want to call it, you know. And the other thing I take [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=3495.28s)]
*  away that's hopeful, because there's a lot of dark stuff I can take away about, you know, technology [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=3501.28s)]
*  and, you know, how it's transformed the lines. There's plenty of darkness. Obviously, I wouldn't [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=3505.84s)]
*  have liked the book if there was no dark. Yeah, it's super dark. So I'm just trying to get positive [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=3512.2400000000002s)]
*  lessons. There's a lot of solidarity out there. I believe there are more of us, us being like people [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=3515.84s)]
*  who want that kind of world than them being the kind of strong men in the creeps. But we're not [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=3520.64s)]
*  wired in with each other enough. Like, you know, Steve Bannon, these guys have built like an actual [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=3526.8799999999997s)]
*  community of solidarity across far right movements. And some other people have built [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=3534.3199999999997s)]
*  solidarity across autocratic leaders, you know. And we tend to argue with each other, you know, [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=3539.2s)]
*  instead of just like charging up the hill, you know, and I appeal to the people that, you know, [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=3545.6s)]
*  piss on maybe on this podcast. Like, if you spend time being mad about that, we're going to get, [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=3550.16s)]
*  we have no shot. You know, and I apply that to myself, too. Like, I have to accept allies, [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=3555.04s)]
*  you know, like, because without them, you're going to get crushed, because that's what they're [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=3559.92s)]
*  counting on is dividing their opposition. Yeah. The other thing I took from it, I mean, that was [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=3563.52s)]
*  positive, so we can leave it there was, and that I am that informs my thinking on what we need to do [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=3568.3999999999996s)]
*  now is all of the heroes that you were talking to who are fighting Orban and Putin and she, [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=3573.92s)]
*  like, at least maybe in your book, there was very little conversation about like, [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=3580.96s)]
*  is our adverse advocacy going to pull well with the median person in Hong Kong? [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=3586.64s)]
*  Like, that was not it. No, it's like, it's like in the face of authoritarian threat, [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=3592.7200000000003s)]
*  like, resistance and opposition for the sake of it is good, because that is needed to stop it. [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=3596.88s)]
*  And and and and what you just said, like, bringing in allies from across the spectrum is good. [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=3602.48s)]
*  And you know, it's not worth, you know, nitpicking over. And then we can figure out the rest when we [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=3608.32s)]
*  have a stable democracy about what you know, the best TV ad is to run in in the Columbus market, [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=3614.0s)]
*  you know, that's right. And and I and I like that mindset. I think that's an important mindset [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=3620.32s)]
*  that people lose here. Yeah, it is both righteous and right to say that what happened to Brad [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=3625.52s)]
*  Landers wrong and not worry about whether it's distracting us from the big, beautiful bill [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=3630.8s)]
*  messaging. All right, final thing you got to go. As I said, the final segment, I do this with Tommy [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=3635.36s)]
*  famously, George W. Bush was quizzed by a local TV reporter about world leaders. And he did not answer [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=3640.0s)]
*  the questions and you correctly and you and your elk mocked him about it for years. And so you will [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=3645.6000000000004s)]
*  receive a world leader quiz now to end the podcast. Are you coming? Yes, I'm ready. Here we go. The [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=3651.2000000000003s)]
*  leader of Pakistan. Well, Imran Khan is in jail. The the the actual leadership of Pakistan is the [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=3656.48s)]
*  chief of staff of the army. And I don't know his his name actually right now. I don't. But that's [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=3667.6s)]
*  the actual power. So Dari is the president. Well, yeah, but he's our Dari is the prime minister. [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=3672.48s)]
*  You know, he's the duly elected leader. Yeah. I guess the point I'm making is that I don't think [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=3677.84s)]
*  that and Zardari is a deeply strange guy who we you know, who's been around forever. But the [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=3684.56s)]
*  actual leadership of the country to me is the military and the chief of staff of the army, [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=3692.72s)]
*  because it's essentially a military dictatorship of the civilian front. And I don't know the name [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=3697.12s)]
*  of the chief of staff. A nuanced answer. We're gonna let you off the hook. This one is going [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=3702.24s)]
*  to be tougher. It gets easier from here. The leader of the Chechen Republic. That was another [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=3705.92s)]
*  W to not know. [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=3710.48s)]
*  Rasmun Kadyrov, right? Oh, boom. Yeah. Yeah. So Kadyrov is like a what Putin's like biggest flunky [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=3711.2s)]
*  has a creepy beard was fighting with mercenaries in Ukraine is lavishly corrupt and may have [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=3719.52s)]
*  carried out the assassination of Boris Nemtsov. Because it was five Chechens. And so sometimes [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=3725.44s)]
*  Putin does his dirty work through Kadyrov. One and a half for two. You're beating Tommy right now. [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=3732.48s)]
*  I'm gonna have a European trip this summer. Two of the countries I'm going to leaders are easy. [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=3736.88s)]
*  The third is maybe not maybe easy for you. We'll see the Prime Minister of the Netherlands. [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=3741.6s)]
*  Great name. [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=3746.32s)]
*  Oh, shit. Because Mark Ruta is no longer the Prime Minister of the Netherlands. [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=3747.12s)]
*  It's tough. He was elected July 2024. He has a name that's that is also a name. [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=3753.92s)]
*  Male body part. [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=3763.2s)]
*  I guess where I'll go for my half is that he was like dependent on Gert Wilder is the far right [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=3764.88s)]
*  lunatic to sustain his coalition and Gert Wilder is just pulled out. But I don't remember this [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=3770.0s)]
*  person's name. And he pulled out in favor of Dick Schuf. So is that his name? Dick Schuf? Yeah, [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=3775.68s)]
*  I should know that. Okay, now you know. That's great. Final question. The demographic makeup [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=3781.68s)]
*  of Iran. Ted Cruz was unable to answer it. I don't know it on a percentile basis. It is [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=3786.72s)]
*  certainly majority Persian. There's a significant Kurdish minority. There's a Baluqi minority [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=3794.8799999999997s)]
*  as well. Okay, Baluqi 2% Kurdish 9%. There's actually the second minority is [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=3802.24s)]
*  Azerbaijan. Okay, okay. The reason that I'd keep an eye on the Kurdish and Baluqi points is that [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=3810.0s)]
*  they have fought against they have separatist movements for good reason because they've been [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=3817.2000000000003s)]
*  treated like shit. And so in a regime change scenario, I would watch that space. Baluqi [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=3821.76s)]
*  separatist and Kurdish separatist the Azeris. I don't think have the same beef with the government. [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=3829.04s)]
*  Running circles around VTOR on this. I didn't know this segment was coming. [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=3836.08s)]
*  Okay, well good. Well, I wasn't gonna warn you. It's important to get you a George W. Bush that [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=3841.68s)]
*  knows coming either. Ben Rhodes, I want to do China stuff. There's so much stuff to talk about. So [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=3845.3599999999997s)]
*  you're gonna have to come back. I love it. I love to come back. All right, brother. We'll see you [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=3850.3199999999997s)]
*  soon. Everybody else will be back here tomorrow for another edition of the Bullwork podcast. See [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=3853.92s)]
*  you all then. Peace. [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=3856.64s)]
*  you [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avxVHPXnd7Q&t=3883.92s)]
