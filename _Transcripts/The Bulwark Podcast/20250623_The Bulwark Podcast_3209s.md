Video Description: Tim and Bill may have different takes on the wisdom of the U.S. bombing of Iran's nuclear sites—and on potential regime change—but they see eye-to-eye on the risks of Trump's ego and his incapable advisers in a dangerous situation. And where is the missing enriched uranium? Meanwhile, Stephen Miller's masked goons violently assaulted an immigrant landscaper and father of three Marines in Southern California. Plus, the trans military ban is un-American, local anti-trans laws are trampling all over parents' rights, and why didn't the moderate Dem establishment circle the wagons around a candidate who could've knocked Cuomo out of contention? Bill Kristol joins Tim Miller.

# DEBATE: Tim vs. Bill on Iran Strikes (w/ Bill Kristol) | The Bulwark Podcast
**The Bulwark Podcast:** [June 23, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw)
*  I don't know. I think that if Trump decided to bomb Iran, that 70% of the megabase would [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=0.0s)]
*  be with him. And if he decided to bomb Israel, 70% of the megabase would be with him. And [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=5.68s)]
*  if he decided to do nothing, 70% would be with him. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=9.76s)]
*  And if it's a success. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=13.120000000000001s)]
*  Hello and welcome to the Bollard Podcast. I'm your host, Tim Miller. Much to discuss today. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=20.240000000000002s)]
*  Since we got together with Mark Cuban last week, we've bombed Iran. So a lot is happening on the [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=25.68s)]
*  weekends these days. So if you need your fix and you're in the need for bulwark takes, reminder [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=33.760000000000005s)]
*  that we do have a bulwark takes podcast feed that you can log on for where we put in breaking news [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=39.52s)]
*  and other kind of random ephemera. And on YouTube and Subsec we go live from time to time. We did [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=45.28s)]
*  so Sarah Givio and I did so after Trump's comments on Saturday about the bombing. So FYI on that, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=50.56s)]
*  but it's Monday. So we are here today with editor-at-large Bill Kristol. How are you doing, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=58.800000000000004s)]
*  Bill? [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=62.96s)]
*  Fine. And while we're pumping, while we're promoting bulwark content over the weekend, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=63.68000000000001s)]
*  Sam Stein had an excellent interview with Jim Himes, the ranking Democrat on House Intelligence, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=68.88s)]
*  who's upset about the lack of congressional notice or authorization. And then I had a [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=73.2s)]
*  conversation with Eric Edelman yesterday on the foreign policy side of this. So yeah, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=78.08s)]
*  there's a lot of content on the bulwark. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=84.88s)]
*  People don't have to watch every single thing. Do what serves you. That's the purpose of this effort. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=86.48s)]
*  I watched your Eric Edelman conversation and I'm delighted to announce that we might have a little [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=94.24s)]
*  bit of a disagreement on this podcast. And I was thinking back, we've been doing this every Monday, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=100.24s)]
*  we've been agreeing a little too much. It's concerning. And I was thinking about the last [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=104.96s)]
*  major disagreement I remembered. And it turned out you were right on that one. So maybe we'll [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=109.36s)]
*  even even Stephen it or maybe we'll be to and O for you. We'll see how things shake out. But that was [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=114.8s)]
*  with regards to Joe Biden, where we were totally aligned on Joe Biden not running, being opposed [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=120.47999999999999s)]
*  to him running in 2022 and early 2023. But eventually I came around to the idea that, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=127.52s)]
*  okay, maybe we should just circle the wagons around old man, like it's too late to do anything [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=133.12s)]
*  about it. And you were resilient. And arguably, it was not too late. We should not circle the [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=137.04s)]
*  wagons. And then I came back around to your position after the debate. So anyway, one point [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=144.24s)]
*  for you on that one. And we'll see how today's disagreement shakes out. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=149.76s)]
*  Maybe only a half point since after all that Biden got out and who's the president of the [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=152.72s)]
*  United States now. I don't want to take too much credit for that. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=157.12s)]
*  Fair enough. So before we get to the merits of our disagreement, one delicious item I think of [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=162.24s)]
*  schadenfreude together is just we look at the Iran situation. And that is that the vice president of [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=166.88s)]
*  the United States is really squirming. There's nobody in a tougher political position right now [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=172.88s)]
*  than JD Vance. You wrote about this morning for the newsletter how Trump just dunked on him and [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=178.8s)]
*  emasculated him essentially with one bleat where he talked about how, you know, where he countered [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=186.24s)]
*  JD's comment on the morning shows where JD had said that, of course, we're not for regime change [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=192.8s)]
*  and we're not dumb like all the other presidents and journalists. His sort of haughty condescending [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=197.28s)]
*  rebuttal to the questioner who was asking about regime change and Trump a couple hours later [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=204.64s)]
*  bleats out, well, you know, regime change might be all right, actually. We'll see how it goes. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=209.68s)]
*  And JD just, you know, I think he's struggling to find where, you know, where the water table line [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=214.88s)]
*  is for him on this. Well, yeah, I think I sort of made up in morning shots what I thought Trump's [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=223.44s)]
*  mental process might have been watching JD say we don't want to regime change. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=230.4s)]
*  Hexeth and Rubio had previously said perfectly reasonably inconsistent with the actual intention [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=234.8s)]
*  of the operation. The point of it isn't regime change. That's not why we're doing this. And I [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=240.48s)]
*  think that's actually true. And but JD is very revealing. I thought about JD's worldview that he [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=245.6s)]
*  didn't say, you know, the point of this isn't regime change. We're not intervening for the sake [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=252.0s)]
*  of regime change, but we don't want to regime change. I do. I'm giving Trump a little more [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=257.2s)]
*  credit than I should hear. But I think he had kind of a normal reaction to that American reaction, [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=261.28s)]
*  which is really I mean, they'd be better off if the Atoll is left. We're not going to put boots [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=265.28s)]
*  on the ground. We're not going to do a B or C. You know, we're not going to maybe even do other [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=269.44s)]
*  things that we could do diplomatically and that a more internationalist minded administration might [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=273.36s)]
*  do. But saying we don't want it. That's a little weird. Maybe Trump didn't have any of that mental [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=280.08s)]
*  process. Maybe that's just me thinking that. And maybe Trump just finds JD annoying, which is quite [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=284.24s)]
*  possible. But he certainly went out of I agree, he went out of his way with that late afternoon [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=289.2s)]
*  tweet or truth social or whatever those things are to let it look like he was slapping him down. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=293.84s)]
*  And certainly no one from the White House, to my knowledge, came out in the next [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=302.24s)]
*  four or five hours and said, oh, you guys are all misinterpreting that tweet. It had nothing to do [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=305.76s)]
*  with what JD did. Right? I think it was kind of you've been in these spokesman positions to say the [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=308.88s)]
*  least. I think it was kind of noticeable that no one from the White House was like saying, oh no, [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=312.64s)]
*  Trump and JD, they're totally on the same page. Well, yeah, because they're all lapdogs for Trump [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=316.15999999999997s)]
*  and they can't write like they can't to do that would be to undermine Trump, right, which is which [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=320.56s)]
*  is which nobody can do. And just to put a finer point on on the political pickle, the JD is in, [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=325.2s)]
*  right? You know, there's this conversation that's going around about, oh, well, maga split over this [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=332.24s)]
*  and I don't know where you are on that. But we've discussed how certain JVL are leaking. And I'm just, [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=337.84000000000003s)]
*  we're all pretty bearish on the notion that maga will split the biggest percentage of [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=343.12s)]
*  maga are people that are essentially an occult and just are going to go along with whatever Trump [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=347.44s)]
*  wants and they don't want anybody to undermine Mr. Trump and they want the left to be feel like [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=351.28s)]
*  they're losing and Trump to feel like they're winning. That's the that's the median Trump voter. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=355.36s)]
*  Are there some people with underneath that who have strongly held views about foreign policy? Yeah, [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=360.48s)]
*  on both sides of Trump. Certainly. You saw the Nikki Haley vote was what, 15 percent of the [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=366.24s)]
*  primary. I'm sure a Tucker vote would get about 15 percent. But there's still, you know, that still [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=371.6s)]
*  leaves 70 percent that are just going to go along with Trump. The split becomes very real, though, [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=377.28000000000003s)]
*  for JD, because if we do get to a point where there's an open primary and Trump's out of the picture, [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=385.52000000000004s)]
*  then then things get scrambled. And JD knows that to become the heir, his top priority [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=391.44s)]
*  is to make sure Mr. Trump is happy, right, because he needs that 70 percent to see him as the heir. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=399.28s)]
*  But then the next obligation is to kind of align himself more with what he sees as the whatever, [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=404.08s)]
*  Tucker, Bannon-ish isolationist wing. And those two things are in tension right now. And he is like [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=409.44s)]
*  really in a bind. You can just see it in every comment that he makes that he's really straining [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=417.44s)]
*  to try to navigate it. I think he thinks he's in a bind for exactly the reason you said. I actually [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=421.59999999999997s)]
*  don't think it's that much of a bind. I don't think it's a close call. What he needs in 2028 is [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=427.6s)]
*  Donald Trump to support him, period. That means he should be slavishly loyal to Donald Trump. And [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=431.44s)]
*  people like us should make fun of him for three years as they made fun of Bush in 85, 86, 87, [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=436.88s)]
*  the original Bush, H.W. Bush for being slavishly supportive of Reagan. And he was a lap dog, [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=441.76000000000005s)]
*  I think George Will called him on some famous piece. Not exactly the same thing. And Reagan [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=446.8s)]
*  wasn't going out of his way to just send flares to humiliate H.W. Well, fair enough, though. There [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=450.48s)]
*  was a little bit of tiny bit of that. Anyway, it's not a good comparison in some ways, I agree. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=456.16s)]
*  But anyway, I think Vance's call politically, not that I'm advising him on this, I don't want to, [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=460.0s)]
*  but would be to just be for Trump, just define the mission as not a regime change mission. Fine, [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=464.72s)]
*  just as Rubio and Hexnett did. And then emphasize that look, Vance did this a little actually. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=469.76000000000005s)]
*  This is getting rid of a very dangerous nuclear situation. It's not like we're intervening [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=475.76000000000005s)]
*  anywhere else. There are no other regimes that will literally have this kind of nuclear program [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=479.28000000000003s)]
*  or these kinds of missiles that aren't already nuclear powers. So I think it's actually, A, [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=483.2s)]
*  he really believes in the Tucker isolationist ban in worldview. No question about that. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=488.56s)]
*  He's probably closer to them personally and moved by them. And he's probably overestimates, [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=494.48s)]
*  I think, their power. A lot of the Trump support, I guess, I would just slightly modify what you said, [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=499.04s)]
*  maybe I'm wrong, is just people, they like America bombing countries that are far away, [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=504.0s)]
*  that they don't like anyway, that has killed American troops and held Americans hostages. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=510.32s)]
*  I don't think there's a heck of a lot of, I'm very curious to see what the polls show this week. I [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=515.68s)]
*  think there was some polling last week that said, oh, people are very resistant to this. Maybe I'm [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=519.6s)]
*  underestimating the Iraq effect. Maybe I'm overestimating a kind of just American [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=524.0799999999999s)]
*  belligerence. But I think Trump taps into that actually. And we could all say Trump was more [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=528.64s)]
*  isolationist, which he was, than Hillary or than Biden. But he also does tap into a certain kind [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=534.24s)]
*  of just, you know, but when we act, we're just going to kick the shit out of them. And I think [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=539.76s)]
*  JD cannot walk away from that side of Trumpism. Yeah, I don't know. I think that if Trump decided [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=543.92s)]
*  to bomb Iran, that 70% of the megabase would be with them. And if he decided to bomb Israel, [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=549.12s)]
*  and if he decided to do nothing, 70% would be with them. And if it's a success. Yeah, no, I don't [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=556.88s)]
*  quite agree. But I totally agree. I wasn't trying to make it a raw specific point, though I think [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=562.56s)]
*  Iran has a slightly special place in the hearts, or the opposite of hearts, whatever that is, [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=568.48s)]
*  of Americans. But I don't disagree. But anyway, I think you're making my point away, right? That [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=573.12s)]
*  you, doesn't he just want to be with Trump, JD? Yeah, right. For sure. He should feel that way. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=577.2s)]
*  But he, I don't know, he's wrapped around the axle, I guess. And that's enjoyable to watch. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=582.96s)]
*  All right. So let's just get to the merits. Like I said, we this the bombing actually happened [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=590.24s)]
*  after we taped on Friday. So we've covered zero of it on this podcast. Your conversation with [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=595.52s)]
*  Edelman, for folks that want a deep dive, a deep wonky dive on the the arguments for the bombings [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=603.28s)]
*  of the nuclear sites, they should go check that out. Could you give folks, maybe just a reader's [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=613.84s)]
*  digest version of what the what the bold case would be for this action? I think Eric tried to [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=619.76s)]
*  lay out, I tried to kind of the let's go in the moderate bold case, which is whatever one might [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=626.72s)]
*  have thought in the past about diplomacy, about bombing, about other moments where we could have [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=631.68s)]
*  acted more aggressively. This is a very unusual moment. I mean, we have had Israel's destroyed [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=636.08s)]
*  Hezbollah, the Syrian regime fell. So Israel was able to do a week of bombing that no one would [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=641.68s)]
*  have anticipated and seems to have done it pretty effectively. And then leaving us in the position of [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=646.64s)]
*  finishing the job is too strong. But going some steps towards coming closer to finishing the job, [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=652.64s)]
*  however you want to put it, however much you know, we don't know that yet, obviously, with [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=658.3199999999999s)]
*  Fordo and stuff, but doing a lot more damage. And the cost of doing it, the risk of doing it at this [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=662.3199999999999s)]
*  moment, I think, much, much less than it would have been three or four years ago. I think a lot of [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=668.0s)]
*  analysis is mired in a world where Hezbollah was really strong, and Iran was really able to control [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=672.24s)]
*  them. And the threat of attacks on US troops was very real and stuff. I think that's just so much, [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=678.08s)]
*  I hope at least, that's so much reduced now. And that we've retained huge deterrent effect. I mean, [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=682.64s)]
*  it's not as if, you know, it's their turn, or we just have to sit back. And I think Trump actually [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=688.24s)]
*  was quite good in that way, warning them that, hey, incidentally, if you think of doing anything, [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=692.4s)]
*  more, you're going to get it again. So I feel like the risks are manageable. The upside is real. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=696.8000000000001s)]
*  Leaving it undone and not helping Israel at this point, it's not like we get any credit from [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=704.72s)]
*  anti-Israel regimes around the world. The final point Eric makes, which I hadn't really thought of, [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=710.32s)]
*  and it's not a bad message to send other dictators, that at some point, you know, [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=714.88s)]
*  the use of force remains in our toolkit, so to speak. We've been so reluctant with Obama and [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=722.0799999999999s)]
*  then Trump, even Biden, he helped Ukraine, but no offensive weapons, you know, so reluctant to [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=728.0s)]
*  cross that line. And again, we're not talking about boots on the ground. Not a bad message to send [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=733.84s)]
*  that, you know, we do remain a superpower willing to use force if necessary, but in a very precise [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=738.0799999999999s)]
*  and targeted way. So I think that's the basic case for it. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=743.52s)]
*  Yeah. I'll just add on to that, because as I've said last week, I've been kind of really mixed [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=746.48s)]
*  and torn on it. I think I kind of end up falling on the other side, which we'll get to in a second, [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=751.28s)]
*  but on the case for it was, A, the Soleimani experience. It's just worth mentioning, right? [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=755.4399999999999s)]
*  Like if this does end up such as that, like that was a net positive. I know a lot of folks that [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=761.4399999999999s)]
*  were hair on fire after Soleimani was killed, you know, saying this is going to lead to a wider [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=767.76s)]
*  regional war and it didn't. And so that is just like an important data point to not brush over [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=773.1999999999999s)]
*  when looking at this. And just to kind of expand on what you said about how weakened the [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=780.24s)]
*  Iranian regime is. I mean, like they're just getting dunked on by Mossad, like left and right. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=786.5600000000001s)]
*  And it's kind of crazy just how well, how effective Israel has been in taking out [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=793.04s)]
*  their leaders. And I saw some Mossad social media posts where it was like, there was a leader of a [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=800.0s)]
*  garrison. He got shot by somebody with inside Iran and then survived. Then an ambulance went [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=806.16s)]
*  to pick him up and then a drone hit the ambulance. And it's like, they've just been like all up in [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=813.6s)]
*  the kitchen here. And to the point that it's like, how much of the IRGC are Israeli operatives at [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=819.6s)]
*  this point? They're not only weakened, but I think internally, they're in a very tough position [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=831.6s)]
*  as far as responding from the regime. And it is a regime that the last thing I'll say that has over [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=840.5600000000001s)]
*  the past two decades caused a lot of death and destruction via proxies, direct act via cyber, [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=848.08s)]
*  et cetera. So anything else on the bull case before I offer the other side of the argument? [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=854.48s)]
*  Just one footnote to what you're saying, Chris, often we don't act in certain situations, [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=862.32s)]
*  which we want to be able to be a broker or we want to stay out. We don't want to be the object of [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=868.08s)]
*  hatred or resentment. I don't think much of that holds in this case either. It's not like the [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=871.9200000000001s)]
*  Iranian regime, if wounded, but if it's wounded as it is and stays in place, which it may, [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=875.44s)]
*  isn't going to hate us as much as it hates Israel. You know what I mean? It's like, [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=881.76s)]
*  I think these, and it's not as if it's going to, the neighbors aren't going to blow up. I was there [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=885.36s)]
*  in the first Bush White House 30 years ago. And yeah, there were real concerns that first Gulf War [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=890.08s)]
*  about what would happen with all the other Arab nations and stuff. I mean, the Arab nations, [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=894.96s)]
*  whenever they're saying publicly, clearly had no big problem with this. You don't see a heck of a [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=899.36s)]
*  lot of rallying to Iran. And incidentally, Putin and Xi have been awfully restrained. So I just feel [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=903.44s)]
*  the cards kind of, you hate to say this, but God knows things can go wrong. And I stipulate that [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=911.2s)]
*  right now, but the cards seem to have been lined up in a pretty opportune way for this action. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=915.12s)]
*  Pete Slauson So now here's where we talk to, let's go to the possibility of things going wrong. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=920.48s)]
*  Because I've, I just have been, I was reading a lot about it. And as I said, like a lot of what I've [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=924.16s)]
*  read affirmed what Eric was talking about, just about the weakness of the Iranian regime and the [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=928.64s)]
*  opportunity that was presented. That said, it's kind of a touchy subject to frame it this way. So [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=935.68s)]
*  I want to be clear about my words, but because I'm all for supporting, Israel's an important ally [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=941.52s)]
*  to us in the region, I'm all for supporting them in ways that make sense strategically. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=947.28s)]
*  I just look at this action of us actually doing the bombing, like the US taking the lead and [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=952.0s)]
*  doing the bombing of Fordow and the other sites. And I just, I come to the conclusion that I think [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=958.0799999999999s)]
*  that this action, just looking at the short term, made Israel safer. Not totally safe, [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=964.88s)]
*  obviously Israel has a ton of risks. But what they've done with Iran and Hezbollah, [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=971.4399999999999s)]
*  obviously Israel is safer now than they were six months ago. And it's made us like marginally less [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=976.24s)]
*  safe, because the bases, the US bases are more at risk now of what, an Iraqi proxy, etc. Terror [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=981.76s)]
*  threat I think is higher, both from proxies and lone wolves, possibly a state violence against us. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=990.08s)]
*  We don't know, but we will see. Now Trump's ego is kind of in play as far as potential escalation, [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=997.0400000000001s)]
*  like something happens and we end up getting down an escalatory pipeline, we didn't have to. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=1003.2800000000001s)]
*  And all of it for a threat that was like not really acute to us. I don't, none of it, we don't want [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=1008.1600000000001s)]
*  Iran to have a nuclear weapon, but they weren't particularly, you know, they were getting closer, [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=1013.84s)]
*  but they weren't particularly close, it wasn't imminent. And it's not like if they got one, [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=1018.72s)]
*  Miami is at risk of being nuked by Tehran anytime soon. So anyway, and that's kind of a, [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=1023.12s)]
*  I'm not a foreign policy expert, so I grant that this is kind of like a basic way to look at it. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=1030.48s)]
*  But sometimes there's some value in just kind of looking at it from a more simplistic standpoint. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=1036.0s)]
*  And I think that you can get kind of wrapped up into the geopolitics of it. I just look at it and [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=1041.6000000000001s)]
*  think, I don't, I don't, with Trump as president, and like the way that the status quo was with Iran [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=1046.08s)]
*  felt like a more stable status quo for us, America, than it is today. What would you say to that? [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=1052.1599999999999s)]
*  No, I think that's well said. And I don't, it's the right, those are the right qualifications or [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=1059.12s)]
*  reservations to raise. And sadly, if we could have, and I don't know if we could have, given Israel, [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=1065.4399999999998s)]
*  the B-2s and to drop the big bombs on Fordow, that would be, it would have been preferable. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=1071.36s)]
*  So I agree with your sense that if we didn't have to get involved, we shouldn't have. Now, the way, [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=1075.68s)]
*  I guess, I don't think our forces are willing to, you know, trade Israeli pilots for two weeks, [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=1080.0s)]
*  give them the keys. Can't you have a B-2 Uber situation? Well, we get, look, we've sold them, [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=1084.6399999999999s)]
*  and to some degree given them a lot of the other material they're using, it wouldn't be [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=1089.28s)]
*  totally crazy to say, to have said quietly two weeks ago, why don't we just give Israel 12 [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=1092.8s)]
*  Ops that they can use? I mean, we've done that in other wars, right? We've given Israel material, [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=1097.92s)]
*  we've given other allies material, we've given the Ukrainians material. Sometimes we're a little [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=1102.3200000000002s)]
*  nervous about how they would use it, we still gave them material. So I don't disagree with that. For [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=1106.0s)]
*  whatever reason, we weren't going to do that. And maybe we were right not to. And so that, I think, [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=1110.5600000000002s)]
*  meant it was a little more of a stark choice. I don't disagree with your concert worries. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=1116.0s)]
*  I think the biggest one, you slightly maybe buried the lead, maybe you intended to. I mean, [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=1120.24s)]
*  I think Trump being president and Trump's team being in charge is a legitimate concern. That is, [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=1124.8s)]
*  I hesitated a fair amount, you know, as this strike became pretty likely, and I thought it was by the [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=1129.9199999999998s)]
*  middle of last week, about, you know, and it's not, it wasn't like I was going to endorse it or not [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=1135.52s)]
*  endorse it. I was just gonna say what I thought as it happened, but I try to be sober about it. But, [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=1140.56s)]
*  you know, I do not trust Trump to be a good wartime president, even if it's not really a war, [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=1145.28s)]
*  a good even military operation president. I don't trust XF. I don't trust a lot of the others. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=1151.12s)]
*  The ego gets involved, as you say, the grandiosity. So that was the single thing [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=1157.9199999999998s)]
*  by friend Bob Kagan wrote a piece Saturday putting it. Yeah, let's just talk about that. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=1163.9199999999998s)]
*  Because I had three other little sub bullets that are less my core arguments against. But yeah, [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=1167.28s)]
*  so there's three other arguments against that are kind of out there. Kagan's, I think, [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=1172.1599999999999s)]
*  in the Atlantic, and we can put that in the show notes, folks can go read it. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=1178.1599999999999s)]
*  His was really more focused on domestic concerns that like essentially that Trump becoming a [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=1181.6s)]
*  wartime president would empower him, potentially would, you know, if there is a response would [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=1188.0s)]
*  allow him to take more wartime powers, emergency power stuff he already wants to do, and that he [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=1195.76s)]
*  was against it for that reason. What would you make? So yeah, I think you put that one there. So [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=1201.1999999999998s)]
*  maybe there's a one A and a one B on the Trump question. The one A is it will move wars, make [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=1206.6399999999999s)]
*  countries more authoritarian to the degree that we are now at a war or possible occasion that [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=1212.1599999999999s)]
*  might lead to a war or lead to renewed military activities. Trump might use that as an excuse, [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=1218.56s)]
*  or in any case, just the momentum of it might make it easier for him to do all kinds of authoritarian [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=1223.2s)]
*  things, including politicizing the military and all that. So that's the, let's say the domestic [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=1228.24s)]
*  consequences of this in terms of Trump's authoritarianism. Bob was very focused on [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=1232.96s)]
*  that. And I think it's a fair thing to worry about. I'm not, I don't think it's that big, [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=1236.8s)]
*  you know, again, if it is a couple, even if it's one or even if it's three or four military [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=1241.92s)]
*  strikes against Iran, I don't really think it changes the dynamics much here at home. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=1245.44s)]
*  So I'm less worried about that, but it's a fair point. The other is a point that Bob also mentions [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=1250.16s)]
*  that was the one I was mentioning more this time, which is, well, will he in fact be a good war [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=1256.0s)]
*  president or let's just say a good crisis president? And it's not crazy to take the [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=1260.56s)]
*  position. You know, what would be good given that Donald Trump's president, Pete XS, they are all [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=1264.56s)]
*  these characters, Tulsi Gabbard, the best thing we can hope for in the next four years is no crises. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=1268.56s)]
*  And to the degree that we have some optionality, some choice in whether a crisis becomes a real [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=1274.48s)]
*  crisis or just a slightly far away crisis between two other countries, we should err on the side of [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=1279.9199999999998s)]
*  not making it our crisis. And I take that point. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=1285.36s)]
*  Yeah. Just a couple other things on the, we kind of glossed over the regime change side of this, [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=1287.84s)]
*  the mega, Bill seems mega curious, which we'll just let that, we'll leave that for a second. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=1294.24s)]
*  The other thing, I think the other concern that people have that kind of relates to what I was [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=1302.6399999999999s)]
*  talking about earlier about Israel is that obviously it's in Israel's security interests [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=1308.24s)]
*  for there to be regime change, or they at least perceive it to be. I mean, they assume that [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=1312.72s)]
*  a regime that would replace the Atolla would be less hostile. It's hard to be more hostile [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=1320.64s)]
*  than one that has a clock counting down towards your elimination, right? And so, yeah, we have [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=1324.64s)]
*  the Israeli defense minister this morning, Katz, says the IDF is currently striking regime targets [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=1332.24s)]
*  and symbols of government oppression in Tehran, including a prison for political prisoners, [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=1338.24s)]
*  their internal security HQ, et cetera. Trump might be in the position of, oh, [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=1345.28s)]
*  wouldn't regime change be great, but we're not trying to effectuate it. But it seems like our [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=1353.44s)]
*  partners in Israel might be in a position of trying to effectuate it. And we get kind of [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=1359.2s)]
*  tied into that. What do you make of that concern? [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=1365.36s)]
*  I think that's a fair point, and maybe you shouldn't have tweeted it at all. But given that [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=1367.68s)]
*  he did, I thought it's sort of worth interpreting it. And as I say, it's both to his, maybe Prudence [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=1371.3600000000001s)]
*  would have said to keep quiet. But since he was going to keep quiet either way, nice that he [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=1377.2s)]
*  vaguely expresses the old fashioned principle that we are kind of on the side of liberty for [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=1382.24s)]
*  people around the world if it's possible. I mean, Israel, I think, is inclined to hope more for [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=1386.24s)]
*  regime change. Well, not in North Korea or Russia. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=1391.1200000000001s)]
*  Well, that's the thing. No, that's what's just in Iran. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=1393.68s)]
*  Well, but I think, OK, that's terrible. And we should make that point, though, it feels to me [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=1395.44s)]
*  like that's a bit of a vulnerability now for Trump to say, well, hey, what about other dictators? [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=1399.3600000000001s)]
*  It's not going to affect him, obviously. Could it affect a little bit some other supporters, [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=1405.04s)]
*  some Republicans in Congress? I don't know. Maybe not. But maybe they just cheat Israel and Iran [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=1410.0800000000002s)]
*  as a special case. I'm against cheating Israel as a special case in this respect. I mean, I'm for [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=1414.72s)]
*  helping Ukraine, I'm for helping Israel, right? I mean, I think it's a mistake. It does probably [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=1419.1200000000001s)]
*  hurt Israel to treat it entirely as its own unique distinctive. The only country we're [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=1424.32s)]
*  supposed to well out to help or like around the world. So, yeah, so I mean, that's like there are [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=1428.6399999999999s)]
*  so many more things one could say about all this. But a lot of it is obviously we don't know. I mean, [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=1436.48s)]
*  these things always have some anticipated consequences. I think, you know, moving the [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=1441.36s)]
*  needle a little bit to make it easier for the Iranian people to effectuate regime change is a [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=1445.6799999999998s)]
*  little different from invading a country and bringing about regime change. I mean, Iraq is [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=1449.9199999999998s)]
*  way over on one side of the spectrum. Israel seems to be moving from here to here, you know, [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=1453.68s)]
*  I mean, but within a sort of pretty limited boundary. And I don't object to that particularly. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=1459.04s)]
*  But I agree, we get a little bit implicated. We are now implicated. We use force on behalf of [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=1464.3200000000002s)]
*  Israel. We're a little more complicated than we were. Wouldn't we have been pretty implicated [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=1469.04s)]
*  anyway, though? All right. I had one more thing on this, like kind of a news item that's up this [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=1472.5600000000002s)]
*  morning that's worth monitoring related to the situation. There was a lot of chest thumping [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=1475.76s)]
*  yesterday from the administration, you know, total elimination of the nuclear ambitions of Iran. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=1483.0400000000002s)]
*  Looking a little murkier this morning, like whether, you know, Fordow is actually eliminated. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=1492.48s)]
*  It seems like maybe partially. Obviously, this is not to say that there was not great damage done, [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=1497.76s)]
*  but maybe partially not completely eliminated. But more strikingly, the question of where is [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=1503.2s)]
*  the Iranian uranium is now floating out there. The New York Times has a report that says that [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=1508.96s)]
*  the actual state of the nuclear program seems far more murky with senior officials conceding they [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=1516.64s)]
*  did not know the fate of Iran's stockpile of near bomb grade uranium. There was evidence, [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=1520.72s)]
*  according to two Israeli officials with knowledge of the intelligence that Iran had moved equipment [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=1525.1200000000001s)]
*  and uranium from the site in recent days, maybe due in part to Trump's crazy bleats, [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=1529.28s)]
*  which circles us back to whether we want Trump in charge during a crisis. So I don't know, [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=1535.12s)]
*  you're talking to, you know, more folks than I am kind of in the national security space. Like, [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=1541.6s)]
*  what's the feeling of like the kind of the effectiveness at this point? [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=1546.32s)]
*  We don't know. Pretty effective, but whether very effective or they move some stuff. Now, [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=1549.6s)]
*  you can move the stuff, but if you don't have the ability to do much with it, you know, it's, [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=1555.1999999999998s)]
*  it's obviously a limited effect. You know, just one final point on the whole thing. I guess one [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=1558.8799999999999s)]
*  question, and I, this is, I think a tough thing to answer is what's more, what's a little more, [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=1563.68s)]
*  if the more we do the job now, the less likely it's, it's likely to pop up as a something that [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=1569.44s)]
*  seems to require further action six months or 18 months from now. Right. And I think that's [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=1574.16s)]
*  important. If you don't, if you think it's an unstable area, if you don't really trust it as [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=1579.1200000000001s)]
*  an Yahoo government, if you don't trust the Trump administration, I mean, the happy story here in a [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=1582.8s)]
*  funny way would be this is kind of one and done. They're set back pretty far. It's going to take [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=1587.44s)]
*  them quite a while to even if the regime doesn't fall and would be replaced by something better, [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=1593.44s)]
*  which would be nice. They're going to be set back. They're not going to be able to do much. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=1597.44s)]
*  It's going to take them a heck of a long time to reconstitute things. We've bought time, [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=1602.48s)]
*  not just bought time in the nuclear program, bought time where we're not going to have another crisis [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=1606.0s)]
*  of the year. Because one of the problems with Trump doing nothing is the Israeli government [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=1609.6000000000001s)]
*  sitting there thinking, okay, well now we've got to have a Fordo plan, which we're going to execute [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=1613.92s)]
*  in six months, which is going to be an extremely dramatic, you know, I'm making this up obviously, [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=1617.8400000000001s)]
*  but you know, whatever your paratroopers landing and all this. And then, you know, so I think you [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=1621.52s)]
*  could argue that this action makes stability, even to use that word relative stability, more likely [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=1625.84s)]
*  six or 12 or 18 months out, but who knows? We'll report back on that in two weeks. I'm going to [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=1632.32s)]
*  clip and save that one. Just see how many on the Biden point and we'll have you on relative stability [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=1638.16s)]
*  and report back on that at Labor Day. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=1646.16s)]
*  So I've been talking to you about today's sponsor, The Perfect Gene, and how much I'm trying to process [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=1654.72s)]
*  the change in my identity as it relates to denim. Because for the gains that skinny gene [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=1662.8799999999999s)]
*  was so important, so central, it was so crucial, and now it's out of vogue. And as I've been trying [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=1669.84s)]
*  to transition towards, you know, can I try something a little different? Can I try something that is not [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=1676.4s)]
*  a dad gene, but that also does not make it look like I'm at a Strokes concert in 2009? And The [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=1684.56s)]
*  Perfect Gene has been helping me on that journey with a huge range of sizes and fits to choose from. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=1691.12s)]

*  Perfect Gene. All right, I would move on to some other stuff. There's a video out, [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=1762.56s)]
*  a really horrifying video out of Southern California, one of these immigration cases. There's so many of [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=1775.52s)]
*  these. I'm sort of going to use this one as an example to kind of talk about the state of affairs. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=1779.52s)]
*  Narquiso Barranco is the man, he is I guess doing landscaping outside at IHOP. He's a worker doing [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=1783.52s)]
*  landscaping in Southern California. He's from Santa Ana. He's got three sons, they're all marines, [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=1792.48s)]
*  at least one of them had served in Afghanistan. I presume he's undocumented, though I haven't seen [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=1798.16s)]
*  that confirmed by the news. An unmarked SUV drives up to the IHOP and another unmarked car and six [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=1802.16s)]
*  guys in masks and glasses. You can't even see their faces with no identification, jump out, [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=1806.6399999999999s)]
*  and they're all wearing masks. They're all wearing masks. They're all wearing masks. They're all [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=1814.16s)]
*  wearing masks. They're all wearing masks. They're all wearing masks. They're all wearing masks. [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=1820.0s)]
*  Jump out and according to his son, Barranco starts running, which seems a kind of reasonable thing to [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=1826.32s)]
*  do. If six dudes in masks jump out of an unmarked SUV and start chasing at you, then he ends up [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=1833.6s)]
*  getting thrown to the ground. After he's clearly subdued, he's getting maced. They're hitting him [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=1840.72s)]
*  in his head. Another onlooker is posting this on social media. He's thrown into the car. This is [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=1846.24s)]
*  just a crazy way to treat people. It's completely authoritarian and fascistic. It's interesting in [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=1854.08s)]
*  the context of a fact. I'm not sure if it feels like everybody's moved on from this fact. Important [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=1862.24s)]
*  fact, we're still militarized to the National Guard. We still have military in the streets of LA for [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=1867.36s)]
*  no apparent reason right now. Anyway, thoughts on those two data points? [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=1872.48s)]
*  On that latter point, we've increased the number of National Guard doubled it in the streets of LA. [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=1879.76s)]
*  Even as the protests have died down and there's been almost no violence, I gather, for the last [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=1884.6399999999999s)]
*  several days. ISIS is doing its thing, as you just mentioned, in LA and other places and doing it in [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=1889.44s)]
*  a very bad way, in my opinion. That gets me very worried. There, I'm not too alarmed about what [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=1897.92s)]
*  Trump's done. In fact, I'm somewhat supportive of it in Iran. I am very alarmed about the fact [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=1906.88s)]
*  that we've now normalized the use of the Guard and the Marines in LA. If LA had some disturbances, [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=1911.1200000000001s)]
*  why won't it be somewhere else two weeks from now? He's clear the principle of it for him, [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=1917.2s)]
*  and the courts haven't struck this down, is he can use them wherever the state and local [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=1921.7600000000002s)]
*  authorities are in his judgment, not doing enough. Can I just chime in on this really quick? [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=1925.7600000000002s)]
*  Please. It's just important to think about this. He's still doing this over the objection of the [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=1931.2800000000002s)]
*  state's governor. It's totally unprecedented. This hasn't happened since the civil rights era, [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=1936.32s)]
*  right? That the president of the United States has nationalized the California Guard over the [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=1940.88s)]
*  objection of the governor. I think that that would only be acceptable in the most extreme [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=1944.4s)]
*  circumstances. Even in the most generous interpretation for the administration, the [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=1951.2s)]
*  idea that this was necessary during that first weekend when the way Mo's were on fire or whatever, [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=1956.96s)]
*  and there was a couple of blocks where there was some rioting, and you needed military to come in [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=1962.0s)]
*  and help tamp that down. Even in that generous interpretation, which obviously I was supposed [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=1968.8s)]
*  to and found absurd at the time, there's no rationale for it now. These are the National [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=1973.44s)]
*  Guard troops, they're people with lives. They all have other jobs. They're being taken away from [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=1980.8s)]
*  their families. People on the streets of LA are living in a militarized zone where there has to [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=1985.76s)]
*  be fear. A friend of mine lives in LA, a 60-year-old that he works with didn't have her birthday party [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=1991.92s)]
*  because she's friends and family that have mixed status, and she was afraid that it was going to [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=1998.72s)]
*  get raided. This is a preposterous, authoritarian, offensive way for people to live, and there's no [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=2003.8400000000001s)]
*  stated rationale for it. What is the rationale? Well, the real rationale, of course, is the [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=2013.8400000000001s)]
*  unstated one, and I do think this is true. One sounds like one of these alarmist authoritarianisms [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=2018.0s)]
*  around the corner, but it is. The rationale is he wants the ability to use the military domestically, [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=2022.64s)]
*  and he wants it to be done at his whim and on his say-so and over the objections of state and local [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=2028.0s)]
*  authorities because he sees disturbances, or maybe they have information and intelligence that would [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=2033.36s)]
*  suggest planned disturbances. I do not think it's at all paranoid to be extremely concerned about [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=2039.28s)]
*  this. The courts have sort of intervened, but then there are issues with why the courts didn't [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=2045.68s)]
*  fully intervene, Congress as being its usual pathetic self. I would say honestly on this one, [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=2051.12s)]
*  the popular backlash is less than a share. There's so many, I don't blame people, there's so many [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=2056.88s)]
*  outrages, so many individual cases of outrage in the detention and mass deportation world. [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=2060.2400000000002s)]
*  But just the general fact of these troops being on the streets, it really is cause for alarm. [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=2067.52s)]
*  And then on the particular case you cited, it's really horrifying. And again, what are we doing? [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=2073.04s)]
*  The guy showed up for work as a gardener, I think, a landscaper. They know his name. They [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=2077.2799999999997s)]
*  probably know where he lives. They probably can find him if he runs away. Do they need to? And [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=2082.64s)]
*  anyway, leave aside why are they deporting this guy? I mean, he's, as far as we know, [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=2087.6s)]
*  showing up for a peaceful job. And now it turns out- [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=2091.84s)]
*  This is America first. There's people clamoring for the jobs, mowing the lawn outside IHOP. [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=2095.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=2100.64s)]
*  Even in the America first nationalist rubric, this is crazy. [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=2101.3799999999997s)]
*  I mean, I understand they're not going to do computer searches and discover his three sons [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=2104.9s)]
*  are Marines, though I guess they're doing computer searches on everything else. Why can't they do [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=2108.5s)]
*  this actually? It'd be better than searching people's, people who are coming in to be [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=2111.8599999999997s)]
*  researchers at Harvard Medical School, searching their social media accounts. But they're not [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=2115.54s)]
*  searching it. So the kind of, just the, I don't know what word I'm looking for, just the, [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=2119.8599999999997s)]
*  they relish the use of force. Again, I guess they hope it's going to lead to self-deportation [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=2125.46s)]
*  for a lot of other people. So again, that's a bit of the hidden agenda here. It's not just [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=2130.34s)]
*  literally that they're going to catch all these people and detain them and deport them. It's also [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=2133.94s)]
*  they hope other people will deport themselves. But for what, I mean, what are we talking about [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=2138.26s)]
*  here? Again, guys, maybe they'll now discover some driving violation eight years ago and try to make [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=2142.42s)]
*  him into quote a criminal, but I haven't followed it as closely as I might have. So I don't think [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=2148.98s)]
*  there's anything- For what? Yeah. Somebody that raised three kids and went on to serve the country [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=2153.94s)]
*  and his mowing lawns outside IHOP. We're going to deport them in the name of what? Safety, [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=2158.1s)]
*  the name of American, the American sovereignty being violated or jobs. Like the forgotten man [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=2163.14s)]
*  in Ohio wants to work mowing lawns at IHOP in Southern California. The whole thing is just [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=2170.18s)]
*  preposterous. And to do it masked, no identification, guys getting thrown into the back of his SUV. I [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=2177.2999999999997s)]
*  mean, you think about it and he assumes that this is the real ICE, but you can't be sure. This is [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=2185.7s)]
*  happening now where people are imitating ICE in other places. He might be getting kidnapped by [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=2191.54s)]
*  some dudes. Who knows what's happening? You know, no, totally. And a final point just on how grotesque [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=2197.46s)]
*  this whole is, and there's not maybe quite as much reaction as there should be. A big, well, [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=2202.5s)]
*  a big part, one part of this bill reconciliation bill that's moving through Congress, I guess, [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=2207.14s)]
*  through the Senate this week is massive amounts of money for ICE and for border patrol and for [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=2211.54s)]
*  detention facilities and for deportation efforts. And it hasn't been, you know, there's so much else [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=2217.3s)]
*  in the bill, the taxes, obviously, the Medicaid cuts, Medicare cuts and all kinds of other things. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=2222.5s)]
*  But this is bad. I mean, so if we don't like what ICE is doing now, what Trump is doing, very much a [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=2228.02s)]
*  key part of the bill, he and Stephen Miller have emphasized it. There's no talk about taking this [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=2234.5s)]
*  out. There was a little like there was talk for 10 seconds about maybe there's a little more money [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=2238.18s)]
*  in there than we need. I think someone like Ron Johnson suggested that they immediately slapped [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=2241.7s)]
*  him down. So let's have four or five times as much, I mean, literally, of what we're doing now [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=2245.8599999999997s)]
*  of detention and deportation. We could have a hundred, our friend Aaron Reikland, [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=2252.2599999999998s)]
*  Reikland Melnick says we could have something like a hundred thousand people detained in the United [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=2257.14s)]
*  States into two or three years from now at one time by ICE. What does that start to look like? [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=2261.22s)]
*  The combination of that kind of militarization or beefing up of that whole side of law enforcement [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=2267.94s)]
*  slash militarization combined with the ability to use the troops, very bad. But I wish people [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=2274.9s)]
*  would scream and yell a little more about this provision in that reconciliation bill. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=2280.34s)]
*  Yeah, I agree. That's what really that's the future of America. That's what we're going to [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=2284.5s)]
*  make America great again, more private prisons and detention centers. Those are our growth industries. [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=2289.14s)]
*  I appreciate you mention that. We just want to think because I was, I forget who, I was having [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=2294.58s)]
*  a disagreement with somebody. It's kind of just a real good faith argument where they're talking [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=2298.18s)]
*  about how, you know, is this kind of the media overplaying these stories? Because like, isn't [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=2301.94s)]
*  it true that Biden and Obama also deported a lot of folks and we didn't see these stories like this? [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=2307.06s)]
*  And there were certainly cases of inappropriate actions by ICE during the Obama and Biden years. [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=2312.1s)]
*  I don't want to say that there wasn't, but that those stats that go around about how Biden, [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=2317.22s)]
*  Obama was a deporter in chief and Biden was, a lot of that was like, we were letting people in at [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=2321.94s)]
*  the border and then they're getting, they're being turned around. Right. And so like, when you think [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=2327.2200000000003s)]
*  about the counting numbers and how stats can deceive, it's like, oh, I don't have in front of [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=2332.02s)]
*  me, but oh, Biden deported a million people. Well, a lot of those people are people that like came [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=2335.7000000000003s)]
*  across the border, you know, encountered an agent, got sent back right across the border. Right. And [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=2340.02s)]
*  so, A, the amount of time that goes into that as little, the appropriateness of it, right. Like the [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=2346.34s)]
*  anyway, so when people aren't coming to the border now, which Trump people take as a win, [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=2352.1s)]
*  very, very few. And so to get to those same numbers, you're having to do things like [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=2359.22s)]
*  these IHOP landscaping rates. Right. And I just, anyway, I thought that might just be kind of some [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=2366.18s)]
*  useful. No, it's very useful. It looks at some number in addition to the border people who were [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=2372.66s)]
*  being sort of deported just after crossing of the deportations in the pre 2025 cases were people who [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=2377.22s)]
*  were undocumented, who had committed crimes, had been convicted, has served time by some of them, [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=2386.74s)]
*  fairly small crimes, some of them very serious crimes. And then basically I showed up at the [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=2390.8199999999997s)]
*  prison. They were, they got notifications that this guy who was undocumented was about to be [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=2395.2999999999997s)]
*  released. They released him to ice. I used to take him to the airport. They flew him to Mexico or [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=2399.2999999999997s)]
*  Guatemala or something like that, which no one I was raising great objections to. I don't know [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=2403.94s)]
*  great objections to it. As long as they're careful. Well, basically I don't know great objections to [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=2407.86s)]
*  it. And, and this was being done. And that's, that was a good chunk. That's what's certainly why the [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=2412.1s)]
*  whole sanctuary city thing, why did that become important? Think about that for the reason was [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=2416.02s)]
*  that the cops was where the cops going to cooperate with ice. If they just arrested someone, but before [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=2419.94s)]
*  he'd been charged, were they going to let ice deported? Were they going to wait till going [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=2425.06s)]
*  through the formal proceedings and so forth? People can differ on that. But again, at least [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=2428.1s)]
*  those people were lawbreakers or plausible plausibly lawbreakers. No one's now we're way, [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=2432.82s)]
*  we're way beyond that. And that is what's, I think the key point we are in a different world. [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=2439.1400000000003s)]
*  Biden, I mean, this is a great point of bitterness for Stephen Miller and Trump. Biden did not order. [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=2443.38s)]
*  I mean, I used Biden's DHS. I could, he did not order ice to go arrest people like the landscaper [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=2448.6600000000003s)]
*  at, uh, I hop. I mean, that was not, if he was not otherwise committing crimes, basically they let [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=2455.2200000000003s)]
*  him alone and let him pay taxes. Uh, if he registered as which met, he did. Yeah. This [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=2462.1s)]
*  guy was paying taxes, uh, Bronco. Um, one more immigration thing. Um, let's go through rapid [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=2468.42s)]
*  fire through a couple of other quick topics in the news. Um, Malcolm Kalil was released. Um, [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=2473.94s)]
*  uh, he immediately goes to Columbia to start protesting. Um, I see a lot of, I saw a chatter [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=2480.18s)]
*  about this over the weekend from the right about like, Oh, the, the communist left is [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=2486.5s)]
*  cheering this horrible person that got released and, and, and upset that we're bombing Iranian [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=2493.14s)]
*  nuclear strikes and they're, they're, they're, they're totally backwards in their priorities. [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=2499.22s)]
*  And it's like the whole thing, the Khalil thing is just such a clear cut case of just like, [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=2504.26s)]
*  you believe in free speech for people that you disagree with or you don't. And like they never [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=2509.22s)]
*  gave a rationale for him being held for a hundred days besides the fact that he said [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=2514.42s)]
*  anti-Semitic things or was involved in protests that they didn't like that he passed out the [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=2520.66s)]
*  Hezbollah game cards, whatever it was, bingo game. And like that, um, like that, those were, [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=2526.82s)]
*  there was never any actual crime offered. It was just the secretary of state can do this. [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=2533.78s)]
*  And, um, and you know, so, and now he's out and AOC walked him out. And as far as I'm concerned, [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=2538.5s)]
*  it's totally fine that AOC did that. And it's okay. And it's, it's okay. And me and Mahmoud Khalil [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=2544.98s)]
*  probably disagree about a variety of things, but like, that's just, that's what it's like living [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=2551.46s)]
*  in a messy country with the constitution and a declaration of independence that gives people [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=2557.14s)]
*  free speech. So I don't know if you agree with that. Yeah. Um, [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=2561.78s)]
*  on the kind of un-American actions of the, of this administration, I do just want to do a quick [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=2568.02s)]
*  word on, on the transgender military ban was gone into effect. There's a, another, I'll put this [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=2574.42s)]
*  link in the, in the notes too. There's a good Washington Post story about 10 people that were [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=2578.98s)]
*  10 transgender people that were now kicked out of the military and what they were doing and what [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=2583.7000000000003s)]
*  their hopes were. And like the whole thing is really just so grotesque. And it's like this idea [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=2588.9s)]
*  that we, that people that we have, fucking a guy that ducked service that's now engaging in military [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=2595.46s)]
*  activity overseas and sending troops into LA in the city and in America with no regard for what [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=2603.14s)]
*  are, what the, what the norms are and what the laws are of this country, like wants to like degrade [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=2611.38s)]
*  and punish people who were serving in good standing solely because they're transgender. It's just, [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=2617.46s)]
*  it's really sick. Yeah. Disgusting. I mean, the assault on transgender people in general, [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=2622.66s)]
*  we're so far beyond any reasonable concerns about some of the sports issues and maybe those who [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=2628.3399999999997s)]
*  we worked out, uh, case by case or by local leagues and youth healthcare issues where, [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=2634.2599999999998s)]
*  where beyond the concerns, uh, on children basically in surgery and puberty blockers and stuff. [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=2639.54s)]
*  But I will say, I even on that, I've become sort of radicalized in the sense that reading a little [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=2647.46s)]
*  bit of the Supreme court decision late last week, the argument for the Tennessee law is that they [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=2651.14s)]
*  get to override everyone, the family, the doctor, the kid, other people who maybe the state could [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=2656.66s)]
*  insist on some counselors coming in who, you know, sort of to, to, to take a look who not just hired [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=2662.66s)]
*  by the family or by the hospital. If they're concerned that there's a kind of collusion going [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=2668.2599999999998s)]
*  on, I wouldn't necessarily object to that. Um, but everyone wants to go ahead with a certain [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=2671.7s)]
*  treatment and the state of Tennessee has decided to prohibit it. You have to have a pretty high [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=2678.42s)]
*  bar in mind and it's important treatment. And there's a lot of evidence. If you don't have that [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=2682.7400000000002s)]
*  treatment, you have real harm to these kids, you know, suicide, suicide attempts and terrible [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=2686.1s)]
*  things. And the state of Tennessee just gets to block that. I don't know. It seems to me like the [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=2690.34s)]
*  bar and the Supreme court was like, Hey, it's kind of, it's not really a gender discrimination. So [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=2694.02s)]
*  we're just going to apply, I think what they call rational basis scrutiny, which is very low level, [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=2698.42s)]
*  not the heightened scrutiny that you should have in sex or race and stuff. And so it seems like [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=2702.9s)]
*  maybe they had a reasonable reason to be worried about all this. So we're just going to defer to [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=2707.46s)]
*  them really embarrassingly bad reasoning. And, and really they want to stay out of this. They [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=2710.82s)]
*  think that's a way they can, you know, do what they believe, which I suppose is to stop the stuff [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=2717.06s)]
*  without really engaging on the merits or in the details. But I would just point out that [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=2721.78s)]
*  all the conservatives have all, you know, it's the family, the parents have, what's wrong with [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=2726.5s)]
*  these books in those school elementary school libraries? How could a book be there? The parents [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=2729.78s)]
*  didn't approve of how can you let teachers say something in class about their, if they're male, [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=2733.46s)]
*  about their husband, or if they're female, about their wife, you know, and have a picture of that [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=2738.42s)]
*  person on the, on the, on their, on the teacher's desk, that's terrible parents, right? Parents [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=2743.14s)]
*  rights totally out the window, totally 100% out the window in this case. So the, the animus against [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=2747.7s)]
*  transgender people is disgusting. And I do worry that it's a little more pervasive than some of the [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=2754.02s)]
*  other things Trump is trying to exploit. But, but of course, as he exploits it, it becomes harsher. [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=2760.02s)]
*  I, were people really worried about these people in the military? Incidentally, I don't know, I know [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=2764.2599999999998s)]
*  a fair number of people in the military. They weren't really telling me a lot about this in the [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=2767.06s)]
*  conversations I've had in the last few years, you know? Yeah. And also the military does so much [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=2771.3s)]
*  stuff now, right? Like in your, in their head, they immediately try to go to like, oh, and the [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=2775.86s)]
*  barracks might create issues with unit cohesion, which is, which is I really to begin with. But if [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=2780.18s)]
*  you like, you actually read this post story, it's like a lot of the folks are like back in an office [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=2785.22s)]
*  working on Intel gathering, you know, doing like, what possible impact could being transgender have [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=2790.1s)]
*  on your ability to be on a computer and do Intel gathering for the military or, you know, other, [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=2796.98s)]
*  you know, JAG services, et cetera. The whole thing is just fucking preposterous. All right, last thing [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=2802.34s)]
*  is we have this New York mayor's election coming tomorrow. We were just discussing about it in [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=2809.14s)]
*  Slack. It's a primary, there's some people on the internet that are acting like this primary is, [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=2814.58s)]
*  as you know, the end of the world who could, you know, that the state of American democracy and the [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=2820.5s)]
*  left rests on whether sex pest Andrew Cuomo or leftists Zoran Mamdani wins when actually both [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=2826.42s)]
*  Mamdani and Cuomo are on other ballot lines in this weird New York ballot system and the incumbent [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=2836.6600000000003s)]
*  mayor Eric Adams is on another weird ballot line. So it's very possible that tomorrow's election [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=2841.6200000000003s)]
*  ends, which is also kind of good. The ranked choice voting thing is a little strange. And we [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=2848.02s)]
*  end up on Wednesday waking up and it's still Cuomo versus Mamdani versus Adams versus Silva or whatever [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=2852.02s)]
*  the, the, the vigilante Republican candidate is. So a very weird race. There are a couple of normal [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=2858.42s)]
*  candidates. If it's too late, if you're looking for somebody to vote, to put number one, I really [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=2865.78s)]
*  do like Zelderman. Brad Lander seems totally fine. Scott Singer seems totally fine. Adrian Adams [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=2870.2599999999998s)]
*  seems totally fine. But here we are. Bill, do you have any, any takes on yours while hometown? [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=2876.26s)]
*  Bill Lander It's depressing. And for those of us who've been saying both to ourselves, you know, [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=2881.78s)]
*  and of course publicly as well, you know, hey, Abigail Spanberger, Democratic nominee for [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=2886.5800000000004s)]
*  governor of Virginia, Mikey Sherrill, Democratic nominee for the governor of Jersey, that's a [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=2890.5800000000004s)]
*  Democratic party. That's fine with me. And I thought the radicals are taking over everything. [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=2894.26s)]
*  New York City could be, could undercut that argument quite a bit. But again, maybe they [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=2898.26s)]
*  could have put up a decent candidate, you know, are there not enough people that quote, [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=2901.6200000000003s)]
*  Democratic establishment, don't they kind of live in New York? A lot of them last aren't, [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=2905.06s)]
*  maybe I'm wrong about this, but isn't the, [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=2909.46s)]
*  Scott [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=2910.74s)]
*  Couldn't they have circled the wagons around someone? [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=2911.4s)]
*  Bill Lander Isn't the minority leader of the Senate and the minority leader of the house, [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=2912.58s)]
*  aren't they both from New York City? Kind of unusual actually in American history, if that's [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=2915.86s)]
*  the case, maybe unique, I don't know. Maybe they could have spent a little effort getting like [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=2919.46s)]
*  the equivalent of Spanberger or Sherrill. Maybe that's too high a bar, but okay, could they get [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=2924.98s)]
*  some sane human, you know, someone who's not a sex pest and who was some demonstrated some [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=2928.98s)]
*  competence, a mini Bloomberg type, you know, to run and put 50 million bucks up saying this is the [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=2934.18s)]
*  guy and you got to list him somewhere on your ballot and don't list, it's fine for me to say [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=2939.22s)]
*  don't list Zoran and stuff. And then you get a moderate who would be reasonable. So they've got [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=2942.8199999999997s)]
*  the I mean, this is a case where I've got to say the moderate Democrats are okay, I think they're [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=2948.74s)]
*  fine, actually, mostly around the country. Some of these officeholders, like Spanberger and Sherrill, [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=2953.22s)]
*  who both launched their own political careers in 2018, they didn't wait for some establishment to [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=2957.7799999999997s)]
*  select them are fine, more than fine. They're admirable. Jason Crowe, many other people we know, [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=2961.78s)]
*  Seth Moulton, the Democratic moderate Democratic establishment is really pathetic. What are these [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=2966.1000000000004s)]
*  guys doing all the time? They're sitting, they got tons of money, they've got tons of allegedly [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=2971.3s)]
*  powerful organizations. I don't know, they're having a lot of zoom calls, I even get to go on [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=2975.78s)]
*  a few of them and listen to them. And I don't know what, but like, God forbid in an actual mayor race, [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=2981.38s)]
*  the largest city in the country, I understand they're not going to worry about a Dayton primary and [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=2987.3s)]
*  spend a lot of time making sure Dayton nominates the right kind of Democrat, but maybe New York [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=2991.22s)]
*  City, they could have spent a little time and it's unbelievable. You talk to these guys, some of the [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=2994.98s)]
*  New York Times, it's just they lament this as if this were a hurricane that they couldn't do [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=2998.98s)]
*  anything about force of nature. Can you believe that we're stuck with this? I was in New York [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=3002.74s)]
*  giving a talk a month ago. Can you believe we're stuck with this choice? Now I look, I know [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=3006.66s)]
*  individual can change the whole dynamics of a city's politics. And I don't mean to berate some [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=3011.3799999999997s)]
*  hardworking person who is it doesn't have the time to spend 12 hours a day trying to figure out how [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=3015.9399999999996s)]
*  to fix this, but they should have been a little, some people should have stepped up a little more [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=3020.74s)]
*  in this case. They could have looked at the field and circled the wagons around one of the other [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=3024.4199999999996s)]
*  candidates that's in the field or found another candidate. Right. A couple of the other moderate [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=3028.58s)]
*  candidates seem perfectly fine, incidentally, right? Adriana is fine. She's on the on the [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=3032.74s)]
*  city council or whatever. Zellner is maybe too young as a state senator, but like if these are, [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=3036.9799999999996s)]
*  I don't know, you could find, you could have found somebody. I agree with that and they are pathetic [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=3041.9399999999996s)]
*  and the DNC is so bad. There's so much news. I haven't been able to kind of get to, I have like [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=3046.18s)]

*  a little excuse to do a segment on it, but we'll get to it. But you know, Ken Martin like wants to [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAEerdhScw&t=3056.3399999999997s)]
