Video Description: Republicans moved at such lightning speed that even they don't know how many people would lose their health insurance— or how much they'd be spiking the deficit with their highly risky and big, ugly turd of a bill. And they don't care because they're cosmically committed to stopping the government from making rich people pay for healthcare for people who aren't. Plus, Dem leaders have an age culture problem, environmental groups are stuck in a Ralph Nader time-warp, and the danger of radical politics and supporting Hamas hits home on the streets of DC. Jonathan Chait joins Tim Miller.

# Voters Will HATE the New Tax Bill (w/ Jonathan Chait) | Bulwark Podcast
**The Bulwark Podcast:** [May 22, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU)
*  Hello and welcome to the Bullard podcast. I'm your host Tim Miller [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=0.0s)]
*  delighted to have back at the show staff writer at the Atlantic writing about American politics and policy and [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=3.4s)]
*  triggering [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=10.0s)]
*  John Padoretz in the far left daily. It's Jonathan Chait. What's happening? [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=11.36s)]
*  So glad to be on your show again, Tim. It's good to have you so we have passed [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=16.88s)]
*  The house rather has passed by one vote [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=21.92s)]
*  What they've turned the big beautiful bill [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=25.84s)]
*  Sarah Sarah longwell and Bill Kristol are trying to rebrand as the big fugly turd and [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=28.56s)]
*  I guess you have an article out this morning about how it's the largest upward wealth transfer in American history [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=33.32s)]
*  Why don't we just get your overall reaction then we're going to go through the policy and politics of it [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=38.44s)]
*  It's it's pretty shocking in a way that Republicans were willing to absorb the political and economic risks [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=43.24s)]
*  That this legislation is going to cause them the political risks of [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=50.44s)]
*  combining two unpopular things tax cuts for the rich and [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=55.24s)]
*  Medicaid cuts and the economic risks of blowing up the deficit at a time when [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=58.8s)]
*  interest rates are high and rising and [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=64.24s)]
*  Interest payments are already a trillion dollars a year [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=67.08s)]
*  And the recovery is is teetering from the trade war to me the argument [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=70.48s)]
*  This piece is that just shows the level of ideological commitment they have to the project of [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=75.52000000000001s)]
*  shrinking [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=81.76s)]
*  redistribution and that and that's really been the major theme of my writing since I started in journalism the Republican Party's just [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=82.88000000000001s)]
*  Absolutely implacable commitment to shrinking redistribution [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=90.84s)]
*  They just hate when the government taxes rich people to give money to people who aren't rich. They think it's it's just wrong [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=94.4s)]
*  It's unfair at a cosmic level and they'll do anything they can to roll it back and that's what they're doing now [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=100.32000000000001s)]
*  Not to [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=109.64s)]
*  In any way, you know minimize the work that you've been doing in journalism talking about the Republicans love for tax cuts for the rich [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=111.28s)]
*  For the past. Yeah a couple of decades. Yeah, it does feel like this is [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=118.38s)]
*  the worst example of it for a variety of reasons like one it is happening at a moment where they're like [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=123.56s)]
*  Trying to brand themselves as a to a kind of a populist working man's rebrand [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=130.28s)]
*  So yeah direct conflict to the actual messaging that they're putting forth [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=134.8s)]
*  I you know, I mean say what you want about the tenants of Reaganism. He was pretty unapologetic about about about this [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=139.56s)]
*  so that's one so it's there is a [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=146.16s)]
*  dishonesty to it, but also just the economic situation that we're in right now like the [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=149.68s)]
*  Given the massive as you just mentioned the interest payments on the debt that we are making given the fact that what we've seen from the bond [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=155.66s)]
*  Markets about how it's it's really impacting people's lives in a way that the debt and deficit [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=162.74s)]
*  Wasn't you know during some of these past tax tax fights, right? [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=167.94s)]
*  Like people who have car loans home loans student like the interest rates are rising in a way that's squeezing a lot of [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=171.98000000000002s)]
*  middle class people [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=179.46s)]
*  It is happening like after a lot we've had several of these already [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=181.06s)]
*  The Reagan tax cut like took a top tax rate for a very high level down to a lower level, right? [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=186.66s)]
*  It was what when one increase since then and so and it's been brought back down then back and forth [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=192.02s)]
*  It's gone back and forth with the control of government. Yeah, so, you know [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=197.04s)]
*  I mean we're doing it at just at a moment where it is on the merits the least called for and and potentially damning and [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=200.5s)]
*  The and where the politics of it are, you know betray a deep hypocrisy and what's the what Mac is putting for? [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=208.66s)]
*  So I agree with you on the economics. I disagree with you on the politics [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=214.94s)]
*  So why don't I start where I agree and then and then I move to the disagreement [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=218.98s)]
*  So I'll give you a chance to push back on the economics. You're right [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=222.5s)]
*  I mean the interest rates have been low since Bill Clinton came in Bill Clinton got rid of the deficit created a structural surplus [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=225.5s)]
*  Brought interest rates down to rock-bottom levels and he created so much [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=233.38s)]
*  Headroom on the deficit that that George W Bush could blow up the deficit Trump could blow up the deficit [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=238.17999999999998s)]
*  Biden to an extent could blow up the deficit and no one really paid a big cost for it [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=246.17999999999998s)]
*  But that era seems to be over [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=252.34s)]
*  It's in I'm not sure there is an economic free lunch where you can just keep issuing [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=254.54s)]
*  Treasury debt we want more people to borrow money to fund our deficits and they'll just keep buying up those t-bills over and over again [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=259.66s)]
*  It at any price that doesn't seem to be the case anymore. So we don't know what's going to happen [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=266.46s)]
*  I don't want to say that that there will be a huge crisis [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=271.14s)]
*  But we don't there might be and we don't know and it's highly risky. So on the politics [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=274.22s)]
*  Sometimes when I listen to your show and you guys talk about the past I think oh [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=280.18s)]
*  This is why these guys used to be Republicans [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=283.78000000000003s)]
*  That's refreshing [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=286.1s)]
*  That's right. That's why you used to be Republicans [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=288.1s)]
*  It's nice to remind people why it's nice for us to flex the old muscles [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=290.1s)]
*  You know, it's nice to demonstrate to people that we haven't gone fully native [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=293.90000000000003s)]
*  You know, that's good when you put on those rosy glasses and remember the good old days [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=297.74s)]
*  This is what I like to put on my old [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=302.42s)]
*  Liberal Democrat hat and remind you that George W Bush didn't say [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=305.22s)]
*  He was going to give rich people a huge tax cut because he thought they were productive [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=309.20000000000005s)]
*  Or they deserve to keep their own money. He just lied [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=314.1s)]
*  He said no, no, no the poorest people are gonna get the biggest tax cut it, you know [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=317.3s)]
*  It wasn't true Ronald Reagan was was also in many ways selling himself as a new working man's [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=321.54s)]
*  Republican he would you know speak to the unions he would say like he's got you know, he's he's more populous than old [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=328.90000000000003s)]
*  Than old Republicans because it was never popular to say I wanted tax cuts for the for the rich [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=335.90000000000003s)]
*  So people are always comparing the rhetoric of whoever is a Republican now with the policies of the old [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=340.54s)]
*  But at the time they were never selling the policies at face value [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=345.82s)]
*  We're just gonna have to go through and look at some George W Bush [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=350.26s)]
*  We're never separate bonus. Okay, well we want we watch George W Bush's [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=352.82s)]
*  2003 [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=358.22s)]
*  Speech about the second tax cut we're gonna watch speeches about it together and do a mystery science theater [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=359.46s)]
*  Well, that'll be some bonus content for the weekend [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=367.78s)]
*  I'm not prepared to push back on that [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=370.06s)]
*  So I'll grant it to you for now with a caveat that we might have some bonus content later [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=372.62s)]
*  Sure, Jared golden I think makes it pretty compelling. I want to get into the policy substance of this little bit [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=376.65999999999997s)]
*  Just one more on the biggest picture. Yeah, I thought Jared Goldin's critique was pretty compelling because [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=381.06s)]
*  Jared Golden's been a craw in the eye of Democrats in a lot of ways and he's probably been the most man cheney in the house [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=385.82s)]
*  he hasn't you know, maybe gone full mansion, but [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=391.97999999999996s)]
*  He has been willing to [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=394.82s)]
*  buck the Democratic Party on a number of things related to working-class voters in particular and [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=397.7s)]
*  And so it was interesting to see his his response to this bill [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=404.02s)]
*  He writes this the house GOP had every opportunity to work across the aisle the right of budget the put middle-class families first and said [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=408.74s)]
*  They're ramming through an extreme agenda that takes health care away from the working poor and [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=414.18s)]
*  Borrowed trillions of dollars to fund a package of tax cuts tilted to those at the top [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=417.9s)]
*  Mainters want more health care not less they want a tax code where everybody pays their fair share [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=422.21999999999997s)]
*  They want Congress to get its fiscal house in order the bill fails on each of those fronts [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=425.46s)]
*  So this is one of the easiest no votes I've ever taken [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=429.09999999999997s)]
*  I would think that would be like a warning sign to some of the front-line [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=431.53999999999996s)]
*  Republicans like to have somebody like Jared golden the most front-line of the frontline Democrats saying this is the easiest no vote [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=435.65999999999997s)]
*  He's ever taken and yet there doesn't see that there doesn't seem to be any concern [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=441.78s)]
*  It's kind of full speed ahead on this. I don't think they're not concerned. I think they're concerned [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=446.46s)]
*  I think they're just willing to pay the price and and in a way you have to hand it to them [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=451.21999999999997s)]
*  Sometimes if you really care about policy you're willing to take political risks in order to advance something you think is important [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=455.02s)]
*  They think it's very very important to throw 10 million people [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=461.88s)]
*  Who are poor off their health insurance and to give wealthy people a tax cut that is in keeping with their moral values [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=465.82s)]
*  They're willing to pay a price for it [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=472.46s)]
*  So you can question the values and I do but they're they're not cowards [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=473.78s)]
*  Look at that. That's your that is that is that your real view like you really think they or do you think they've themselves? [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=479.78s)]
*  No, no, I don't I don't think that the across the board the 215 Republicans voted for this just they have a passionate [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=486.65999999999997s)]
*  Yeah principled commitment to throwing the working poor off their health care. I mean [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=493.82s)]
*  Yes, they have fought for decades on these principles [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=501.09999999999997s)]
*  I mean the Republican Party has been utterly rock-solid consistent on [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=505.78s)]
*  opposing economic redistribution for rich to poor for decades and and you know, they they paid a [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=510.7s)]
*  Heavy price in the past and will continue to do so [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=516.54s)]
*  I'm not saying that they are [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=520.5s)]
*  the the they [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=523.22s)]
*  you know [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=525.3s)]
*  Wish they could keep the people in health care zone is like I guess I do think that [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=526.54s)]
*  There's more of just a straight cultish political element to like strain to this [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=531.14s)]
*  I got listen to Bannon yesterday Bannon can you know use the muscle to muscle these guys into not to voting against stuff [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=535.5799999999999s)]
*  We've seen that I in Bannon basically deposed a speaker by himself with Matt Gaetz, right? [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=541.66s)]
*  So he didn't do that [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=544.98s)]
*  But still on the merits Bannon was basically like they should have increased taxes on the rich more there should have been let fewer [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=546.38s)]
*  Cuts to Medicaid there should have been cuts in other places so that we would have got the deficit number down like that's basically [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=552.3s)]
*  the Bannon position on this and [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=557.3s)]
*  And I feel like had Bannon been the chief of staff and had Trump tried to jam that through [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=559.34s)]
*  I think they would have jammed it through [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=565.3s)]
*  I don't know. Do you not think that's right? [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=567.26s)]
*  You think that there would be a there would have been a principled objection among House Republicans to maintaining Medicaid and and letting tax [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=568.78s)]
*  tax rates rise on the rich I [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=575.9399999999999s)]
*  Don't know. It's a counterfactual. So I don't know they've pushed in this direction [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=578.18s)]
*  They haven't laid down the hammer as you said, but they pushed pretty hard [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=581.58s)]
*  They said like what if we just do like a small tax increase on the rich just to give us a talking point [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=585.3000000000001s)]
*  Right just to give us something to say like hey, we raised the top tax rate by two points and the richer are paying their share [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=590.62s)]
*  It's not all the sacrifice going on the on the poor [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=596.86s)]
*  Even if the overall thrust was still very regressive you'd still have a talking point and in in House Republicans [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=599.5s)]
*  Just absolutely refused to go along with it. There was almost no support for that anywhere [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=606.5s)]
*  So, I mean, I don't think they completely lack power [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=611.58s)]
*  I think this is the deal the reason the House Republicans have been willing to overlook the corruption in the [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=614.5s)]
*  Authoritarianism and even some of these old line Republicans don't love that stuff [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=621.7800000000001s)]
*  But they're willing to live with it because there's a payoff in the end and this is the payoff you take away that payoff and the [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=625.1s)]
*  Whole bargain that holds together this party unravels. Yeah [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=631.3000000000001s)]
*  I [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=635.82s)]
*  Think there's plenty of evidence for that point [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=636.86s)]
*  I think you make a compelling case. There's another look just looking at local Republican looking at the states [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=638.66s)]
*  There's ton of evidence for this too. I'm just like what happening here, Louisiana [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=643.54s)]
*  They passed the most insane regressive tax cut that I've ever heard of last year [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=647.06s)]
*  It's like preposterous that David did it. I think it was great for me, you know [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=651.74s)]
*  They just they they cut the income tax, you know for everybody [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=656.34s)]
*  But but obviously that's disproportionately favors folks towards the top and and they increase the sales tax [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=660.42s)]
*  Pay for it. It's just a pure straight [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=667.06s)]
*  Regressive tax and and they jammed it through party line here in Louisiana crazy [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=670.98s)]
*  Yeah at the state and federal level that is the central policy goal of the part [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=676.3399999999999s)]
*  Let's look really quick at just a couple of the policy particulars [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=680.5799999999999s)]
*  the cuts to snap [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=684.3399999999999s)]
*  81% of recipients of snap live below the poverty line [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=686.62s)]
*  About a third live below half the poverty line [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=689.86s)]
*  They're cutting 30% from snap and you know [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=693.44s)]
*  We'll see what kind of happens in the Senate side of this but like a really draconian [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=697.64s)]
*  Cuts to the snap program which also hurts farmers [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=702.36s)]
*  Yeah [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=706.72s)]
*  Incidentally, right because like the people who are too hungry to eat food don't don't buy food and then you know [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=707.66s)]
*  The people were selling them food lose out [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=712.6800000000001s)]
*  you wrote also about [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=715.32s)]
*  Updating, you know, we'll just keep trashing Reagan's legacy today [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=718.2800000000001s)]
*  Medicaid Queens [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=722.48s)]
*  They one of the amendments [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=725.2s)]
*  That they gave to the Chip Roy's of the world who are never gonna vote against this anyway [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=727.32s)]
*  So I'm not sure why I felt like they had to give him concessions [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=730.96s)]
*  But they gave some concessions to the to the pretend deficit hawks in the house that voted for this [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=733.2800000000001s)]
*  Largest debt-busting bill, you know in endeavor certainly in modern times [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=739.8000000000001s)]
*  They moved up the work requirements for Medicaid from 2029 to 2026 [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=745.6400000000001s)]
*  You wrote about the kind of this myth of the Medicaid Queens. Just just talk about that policy. Yeah, and you know [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=751.12s)]
*  Jonathan Cohen wrote a terrific piece for you guys as well about this for the bull work [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=758.24s)]
*  But the the way this policy he's got his kid was congrats to Jonathan Cohen [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=762.08s)]
*  Our newest board member who we love and his son's getting married this weekend [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=766.4000000000001s)]
*  So I would have him on instead of you to talk about that [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=770.36s)]
*  I will I will I'm gonna witness that the event [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=773.0s)]
*  Yeah, the way this policy works is that you don't technically throw people off [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=777.36s)]
*  Medicaid or at least not directly what you do is you impose work requirements now the [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=783.8s)]
*  overwhelming majority of the people on Medicaid are [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=789.44s)]
*  Eligible so they could pass the requirement or it's not you have to be working out to be you know working age [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=793.08s)]
*  So you have to prove that I'm I'm too old or I have kids at home or I'm disabled or I'm working or I'm looking for [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=798.4s)]
*  Job, you have to go through this these steps and you have to go through them usually every month [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=804.92s)]
*  And you know if you've ever dealt with paperwork requirements from the government. These are like [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=809.72s)]
*  Like the worst version of paperwork requirements where it's like impossible to understand what they're asking for [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=815.48s)]
*  It's impossible to get people on the phone to answer your questions [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=822.6s)]
*  The you know, it's a doge to all the people that would have answered the questions previously in previous years, right? [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=825.48s)]
*  They've tried this in two states Arkansas and Georgia and the experiment is proven that what it does is it throws? [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=831.2s)]
*  Eligible people off the program people who are eligible who are working or otherwise [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=837.4s)]
*  Eligible to receive this just can't get through the paperwork and they lose their eligibility [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=842.32s)]
*  And then they go to the doctor and they find they can't pay for it. Then then they're rude [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=846.44s)]
*  sometimes those people [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=849.88s)]
*  Had jobs and get sick and can't get treatment for getting sick [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=852.68s)]
*  And then lose their jobs as a result of the fact that they're now too sick to work [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=856.2s)]
*  So rather than promoting employment, this actually discourages employment [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=860.2s)]
*  But what it does do is cut government spending because a lot of people just lose their access to medicaid [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=864.2s)]
*  And then that's how the government saves money. That is literally what it does [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=870.4399999999999s)]
*  But you know, they're they're gonna they're gonna claim that well, we're we're just [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=874.04s)]
*  Any other thoughts on the healthcare cuts and there's some marketplace cuts [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=877.5600000000001s)]
*  You know some of the various ACA plans, but I mean, it's not just medicaid folks that are gonna be hurt right now [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=881.0s)]
*  They just they they literally just threw that in the last minute. I mean it's happened so fast [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=886.9200000000001s)]
*  We don't even have analysis of the effects of how many people are gonna lose their insurance and how many people are gonna lose their insurance [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=890.6s)]
*  And that's the only way to do it. So I think that's the only way to do it [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=895.4s)]
*  And I think that's the only way to do it [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=898.6s)]
*  And I think that's the only way to do it [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=900.6s)]
*  So fast we don't even have analysis of the effects of how many people are going to lose their insurance and how [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=902.6800000000001s)]
*  Much the deficit is going to spike and they just don't care [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=908.0400000000001s)]
*  I mean, they're just they're literally just rushing rushing it through so fast because they in a sense they don't even want to know [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=910.6s)]
*  The lack of caring is pretty [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=916.76s)]
*  Striking i'm gonna do a separate. I haven't finished it because I have to watch it in small doses [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=919.0s)]

*  And the and it's in rome. So jd had just met with the pope. So you think if there's ever a moment [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=935.32s)]
*  for your for the humanity and the caring of your fellow man to be [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=942.04s)]
*  Overwhelming your political instincts that might have been in that hour right after you'd met the pope [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=946.42s)]
*  Not the case for jd vance and they start talking about the migration issues and the immigration issues and like truly the biggest takeaway is just that [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=951.24s)]
*  He doesn't give a fuck [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=959.64s)]
*  Like he just doesn't care about these people at all. Yeah, he he's you know, he's just the epitome of an absolute power hungry. Um [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=961.4s)]

*  I wanted to get to the politics of this time to turn to the democrats a little bit [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=1151.34s)]
*  um [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=1156.3s)]
*  Democrats all voted against us, of course, except for the fact that there are three democrats that have died this year [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=1157.58s)]
*  Uh, it's hard to talk about this without being too macabre or crude [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=1162.78s)]
*  And so obviously nothing but sympathies for the families of sylvester turner roald [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=1165.6599999999999s)]
*  grialva and jerry connelly [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=1170.3799999999999s)]
*  but um [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=1172.54s)]
*  Like they're all over 70 and they're all running in safe democratic districts jerry's jerry's maybe a little bit less so but [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=1174.9399999999998s)]
*  The general generally they all have been replaced by younger democrats [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=1181.82s)]
*  and [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=1185.5800000000002s)]
*  Republicans probably still jam this through [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=1186.78s)]
*  If they get them like right, they only got it by one vote yesterday [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=1189.66s)]
*  Uh, two people didn't show up to two republicans didn't show up to the vote two republicans voted against so [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=1192.7s)]
*  You know, they would have had to twist an arm. Uh, tom massey is a crazy son of a bitch [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=1197.1000000000001s)]
*  So he probably was never going to turn vote vote for it [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=1201.9s)]
*  But you know, maybe uh, who's the other guy voted against a davidson of ohio [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=1204.14s)]
*  So, you know republicans probably still get this passed even if the all of the democrats were there [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=1208.22s)]
*  And yet it's like hard to talk about this without especially in the context of biden without just talking about the fact that the democrats [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=1214.7s)]
*  Once again, like made this easier on them than they needed to [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=1222.8600000000001s)]
*  I think what this points to is just a broader cultural problem within the democratic party's leadership class [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=1227.5800000000002s)]
*  When you're a public servant [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=1234.54s)]
*  The responsibility you have is to the american public the law you affect [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=1236.54s)]
*  Hundreds of millions of lives in this country and around the world. That is an awesome responsibility [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=1242.22s)]
*  That responsibility should dwarf whatever feelings you have about your own life and your own satisfaction [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=1247.98s)]
*  What you should be thinking when you wake up every day is how can I maximize? [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=1254.94s)]
*  My choices to benefit the broader world given how many people depend on my choices [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=1259.74s)]
*  And time and time again [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=1266.46s)]
*  Old people in these jobs have chosen to put their own life satisfaction ahead of the broader good [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=1268.46s)]
*  They've decided [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=1276.22s)]
*  I'll be bored [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=1278.3s)]
*  You know my life won't have as much meaning if I step aside and let some younger person take this job [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=1279.74s)]
*  That's what ruth bethe ginsburg decided. That's what diane feinstein decided. That's what joe biden decided. That's what all these old [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=1285.18s)]
*  democrats who actually stand a high chance of [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=1293.24s)]
*  Of happening the the thing that happened happening of dying in office [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=1298.0600000000002s)]
*  Um at an important time [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=1303.42s)]
*  I'm not saying everyone over 65 needs to automatically retire [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=1305.5s)]
*  But the older you get the easier this choice gets and they just [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=1309.3400000000001s)]
*  Don't care enough about the country to make the right choice [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=1313.18s)]
*  And I think it's a it's a it's a cultural problem in the party that people need to get tougher about discussing [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=1316.46s)]
*  Openly and and not be held back by oh we need to be sensitive to their feelings and oh they've served us so long [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=1321.8200000000002s)]
*  Another poor old poor old guy you make a really good distinction there because sometimes this you know [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=1327.1s)]
*  The pushback is oh, this is ageist and we need to respect our oh and like [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=1332.78s)]
*  You know, i'm i if you want to work till you die i'm for that. I don't I don't care [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=1337.1s)]
*  I mean, I understand like it maybe it's it's smarter to [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=1342.94s)]
*  um [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=1346.7s)]
*  You know want to spend some of your golden years of your grandchildren over all this is a personal choice, right? [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=1348.06s)]
*  Like if you started a pr firm and some 30 year old young buck is trying to kick you out [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=1352.78s)]
*  Fight back like keep working and you know, I don't care. It doesn't matter what you do [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=1359.9s)]
*  Like whatever you you feel whatever you need to feel fulfilled. I'm for [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=1363.82s)]
*  This is public service and this was my thing with the biden the whole time and I wrote several columns about this [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=1368.22s)]
*  So it was like this is not about you like this is not about your legacy [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=1373.42s)]
*  Like your legacy is 100% immaterial [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=1378.6200000000001s)]
*  To anyone except for you and jill and your grandkids like that's it and so [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=1382.48s)]
*  And frankly, you're harming it by what you're doing [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=1389.52s)]
*  But but like there's just has been so much focus on all of that rather than focus on this is public service [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=1391.6799999999998s)]
*  The threats are very great right now [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=1398.24s)]
*  and [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=1400.48s)]
*  And as a leader you need to do what is in the public interest first and uh, you know, I just think that [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=1401.52s)]
*  Like you you pointed that out? [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=1407.1999999999998s)]
*  Perfectly and then you add into that [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=1409.52s)]
*  just [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=1412.1599999999999s)]
*  The fact that there's been no I think finally the pressure is starting to build [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=1413.12s)]
*  For the democrat leadership class to reconsider this because just the idea that after the biden catastrophe that the jerry connelly won a leadership battle [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=1417.6s)]
*  Like against aoc to run the oversight committee. It was preposterous. It was preposterous at the time [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=1426.8s)]
*  I'm not i'm not on the aoc 2028 bandwagon [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=1433.9199999999998s)]
*  Objectively aoc was was a right the right person to lead oversight against this administration not somebody that had help [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=1437.38s)]
*  She was good on that committee [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=1443.78s)]
*  I mean [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=1445.38s)]
*  You the things you and I might not love about aoc were not germane to her performance in that committee [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=1446.1s)]
*  Because that committee was not about medicare for all it was not about foreign policy [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=1453.06s)]
*  It was just about the blocking and tackling of of of working really hard and communicating [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=1458.02s)]
*  Republican corruption to the to the country. She's really good at that [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=1463.3600000000001s)]
*  um [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=1466.98s)]
*  I guess just since we're here, you know, and we're doing the with the biden book tour [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=1469.3s)]
*  Do you have any do you have any additional biden thoughts you want to share? [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=1473.14s)]
*  And if any of the revelations from the past week, uh brought brought any nuance or color to your views or same as it ever was [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=1476.98s)]
*  You know, I've I've contradictory thoughts. I think a point that you made is that like [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=1485.94s)]
*  The cover-up thing is real to the extent that people around biden [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=1490.66s)]
*  Understood how limited he was and they were working to keep that [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=1496.4s)]
*  hidden [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=1501.46s)]
*  But [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=1503.46s)]
*  They thought he was going to go on the debate stage and win, correct? [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=1504.5s)]
*  They didn't put him up on the debate stage because they thought he was demented [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=1507.78s)]
*  They they thought he was going to win. So [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=1512.1000000000001s)]
*  So, I mean, I think it's very hard to reconcile the most extreme kind of cover-up scenario [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=1514.8200000000002s)]
*  with that [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=1520.9s)]
*  that said [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=1522.3400000000001s)]
*  I think if you look back on the way [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=1524.1s)]
*  Liberals were discussing biden all along and even after the debate [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=1527.12s)]
*  There there's a real internal culture problem. We had where it was hard to say this guy shouldn't be the candidate [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=1532.8999999999999s)]
*  We're going to lose like I wrote those pieces and when I wrote those pieces [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=1540.1s)]
*  I would get slammed over and over again, right? You've got you know an audience capture problem. You've got social media [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=1544.82s)]
*  Dynamics that make people hesitant to say what they know and like wouldn't it be either just to write the column [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=1551.52s)]
*  Or to make the point about the thing that all my audience is going to like hearing and not the thing that they don't like [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=1557.6200000000001s)]
*  Hearing and when enough people do that it prevents you from [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=1563.7s)]
*  Correcting real mistakes in your own position and then you lose and then that feels a lot worse [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=1567.68s)]
*  And you know and and I think people I hope people learn the right lesson [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=1573.38s)]
*  Which is like an open culture where people can actually identify mistakes on their side and say them without getting slammed [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=1576.82s)]
*  Um by the by their own side and in treated as the enemy is ultimately a healthier culture [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=1584.6599999999999s)]
*  Yeah [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=1590.8999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, and within any organization dissent within an organization is helpful, right? Like everybody's saying yes, sir [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=1591.7s)]
*  Mr. Ceo sir like is a path to enron, you know [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=1598.1799999999998s)]
*  Okay, any organization right like this is that's a healthy organizational cultural align consent [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=1602.1s)]
*  Also, why don't we give a quick shout out to some of our elders, too? [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=1608.02s)]
*  uh, there there are uh, you know benefits and uh threats to to every um, [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=1611.86s)]
*  Every situation while as a public servant [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=1618.74s)]
*  At what in a safe blue district? [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=1621.86s)]
*  Maybe it doesn't make sense for you to be 77 years old with health issues and running again [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=1623.46s)]
*  Maybe it's better for you to have a younger person replace you [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=1627.3s)]
*  Uh in the pundit class, it seems like there was some value actually in being [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=1630.34s)]
*  Uh a retired, you know a semi-retired person because david axelrod and james carville and bill crystal [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=1634.8999999999999s)]
*  Uh, they weren't worried about what people said about them. They're old and curmudgeonly [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=1641.3s)]
*  They were able to actually say the truth that a lot of people who [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=1647.62s)]
*  You know were maybe hoping that they could get invited to the the [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=1651.78s)]
*  2025 white house christmas party weren't and so, you know, there's a role in life forever [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=1655.44s)]
*  I guess one is one lesson for this maybe no role for mcdonnell and his four million dollar uh payout [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=1660.1s)]
*  But he got that's true, uh to fucking ruin the country. So uh boots to you mcdonnell [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=1665.78s)]
*  Um one other quick thing on age or I guess maybe it's more acuity [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=1670.5s)]
*  You wrote about this [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=1675.06s)]
*  um the there's this federman saga and and then I was like somewhat wrapped into just because I interviewed him and [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=1676.58s)]
*  And I was like he is just not [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=1684.42s)]
*  Not capable of doing these kind of interviews and I had to treat him with kid gloves [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=1686.9s)]
*  I felt like like some people some listeners were like, why didn't you go harder at him on that? [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=1691.22s)]
*  And I was like it felt like arguing at the second grader [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=1694.42s)]
*  I you know, I didn't I didn't want to be too mean and um, and and so I said that after the interview [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=1696.9s)]
*  And uh, and that got included in this big the first ben terris article about federman and and there's been this like [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=1703.7s)]
*  Backlash now, you know the the republicans are you know on the right? [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=1710.0s)]
*  There's been a lot of commentators and on fox like coming to federman's defense [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=1714.5s)]
*  Be like he is [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=1718.74s)]
*  Actually his his mental acuity is fine and the left is just coming for him because he took a pro israel position [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=1720.1000000000001s)]
*  And I don't know how that squares with the bulwark coming for him [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=1726.98s)]
*  But you know so to speak, uh, but uh, whatever, um, because you guys hate israel so much. Yeah [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=1729.8600000000001s)]
*  So anyway, I don't know what if you have any additional, uh thoughts on the federal [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=1734.74s)]
*  I mean I wrote a piece about it [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=1738.66s)]
*  You can read it in the atlantic and I tried to just go through this argument step by step [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=1740.18s)]
*  So i'm not going to recapitulate the whole thing [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=1743.94s)]
*  But number one the position the republicans are taking on this makes absolutely no sense the main person [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=1746.9s)]
*  who's who's testified about [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=1754.02s)]
*  Federman's mental state is [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=1756.5600000000002s)]
*  Is his his chief his chief staff stuff, right? It's adam. Um gentleston gentleston, right? [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=1759.22s)]
*  Blank anisine friend of mine. Um [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=1765.54s)]
*  Adam gentleston has complained about the woke staffers when the woke staffers were attacking federman's israel position [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=1768.5s)]
*  He was slapping them down and saying he got elected you didn't get elected [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=1775.3s)]
*  So the idea that adam gentleston is complaining about federman's health because adam gentleston is is upset about federman's israel position [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=1778.8999999999999s)]
*  Is is implausible? [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=1786.74s)]
*  um [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=1788.82s)]
*  And and I'd want to point out in this piece is that the republicans are are literally doing the exact same thing that the biden [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=1789.7s)]
*  Deadenders were doing which is just disregarding extensive evidence that that this public servant is [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=1796.1s)]
*  Has has lost cognitive ability because it's inconvenient for their position to make that admission and it's just remarkable [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=1802.34s)]
*  That when they knew they were coming into this big public debate about biden's fitness [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=1809.3799999999999s)]
*  They had a test case to show that actually were better than you hacks [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=1813.4599999999998s)]
*  We're willing to admit it when a guy we like is second there and they all flunked the test 100% of them [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=1816.8999999999999s)]
*  Flunked the test because they they get some marginal value out of federman [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=1822.18s)]
*  You know casting a vote for pam pandy and saying a nice thing about trump and and being pro, uh netanyahu [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=1826.42s)]
*  um [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=1833.3s)]
*  so some other I I guess I forgot if you I wrote you wrote about this or I just I say tweeting about it, but um, [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=1835.22s)]
*  There's some other context just in the kind of the demo what was happening, you know during the biden administration that relates to [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=1840.9s)]
*  The big beautiful turd and um, and that was like the inflation reduction act and how they um, [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=1847.78s)]
*  Tried to implement it. So while we're doing inter-democratic debates, maybe let's get abundance filled here [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=1854.6599999999999s)]
*  Uh, there's some discussion that the ira that the ira the inflation reduction act [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=1859.62s)]
*  They were [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=1866.4199999999998s)]
*  Ostensibly trying to rush some of the money out so that republicans couldn't claw it back had republicans won [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=1867.52s)]
*  But it turned out that was a big failure [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=1875.94s)]
*  Yeah, you know I have a I have a big piece coming out of the magazine this weekend about the abundance agenda that I hope [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=1879.78s)]
*  People will have a chance to read over the weekend. Yeah [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=1885.3s)]
*  What people discovered? [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=1889.3s)]
*  basically in the final stages of [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=1892.18s)]
*  passing this signature [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=1895.06s)]
*  Legacy bill for for biden is the same thing that barack obama discovered in the early stages of passing the stimulus [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=1897.38s)]
*  There's no such thing as shovel-ready jobs is what obama said [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=1905.38s)]
*  And what that really means is that we have made it so time consuming for the government to build anything [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=1908.58s)]
*  That it can't be done at at scale and in a reasonable time [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=1914.66s)]
*  That was obama's whole idea when he came in is like we're going to do what roosevelt did during the rest, right? [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=1919.46s)]
*  We're going to put everyone to work by building all these big infrastructure programs [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=1924.9s)]
*  And that's what they did in the 30s and it and it was successful [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=1928.34s)]
*  But they said we can't do that we could do it in the 30s [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=1931.56s)]
*  We can't do it anymore because now the permitting and in all the you know [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=1934.04s)]
*  The this hoops you have to jump through will take so many years the recession is going to be over [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=1938.12s)]
*  By the time we actually put in the 30s they weren't worried about the rare grouse [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=1942.28s)]
*  That was like habitat that was going to be right. No, they built the empire state building in a year [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=1945.72s)]
*  Right, they build these giant infrastructure programs with worse technology. We've got a trader joe's going in down the block [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=1951.24s)]
*  I feel like that's going to be in by 2027 exactly right? No, it does [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=1956.52s)]
*  So, um, you know then then they just kind of forgot this whole lesson [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=1960.6s)]
*  There was just like well that that that sucks [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=1964.76s)]
*  So, you know wish it was different and then they did another like gigantic infrastructure bill they get to the final stages [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=1966.6s)]
*  They say oh wait, you actually can't build stuff in this country. That's a problem [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=1972.04s)]
*  um, they in in one analysis said like you're the whole [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=1977.1599999999999s)]
*  Purpose or at least the main purpose of the ira was to get greenhouse gas emissions down, right? [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=1981.7199999999998s)]
*  We're going to build out green energy. We're going to put people to work. It's going to serve all these purposes, right? [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=1985.7199999999998s)]
*  They're going to be in these battery factories these car factories these new power plants. They're going to have jobs [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=1990.36s)]
*  They're going to love joe biden because joe biden gave them these jobs [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=1995.6399999999999s)]
*  We're going to get emissions down [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=1998.76s)]
*  But they said 80 percent of the emissions reductions projection in this bill will not materialize if we can't fix permitting in this country [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=2000.4399999999998s)]
*  So they tried to fix permitting and you know who blocked them among them [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=2009.32s)]
*  One thing was republicans because republicans were so bad that they raised taxes on the rich in this bill [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=2014.04s)]
*  They said like we're going to make this bill fail because you violated our moral precept to bring this back to point one [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=2019.0s)]
*  but point two [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=2025.0s)]
*  the environmental groups [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=2026.6799999999998s)]
*  Almost all the environmental groups lobbied to block the permitting bill [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=2028.28s)]
*  Because they are so committed to this 1970s ralph nader era agenda of blocking everything [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=2032.84s)]
*  The government does in paperwork that they can't [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=2038.9199999999998s)]
*  Get their heads around the fact that the situation has changed [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=2042.52s)]
*  What you actually need to do to save the environment is build stuff and not prevent the building of stuff [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=2044.76s)]
*  So a huge part of the abundance agenda came out of this realization [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=2049.64s)]
*  That the choices that that liberals especially have made in the past have prevented us from doing the things we want to do today [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=2054.12s)]
*  So you have to almost completely completely reverse your old mentality [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=2062.12s)]
*  In order to do the things you want to do and getting people to reverse their mentality is hard work [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=2067.7200000000003s)]
*  But that's what the abundance agenda is about this hard work [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=2072.6s)]
*  You know who's out there in these streets doing it is ezra klein [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=2074.68s)]
*  What have you made of ezra's heel turn and this was your space? [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=2077.4s)]
*  Do you feel a little do you feel a little jealous? [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=2081.16s)]
*  You know that ezra's out there arguing with sam sader and like getting shouted down by [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=2083.64s)]
*  You know the all the liberals that loved him when he was you know starting vox and what do you make about kind of like dark ezra? [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=2089.0s)]
*  Ezra doesn't love being hated like most people [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=2097.16s)]
*  I kind of do I kind of enjoy being maybe that's why people have moved on for you because haters [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=2101.64s)]
*  Don't love hating people that don't mind being haters want to hate haters want to get under the skin [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=2107.72s)]
*  No, it's it's true. Um, so ezra's really I mean ezra's a brilliant writer. I've I've loved his work since he started [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=2113.64s)]
*  He's his work is better than ever [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=2121.56s)]
*  And I feel like he he tries to keep things as simple as he possibly can [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=2124.84s)]
*  But in a way, it's it's become impossible for him because he's hit this red line. He's he's really [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=2131.0s)]
*  Challenged progressive dogma for many people at such a fundamental level that they need to do [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=2136.74s)]
*  The only way they need to do the only thing they ever do when their ideas are challenged [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=2143.48s)]
*  Which is to demonize the person who's challenging them and say that person's a terrible evil person who's our enemy [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=2146.92s)]
*  Um, and you should never listen to a single word he says [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=2153.16s)]
*  Um, so he's really struck this raw nerve within the left [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=2155.56s)]
*  Um that it's been fascinating to see because he's the nicest guy on earth and convincing people to hate esra klein [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=2160.12s)]
*  Is a hard task, but people are trying it anyway [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=2166.6s)]
*  Yeah, convince people to be a little annoyed by him. Maybe it would be easier but hate is tough [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=2169.56s)]
*  Sweetheart, um, I I feel this way [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=2175.16s)]
*  So we discussed earlier going back to our top topic [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=2177.56s)]
*  Maybe some of the blind spots and some of the limitations of being a former republican [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=2180.52s)]
*  Commentating on the news of the day and i'm open to the fact that i've got some of those i've been working through them slowly [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=2185.16s)]
*  But surely, um, there's also some clarity though [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=2189.96s)]
*  Yeah, like I look at like just the biden thing [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=2193.08s)]
*  Last year and this now this esra kerfuffle. I look at it and i'm like [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=2196.76s)]
*  Have all these people lost their mind and like esra is not saying anything that is just not [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=2201.4s)]
*  like like as [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=2206.92s)]
*  Obvious as the sun rises in the east or like lebron james is a good basketball player. It's like [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=2208.68s)]
*  California [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=2214.1s)]
*  Is a blue state controlled by democrats and they have they have the highest cost of living [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=2215.32s)]
*  It's challenging for middle-class folks. They are unable to build a train [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=2219.64s)]
*  And that's a problem and there's they have a homelessness crisis and that's a problem and california should try to fix it [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=2224.92s)]
*  Like that's like really all he's saying. I mean you could kind of some abundance has a lot of detailed policy walk nerd stuff [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=2230.52s)]
*  But his overarching point you could summarize in a tweet [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=2238.52s)]
*  And and a very obvious one and it's pretty I guess it's kind of alarming to me that it's even controversial [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=2241.48s)]
*  People don't like being told that they're the problem [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=2249.72s)]
*  No one likes that and what abundance does is it points at the progressive wubin and says we are the problem [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=2252.8399999999997s)]
*  The things we did in the 1970s are causing us to fail today [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=2258.8399999999997s)]
*  We have to change our mentality and a lot of people are still invested in those ideas [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=2263.24s)]
*  And the the groups that [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=2268.44s)]
*  One of the points i've tried to make in this piece that i'm writing obviously you haven't seen hasn't come out yet [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=2271.0s)]
*  Is that we're teasing people now pretty much all of our listeners are already atlantic subscribers because this is the official home of the atlantic [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=2275.88s)]
*  The official podcast home of the atlantic so i'm sure they'll be able to read it [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=2283.2400000000002s)]
*  It's true. But if there are any if there are any who are not go go subscribe to the atlantic [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=2286.76s)]
*  And eventually jeff goldberg will give me a 10 pig on all those subs, but it hasn't happened [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=2291.96s)]
*  I'm sure will um [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=2297.08s)]
*  People talk about the groups, right? [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=2299.24s)]
*  That's that's part of the discourse within the left is the role of the progressive groups in creating this infrastructure [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=2300.7599999999998s)]
*  Where every group has its position that it holds to and it gets all the other groups told to it [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=2307.88s)]
*  And that's what's pushed the party to the left over the last 10 years [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=2311.72s)]
*  ralph nadir [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=2315.72s)]
*  Pretty much invented that he invented the groups [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=2317.4s)]
*  He invented all these groups that came [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=2320.36s)]
*  In to dc to lobby for their individual position the whole idea that work the he called them like a new class of citizen [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=2322.36s)]
*  That we're inventing this this professional activist group [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=2328.76s)]
*  So like this is a gigantic part of the progressive movement infrastructure that has a stake in [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=2332.12s)]
*  In this set of laws that the abundance movement is trying to change [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=2339.16s)]
*  So it's not a small thing that they're trying to revise. It's really the entire orientation of the progressive movement [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=2343.08s)]
*  um [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=2349.96s)]
*  Somebody who's been making these cases for 30 years and neoliberal shill [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=2351.56s)]
*  Yeah, as please she'll you have college age kids not college, right? We're in college. That's right college go blue. Um, and uh, [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=2355.96s)]
*  And so you're you know, you're you kind of uh are are in touch with what's happening with the youth a little bit [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=2363.32s)]
*  Just from a parenting perspective. Um [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=2368.92s)]
*  Do you ever kind of sit back and be like why are we so unpopular? [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=2372.68s)]
*  I just I can't it's hard to kind of understand right we're weeping that weeping the [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=2376.38s)]
*  neoliberal [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=2382.94s)]
*  Right, like it's like the there is there's this huge like negative reaction on you know online [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=2385.34s)]
*  It's like the mega folks like we need to tear everything down [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=2391.18s)]
*  And the young online leftists like we need we need to totally like reject all of these leaders that have got us to this place [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=2394.62s)]
*  And instead, you know go to our new to our perfect socialist future [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=2401.42s)]
*  And I just I kind of like look at the arc of the last 50 years and think [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=2406.2200000000003s)]
*  I don't know [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=2411.34s)]
*  Like things have gotten things are pretty good [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=2412.62s)]
*  I can understand why you're mad if you live in youngstown [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=2415.9s)]
*  You know, but um, it's not like venezuela over here or argentina [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=2419.1800000000003s)]
*  Or it's not like, you know like things like directionally have been have gotten better [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=2424.2200000000003s)]
*  Um, you know since since our grandparents were were kids. I what what do you think it is the [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=2430.22s)]
*  reason that [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=2436.94s)]
*  Like the the now new the ezra jonathan chafe [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=2438.3799999999997s)]
*  You as as being rejected by the youth [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=2441.98s)]
*  I mean, that's a really big profound question. I think to to the extent you want to focus on [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=2445.3399999999997s)]
*  Youth I I sort of buy the the theories of you know, jonathan height who's not me? [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=2450.94s)]
*  Let alone in fact completely different person [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=2456.8599999999997s)]
*  um [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=2459.1800000000003s)]
*  That just one different letter. No two different letters. I guess a couple different letters. He's got a d. I don't have a d. I obviously [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=2460.2200000000003s)]
*  That the social media has has caused, you know [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=2466.7000000000003s)]
*  This kind of negative affect and and mental health difficulties [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=2471.26s)]
*  And in a lot of this radical politics on the right and the left [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=2475.98s)]
*  Really is at some level it shades into mental illness in a way that is sometimes difficult to distinguish one from the other where [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=2481.26s)]
*  You just view everything in hyperbolic negative terms [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=2488.86s)]
*  and in refuse to like [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=2493.1s)]
*  Look at practical steps you or the world can be taking to make the situation better [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=2495.9s)]
*  It's it's cognitive behavioral therapy therapy in reverse. I think that's height's phrase right where you just catastrophize [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=2500.1400000000003s)]
*  Everything that's that's happening and in a lot of these spaces [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=2507.42s)]
*  I think it's gotten better actually since elon broke twitter by mistake [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=2511.9s)]
*  But just even saying that like hey i'm kind of like happy [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=2515.9s)]
*  Makes people angry because if if you're like a happy normal well-adjusted person [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=2520.06s)]
*  That means you don't know how terrible the world is and and you're insensitive to to all the problems out there [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=2524.54s)]
*  um, and and and people have actually built political movements around that the whole way of thinking and expressing yourself and it's and it's just [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=2531.5s)]
*  It's totally impossible, right? It's just unworkable. It's it's it's not it's not a practical way [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=2540.38s)]
*  To make the world better. I think there is this nostalgic idea on the left that you old republicans are not burdened by [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=2545.58s)]
*  that the you know that there's something noble in being a protester who shouts and screams and exaggerates and [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=2552.94s)]
*  And carries on because even if you're not technically right you're pushing things in the right direction. I think [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=2559.9s)]
*  um, you know vestigial republicans like yourself understand that that's actually not always the case and oftentimes you just convince people [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=2565.58s)]
*  That you're crazy and they shouldn't listen to anything you say [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=2574.14s)]
*  Yeah [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=2577.98s)]
*  I was with you on the on the cell phone answer [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=2579.74s)]
*  Okay, I don't know if the protest answers right because it because [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=2582.7s)]
*  I've been talking about this a lot on my gen z pod like there's actually it's kind of a surprising lack of protest [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=2585.8199999999997s)]
*  among young folks on the left right now, yeah, right and so [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=2590.8599999999997s)]
*  um the draw the allure to that might be more of a [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=2594.8599999999997s)]
*  Generational thing about your peers, um who are out there in these streets and we appreciate that's true [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=2598.44s)]
*  Um, it's true. No, my people at least leave the house. It's [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=2604.62s)]
*  Young people want to do it all on the phone [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=2608.62s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know. We could probably do a whole podcast on it [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=2611.2599999999998s)]
*  But I think it's just a big challenge right what what ezra is pushing for and derek seems to have an appeal [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=2613.66s)]
*  to [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=2621.8999999999996s)]
*  basically upper middle class [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=2622.7s)]
*  college educated folks and uh, and it is not [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=2624.62s)]
*  resonating [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=2629.3199999999997s)]
*  beyond um [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=2630.54s)]
*  Yeah, I saw a little image of some of the abundance meetups and it's exactly [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=2632.3s)]
*  You know it looks exactly what you think it looked like and god love all the folks at those meetups [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=2635.82s)]
*  Some of them probably board broadcast listeners. We'd probably hang out and agree on a lot of things [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=2639.7400000000002s)]
*  But in the social media age where? [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=2644.3s)]
*  All of that, you know catastrophizing is winning [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=2647.5800000000004s)]
*  You know, how do you make the argument that like well guys? [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=2651.02s)]
*  Uh some of this some of these radical changes might make things worse not better [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=2655.1000000000004s)]
*  Like have you seen china like all of those arguments are a little bit it's tough [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=2658.78s)]
*  It's and like honestly, maybe it's just cyclical and like letting the populace fuck things up for a while [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=2662.46s)]
*  Is the only path back? I don't know [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=2669.26s)]
*  I mean the irony is the biggest piece of it and the oldest piece of the abundance agenda is is housing right? [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=2671.34s)]
*  We should build more housing like look i'm i'm 53. I [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=2676.3s)]
*  bought into the housing market in the 90s when it was [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=2680.6200000000003s)]
*  You know the cost of what's now like a nice cup of coffee at starbucks, right? [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=2683.98s)]
*  and so like [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=2688.62s)]
*  Uh, I the young people like I I don't need it like I own [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=2689.9s)]
*  I own a house now if anything I stand to lose from building more housing and devaluing [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=2694.54s)]
*  the the cost of [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=2701.7400000000002s)]
*  Property which of which i'm already an owner. It's the young people who actually need [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=2704.1400000000003s)]
*  To allow more housing to be built and and the only way to do that is to legalize it [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=2709.5s)]
*  But but but no you're right and the other aspect of it is that abundance agenda like I said [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=2715.02s)]
*  What says who's the bad guys the bad guys in many cases is us or the bad guys? [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=2720.14s)]
*  Isn't a corporation. It's that when you have [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=2725.34s)]
*  If when you want to build a new apartment building you have to get approval of some neighborhood [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=2728.94s)]
*  Planning commission and they're going to listen to the four [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=2734.46s)]
*  75 year olds who've lived there for 50 years who want to show up and complain [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=2737.96s)]
*  About how they don't want anything to change in the neighborhood and they get to veto the whole prospect and tie it up [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=2741.66s)]
*  In lawsuits if they get cranky about it and those bad guys aren't as compelling to some people as a bad guy [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=2746.38s)]
*  Who's a giant wealthy corporation? Yeah, they're a couple but they're bad. There's some bad corporations and some bad geriatrics [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=2752.14s)]
*  That aren't letting people move to the neighborhood. Yeah [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=2758.54s)]
*  By now you've heard about the game-changing products that I use before a night out with drinks. It's called pre-alcohol [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=2764.94s)]
*  Let's face it after a night out with drinks. I don't bounce back the next day like I used to [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=2771.98s)]
*  I gotta make a choice. I can either have a great night or a great next day. That was until I found pre-alcohol [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=2775.5s)]
*  Zebiotics pre-alcohol probiotic is the world's first genetically engineered probiotic [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=2781.1s)]
*  It was invented by phd scientists to tackle rough mornings after drinking [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=2785.18s)]
*  Here's how it works when you drink alcohol gets converted into a toxic byproduct in the gut [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=2789.42s)]
*  It's a build-up of that byproduct not dehydration. That's to blame for rough next days after drinking [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=2793.42s)]
*  Pre-alcohol produces an enzyme to break this byproduct down [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=2799.42s)]
*  Just remember to make pre-alcohol your first drink of the night drink responsibly and you'll feel your best tomorrow [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=2802.2200000000003s)]

*  Uh, it's it's just fucking self-sabotage [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=2913.98s)]

*  Uh, but it's pretty [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=2924.54s)]
*  And it's pretty alarming that this stuff keeps going on and it's it's unfortunate that we have kind of this fake antisemitism [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=2926.6200000000003s)]
*  Agenda being put in place by this administration when there's like actually real issues there [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=2932.54s)]
*  Right the administration is stocking up with right-wing antisemites [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=2937.9s)]
*  In using antisemitism as a pretext to crack down on [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=2942.46s)]
*  peaceful [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=2947.02s)]
*  Demonstrators often with very unobjectable views at the same time [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=2948.04s)]
*  A lot of these demonstrators have very radical very dangerous views. I mean globalize the intifada [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=2953.1000000000004s)]
*  This is what it means [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=2958.46s)]
*  Yeah, I mean what what if they wanted to say let's just people get people around the world to to speak up peacefully [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=2960.38s)]
*  They could say that but that's not what global globalize the intifada means [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=2967.18s)]
*  And and when from from the river to the sea palestine will be arab [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=2972.22s)]
*  Means that there won't be any jews anywhere in the state of israel. There won't be a state of israel. I mean [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=2976.54s)]
*  these [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=2982.46s)]
*  Groups actually are fairly tightly organized and disciplined and they're loyal to hamas [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=2983.9s)]
*  They won't denounce hamas they won't denounce 10 7 because that is actually what they believe [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=2991.34s)]
*  They attract a lot of people who are just motivated to help the palestinians who are suffering horribly [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=2996.54s)]
*  And they so so many of the people who are attracted to these protest groups have noble [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=3003.18s)]
*  Motives that that I share but the causes into which they're joining are often [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=3008.54s)]
*  Bloody ones that we should be honest about describing. Yes [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=3014.94s)]
*  and so and [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=3019.8199999999997s)]
*  And all these things can be true [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=3021.18s)]
*  Like like what's happening in gaza right now is like almost as bad as it's been the whole time [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=3022.2999999999997s)]
*  Like what is happening in gaza like blocking food from getting into gaza? [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=3026.7s)]
*  Young baby like young children and babies are dying in gaza as we speak [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=3030.7799999999997s)]
*  um who are not [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=3036.62s)]
*  These are not hamas [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=3038.7799999999997s)]
*  Toddlers, like these are just toddlers. They're being held hostage by hamas. Yeah [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=3040.8399999999997s)]
*  and so [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=3045.8199999999997s)]
*  You know like there are [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=3047.1s)]
*  valid reasons to to protest and to speak out about the atrocities there, but it is it's just [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=3049.2599999999998s)]
*  It's very obvious to anybody seeing this clearly how often that like bleeds into the type of anti-semitic rhetoric [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=3057.18s)]
*  that [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=3064.3s)]
*  Can take a person to the place where they feel like the right thing to do is to randomly shoot people outside of a capital jewish museum [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=3065.2599999999998s)]
*  Just here's a point that I think i've been making [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=3072.14s)]
*  Students for justice in palestine [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=3075.18s)]
*  Is a radical group [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=3077.58s)]
*  With eliminationist goals that supports hamas and hamat and supports violence people should not work with that group people should not endorse that group [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=3079.66s)]
*  You should find other ways to support the palestinians. I don't care if they're the main group on your campus [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=3087.66s)]
*  That's organizing a protest organize your own protest that's separate from them because they are bad [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=3093.3399999999997s)]
*  Uh blunt and well said um [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=3100.7799999999997s)]
*  speaking of people that are bad and uh and eliminationist, uh, we had a [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=3103.2599999999998s)]
*  Another one of these fucking reality show oval office meetings yesterday between trump and the president of south africa [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=3109.42s)]
*  uh trump advancing [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=3116.46s)]
*  The notion that there is a white genocide happening in south africa [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=3118.78s)]
*  Uh, there have been [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=3123.1s)]
*  I think there were other the lsf in the washington post was there but [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=3124.78s)]
*  12 deaths 12 murders on farms in south africa, which is not good, but there were 6900 murders in south africa [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=3129.2599999999998s)]
*  Last year, right? So we just have to contextualize all this that's happening [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=3136.62s)]
*  There is I heard from I received a nice note from a south african [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=3140.14s)]
*  Who just you know wanted to make sure that it is important to contextualize there this this administration in south africa [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=3143.9s)]
*  There's some bad laws that are being put in place [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=3149.42s)]
*  There's some race-based laws that are being put in place that are pernicious the like in the grand scheme of things [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=3151.5s)]
*  The idea that the white farmers the africaners in south africa are like the only victims in the world [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=3157.18s)]
*  That we should care about and that the the the united states president should browbeat [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=3164.9399999999996s)]
*  the president of south africa in the oval office a week after [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=3170.22s)]
*  sucking the cock of mbs like is is obviously [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=3174.7799999999997s)]
*  motivated by racial animus like it's just obvious what trump is doing here and so um, [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=3179.48s)]
*  Anyway, you've written about this. I wonder if you have any other thoughts [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=3184.94s)]
*  Right one of the columns I wrote last week was that I was trying to make the old an old new republic counterintuitive argument [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=3188.3s)]
*  Which is that like watch out no slate pitches on the bulwark podcast. Okay radical candor here [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=3194.78s)]
*  Yeah before slateway existed that the slate pitch was the new republic pitch anyway, um [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=3201.26s)]
*  When when when trump flew to saudi arabia, he basically he gave a speech [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=3207.1000000000004s)]
*  We're saying like we're you know, we're not here to moralize [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=3211.02s)]
*  We're just about you know, making business deals with people and that's what our foreign policy is about [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=3213.82s)]
*  I think a lot of people took that idea completely at face value [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=3218.06s)]
*  But but my argument is actually they do have values based foreign policy [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=3221.58s)]
*  They they've gone jd vance has gone to europe and he's lectured people about their immigration policies and about their free speech policies [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=3226.78s)]
*  And about letting you know afd have more access to the political system their policies [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=3234.46s)]
*  They've lectured south africans on their treatment of white farmers [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=3239.98s)]
*  Their concepts of democracy and free speech and human rights are very important to their foreign policies [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=3244.46s)]
*  So they have values but their values are bad. It's not amoral [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=3249.9s)]
*  It's immoral foreign policy and I and I think it actually gives them too much credit to assume that it's pure [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=3253.98s)]
*  Commerce based just making money and making deals [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=3260.54s)]
*  Trump's dealings with the gulf are corrupt [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=3263.82s)]
*  They are money based but there is a shared value system [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=3267.5s)]
*  I mean he he genuinely admires the authoritarian character of these regimes [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=3270.38s)]
*  He loves the fact that he can go there and no one is allowed to protest against him [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=3275.02s)]
*  um in in that, you know, he can get his palms greased and in [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=3279.2599999999998s)]
*  And in and that's so that's not just about making deals for the country or even for himself [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=3283.1s)]
*  It's really he you can see it in his face. He loves dictators. He admires them [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=3288.06s)]
*  It's it's a it's a it's a value of his and so like it's a values based polar policy, I think is important [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=3293.9799999999996s)]
*  Yeah, the pluralist countries are the foes [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=3300.7s)]
*  Yeah [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=3303.8999999999996s)]
*  I just it's across the board. I and and it's just [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=3305.2599999999998s)]
*  um [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=3309.18s)]
*  It's like anything in life, you know when you have a friend or colleague, you know, it gets them excited [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=3310.54s)]
*  You know like you can just tell like you can tell like in their energy and their voice and their engagement level [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=3316.22s)]
*  Like trump gets very engaged and excited when he is attacking [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=3322.94s)]
*  our small l liberal [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=3327.2599999999998s)]
*  Allies around the world like he does not like them [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=3329.5s)]
*  He does and when they're black and when they're black all the more so yes, right. He does not really want to be in their company [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=3332.2999999999997s)]
*  He wants to talk down to them and he enjoys [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=3338.7799999999997s)]
*  Like erotically the company of the middle eastern fascists. Yep, and like that's just it [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=3341.98s)]
*  I bet that I bet I think it's a very it is a good point and I was [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=3347.98s)]
*  Making a softer version of the point yesterday by saying that like that the trump doctrine is that this [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=3353.1800000000003s)]
*  That there is a trump doctrine that is mercantilistic [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=3359.42s)]
*  And that they're just they just have carve outs for white people [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=3363.02s)]
*  But i'm i'm i'm open to the the next step of that argument, which is no, it's not purely mercantilistic [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=3365.9s)]
*  It's also values based. It's bad values. I thought it was really you might have pitched it as a [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=3372.38s)]
*  Great to the canadians are mostly white to the western europeans are mostly white [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=3376.86s)]
*  I mean their leaders are are white and he's hostile to them because they're liberal democracies [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=3381.1800000000003s)]
*  um [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=3386.3s)]
*  Well while we're talking about this part of this is related to um [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=3389.82s)]
*  There's this concept that's been going around [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=3393.34s)]
*  Um that if people who are listeners who are blessedly off of the internet [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=3395.5s)]
*  Um are probably not even going to be aware of this concept, uh, but it's been it's an intra right wing fight [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=3400.2200000000003s)]
*  About the the woke right that there is a woke right that is themselves obsessed [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=3405.66s)]
*  with race and identity and [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=3411.4199999999996s)]
*  identitarianism [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=3414.2s)]
*  um and just in a [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=3415.18s)]
*  And and a similar way to how how robin diangelo might be but in in a way that is ill of ill intent [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=3418.46s)]
*  and [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=3425.98s)]
*  And so the key to the the the key difference is the intent is ill but the identitarian, uh, [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=3428.22s)]
*  Obsession is is is the same [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=3434.62s)]
*  Um, you've you've kind of observed this I do think that this in some ways overlaps with what we saw with the south africa discussion [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=3437.02s)]
*  Too, but I don't know if you have any insight into the woke, right? [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=3443.02s)]
*  Right. So this is a critique that sort of originated on parts of the right that were at least [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=3446.06s)]
*  open to trump if not completely in his camp and then since [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=3451.1s)]
*  you know that were basically against the [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=3455.7400000000002s)]
*  Illiberalism of the far left and saw trump as a corrective to that and then realized that trump was [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=3458.78s)]
*  Just recapitulating or in my view exceeding the liberalism of the far left [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=3466.06s)]
*  I would say massively exceeding the liberalism of the far left [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=3472.06s)]
*  Um, and so they were using the word woke to express the kind of parallel the sort of meet the new boss same as the old [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=3475.5s)]
*  boss dynamic of this I personally prefer [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=3482.38s)]
*  Illiberal or authoritarian as descriptors sure [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=3486.52s)]
*  But the difference between my descriptor and woke is they hate the term woke, right? It makes them so angry [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=3490.94s)]
*  They can't stop talking about how angry it makes them [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=3497.5s)]
*  So that's appealing it's appealing to you that for that reason there is a real appeal [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=3501.1s)]
*  In it but also making them realize the degree to which they they really have recapitulated the worst habits of the people [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=3505.8199999999997s)]
*  They most hate I made a can I can I repeat one of my [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=3511.9s)]
*  little twitter burns [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=3516.06s)]
*  Will chamberlain one of these right-wing fedsoc [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=3517.9s)]
*  Illiberal, you know lawyer types who's who's who's who's in the trump circle [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=3521.4s)]
*  He was he was really complaining about ed wheeling was a more, you know traditional conservative who called [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=3527.1s)]
*  Um who called emil bov the justice department staffer a henchman saying we can't promote a henchman [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=3533.1s)]
*  He says like how can you is this the term we're using we're calling him a henchman [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=3539.1s)]
*  Is that fair and and I said like you're right when you're in the walk, right? [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=3542.38s)]
*  You gotta call a pinched person or or person experiencing hench [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=3545.2599999999998s)]
*  That's that's the real nice walk right term [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=3549.74s)]
*  So, you know, you know in a way there are all these parallels but the the language policing [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=3552.06s)]
*  And and but and the conscious obsessions with race they they like to claim sometimes that we're we're we're the race neutral people [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=3556.86s)]
*  But they're not race neutral. They're very very conscious of race. Yeah [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=3564.2999999999997s)]
*  Um, I want to give one example of this conscious obsession with race. That's really kind of tragic [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=3568.3s)]
*  Um that that i'll talk about this just really quick though for listeners [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=3572.86s)]
*  I I did a late night chat with patrick gaspart was on the show a couple weeks ago [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=3575.82s)]
*  Who's ambassador to south africa where we kind of went more into the details about what's actually happening in south africa [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=3579.9s)]
*  So folks if you want to listen to that and go check it out either on youtube or on the bulwark takes feed [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=3584.94s)]
*  Patrick's really really good [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=3589.82s)]
*  the uh [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=3591.82s)]
*  The obsession I was gonna see this more in my comment section from both the woke left and the woke right and so I just kind [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=3593.5s)]
*  Of wanted to weigh in on it because it's such a tragic story. Um, there's a story out of mississippi out of starkville [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=3598.62s)]
*  Really annoying the cowbells at the football game. It's very annoying but it's it is it's america in starkville. Okay, um [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=3604.22s)]
*  casper erickson [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=3611.98s)]
*  Uh, he came from denmark [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=3613.42s)]
*  Maybe he's being targeted because as part of the pressure campaign against denmark to give up greenland [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=3615.18s)]
*  I don't know. He came from denmark on a cultural exchange program in high school [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=3619.02s)]
*  One of these things where you come and do a semester abroad [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=3622.78s)]
*  Um, he went to high school in starkville. He meets an american girl there [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=3625.42s)]
*  um [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=3629.66s)]
*  They they fall in love he moves back to denmark the pen pals [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=3630.86s)]
*  Uh, he comes back. They decided to get married. They have four kids [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=3635.02s)]
*  Uh one on the way, uh [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=3639.82s)]
*  The guy you know, uh fills tries to fill out all the firms to become an american citizen his wife's americans kids are american [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=3641.9s)]
*  I guess 10 years ago one of the forms he did not [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=3648.94s)]
*  Fill out there had been an oversight [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=3652.7s)]
*  He'd had many many meetings with immigration in the intervening periods where they had not told him about this form that he forgot to fill out [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=3654.7799999999997s)]
*  um [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=3661.1s)]
*  Uh, he says it happened right after there was a stillbirth of their child. So they just there was a lot happening in the household [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=3662.06s)]
*  Um, he went in for his immigration checkup. He's still like going through the process like you're supposed to do to become a citizen [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=3668.14s)]
*  Uh the fucking ice goons shackle him [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=3675.2599999999998s)]
*  Uh, and they put him they send him to louisiana. He's in a cell in natchez now. He's been there for one month [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=3678.54s)]
*  Awaiting deportation [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=3686.54s)]
*  Uh while his pregnant wife is at home with the four kids [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=3688.14s)]
*  Uh, they're charging a ridiculous amount for him to even use the phone to call her because it's a private prison [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=3691.5s)]
*  That's monetizing all this [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=3697.02s)]
*  This is a fucking horrific story [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=3698.54s)]
*  And it just and and what it is is an example of just how inhumane the trump immigration regime is across the board [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=3700.54s)]
*  There are elements of it that are racially motivated. They're also that is just a just blanket [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=3707.9s)]
*  Inhumanity and they're trying to reach their numbers and the easiest way to reach their numbers is to take people who are doing things the right way [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=3714.86s)]
*  Not criminals. It's hard to find fucking criminals, right? Because they're the ones who walk in the door exactly [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=3720.86s)]
*  It's easy to find people who just walk in the door [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=3725.18s)]
*  And so this guy is going to be sent back to denmark. Who knows what happens to his family. It is [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=3727.42s)]
*  It is despicable what is doing it is just fundamentally unamerican what we are doing this immigration regime [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=3733.1s)]
*  And so I was grossed out by it and then [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=3739.18s)]
*  Like literally my entire reply chain from left and right was about how this guy's white [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=3743.18s)]
*  It's like oh lefties being like, oh well, it's a white guy [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=3748.46s)]
*  So that's so the trump people let him off the hook eventually and then it's right wing people being like, oh, I thought that [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=3751.8199999999997s)]
*  I thought that we only deported brown people see we also deported whites. Hell. Yeah [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=3757.5s)]
*  And I just like [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=3762.62s)]
*  It is it leads to an unhealthy culture [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=3763.8199999999997s)]
*  Where you're centering the skin color above everything because like the center of this case is the tragedy of it [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=3766.94s)]
*  And the fucking horrific immigration policies that this administration is putting forth and it makes me concerned [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=3773.9s)]
*  When like we are immediately leading to like where people are stoking race war over over things such as this [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=3780.46s)]
*  So anyway, I don't know if you have any thoughts about the story [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=3786.7799999999997s)]
*  Yeah, I mean I think what you're hitting on is this the hangover of this ideology that really got very fashionable in this country for a few years [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=3788.78s)]
*  Maybe peaked around 2020 which is a really a kind of totalizing analysis of race, right? [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=3796.7000000000003s)]
*  Like ibram kendi saying that literally everything is either pro-racist or anti-racist and nothing is is neutral [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=3803.1000000000004s)]
*  and [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=3809.9s)]
*  I think it began with the very correct [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=3811.1000000000004s)]
*  Understanding that racism left an incredibly deep and enduring imprint on american society [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=3814.62s)]
*  That didn't go away when slavery disappeared and didn't go away when segregation disappeared [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=3820.3s)]
*  But in many people's minds that has grown into a just a totalistic explanation for everything. So [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=3825.18s)]
*  It certainly impacts our immigration policy, but they have no other way of understanding anything else that could be [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=3833.34s)]
*  In impacting our immigration policy and so they're driven to this this totalistic frame and so you [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=3839.42s)]
*  You know you you're just left with with these kind of black. I mean black and white I suppose is the way [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=3846.14s)]
*  to use but you know just [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=3852.54s)]
*  Right. This is absolutely just analysis living in harmony together [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=3854.46s)]
*  Right. I mean, I think you need to you not only can but you you you have to recognize the [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=3858.46s)]
*  Impact of racism in american life while leaving yourself leaving yourself room to see [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=3864.7s)]
*  Other forces that are at play. Yeah [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=3869.2599999999998s)]
*  And to me this case in particular and what we're doing across the board that I just I like to keep bringing up because sometimes [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=3872.2999999999997s)]
*  Just people don't think about yeah, like they have a you know [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=3879.34s)]
*  Whatever their view is about immigration like liberal or conservative. It's not like well [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=3883.1s)]
*  He didn't follow the rules. You should leave or you know, well, we should be more generous, right? [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=3886.38s)]
*  Like there there are choices that are made by the government about how to handle situations such as this, you know [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=3889.9799999999996s)]
*  I mean, it's like [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=3895.5s)]
*  You know, we could change the law where if you run a red light [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=3896.8599999999997s)]
*  You know you get jailed for life like or you could get a ticket, right? [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=3900.22s)]
*  Like there's like there's a whole range of different punishments for things such as this and the notion and this is happening across the board [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=3903.58s)]
*  Uh to on these immigration detentions and every story I read about it [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=3910.3799999999997s)]
*  Is that this this administration? [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=3914.14s)]
*  probably because the private prison or uh, uh lobby is [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=3916.3799999999997s)]
*  Uh is is the one that's making the most bank during the trump years private prison folks are crushing right now [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=3919.74s)]
*  um [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=3925.66s)]
*  They've made a decision [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=3926.7s)]
*  That anybody who has an immigration violation you get shackled put on the bus and sent to to natchez, lusiana [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=3928.22s)]
*  Or the other places where there is are these private prisons and you sit there [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=3934.7s)]
*  And like that's where macroncalil is that's where this danish guy is [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=3939.1s)]
*  That's where the woman the woman from georgia that i've been talking about. Um the immigrant from mexico [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=3942.8599999999997s)]
*  She got sent to one of these uh in georgia [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=3947.18s)]
*  and it's like none of these people are [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=3949.5s)]
*  Are are a danger to their community like why are why why are they in cells like there's no reason for it, right? [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=3952.62s)]
*  like besides like intimidation cruelty and wanting to you know, uh give widgets to your private prison pals, right human widgets because like [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=3959.5s)]
*  the the none of these folks are [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=3969.4199999999996s)]
*  Have any past of any past crimes or any threats to their community and all of them [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=3973.02s)]
*  You're trying to get them to leave [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=3978.7s)]
*  There's no flight risk. It's not like oh, maybe the danish guy will leave to denmark [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=3981.1s)]
*  Like that's what you want like okay, so it's not like there's a flight risk situation [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=3986.3s)]
*  There's no reason this man should be away from his four children [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=3989.7400000000002s)]
*  Like even if in the end you do a stupid policy that I disagree with which is to deport him [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=3993.1s)]
*  Like in the meantime the idea that he should be in a prison in louisiana [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=3998.62s)]
*  It's fucking insane and inhumane and like that's the center of this and it's happening across the board [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=4002.7999999999997s)]
*  My suspicion is that they recognize that actually finding in deporting all the people that they want to find and deport [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=4009.3599999999997s)]
*  Is not going to be possible even after they get the money from this bill to to to [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=4017.2s)]
*  To staff up on the immigration enforcement. It's just too hard to find everyone. It's too resource intensive [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=4023.52s)]
*  You know just the I mean doing the math and the plane loads and the bus loads of people [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=4029.52s)]
*  It's just it's too forbidding. I think what they're trying to do instead [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=4033.6000000000004s)]
*  Is to scare people right you create enough high profile cases [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=4037.28s)]
*  That make it into the media than anyone who's here illegally will self deport [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=4042.0800000000004s)]
*  So you actually the cruelty is the point as my colleague adam sort of server server said right? [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=4047.6000000000004s)]
*  It's like the abuse is better [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=4053.36s)]
*  It's it's better to in in if you're getting an innocent person to mistreating them and it makes the [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=4055.76s)]
*  Media all the better because that's just going to be a better a better story for the media [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=4060.56s)]
*  It's going to travel farther and scare more people now [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=4064.96s)]
*  Maybe i'm wrong [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=4067.6800000000003s)]
*  Maybe it is purely incompetence and i'm sure incompetence is part of the play [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=4068.32s)]
*  But I do know there's malice and incompetence and cruelty and there is just straight grift [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=4071.92s)]
*  Yeah, I don't think they're concerned about abuse. I think abuse is really built into this point into the absolutely [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jj8iwJx9-AU&t=4077.28s)]
