Video Description: Everyone can agree: Chinese economic growth is slowing. After Chinese President Xi Jinping lifted the country’s strict COVID-19 restrictions in December 2022, many expected the Chinese economy to surge, but after a brief post-COVID bounce, it appears to be losing some of its vitality. What are the causes of this stagnation? That is a question of intense debate, and China’s ability to recover and the future of U.S. policy largely depend on how it is answered.  
 
Foreign Affairs Executive Editor Justin Vogt and the Peterson Institute’s Adam S. Posen, along with Zongyuan Zoe Liu and Michael Pettis, discuss the causes of China’s economic stagnation and what it may mean for American strategy.  
This joint event from Foreign Affairs and the Peterson Institute for International Economics originally aired on November 14, 2023.

# Who Killed the Chinese Economy? | A Discussion with Adam S. Posen, Zongyuan Zoe Liu, Michael Pettis
**Foreign Affairs:** [November 15, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI)
*  Thanks, Sam. And good morning to everybody. Thanks for joining us. This is a dual event. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=0.0s)]
*  It's a foreign affairs event launched for our November-December issue, but we're doing [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=7.0s)]
*  this in partnership with our friends at the Peterson Institute for International Economics [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=11.96s)]
*  as well. I'd like to think about what we're going to do this morning as sort of like a [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=15.88s)]
*  game of Clue, a foreign affairs edition of Clue, the board game Clue, with the mystery [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=23.919999999999998s)]
*  that we're trying to solve being who killed the Chinese economy? And we're going to get [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=32.16s)]
*  a couple of different guesses at that. Was it zero COVID in the 2020s with the excessive [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=38.480000000000004s)]
*  state interventions? Maybe it was Chinese leader Xi Jinping in the 2010s with the civil [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=46.0s)]
*  military fusion strategy, or maybe it was the CCP in the aughts with an outmoded growth model. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=55.519999999999996s)]
*  We're going to get variations on those guesses today from our terrific panel of guests, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=63.92s)]
*  Adam Pozen and Zoe Liu and Michael Pettis. You have their bios. I'm not going to bore you with [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=69.6s)]
*  those, but take my word for it when I tell you that these are three of the very best experts [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=75.28s)]
*  on China and on the Chinese economy. They're going to share their perspectives with us on [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=80.8s)]
*  this question. We're also going to talk a little bit about the current situation in China, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=87.44s)]
*  U.S.-Chinese relations, and what we can expect to come. We're not just going to focus on the [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=93.68s)]
*  past, but also the present and the future as well. I'm going to start with Adam because [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=98.48s)]
*  actually this entire question was brought to the fore by this tremendous piece that Adam wrote for [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=104.8s)]
*  the magazine a couple of months ago called The End of China's Economic Miracle. That's what started [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=111.52s)]
*  this debate. The piece that is in this issue of the magazine is what's called a response package [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=119.03999999999999s)]
*  where we asked some people to respond to Adam's argument and to critique it and then for Adam [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=126.16s)]
*  to respond to them. In some ways, this is like a live action version of that response package. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=133.04s)]
*  What I'm going to do is I'm going to start with Adam. We're going to hear from Zoe. We're going [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=139.04s)]
*  to hear from Michael. I'm going to ask them some questions. About half an hour in, I'm going to [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=143.92s)]
*  turn it over to our audience. We have a lot of people on the call today and I'm sure a lot of [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=148.39999999999998s)]
*  you will have questions for our guests. It should be a really good conversation. What I'm hoping we [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=152.56s)]
*  get out of this today is not just a sense of the history here, the economic and the political [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=157.92s)]
*  history that's relevant to the current moment, but a real understanding of how the way in which you [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=163.11999999999998s)]
*  interpret that history can shape the way you understand policy today and policy going forward. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=168.39999999999998s)]
*  That's really what matters and where the rubber hits the road. Adam and Zoe and Michael, thank you. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=175.11999999999998s)]
*  Welcome. Let's try this out. Let's see if we can solve this mystery. Adam, let me start with you. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=180.32s)]
*  Can you explain for me and for all of us what the idea that you put forward in your original [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=186.72s)]
*  article, which was that what China is struggling with is something that you refer to as economic [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=193.52s)]
*  long COVID. Can you explain what that is and the sources of it and the ramifications for the Chinese [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=199.92s)]
*  economy? Thank you, Justin. I'll try. Thanks to you for your editing and for Foreign Affairs for [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=205.2s)]
*  giving us the forum and bringing us all together. In my view, the stunning fact about China's [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=210.64s)]
*  economic slowdown is how little bounce China got after reopening in zero COVID. Most economies, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=217.35999999999999s)]
*  including Japan, including other neighbors in Asia, but all high income economies, saw some degree of [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=225.2s)]
*  big consumer rebound right after they reopened. In China, that rebound barely existed and then [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=230.64s)]
*  fizzled out. When I look at that, what I find more deeply is that you see a huge shift in Chinese [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=237.12s)]
*  household behavior. They stop buying durable goods, autos, expensive things. Small businesses, [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=243.92000000000002s)]
*  which are essentially owned by households, do the same thing. They start putting more and more money [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=249.68s)]
*  into bank accounts, into cash like liquid substances, foreign assets, and in general, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=254.64000000000001s)]
*  savings go up. Importantly, they're moving towards liquidity. I interpret this as a [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=261.28000000000003s)]
*  reaction to the zero COVID policy, which made China's Communist Party and Xi's more aggressive [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=266.96s)]
*  interventions in the face of the average Chinese person. For decades, there was what I called a no [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=274.0s)]
*  politics, no problem compact in China. This to me was a big part of the actual Chinese miracle. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=279.84s)]
*  From Deng until Xi takes power in 2013, if you weren't a democracy protester, if you weren't an [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=285.68s)]
*  oppressed Muslim minority or some other ethnic minority, basically you could go about your [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=292.32s)]
*  commercial life. You might have to pay a bribe. You might not always get the contract you wanted, [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=296.56s)]
*  but basically you were left alone as long as you did no politics. Starting with Xi's [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=300.56s)]
*  consolidating power in 2015, but especially with their zero COVID crackdown, average Chinese [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=306.0s)]
*  suddenly were subjected to your company is closed. You can't go to your job. You've lost your business [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=311.6s)]
*  and it's arbitrary by a given party member in a given city making up their mind. This resonates [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=317.36s)]
*  in a way with the people that putting an Alibaba executive in jail or putting an anti-corruption [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=323.36s)]
*  campaign does not, because that's just abstract leaders. When we have this, this breaks the compact [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=329.84000000000003s)]
*  and it's very hard for an autocrat, which is what Xi and the Communist Party are, to reestablish [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=336.0s)]
*  credibility. They can say, oh, gee, we did it just because of COVID and look at all the millions of [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=340.8s)]
*  lives we saved. It's still not credible that they're going to go back, especially since there's a [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=346.72s)]
*  laundry list of ways in which Xi and the party have been more and more intrusive in recent years. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=351.76s)]
*  Two key points to go with that. This behavior, this long COVID, economic long COVID, [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=357.52s)]
*  meaning the non-responsive consumers to incentives, because they're hoarding liquidity, [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=364.8s)]
*  they're trying not to get expropriated, they're basically scared. This occurred well before the [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=369.03999999999996s)]
*  breakdown of the real estate market. The real estate market is on top of that, doesn't help, [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=375.68s)]
*  but it occurred and is independent of that. In fact, the behavior of moving into savings [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=380.4s)]
*  and out of durable goods is not necessarily what the real estate market crash would do. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=385.12s)]
*  The other point is this goes with a turn against the private sector, not just the big fancy [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=390.08s)]
*  platform companies, but against the private sector more generally in China, which is marked and is [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=397.03999999999996s)]
*  different than the previous 30 years in China. To me, we have economic long COVID in China, [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=402.88s)]
*  the ability to stimulate the economy is very limited, even though they keep trying. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=408.48s)]
*  Therefore, there's pressure for capital, people, talent, and money to exit. That's the direction [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=414.24s)]
*  I think policy needs to think about. Thank you. The metaphor here that you're making with economic [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=420.8s)]
*  long COVID is that it's not the virus itself that has caused these lingering symptoms, but the [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=426.64000000000004s)]
*  overactive immune response on the part of the state that has stuck with us. That's [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=432.08000000000004s)]
*  sort of the answer. Thank you for bringing it out. Yes, that is what I wanted to convey. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=437.35999999999996s)]
*  Sure. Good. Zoe, you wrote about this. Obviously, you took up Adam's [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=440.96s)]
*  article and you wrote a really interesting critique of it. I wanted to ask you, [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=447.59999999999997s)]
*  if I understand your critique correctly, some of what Adam has written you sort of agree with, [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=453.44s)]
*  but the emphasis is slightly different. Can you explain, I'd love to hear your basic [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=458.15999999999997s)]
*  take on the story that Adam tells about this and where your view of it differs? [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=463.28s)]
*  Thank you very much, Justin, for the opportunity to write this response. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=469.52s)]
*  I do think Dr. Posen's metaphor of long economic COVID is very creative. I do share with him in [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=474.08s)]
*  the sense that in terms of how COVID has shifted or put in front of the normal Chinese people's [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=482.79999999999995s)]
*  face in terms of the intrusiveness of the party as well as President Xi Jinping. However, I would [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=490.32s)]
*  like to consider myself as the student of a lot of these great economists, including Adam Posen, [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=496.56s)]
*  including Professor Michael Pettis, as well as Nicolas Lardi and all that. Therefore, where I [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=502.96s)]
*  come from, really, I understand this situation as President Xi Jinping, he did not assemble [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=508.56s)]
*  China's economic time bomb, but I do think he should be blamed for having shortened the fuse. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=514.96s)]
*  If I can explain this a little bit more, this is how I view the Chinese economic problems. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=522.8000000000001s)]
*  I view it as having the problem of four Bs, including debt, demographics, demand, [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=527.12s)]
*  and decoupling. I think Professor Pettis can explain this in terms of the structural problems [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=534.4000000000001s)]
*  way much better than I do, especially in terms of debt, demand, demographics, and all that. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=540.64s)]
*  I think President Xi Jinping's share of the responsibility here is really with regard to how [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=545.68s)]
*  his policies have accelerated the trajectory of decoupling. A lot of these four Bs that I talk [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=555.5999999999999s)]
*  about, debt, demand, demographics, and decoupling, a lot of these problems have long been evident, [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=565.28s)]
*  as Professor Pettis noticed, and he's written widely about this. President Xi Jinping and his [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=570.88s)]
*  predecessor, they were aware of these problems, but they really didn't do enough to mitigate these [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=576.8s)]
*  longstanding issues. Therefore, I think it's unfair to blame Xi Jinping entirely for creating all [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=582.72s)]
*  these problems or for the lack of economic recovery post-COVID. That's why I think he [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=589.92s)]
*  didn't assemble the time bomb. However, really his responsibility is in terms of the last D, [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=595.04s)]
*  the decoupling. This is where I think I agree with Dr. Poston in terms of the policy missteps [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=602.4799999999999s)]
*  that he did have been highly consequential. I would differ with Dr. Poston in terms of the role [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=610.0s)]
*  of the decoupling or for that matter, identifying COVID-19 as a critical juncture. I would argue [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=618.64s)]
*  that actually the critical juncture happened several years before COVID-19 as well as zero [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=625.28s)]
*  COVID. Because if you remember back in 2013, President Xi Jinping already put out his own [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=633.28s)]
*  personal explanation, his own explanation to what does he mean by, what he thinks, [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=640.3199999999999s)]
*  reform and deepening reform and opening up means. In writing and in his speech, he's specifically [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=646.16s)]
*  talking about, for him, reform and open up really is about the emphasis of the state sector, the [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=653.9200000000001s)]
*  leadership of the party in economics and finance. In a way, he has been quite honest. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=660.72s)]
*  Why this matters for decoupling and why this relates to COVID, I would say that the net effect [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=669.84s)]
*  of zero COVID was actually to make President Xi Jinping overconfident that his assertive foreign [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=675.36s)]
*  policy could be persuasive. Many of us probably still remember the initial shock of COVID, [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=681.84s)]
*  the Chinese government response was relatively susceptible in terms of control, the virus, [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=689.6s)]
*  the spread of the virus compared with the rest of the world. In a way, the Chinese government response [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=697.04s)]
*  actually is very much reflective of the governance philosophy. In Chinese, crisis is the same term, [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=702.4s)]
*  crisis and opportunity is way and way is very much like so-and-so kind of thinking. In chaos, [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=711.68s)]
*  there is great opportunity. This is also where I think President Xi Jinping's draconian zero [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=718.8s)]
*  policies actually created a dent, not just for himself, but exacerbated, [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=724.72s)]
*  exacerbated, not created, the previous demographic debt and demand problem. Therefore, [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=731.68s)]
*  in our term member meeting earlier this year, I described this whole situation as before COVID [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=739.84s)]
*  or before 2019, when we think about the Chinese economy, it looks like a Monet, it's like an [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=748.88s)]
*  impressionist painting. It looks beautiful from afar, but it looks like a jumbled mess up close. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=753.44s)]
*  But after COVID, the problem still exists, but it's now like a Jackson Pollock in a sense that [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=759.36s)]
*  it looks like a jumbled mess from afar and a jumbled mess up close. So from that perspective, [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=764.8800000000001s)]
*  I really don't think President Xi Jinping should be blamed for the lack of recovery or for [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=769.7600000000001s)]
*  assemble the time bomb, but he actually did shorten the fuse. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=774.24s)]
*  I like this. We've moved from a medical metaphor to an artistic one, just in defense of Jackson [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=778.72s)]
*  Pollock. Chase May Dipper, some people like those jumbled messes. That's interesting though, because [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=783.6s)]
*  I'm thinking about what you said about the overconfidence that it's good to remind [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=791.44s)]
*  ourselves that in the early phases of the pandemic, there was reason for the Chinese [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=795.2s)]
*  government and for the CCP to believe that what they had done was correct and they were doing so [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=801.28s)]
*  much better. That's an interesting thing that I think we tend to forget in our presentism. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=806.64s)]
*  Speaking of presentism, I think, Michael, your contribution here and your critique, [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=814.96s)]
*  if I understand it again correctly, and you can explain this more thoroughly, [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=824.16s)]
*  is that you see the roots of some of the problems that China is now facing far earlier than both [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=828.8s)]
*  Adam and Zoe, and not only see them there, but believe that they were foreseeable and even [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=834.8s)]
*  foreseen. Can you explain exactly what you mean by that? Whereas Adam has talked about the turning [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=842.3199999999999s)]
*  point being, or maybe not the turning point, but the point of no return being 2020, Zoe has talked [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=850.3199999999999s)]
*  a little bit about 2015 and 2013 with Xi's arrival on the scene. I think you seem to put [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=855.68s)]
*  this turning point closer to around 2006. I'm curious about what are the factors, what was [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=864.0s)]
*  happening then that cast the dye in your point of view? Thanks very much, Justin, and thanks, [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=869.52s)]
*  Adam and Zoe. The other famous Adam, Adam Toogs, refers to me as the structuralist. I think that's [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=877.6s)]
*  accurate. I think it's a much more structural argument as to what happened with China. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=887.44s)]
*  Basically, the Chinese growth model, the high savings, high investment model, is not particularly [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=892.64s)]
*  Chinese. Many countries have followed it. It always seems to follow a pretty similar path. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=898.3199999999999s)]
*  You have a period of very rapid healthy growth, followed by a period of very rapid unhealthy [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=904.64s)]
*  growth driven by a surge in debt, and then a difficult adjustment. One of my favorite economists, [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=910.88s)]
*  Albert Hirschman, talked about this way, way back in the 1970s. What he argued is that this is what [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=916.8s)]
*  happens to a successful development model. A successful development model by definition makes [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=923.4399999999999s)]
*  itself obsolete because it resolves the problems it was designed to address. Then you need to shift [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=928.56s)]
*  the model. If you don't shift the model, you end up developing a different set of imbalances. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=934.4799999999999s)]
*  He also noted that almost no one shifts the model. The reason he argued is because a successful [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=941.0400000000001s)]
*  development model creates a series of institutions that disproportionately benefit certain constituencies [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=948.0s)]
*  that become very powerful. It's very hard to shift the model because of the blocking efforts [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=955.0400000000001s)]
*  by those constituencies. Well, he died before the whole China story, but he could have been [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=961.0400000000001s)]
*  talking about China. What I would argue is that this high investment model made a lot of sense in [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=966.0s)]
*  the 1980s and 1990s when China was possibly the most under-invested economy in the world. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=972.56s)]
*  With the fastest growth rate of investment, they closed the gap pretty quickly between what they [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=980.48s)]
*  had and what they could productively absorb. Now, at that point, you're supposed to shift to a [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=986.24s)]
*  different model, but no one ever does. Not Brazil in the 1970s, not Japan in the 1980s, [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=990.72s)]
*  not the Soviet Union in the 1960s. That's when you end up with very high investment rates [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=996.32s)]
*  that are no longer productive. When that happens, you start to see debt grow faster than GDP. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=1003.6s)]
*  This is a pretty old story. I would argue that most people would say the problem began in 2009, [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=1011.36s)]
*  2010. I think it started earlier than that, but it doesn't matter. At some point, we started to [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=1017.12s)]
*  see this unsustainable acceleration of debt in order to maintain high growth rates. Here's where [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=1023.12s)]
*  another economist that I cite a lot, Janis Cornyn, is very important. Cornyn argued that in these [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=1029.52s)]
*  types of economies, you have a shift from the hard budget constrained part of the economy to the soft [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=1035.76s)]
*  budget, as long as you want high growth rates. Because the hard budget constrained part of the [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=1043.28s)]
*  economy, for example, the private sector, won't systematically engage in non-productive behavior. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=1048.3999999999999s)]
*  If they do, they go bankrupt. If you want to maintain higher growth rates than the real [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=1054.32s)]
*  economy can deliver, then you have to increasingly shift activity to the soft budget constraint, [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=1059.52s)]
*  which in China was largely local governments and the property sector. As a result, the problem [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=1066.72s)]
*  in China predate Xi Jinping. In fact, back in 2012, remember when Xi Jinping became a party [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=1073.44s)]
*  secretary, we all agreed this was a good thing because he was a pragmatist and a market guy. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=1082.24s)]
*  Back then, I argued that if you look at the historical precedents, what was very likely [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=1087.52s)]
*  to happen was a recentralization of economic decision making because the conflict over [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=1092.24s)]
*  adjustment would be so difficult that without a recentralization of power, they would probably [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=1098.24s)]
*  fail to do it. I would argue that all of this was already baked into the pie before COVID. Now, [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=1103.52s)]
*  I agree with Adam and Zoe that COVID mattered. I think it mattered because it accelerated what [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=1109.6s)]
*  was already a pretty bad process, not just in China, but in the US, Europe, and the rest of the [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=1115.76s)]
*  world. We saw the debt pick up even more rapidly and more importantly, during that period, we saw [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=1122.08s)]
*  the household share of GDP drop. What was particularly bad, we saw income inequality [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=1129.28s)]
*  increase, which put even more downward pressure on consumption. I would argue that that's the [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=1136.08s)]
*  basic problem. If I could summarize it in a snappy phrase, I would say it's not that the [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=1141.04s)]
*  recentralization of the economy caused the slowdown. I would say it was the slowdown that [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=1149.9199999999998s)]
*  caused the recentralization of the economy. That's interesting. You have the causal arrows [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=1155.9199999999998s)]
*  reversed in a sense from where Adam does. The two of you see the same factors, but you see them [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=1162.0s)]
*  affecting each other in a different sequence almost. Can I add? Yeah, please, please jump in. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=1168.8s)]
*  Yeah. I just want to affirm Dr. Liu and Professor Pettis' characterizations. These are very [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=1174.96s)]
*  different points of view. As you just said, Justin, causality runs the other way. I would make two [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=1180.64s)]
*  points. I think first, the heavy duty structuralist version, which Michael argues for, is too [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=1186.64s)]
*  dismissive of the agency of both the party and the average Chinese household. If you look at the [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=1194.56s)]
*  period, even including the period Michael talks about, there's an enormous growth in private sector [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=1200.4s)]
*  employment, in returns on private sector assets, and in private sector investment, as my colleague [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=1206.0s)]
*  Nick Lardy had documented in Market So for Mal. Then starting in 2015 and accelerating, [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=1212.24s)]
*  she turns it around. Then again, the households don't react until we have the zero COVID in the [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=1219.92s)]
*  way that I identified. To me, while the structuralist problems are there, it both exaggerates [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=1228.4s)]
*  the determinism coming out of the structural problems and also, frankly, their magnitude. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=1234.88s)]
*  All economies slow down. All economies accumulate over time. There was nothing inevitable that you [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=1240.48s)]
*  couldn't have put more money in the private sector and gotten higher returns than you did the last [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=1245.2800000000002s)]
*  several years. Anyway, just to say, I think Michael and Zoya are being perfectly fair, [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=1249.52s)]
*  contrasting views, but just that would be my point of difference. I don't think their model fits [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=1254.6399999999999s)]
*  the developments that I saw. Let me ask you to clarify one thing, though, and that will [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=1260.3999999999999s)]
*  probably generate a response either from Zoya or Michael. You say this wasn't inevitable. I guess [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=1266.72s)]
*  what I'm curious then is that it's really a political question. I'm wondering, if it wasn't [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=1271.76s)]
*  inevitable, why were the choices made that you see as having led to this point where there was [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=1278.4s)]
*  agency? You talked about the household spending patterns. What about on the policy question? [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=1285.2s)]
*  What was the particular policy choice and why do you think that was the choice that the CCP [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=1291.92s)]
*  opted for instead of the other choices that presumably you think might have, if not averted, [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=1297.6000000000001s)]
*  the current situation, at least pushed it further off into the future? [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=1303.0400000000002s)]
*  Michael S. I'm not a good enough Chinese expert. I'm a macroeconomist to do that, [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=1306.64s)]
*  but I think there are two clear contributing factors. One is that, not to personalize this, [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=1312.16s)]
*  but in an autocratic system, the views of the leader do matter. And Xi's views clearly from [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=1320.8000000000002s)]
*  the time he took office, but particularly from 2015 forward, were that the market had gone too far, [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=1327.0400000000002s)]
*  the party had gotten soft, the people had gotten soft, and you had to deal with it. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=1333.04s)]
*  A second factor is, you can argue how much instead of what none of the three of us have mentioned, [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=1337.76s)]
*  you have the external environment. How much, although Zoe makes reference to the remilitarization [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=1344.1599999999999s)]
*  needs, to be fair. So how much this is a reaction to perceived threats or external ambitions, [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=1350.3999999999999s)]
*  and that pushes you in this direction. But I think it's ultimately mostly about control. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=1357.12s)]
*  And that's why, again, I tried to speak of the long COVID. It's the immune system or responses [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=1363.6s)]
*  you kindly invoked. It's not because the Communist Party ever was not in control. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=1369.68s)]
*  It was that the Communist Party's self-control broke down. That unlike Deng and his successors, [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=1376.8799999999999s)]
*  Xi broke this no politics, no problem compact. And I don't know if it's inevitable, but it's very [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=1383.68s)]
*  hard for an autocratic system, a party, to resist that temptation for decades. It's amazing to me [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=1390.8s)]
*  how long China did. Right. Yeah. That's one of the things that comes through in your piece originally [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=1397.28s)]
*  is that it's sort of like they were, the image that I had in my mind, and I almost put this in [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=1402.56s)]
*  in the edit and I decided it was not, it wasn't okay for foreign affairs. Well, I'll do it now, [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=1407.28s)]
*  though, is it was that image of the old Roadrunner cartoons, where Wiley Coyote kind of goes out [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=1411.12s)]
*  over the edge of the road and is sort of running on air until suddenly he realizes and drops. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=1420.0800000000002s)]
*  That's kind of the image that I got from your analysis of recent Chinese economic history. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=1424.48s)]
*  So actually, I want to go back to Michael in a second, but Adam mentioned something that I [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=1429.76s)]
*  did want to bring in because one thing that your essay talks about is this question of, [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=1434.3200000000002s)]
*  Xi's kind of a broader foreign policy and its effect on some of this, the sort of the [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=1439.68s)]
*  re-embrace of nationalism, what you describe as this civil military fusion and its effect on the [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=1446.64s)]
*  Chinese economy. Can you pick up where Adam left off there and kind of talk a little bit about [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=1451.68s)]
*  that context in which this happened? Because that's also on our minds now, I think, with the APEC [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=1456.5600000000002s)]
*  summit happening this week and with the meeting between Biden and Xi. And I'm sure that some of [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=1463.3600000000001s)]
*  our attendees are going to want to hear a little bit about that. So it'd be interesting to hear [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=1467.2s)]
*  your take on that. Sure, Justin. I do think President Xi Jinping's elevation of the civil [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=1470.88s)]
*  military fusion strategy to the level of national strategy. Can you just explain what that is quickly? [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=1477.1200000000001s)]
*  What you mean by that? So this is so-called strategy did not start from Xi Jinping. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=1483.1200000000001s)]
*  It's the whole civil military fusion started during Hu Jintao's era. The idea is to empower [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=1489.3600000000001s)]
*  or basically mobilize the whole of the society, whole of a nation element blurring the nature of [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=1497.44s)]
*  military as well as the private sector and the civilian sector in terms of technological [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=1507.3600000000001s)]
*  advancement and technological self-sufficiency. So President Xi Jinping really elevated that [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=1514.0s)]
*  to the level of national strategy and combining that with the meeting in China [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=1520.72s)]
*  2050. So a lot of these really triggered, alerted Western politicians and in particular here, [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=1528.8799999999999s)]
*  U.S. policymakers in Washington, D.C. And in response, the United States policymakers [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=1536.72s)]
*  accelerated a lot of the pre-existing mechanisms such as export control, such as investment [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=1542.56s)]
*  screening. And now we are in an era of outbound investment screening. So if Xi Jinping or if [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=1548.72s)]
*  President Xi Jinping did not put this or accelerate a lot of these policies to such a higher level, [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=1555.76s)]
*  I do not think it would trigger such a response from the United States. And as a consequence, [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=1563.1200000000001s)]
*  what used to benefit China's economic rise on the one hand, international confidence in the [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=1570.88s)]
*  Chinese economy as well as policy predictability. And then on the other hand, China's easy access [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=1577.6s)]
*  and achieve at a lower cost to advanced technologies, investor market. Those things [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=1583.4399999999998s)]
*  are no longer there. And I would agree with Dr. Poston in that, you know, President Xi Jinping, [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=1589.12s)]
*  a lot of his policy misstep did matter, but I would say that it matters before COVID. And more [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=1595.9199999999998s)]
*  specifically, he removed the predictability and the lack of political drama that used to [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=1602.16s)]
*  benefit the Chinese economy. Great. Thank you. Michael, I'm going to turn to you and I have a [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=1610.88s)]
*  sort of clarification question for you that I hope will be fruitful. In the meantime, folks who are [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=1617.28s)]
*  joining us, if you want to start thinking about the questions you want to ask, I'm going to go [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=1624.5600000000002s)]
*  to that next. Michael, when both you and Adam sort of tell this story that to my kind of layperson's [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=1628.8s)]
*  mind, it brings to mind this expression that at least when I was a college student, I learned, [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=1636.8799999999999s)]
*  which was the middle income trap, right? That there was this kind of problem where, as you put it, [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=1645.28s)]
*  you know, a system was developed to solve a certain set of problems. And then once it solved those [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=1652.6399999999999s)]
*  problems that became obsolete, you had to switch. Is that essentially what you're describing? Is [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=1658.48s)]
*  that another name for what you're describing? Or is that different from what you're talking about? [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=1663.84s)]
*  And regardless of whether what the answer is there, I guess my question for you is if China [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=1668.64s)]
*  missed its opportunity or the opportunity it had some time in the aughts to shift growth models, [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=1675.3600000000001s)]
*  do you only get one chance as a regime type? Or is this a kind of thing that you can kind of [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=1682.8s)]
*  try again? You can keep adapting? What's your view of that? [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=1690.24s)]
*  Well, to address the middle income trap, it's not a phrase that I really like because it seems to me [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=1695.6799999999998s)]
*  that we often trot it out to mean we don't know, so it must be the middle income trap. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=1700.3999999999999s)]
*  But in terms of the, you know, I would call it an investment trap because it affected all countries [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=1706.32s)]
*  that had very, very high investment growth models. Japan, which is certainly not a middle income [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=1715.4399999999998s)]
*  country, it's quite a rich country, also went through this trap. Poorer countries like Brazil [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=1723.12s)]
*  in the 1960s and 70s and so on. There was about a dozen, two dozen countries that went through this [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=1727.52s)]
*  growth model. And what's really striking is how they all follow the same pattern. You have [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=1733.04s)]
*  very rapid healthy growth followed by very rapid unhealthy growth, followed by a very difficult [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=1738.88s)]
*  adjustment. And the adjustment can range. You know, I talk about the American style adjustment, [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=1744.32s)]
*  which Brazil followed too, which is a rebalancing in the form of a crisis. So the United States in [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=1749.3600000000001s)]
*  the 1930s, you'll remember GDP contracted by 35%, household income contracted by half of that, [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=1755.44s)]
*  brutally painful, but it rebalanced. And it was quite quick. In Japan, what we saw is that GDP [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=1762.96s)]
*  growth went from roughly four or 5% to around half a percent. Consumption growth dropped by a [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=1769.3600000000001s)]
*  lot less. I don't have the per capita numbers, but the per capita numbers look like they drop [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=1776.08s)]
*  from around 3% to 2%. So it wasn't as brutal an adjustment, but it took a very long period of time. [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=1781.2s)]
*  And what's really striking about this, and Darren Asimoglu and James Robinson do a series of very [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=1788.3999999999999s)]
*  interesting papers on this, what's really striking is how politically disruptive it's always been, [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=1793.28s)]
*  except for two types of political systems. They argue highly competitive political systems, [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=1799.36s)]
*  which seems to mean robust democracies, and then highly non-competitive, which basically seems to [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=1806.3999999999999s)]
*  mean a highly centralized autocracy. By the way, an example of the latter was China in the 1980s. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=1812.48s)]
*  A series of reforms ferociously opposed by the party, but with a highly centralized leadership, [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=1818.8s)]
*  they were able to implement the reforms anyway. So I think that's a really important part of it. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=1824.3999999999999s)]
*  We always see that. And that's why I argued that if you were going to advise Xi back in 2012, [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=1830.3999999999999s)]
*  you would have said either become a democracy or recentralize power. That's part of the process. [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=1836.72s)]
*  Now, I realize my answer is getting a little bit long, but I wanted to talk a little bit about the [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=1842.72s)]
*  rise and fall of the private sector. What really seems to drive the private sector in China has [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=1849.0400000000002s)]
*  been a combination of domestic consumption and exports. And so domestic consumption bottomed [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=1854.4s)]
*  out around 2010, 2011 with household consumption at a truly surreal 34% of GDP. And after that, [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=1862.16s)]
*  we started to see a partial recovery of consumption and the private sector benefited from that. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=1871.28s)]
*  But that more or less stopped a couple of years before COVID. And during COVID, we saw, again, [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=1876.96s)]
*  the consumption share of GDP go down. And that's much more important than exports. And so I would [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=1882.32s)]
*  argue that what's really driving the expansion and contraction of the private sector has really [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=1888.16s)]
*  been the distribution of income to the household sector. I think that's what's really been key. [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=1894.0s)]
*  I'm aware that this is already a long answer, so let me stop there. [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=1899.2s)]
*  Okay. I'm going to open it up now. And I'm hoping that some of our questions might get at the point [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=1902.24s)]
*  I was making earlier about how our interpretation of this matters going forward. If not, I'll jump [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=1911.6000000000001s)]
*  in and kind of ask you all to weigh in on that. But I'd like to give our many guests a shot here. [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=1917.2s)]
*  So Sam, I'm going to turn it over to you for our questions. [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=1921.76s)]
*  Thank you so much. Ladies and gentlemen, as a reminder to ask a question, please click on [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=1924.56s)]
*  the raise hand icon on your Zoom window. When you are called on, please accept the unmute now button [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=1929.12s)]
*  and proceed with your name, affiliation, and question. You may also type in your question [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=1934.6399999999999s)]
*  using the Q&A box on your Zoom window at any time. And as a reminder, this meeting is on the record. [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=1939.1999999999998s)]
*  Our first question is a written submission from Bert Eli, who asks, to what extent are China's [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=1945.6s)]
*  economic issues an inevitable consequence of its authoritarian governance? Viewed more broadly, [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=1951.44s)]
*  is authoritarianism over the long-term an economically unsustainable form of government? [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=1956.88s)]
*  Okay. I think Michael was sort of gesturing at some of that in his last answer. Maybe, [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=1963.68s)]
*  Adam, do you have a kind of very short answer to that one? Yeah. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=1970.8s)]
*  So as I tried to say a minute ago, I think that there is an autocratic temptation [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=1974.8s)]
*  by the individual or by the party, look at Orban, look at Putin, look at Duarte, look at Chavez, [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=1980.64s)]
*  and Maduro, and Venezuela, look at Erdogan, then at a certain point, you want control. And so it's [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=1986.5600000000002s)]
*  very hard to resist the urge to exert that control. And so it's not inevitable, but I would say it's [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=1993.1200000000001s)]
*  very unlikely that you can sustain having authoritarianism and not having excessive [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=2001.6000000000001s)]
*  intrusions and importantly, arbitrary intrusions. I mean, that's the key thing that I would emphasize [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=2008.08s)]
*  about the household sector reaction, the long COVID in China, is that it's about the arbitrary [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=2014.6399999999999s)]
*  nature, the capriciousness of authoritarian policies. And that's what causes the immune [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=2022.1599999999999s)]
*  reaction of people trying to self-insure. So authoritarianism can work for long periods. [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=2027.28s)]
*  There was the old Sam Huntington argument about political order and changing societies [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=2032.72s)]
*  with the example of Korea in the 50s and 60s. But Korea has done even better as a democracy. [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=2037.68s)]
*  It's hard to be a despot. And it's even harder to be an enlightened despot, is what you're saying, [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=2043.6000000000001s)]
*  is that you can't keep it up for that long. Let's go to the next question, Sam. [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=2048.4s)]
*  Thank you so much. Our next question is a live question from Tara Hariharan. [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=2053.12s)]
*  Thank you so much. My name is Tara Hariharan. I work at NWIA Hedge Fund in New York. [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=2058.56s)]
*  We've heard some very incisive diagnoses of the problems with the Chinese economy. I'd now invite [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=2063.6s)]
*  the panelists to talk a little bit about viable policy prescriptions. We've already seen some [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=2070.08s)]
*  easing in monetary policy, but it hasn't really resulted in a pickup in consumer demand or in [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=2075.04s)]
*  housing demand. Similarly, on the fiscal side, fiscal easing has not yet shown growth multipliers. [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=2080.08s)]
*  And separately, again, based on the structure of the economy and the government, it seems like for [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=2087.04s)]
*  model hazard reasons, China will not be ready to bail out the developers or the local governments [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=2092.8s)]
*  or for that matter, even do some kind of consumer handouts. So what do the panelists see in terms [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=2099.6800000000003s)]
*  of actual viable policies that China can take at this point? Thank you so much. [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=2105.28s)]
*  That's a great question. Thank you, Tara. I'd love actually all three of you to take a crack [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=2110.48s)]
*  at that because that... And if you can, if you can connect it to your, as Tara put it, [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=2113.44s)]
*  your... If you can connect your prescription to your diagnosis to the extent that you're willing [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=2119.36s)]
*  to, I'd love to hear what you think is the answer to that question. Why don't we start with Zoe and [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=2124.7200000000003s)]
*  then we'll go to Michael and then Adam. Yeah, sure. Tara, thank you very much for your question. [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=2129.44s)]
*  I think there are two pieces. One is domestic, one is international because I do think the Chinese [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=2134.96s)]
*  economy right now is at a stage where reform and opening up reform, deepening reform domestically [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=2142.32s)]
*  is not necessarily going to be about the pure distribution of benefit, but it also involves [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=2148.96s)]
*  the allocation of the pan because systematic financial repression already built around it [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=2155.2000000000003s)]
*  itself, institutions as well as the incentives that people just resist additional reform. [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=2160.96s)]
*  And I think Professor Pettus also made a similar argument as well. And so in terms of domestic, [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=2167.44s)]
*  I think perhaps in the immediate term, the government really need to figure out how to [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=2174.4s)]
*  stimulate household consumption. I'm not exactly sure whether this is going to be in the format of [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=2180.56s)]
*  direct stimulus check or household debt ease or things like that, but direct household [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=2185.76s)]
*  support is necessary both to solve, on the one hand, to address the lack of household confidence [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=2195.2s)]
*  issue than on the other hand, at least to give people some sense of short term relief. [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=2202.48s)]
*  And internationally, I do think this is tremendously important for President Xi Jinping to show that he [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=2208.56s)]
*  can, he cares about stabilizing US-China relations. And because this is the moment I always remember [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=2215.7599999999998s)]
*  what Deng Xiaoping said after he visited the United States and on his plan back to China, [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=2223.76s)]
*  he told everybody on the plan saying that, you know what, if you look around the world, [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=2229.92s)]
*  for those who are friends of the United States, they all become rich. And I think I'm not exactly [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=2235.36s)]
*  sure to what extent this kind of political willingness is still there, but at least I think [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=2241.6000000000004s)]
*  APEC moment, APEC is an opportunity for President Xi Jinping to restore the relationship and in [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=2246.0s)]
*  particular to try to stabilize the relationship. That's interesting. I wonder whether that [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=2252.48s)]
*  perception holds about the value of friendship with the United States these days. Michael, [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=2256.88s)]
*  what's your basic sort of prescription or policy advice for how to deal with this slowdown? [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=2262.8s)]
*  You know, I think it's not very surprising that there is a consensus. It's not universal, [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=2270.32s)]
*  but there is a consensus among economic policy advisors and economic policymakers about what [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=2277.28s)]
*  China needs to do. And very specifically, they need to boost domestic demand, domestic consumption, [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=2283.52s)]
*  because if you bring investment down, and everyone agrees that China has an over investment problem, [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=2290.4s)]
*  but if you bring it down, the economy slows, workers lose their jobs, consumption drops, [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=2296.08s)]
*  and you get all these terrible things. So what you really need to do is as you bring investment [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=2303.04s)]
*  down, you've got to bring consumption up. So everyone agrees on that. So how do you bring [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=2307.7599999999998s)]
*  consumption up? Well, there's basically two ways. One way is you encourage somehow households to [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=2312.3199999999997s)]
*  save less, quite hard to do, because the weak economy is probably what's encouraging them to [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=2319.36s)]
*  save more, or you encourage household debt. And in fact, banks have been told to expand their [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=2324.96s)]
*  consumer loans. Of course, banks only want to lend to professionals who own their own homes, [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=2331.44s)]
*  and it's become sort of a joke here. If you're part of that favorite group, banks are desperately [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=2337.44s)]
*  trying to get you to borrow at incredibly low rates. But that's not sustainable. China already [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=2342.64s)]
*  has the highest household debt as a share of GDP, among the highest in the world, higher than in the [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=2348.32s)]
*  US. So the problem with monetary stimulus in China doesn't work like in the US. Monetary stimulus [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=2353.92s)]
*  tends to stimulate the supply side of the economy. So every time we've seen fiscal expansion or [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=2362.32s)]
*  monetary expansion in China, rather than rebalance, the imbalances have gotten worse. [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=2367.84s)]
*  So what do we do? Well, again, everyone agrees we have to increase the household share of GDP. [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=2372.96s)]
*  We have to increase their wages, transfers, the social safety net, etc., etc. What hasn't really [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=2379.36s)]
*  been discussed yet is the hard part. If I increase my share, then by definition, I have to reduce [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=2386.0s)]
*  your share. And we haven't really discussed who you are in this case. That's not totally true. [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=2392.56s)]
*  There is a growing recognition that it's going to be the government, not the business sector. [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=2399.6800000000003s)]
*  But which government? Beijing or the local governments? And what we're seeing in China, [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=2404.96s)]
*  it's been developing over the past year, and I suspect it's going to be the big story of the [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=2409.84s)]
*  next year or two, an increasingly contentious dispute between Beijing and the local governments [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=2414.0s)]
*  as to who's going to pay for the adjustment costs, who is going to liquidate assets in order to [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=2422.0s)]
*  increase the household share of GDP. I could go on on that for an hour. It's a very complicated issue. [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=2427.92s)]
*  Ultimately, I think Beijing knows what they have to do. They just don't know how to do it. [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=2434.0800000000004s)]
*  That's fascinating. There's a bit of a zero-sum quality to what you're describing, [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=2438.88s)]
*  and the question is who's going to wind up with the short end of the stick. Michael said that [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=2442.1600000000003s)]
*  basically everybody agrees about what has to happen, that the disagreements are about how to [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=2446.2400000000002s)]
*  get there. Do you share that view? And do you have thoughts about—I know you do from your piece, [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=2450.0s)]
*  but can you tell us what your prescription is in terms of how to get there? [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=2454.8s)]
*  I think there's disagreements on how much those solutions would help, I think. Let me go directly [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=2458.8s)]
*  to Tara's question, which was excellent. First off on stimulus, one of the key differences [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=2465.76s)]
*  between the structuralist view and my view is that in the stimulus, the issue is for structuralists, [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=2471.1200000000003s)]
*  you restructure the debt and stimulus will work, and that fiscal stimulus is just as it should be [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=2479.92s)]
*  effective even if monetary stimulus is not. Whereas in my point of view, because the households [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=2488.8s)]
*  are beaten down, it's not going to work that way. And so the Chinese officials, despite the moral [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=2495.6000000000004s)]
*  hazard, have been doing stimulus, and in fact, they've just announced a one trillion yuan bond [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=2500.96s)]
*  issue, which is going to be directed to plugging the holes in local and state—not state, but anyway— [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=2506.96s)]
*  local and regional government balance sheets. And I'm expecting that to not have very much [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=2512.32s)]
*  effect, whereas in the structuralist model, that should have a decent effect. And that's the opposite [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=2518.08s)]
*  of Japan, by the way, which my work and others sexually confirmed, that in Japan they didn't do [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=2523.2s)]
*  any of that public investment. This is one of the big differences that gets alighted over in the [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=2529.12s)]
*  structuralist view, is that in Japan the debt was in the corporate sector, not the household sector, [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=2534.56s)]
*  and in Japan the public investment was not there, whereas the private investment was and was when [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=2539.2799999999997s)]
*  bust. So anyway, the upshot of all this is that it's not enough, whereas in Japan it was enough [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=2545.2s)]
*  to take on a combination of monetary stimulus and debt cleanup. In China, because the effect is [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=2551.84s)]
*  through the fear of the household sector, this autocratic immune response, that these stimulus [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=2558.08s)]
*  policies will not do enough, and they will not be very effective. What you need is a credible [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=2564.8s)]
*  commitment from the authorities that they're not going to interfere with life, and that's very hard [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=2569.7599999999998s)]
*  to get. This is why I think it's fair to say, Michael, you feel that in the short term, [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=2575.2799999999997s)]
*  actually, Adam's view and those of others may be a little bit too pessimistic. You think it actually, [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=2581.44s)]
*  this may, some of the things they're doing now may work alright in the short term, although in the [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=2586.08s)]
*  medium and the long term, a little more pessimistic. Is that fair to say? Yeah, I'm not sure that I [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=2589.04s)]
*  would say the structuralist view is that fiscal stimulus works and monetary stimulus doesn't. [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=2594.8s)]
*  At least my view, I don't know if there are other people who claim that title. What I would argue [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=2600.5600000000004s)]
*  is that supply side policies are not sustainable. It's demand side policies that China really needs, [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=2606.0800000000004s)]
*  because China doesn't have a supply side constraint. But Michael, that's the whole point, [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=2612.96s)]
*  because that is stimulus policy. If we follow the logic of your argument, putting more money in the [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=2617.28s)]
*  hands of households should raise consumption. If you follow the logic of my argument, putting money [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=2622.4s)]
*  in the hands of households should raise savings. So it is a very distinct, should raise savings, [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=2627.12s)]
*  because people don't want to spend, whereas you're saying they're spending constraint. [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=2632.56s)]
*  So there is a very clear difference in our predictions on what would be the result of [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=2636.88s)]
*  fiscal stimulus. Okay, yeah, definitely a very clear difference in our views. [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=2641.6s)]
*  That's good. That's good. That's very well distilled. Let's take another question. [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=2647.12s)]
*  Our next question is a written submission from George Aridis, who asks, to what extent does the [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=2653.36s)]
*  demographics, particularly aging population, impact the ability to stimulate domestic demand [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=2658.96s)]
*  and provide the safety net within the confines of the growing debt crisis? [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=2664.1600000000003s)]
*  Zoe, I'm going to throw that one to you, because you actually, you talked about this in your piece, [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=2669.12s)]
*  you talked about the one child policy and some of its lingering effects. Can you [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=2673.12s)]
*  elaborate on that? Sure. I think the one child, the demographics have both positive [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=2676.4s)]
*  and negative effect, because it's not about demographic trend or the aging population [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=2682.48s)]
*  is going to do with the Chinese economy, because aging population also creates new demand, [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=2687.44s)]
*  such as older healthcare or adult diapers. It drives a new industry. But then the downside of [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=2696.08s)]
*  that is what worries me more. If you just look at the trajectory, by 2040, China is going to have [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=2706.72s)]
*  about 402 million people who are above the age of 60, which is the current legal retirement age. [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=2715.2s)]
*  At that time, the United States population is going to be around, the entirety of the US population [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=2724.64s)]
*  is going to be around 390 million. The other word, within the next 20 years, the retired Chinese [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=2730.48s)]
*  people, the population is going to be higher than that of the United States. That is not only [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=2741.6s)]
*  removing China's demographic premium, but also going to raise the healthcare cost tremendously. [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=2750.56s)]
*  The social welfare system already has been a burden a lot during COVID. Then the final part [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=2757.68s)]
*  in terms of why demographic trend in the long run bodes not good for the Chinese economy is really [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=2767.2000000000003s)]
*  about the real estate sector. Real estate sector is about 30% of the economy. As a family formation [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=2772.4s)]
*  rate decline, as Chinese women not necessarily willing to get married, to bury children, [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=2778.96s)]
*  you know, basically that is going to permanently drag down the money in the housing sector. [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=2785.6s)]
*  Demographics, I don't think in the long run is going to bode well for the Chinese economy. [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=2791.52s)]
*  Let's take another question. [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=2796.96s)]
*  Our next question is a live question from James Galbraith. [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=2799.3599999999997s)]
*  Thanks very much. It's a pleasure to listen to you. I wrote a paper on China for the Council [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=2808.24s)]
*  on Foreign Relations around 2001. Some of these issues were already being raised. [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=2814.0s)]
*  In fact, I experienced there in the 1990s, people were saying, economists were saying, [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=2820.56s)]
*  they should raise consumption and lower investment. There's nothing more dangerous than [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=2825.76s)]
*  when economists reach a consensus, you can be sure that something's about to go wrong. [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=2831.68s)]
*  In this case, it seems to me that the incomes that the Chinese households have in excess of [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=2837.2s)]
*  what they consume are because of the high investment share. That's what gives them the [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=2843.44s)]
*  incomes over and above what they're spending. So you can't really ask them to raise their [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=2848.2400000000002s)]
*  consumption share out of their savings. The savings is what they're not consuming right now, [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=2855.12s)]
*  because they don't want to and they don't need to when they have incomes above and beyond their [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=2860.64s)]
*  needs. Back in the 1990s, when I was advising the government of China, this question was already [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=2865.04s)]
*  being raised. I asked them, what are you talking about here materially? Are we going to build [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=2871.44s)]
*  roads and sell cars and not have roads to drive them on or gas stations to fill them up in? Are [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=2876.4s)]
*  you going to ask people to buy televisions and not have apartments for them to live in? What is [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=2883.76s)]
*  this distinction in material terms and why are Western economists fixated on it when the Chinese [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=2889.04s)]
*  have been doing quite well for the last 40 years by essentially not following this advice? Thank [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=2895.28s)]
*  you very much. Okay. I'm going to try to draw a question out of that. That's an interesting [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=2901.84s)]
*  comment. I think what Mr. Galbraith is getting at is what is the real capacity that the state has to [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=2908.5600000000004s)]
*  alter this decision-making, whether it's amongst companies or households? How much ability do they [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=2921.92s)]
*  really have to change decision-making at all? I don't know whether Adam or Michael, one of you [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=2933.12s)]
*  wants to respond to that or whether you heard another question in there that you want to address. [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=2939.12s)]
*  So thanks to Professor Galbraith for listening and contributing. I would take the question you put [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=2943.44s)]
*  forward, Justin, and I would say two things. First is, again, Michael Pettis and I are on opposite [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=2949.36s)]
*  tracks but have some parallels. So I also read a lot of Albert Hirschman and I invoke in my response, [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=2957.28s)]
*  exit voice and loyalty. And so when we ask what's the response, I think a lot of it is going to be [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=2963.44s)]
*  Chinese households, Chinese businesses exercising more exit, meaning instead of showing loyalty or [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=2970.48s)]
*  complaining domestically, which is not an option really, they're going to be trying to move their [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=2978.16s)]
*  people, their plants, their money out, not in a huge number but in a markedly larger number. [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=2983.68s)]
*  And all the data of the last several months, the movements in the Yuan, the stories about China [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=2989.44s)]
*  cracking down on outflows of capital fit that. And then that has the policy question, which you may [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=2994.16s)]
*  want to get to, Justin, of my arguing that the US should instead of be doing sanctions to constrain [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=2999.2s)]
*  China, should be doing suction to get stuff out of China and put pressure that way. [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=3004.16s)]
*  Let's go right to that, Adam, actually, because I do want to ask that question. I want to hear what [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=3008.48s)]
*  Michael and Zoe have to say about that as well. We've talked about what you would sort of advise [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=3011.7599999999998s)]
*  President Xi or the CCP. One of the real questions, and I would recommend to everyone on the call to [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=3016.3199999999997s)]
*  look at a piece we ran this week by Dan Rosen and Logan Wright on this question of what should [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=3022.48s)]
*  American policymakers do in reaction to this slowdown? How should they treat it? Should they [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=3027.92s)]
*  try to exploit it? Should they lean into it? What's the proper response from the US point of view [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=3034.64s)]
*  to what's happening in China, regardless of what the sources of the problem are? [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=3040.96s)]
*  So why don't you take a stab at that and then we'll hear from Zoe and Michael and that'll [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=3044.7200000000003s)]
*  probably bring us to time. Yeah. So I'll try to be quick. As I argued in the original article, [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=3047.92s)]
*  which you guys posted on in early August, you want to think in terms of suction is not sanctioned, [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=3052.72s)]
*  that the way to put pressure on the regime is to make it so that it's attractive for people to [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=3058.3199999999997s)]
*  leave. And then that creates a dynamic we've seen with other autocrats in the economic sphere, [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=3063.12s)]
*  that they try to put up more controls against capital flight, against outward migration, [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=3068.8799999999997s)]
*  against outward investment. And those controls induce more desire to leave. And so you're not [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=3073.04s)]
*  going to collapse the Chinese Communist Party regime, but this is a much more constructive, [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=3078.72s)]
*  positive way of putting pressure on the Chinese Communist Party regime than being confrontational [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=3083.6s)]
*  trying to bottle them up. And I've made this case to various senior US economic officials with [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=3090.0s)]
*  who knows how much influence at this point. It also depends obviously on domestic politics in [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=3096.16s)]
*  the US to take advantage of this, but it's a much more attractive position and frankly, [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=3102.24s)]
*  a much more sustainable position with allies and with the world and when US's own economic [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=3106.88s)]
*  interests to be pursuing pressure through this means than pursuing pressure through trying to [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=3113.6800000000003s)]
*  push China down. The second point to go with that, and this will be my last point, is that [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=3117.84s)]
*  we have a world in which for a while the Biden administration and the Trump administration were [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=3126.56s)]
*  saying China is a huge threat because they're so economically powerful. Then shortly after my [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=3130.88s)]
*  article came out, no causality, of course, President Biden suddenly says China's in deep [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=3136.08s)]
*  economic trouble, so they're a big threat because they might lash out. Now these are not [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=3140.72s)]
*  necessarily contradictory, but there is a tension there, one's about capacity and one's about [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=3145.44s)]
*  intentions. And I think the Biden administration since the president's statements in August has [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=3149.92s)]
*  wisely moved into this APEC summit more about we're not trying to beat China down. As Secretary [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=3155.2s)]
*  Yellen said a couple days ago, we want a constructive economic relationship with China. [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=3161.6s)]
*  Let them fail on their own terms. Don't be us saying we're against the Chinese people, [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=3167.6s)]
*  we're against the Chinese people making a living, we're threatened by Chinese students or Chinese [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=3172.3199999999997s)]
*  business. Let us be focused on the Chinese Communist Party and their external intentions, [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=3177.44s)]
*  but don't beat them while they're down. And I'm hopeful that there has been that change in the [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=3183.2799999999997s)]
*  Biden administration approach. Michael, is that your view as well? Would that be your advice or [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=3187.84s)]
*  would you differ on anything? Well, first of all, I don't think China is the economic threat that [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=3193.44s)]
*  we make it out to be. I think Americans have a history of paranoia. Maybe it's the strength [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=3200.08s)]
*  of the US, but we were terrified of Japan, terrified of the Soviet Union, economically, [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=3205.36s)]
*  I'm not talking about geopolitically. It's a common trend and we tend to get it wrong for the [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=3211.04s)]
*  same reasons. I would say what really matters to the US is not whether China slows down, [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=3217.52s)]
*  but the way in which it slows down. One of the big problems is that if you look at China within the [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=3223.44s)]
*  global context, I had an article that came out in the EFT last week, China represents roughly [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=3229.6s)]
*  18% of global GDP, which is probably overstated. It accounts for 13% of global consumption, [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=3236.24s)]
*  which is incredibly low. It accounts for 31% of global investment and 30% of global manufacturing. [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=3244.3199999999997s)]
*  What really matters to the US and to Europe and the rest of the world is how those things shift [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=3252.64s)]
*  as China adjusts. Now, if China has a Japanese style adjustment where you see consumption growth [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=3258.24s)]
*  sort of stable, maybe down a bit, and much of the adjustment incurring with a reduction in [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=3265.2s)]
*  investment, what you're likely to see is the savings rate in China go down faster than the [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=3270.24s)]
*  investment rate so that the current account deficit as a share of global GDP will contract, [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=3276.24s)]
*  which is exactly what happened with Japan in the 1990s. In which case, China's adjustment adds a [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=3282.16s)]
*  bit of global demand to the world. It's unevenly distributed. If you're a Brazil, an exporter of [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=3288.3199999999997s)]
*  iron ore, you're going to get badly hurt. If you export agricultural commodities or consumer goods [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=3294.08s)]
*  or import industrial commodities, you'll benefit more from China's adjustment, but that's the key. [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=3299.6s)]
*  Now, if China adjusts or as it attempts to adjust, tries to shift lending away from the property [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=3305.36s)]
*  sector and into the manufacturing sector, which we're already seeing, the decline in property [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=3313.04s)]
*  investment has been more than matched by an increase in industrial investment. [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=3318.88s)]
*  That creates a real problem for the world because if you assume that China continues to grow [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=3323.04s)]
*  maybe at 4%, in about a decade, China's share of global manufacturing will rise from 30% to 37%, [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=3328.0s)]
*  while its share of GDP rises from 18% to say 21%. That means the rest of the world, in order to [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=3337.76s)]
*  accommodate China, has got to reduce its own manufacturing share. You'll have a better sense [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=3344.7200000000003s)]
*  of this than I do, but I don't get the feeling that that's what the US wants to do or Europe [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=3351.28s)]
*  or India or any of the large economies. They want to increase their manufacturing share. [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=3356.0800000000004s)]
*  So that creates a real problem, but from our point of view, what matters is how China adjusts, [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=3360.88s)]
*  not whether it adjusts. That's interesting. That's an interesting challenge. I'm going to [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=3366.48s)]
*  give Zoe the last word here before we close. Zoe, what's your basic baseline advice to [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=3369.84s)]
*  the Biden administration, to American policymakers in terms of how to react to the Chinese slowdown? [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=3375.36s)]
*  I would say that we wouldn't reevaluate the premise for America's China policy because [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=3380.7200000000003s)]
*  the premise of our China strategy has been that China will surpass the United States [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=3387.12s)]
*  economically, challenge the United States ideologically, and confront the United States [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=3391.84s)]
*  militarily. However, in our China strategy, it seems that we haven't paid enough attention [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=3397.28s)]
*  to the Chinese people until during COVID, we started to see, oh, actually, when we think about [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=3402.88s)]
*  China, there is also the angle of Chinese people. And as Dr. Pottson's article showed, actually, [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=3408.56s)]
*  the Chinese people not only have an agency, but also perhaps there is a growing incentive mismatch [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=3415.68s)]
*  between the party and the Chinese people. And I think US government should be aware that this is [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=3421.7599999999998s)]
*  not necessarily the moment that we want to push China or President Xi Jinping or the party to look [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=3428.56s)]
*  inward because a country as big as China, the second largest world economy with 1.4 billion people, [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=3432.88s)]
*  if an isolated China with that big of economy and that large number of population who become angry, [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=3441.6s)]
*  and in particular, angry at the United States, that is going to be very dangerous. [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=3448.48s)]
*  Well, I don't envy any policymakers or officials in the administration right now trying to puzzle [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=3453.6s)]
*  through exactly how to do this and what to do over the next couple of days. And I certainly [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=3460.4s)]
*  don't envy whoever is putting together a President Biden's briefing book. I do hope that they have [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=3466.1600000000003s)]
*  read all three of you in Foreign Affairs. I think if they do, they'll be a little bit better prepared [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=3472.0s)]
*  for that very difficult job. I want to thank all three of you. I want to thank our friends at the [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=3479.04s)]
*  Peterson Institute. And I want to thank everybody who attended this morning. Best of luck to you, [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1TxK9JyWI&t=3484.08s)]
