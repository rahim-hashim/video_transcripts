Video Description: More than any time in the last 75 years, we’re living in a world at war. Conflicts in Gaza and Ukraine dominate headlines. But that’s just part of it. Last year, Azerbaijan seized Nagorno-Karabakh, forcing thousands of ethnic Armenians to flee. There’s a full-scale civil war in Myanmar. In Africa, there is war in Sudan, Ethiopia, and Congo, and there have been seven coups on the continent since August 2020.
Comfort Ero, the head of the International Crisis Group, has been tracking these conflicts as closely as anyone. She has watched the international system grow more brittle and less effective at preventing war—and has been doing the hard political work of ending conflict once it breaks out.

# Comfort Ero: Why Is Violent Conflict Reaching Record Levels? | Foreign Affairs Interview
**Foreign Affairs:** [March 21, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg)
*  I'm Dan Kurtz-Faelen and this is the Foreign Affairs Interview. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=0.0s)]
*  More than any time in the last 75 years, we're living in a world at war. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=23.92s)]
*  Conflicts in Gaza and Ukraine may dominate headlines, but that's just part of it. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=28.319999999999997s)]
*  Last year, Azerbaijan seized Nagorno-Karabakh. There's a full-scale civil war in Myanmar. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=32.48s)]
*  In Africa, there is war in Sudan, in Ethiopia, in Congo. And there have been seven coups since [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=37.2s)]
*  August 2020. Comfort Arrow, head of the International Crisis Group, has been tracking [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=42.72s)]
*  these conflicts as closely as anyone. She warns that, without a major shift, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=47.36s)]
*  war is likely to spread even further in the years ahead. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=52.0s)]
*  Comfort, thanks so much for joining me. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=58.24s)]
*  Thank you for inviting me, Dan. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=63.28s)]
*  I want to start at a very high level and get your sense of what is going on with these kind of [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=65.12s)]
*  trends in global conflict that you've focused on. I noted that the Crisis Group's global conflict [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=71.76s)]
*  tracker recorded 13 countries where conditions had deteriorated in February and zero where they [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=77.04s)]
*  had improved. You've noted in the past that more people died in fighting worldwide last year than [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=83.44s)]
*  in any year since the end of the Cold War, with the exception of 1994 when the Rwandan genocide [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=88.56s)]
*  occurred. You also see some grim records in terms of mass displacement and civilian deaths and much [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=94.32s)]
*  else. Is it right to characterize this as a kind of real systemic breakdown, a breakdown in order, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=100.47999999999999s)]
*  or to put it slightly differently, why are all these trend lines so negative? What forces are [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=106.64s)]
*  contributing to this breakdown that we've seen? Thanks for starting at that big picture, because [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=110.48s)]
*  I think everything else hangs on that. When I look at my time when I first came to Crisis Group as [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=117.28s)]
*  West Africa project director, there was a sense in which despite the wars that were going on [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=124.88000000000001s)]
*  at the end of the Cold War era, despite the tragedy around Rwanda, the end of apartheid, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=132.08s)]
*  there was a sense of never again. But it seems as though that never again itself and the norms and [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=139.76s)]
*  the principles that sort of shaped the sense that we were going to do things differently and that [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=147.67999999999998s)]
*  there was going to be a real push towards conflict resolution, mitigation, I think that started to [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=153.84s)]
*  unravel at the time of 9-11 and at the time of the war in terror. A number of those principles [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=159.68s)]
*  themselves came under a lot of stress. And then fast forward, you had the Arab Spring, which I think [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=167.52s)]
*  dealt another death blow to a lot of those norms and principles and to the robustness of the [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=173.44s)]
*  international system, multilateralism. And for most of us, we tend to think of the UN as the bastion, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=180.56s)]
*  as a pivotal sort of body driving multinationalism as well. I also think that what is more brittle [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=186.88s)]
*  this time is geopolitics and the big sort of tensions that we're seeing. It's not that it [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=193.52s)]
*  wasn't there before, but the big tensions that we're seeing with major powers today. I think that [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=200.88000000000002s)]
*  because the great powers, the major powers themselves, are headbutting more and more, you see [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=206.0s)]
*  sort of danger signs and it's becoming harder. Even in conflicts where they don't necessarily have the [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=211.76000000000002s)]
*  same kind of stakes, diplomacy itself has become harder to achieve. There's no appetite to do the [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=217.52s)]
*  hard work of deal making, of compromise, of trying to win that big peace agreement. I mean, we quite [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=223.68s)]
*  frankly haven't seen a credible peace agreement, for example, since 2016 with Colombia as well. So [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=230.08s)]
*  great power politics, I think, is one. I think another one that sort of keeps me worried at night, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=236.88s)]
*  it's just the breakdown of trust. Nobody takes with credibility anymore this notion of an [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=242.72s)]
*  international rules-based order or international law in the way that we used to talk about as well. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=249.12s)]
*  And, you know, there's a lot of talk now as a result from the fallout from Ukraine of [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=255.12s)]
*  sort of hypocrisy, double standards. You can't come and let trust anymore about democracy because [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=259.76s)]
*  we've seen how you sold out on democracy in your own countries. A lot of faith, credibility lost [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=265.44s)]
*  in the midst of the way in which the international community or rich advanced countries were unwilling [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=271.52s)]
*  to cooperate around vaccine, vaccine distribution, also around climate financing. And then you had [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=277.68s)]
*  Ukraine and then you have Gaza and you add all this kind of like crescendo of crises, tensions [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=283.76s)]
*  between great powers, nobody trusting the system. And alongside that, I think a number of countries, [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=289.91999999999996s)]
*  we normally call them middle powers, a certain middle power, rising to also stamp their own [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=296.8s)]
*  authority on certain crises. You know, so we've emerged in this multipolar world where other states [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=302.64s)]
*  are beginning to realize that, well, we can no longer rely and trust the traditional actors. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=309.04s)]
*  We're going to sort of stick our oar in because this is also critical to our own national interests. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=315.44s)]
*  And so quite frankly, the landscape looks more complicated, [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=321.92s)]
*  more challenging, and quite frankly, the wars arising as I speak. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=325.84000000000003s)]
*  You wrote a fantastic piece in Foreign Affairs last May called Sudan and the New Age of Conflict, [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=330.32s)]
*  which looks at Sudan, but looks at it as kind of representative of trends that you see driving [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=336.40000000000003s)]
*  this wave of conflict, both more generally in sub-Saharan Africa, but also globally. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=342.32s)]
*  Before getting to those trends, I think because this is a conflict that gets much less attention, [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=347.36s)]
*  of course, than Gaza and Ukraine, some of the others, just getting your sense of where exactly [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=352.32s)]
*  things stand in Sudan for those who have not followed it closely week to week or even month [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=356.72s)]
*  to month. What is going on and why is that a cause of such concern, even if it's not generating the [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=361.12s)]
*  same headlines? I mean, for Crisis Group, you know, Sudan has been part of our 10 conflicts to watch, [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=365.6s)]
*  or sort of global watch list for the European Union and also for the Africa Union, because it [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=372.8s)]
*  sits in quite a pivotal part of the continent. It is both Africa, North Africa, sub-Saharan Africa, [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=379.52000000000004s)]
*  Africa, Arabist, Red Sea, and its reach and its strategic importance is why it ought not to be a [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=387.28000000000003s)]
*  conflict that is off the radar. But you can see also just the sheer scale of tragedy that we have [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=395.28000000000003s)]
*  to do means that even conflicts like Ukraine get put down, but the Peking order and Sudan therefore [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=402.88s)]
*  falls into that. I mean, we have a conflict right now between two forces that would claim that they [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=410.16s)]
*  were the key to enabling the coup and the revolution of Omar al-Bashir, who had reigned over [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=417.44s)]
*  Sudan for 30 odd years in a very pituitary manner. The irony is not lost on any of us who've been [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=426.0s)]
*  watching that the contest is between the two security forces that were crucial to Bashir's [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=433.28000000000003s)]
*  demise, but also crucial to protecting him and enabling his staying power. So that's the rapid [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=441.6s)]
*  support force led by Hamedi. In fact, he was a coup proffer. One of the reasons why Bashir [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=446.96000000000004s)]
*  created the paramilitary force was because he had this policy of divide and rule, separate, [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=452.71999999999997s)]
*  scatter the security forces, build a paramilitary force that would protect him, like a praetorian [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=458.4s)]
*  guard that would protect him and make sure he fends off the army. So the contest is between [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=463.91999999999996s)]
*  the rapid support force and the Sudanese armed forces. And that fighting has been going on now. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=470.0s)]
*  We're a month away from the anniversary of the war between those two forces. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=475.91999999999996s)]
*  What makes this also very painful to talk about is that 20 years ago, so let's go back into [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=482.4s)]
*  history as we were doing 20 years ago, there was a fervent campaign called Save Darfur. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=488.08s)]
*  Now we've seen the return of genocidal type atrocities back on the table, the sheer scale [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=493.52s)]
*  of the humanitarian conflict, the nature of the fighting. We've never seen this kind of fighting [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=500.08s)]
*  in Khartoum that we're seeing today. And the gravity and the scale and the lack of civilian [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=505.68s)]
*  protection and the ability also of the RSF to continue its offensive into parts of the region [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=513.6s)]
*  and that we haven't witnessed for such a long time across places like the White Nile, the Blue [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=521.52s)]
*  Nile, the places that will be familiar to people who are sort of working on Sudan. And I think what [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=527.6s)]
*  worries me as I think through Sudan is the potential that it could soon collapse and [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=533.36s)]
*  descend into Somalia type conflict or even Libya type conflict. Deliberately mention Libya because [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=540.64s)]
*  of the crisscross mercenaries and how porous the borders are. And the reason I say that also is the [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=547.52s)]
*  capacity for Sudan to suck in the entire region. And I think as the conflict spreads and intensify, [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=553.12s)]
*  we're likely to see serious refugees displacement and all the things that you [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=559.68s)]
*  you'll be familiar with in this kind of conflict. So as if that were not enough, I think one of the [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=564.64s)]
*  things that is so distressing as you go back and read that piece that you and Richard Atwood wrote [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=570.3199999999999s)]
*  in May is the very persuasive way you show that the drivers of conflict in Sudan and some of these [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=574.9599999999999s)]
*  trends that are causing such instability and such humanitarian toll really apply much more broadly. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=581.3599999999999s)]
*  One of those is the kind of roots of this conflict. We've of course seen a wave of [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=588.0s)]
*  coups across sub-Saharan Africa and not just Sudan, but Mali and Niger and Chad. And I know [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=592.8s)]
*  I'm forgetting some others, but you wrote in another piece for Foreign Affairs last year called [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=598.8s)]
*  The Christ of African Democracy that the problem is not exactly the coups, it's the underlying [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=603.92s)]
*  weakness of faith and democracy, of the kind of systems ability to deliver economic outcomes that [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=608.4s)]
*  really represents a kind of broader breakdown in political order, again not just in Sudan, [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=614.72s)]
*  but much more broadly. I want to zoom in specifically into the Sahel because I think [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=619.44s)]
*  that's the one that has really been very worrying and the trend lines there are all going in the [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=624.88s)]
*  in the wrong direction. And if you were looking, I mean, you know, hindsight is a great thing, [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=632.4s)]
*  but in this instance, there were also clear warnings, not just from Crisis Group, but from [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=637.84s)]
*  others who had been watching the Sahel before, that while the security first approach was vital [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=642.64s)]
*  to stop the corridor of the jihadist going any further, and then while it was important to make [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=649.04s)]
*  sure that you could deal with the jihadist ability to sort of crisscross three countries, [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=655.68s)]
*  there were important things that were said also about how to prevent this from spilling over into [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=662.8s)]
*  the region, how to keep Mali's problem within Mali, how to make sure that you shore up and [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=668.0s)]
*  protect Bikina Faso, and how do you make sure that Niger also doesn't face the same fate as Niger. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=673.68s)]
*  Going back as I'm speaking about the titles of certain reports that we put out in Crisis Group, [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=681.92s)]
*  averting Mali from spreading, you know, protecting and shoring up Bikina Faso, [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=688.08s)]
*  asking whether Niger was the weak link, this heavy focus on a securitised approach to dealing [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=694.16s)]
*  with some deep governance issues in these countries partly explains why we are here today in the Sahel. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=702.24s)]
*  You know, and often a real disconnect between the leadership and its people and its citizens, [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=713.1999999999999s)]
*  a real disconnect between the leadership, which is very focused on survival and what external actors [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=719.4399999999999s)]
*  are seeking, and then a region itself that hasn't caught up with realities in its own region as well. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=727.36s)]
*  You know, there's both a national explanation, there's a regional explanation, and there's an [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=735.84s)]
*  international factor. And then you've got the other challenge also, where governments themselves have [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=740.88s)]
*  not found a reasonable answer to the jihadi violence as well, that the militaries themselves [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=747.44s)]
*  pushed back against the failure of governments to be able to respond to that challenge. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=755.84s)]
*  And then I think the third one, which then allows us to bring in the Guineas and the Gabons, [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=761.44s)]
*  is this very false attempt at sort of elective democracy, where governments themselves will go [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=766.1600000000001s)]
*  through the motions every four to five years and still come out victorious, you know, and their [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=774.72s)]
*  citizens are asking some basic fundamental questions, you know, that you sold us this myth [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=781.12s)]
*  about what democracy is about, and yet we've still got corruption, we've still got violence, [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=786.48s)]
*  we've still got sort of an autocratic bend, we've still got injustice, we've still got the stark [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=791.84s)]
*  disconnect between what I gain as a citizen and what is actually happening with the state as well. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=798.08s)]
*  All of this coalescence at a time where I think also the international community itself, [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=805.1199999999999s)]
*  I mean in a sense, then the Sahel is a microcosm of a wider challenge we see with democracy, [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=811.1199999999999s)]
*  not just on the continent, but I could have the same conversation with you in Latin America, [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=816.8s)]
*  I could also have the same conversation with you quite frankly with a number of rich, [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=821.76s)]
*  advanced societies in the west who are also going through similar stresses. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=825.3599999999999s)]
*  One of the other complicating dynamics that you highlight in the case of Sudan, [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=830.2399999999999s)]
*  but also much more broadly is the much more complicated set of outside actors that tend to [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=833.92s)]
*  meddle in these kinds of conflicts. It used to be that this was very much a kind of great power [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=840.16s)]
*  game, especially during the Cold War when it was mostly the US and Soviet Union that were [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=844.7199999999999s)]
*  the outside actors and you see now, as you've noted, a much wider range of often non-western [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=849.04s)]
*  smaller powers that have become much more sort of, I think, often there are conversations in which [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=855.4399999999999s)]
*  multipolarity and of American dominance is kind of taken as a good thing when it comes to peace [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=861.28s)]
*  and equality. You in some ways see the more complicated set of outside actors as complicating [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=867.68s)]
*  efforts to build peace and end these wars. Is that a fair characterization? [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=872.8s)]
*  Yeah, the interesting thing, Dan, when we wrote the Sudan piece for you, we said that what was [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=876.9599999999999s)]
*  different this time, Brandon, what we thought would allow for maybe a different region of mediation [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=882.0s)]
*  in Sudan was that one of the key sets of actors, the Gulf, were not going through the same [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=890.5600000000001s)]
*  upheaval and that split that you saw between Qatar and Saudi Arabia and the UAE, we thought that that [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=897.44s)]
*  itself would be allow for a different environment for mediation, but quite frankly the story is [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=903.2s)]
*  very different since we wrote that article for you and even I have to admit that, you know, [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=910.1600000000001s)]
*  and I think one of our sort of key talking points now on Sudan is that, you know, Sudan is running [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=915.84s)]
*  out of time, partly because the various mediation efforts and varying our course and how to sort of [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=922.0s)]
*  bring coherence and not even talking about coordination. There are multiple mediation [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=930.0s)]
*  banks, there are multiple interests at stake and I think, you know, how do we get either to a single [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=936.64s)]
*  unified track or at least get an agreement on how we can get all these different tracks to be sort [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=945.92s)]
*  of mutually reinforcing is the challenge that we're facing today. So one of the lessons I take away [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=954.72s)]
*  from Sierra Leone and Liberia, particularly Dan, is that when you have this body that forces everybody [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=961.52s)]
*  together despite their different views, you bring them together, whether you call it a contact grip, [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=968.64s)]
*  whatever you want to call it, bring them all together, you know, the enablers, the drivers, [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=973.04s)]
*  you know, the wider powers, you bring them all together because in a sense, for so long as you [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=979.1999999999999s)]
*  leave one person out, you're never going to get to that peace process, you know, you're never going [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=985.1999999999999s)]
*  to get that substantial breakthrough moment that might need to assign and have an agreement as well [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=990.96s)]
*  and that is what's lacking right now in Sudan. Now having said all of that, there's a slight [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=996.88s)]
*  sense of optimism because one of the important things that we've been pushing for, for example, [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=1002.5600000000001s)]
*  crisis group for the US to sort of upgrade its own diplomacy, the US has now announced sort of a new [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=1008.1600000000001s)]
*  envoy in the form of Tom Perriello and at the same time, the UN, Secretary General Gutierrez [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=1014.56s)]
*  has announced a personal envoy, Ambassador Namamura, likely sort of key actors who may or may not, [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=1021.8399999999999s)]
*  I don't know, get us to where we need to get to. I mean the Arab side holds leverage with all the [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=1028.96s)]
*  belligerents quite frankly and we expect the African side also need to lead on the political [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=1035.6s)]
*  front and by here I mean the African Union, I mean Kenya, I mean Ethiopia, I mean the whole [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=1042.24s)]
*  of Africa writ large who has a lot at stake in this process. So you can see a wide cast of characters [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=1048.24s)]
*  and even the classic mediators will tell you that it's very hard to bring all that power [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=1055.44s)]
*  at one table and get them all to be singing from the same chorus sheet. It's going to be a challenge. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=1061.92s)]
*  We'll be back after a short break. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=1066.56s)]
*  And now back to my conversation with Comfort Arrow. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=1096.56s)]
*  Let's shift attention a bit north to the war in Gaza. This has of course consumed lots of [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=1123.92s)]
*  focus both I'm sure within your work but also much more broadly over the last four or five months. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=1132.4s)]
*  When you look at Gaza, when you bring this kind of broader context to your analysis of Gaza, [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=1138.32s)]
*  do you see it as kind of sui generis as its own kind of conflict given its particular historical [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=1142.48s)]
*  roots or does it bear some of the same characteristics and dynamics that you've been [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=1147.68s)]
*  observing in conflicts more generally in recent years? Good question. You know every country, [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=1152.0s)]
*  every region always sees his or her conflict as exceptional and I think there are certain things [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=1157.36s)]
*  that are exceptional and certain things that are not. I mean I'm talking to you Dan and you're [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=1164.72s)]
*  talking from the US and you just seeing the headlines yourself about the family. This is also [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=1171.12s)]
*  a hallmark of a number of conflicts so this doesn't make Gaza unique in that sense. So it's [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=1178.16s)]
*  impossible to start the conversation without mentioning the famine assessment that came out [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=1184.3200000000002s)]
*  I believe at the start of the week Monday which is quite frankly truly horrific. You know another [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=1191.1200000000001s)]
*  sort of characteristic in terms of the trend lines that we're seeing today I think Gaza bears that [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=1198.0800000000002s)]
*  all out in terms of hundreds of thousands of people in immediate danger of famine. 2017 [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=1205.04s)]
*  you remember that Gutierrez talked about famine being man-made. This is UN Secretary-General [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=1213.84s)]
*  Antonio Gutierrez. And you remember he pinpointed a range of conflicts Yemen, Somalia, South Sudan, [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=1221.28s)]
*  Nigeria and here we have another man-made famine caused by man-made disaster. When you look at [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=1227.28s)]
*  Gaza you can see why famine experts say that famines are political crises that require [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=1234.56s)]
*  political solution and crisis groups set at the outset. You know that trying to destroy, [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=1241.52s)]
*  recognizing the need for Israel to defend its people against such a heinous crime that was [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=1247.04s)]
*  committed. Nonetheless you know we said at the outset Dan that trying to destroy Hamas as an [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=1254.8799999999999s)]
*  objective would destroy Gaza and you know I take no pleasure in saying that but that is the reality [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=1262.48s)]
*  that we see and the famine assessment I think sharpens our conviction and why we pushed very [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=1271.2s)]
*  early on in the conflict that the ceasefire is both a sort of a moral and political imperative. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=1277.28s)]
*  You know you asked about whether there was something exceptional or about Gaza or you know [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=1285.5200000000002s)]
*  similar to other conflicts. There is the victors piece but it's clear that in all these conflicts [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=1292.0s)]
*  that you can bomb your way up it doesn't divorce you from the realities of the political upheaval [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=1299.68s)]
*  that you have to deal with as well and that is why I don't want to make this sound as though it's [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=1307.8400000000001s)]
*  exceptional. So one understands that the trauma that Israel faces but that hard political work [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=1314.0s)]
*  is going to be key to also getting us to where I believe Israel wants to be and how you begin to [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=1323.12s)]
*  craft a day after for Gaza but that day after very much is contingent on what is left behind [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=1331.04s)]
*  in Gaza which is why we've been very clear about the ceasefire as well. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=1337.36s)]
*  Just focusing on you know perhaps the most urgent of those issues that you laid out which is the [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=1341.52s)]
*  the risk of famine. What should the United States and the international system more broadly be doing [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=1346.6399999999999s)]
*  to prevent famine that they're not doing already? Obviously a ceasefire would be a key part of that [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=1353.44s)]
*  but are there other policy options that you see that are not being embraced or not with as much [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=1357.52s)]
*  commitment as they should that you think could make a difference or is it really just ceasefire [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=1364.0s)]
*  and no ceasefire at this point? You know the famine assessment you know sort of sharpened [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=1367.68s)]
*  our conviction on two areas the moral and the political. I mean quite frankly because either [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=1372.64s)]
*  Israel or the world and borders are prolonged ceasefire you know with the hostage sort of [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=1379.92s)]
*  prisoner exchange and significantly boost the humanitarian aid entry and delivery into Gaza [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=1386.8s)]
*  or they effectively sanction a famine affecting hundreds of thousands of more people. It's that [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=1393.68s)]
*  simple. It's clear that Hamas is not going to be eliminated even its military won't be eliminated. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=1399.68s)]
*  It will be broken. It has been broken. You heard Jake Sullivan announce sort of the death of a [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=1409.76s)]
*  Hamas leader so it will be broken as a hierarchical organized fighting force but it will still be able [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=1417.68s)]
*  I think to mount sort of in-serving guerrilla attacks and Hamas will therefore have to be [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=1427.76s)]
*  dealt with on that basis. So if there is not some kind of political solution [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=1435.52s)]
*  Israel is going to find itself in a forever war. Now I use the word deliberately forever war because [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=1442.08s)]
*  what struck me at the beginning I was doubtful of his decision to fly into Tel Aviv President Biden [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=1450.0s)]
*  but he referenced the mistakes that the US you know the lessons learned from 9-11 as well [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=1458.48s)]
*  and I thought that was instructive as a way in which to frame what Israel should try to avoid. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=1465.84s)]
*  Look there's no easy political answer. I think even in our early statements we saw that but [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=1472.64s)]
*  nonetheless we called for a ceasefire for the parties to look for a negotiated way out to impasse. [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=1477.68s)]
*  I don't think there is any other way to skirt around your question that it's not conceivable [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=1483.92s)]
*  without a negotiated way out. We could of course linger on a lot of these topics when it comes to [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=1489.84s)]
*  Gaza but I want to make sure we talk about the other global conflict that has consumed so much [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=1495.52s)]
*  attention in the last couple years and that's of course in Ukraine. You and I think met for the [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=1500.08s)]
*  first time in person in Kiev before the war on Gaza started and even then these arguments about [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=1504.08s)]
*  hypocrisy that you heard from you know parts of you know what we now refer to as the global south [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=1510.56s)]
*  were quite prominent you know this idea that leaders in the United States and Western Europe [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=1516.24s)]
*  and other rich countries were very focused on Putin's invasion of Ukraine but were much less [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=1520.8s)]
*  attentive to other conflicts. You've of course heard this probably as much as anyone. How do you [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=1525.68s)]
*  think of this question of hypocrisy? There's something you referenced earlier but as you [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=1530.8799999999999s)]
*  engage in those arguments and hear those arguments what is your reaction then when you look at what [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=1535.12s)]
*  is happening in Ukraine? You know my colleague Richard Garen wrote an interesting piece I think [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=1539.12s)]
*  a couple of weeks ago about hypocrisy and double standards and there was a particular line and I [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=1545.12s)]
*  can't remember it but the upshot was in a sense you know if you're worried about double standards [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=1551.1999999999998s)]
*  and hypocrisy then you shouldn't be in the business of international relations and you know relations [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=1556.9599999999998s)]
*  of states sort of you know evolves around double standards and the minute I accuse you of double [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=1562.32s)]
*  standard Dan you're going to find something to excuse me of as well. That's one of the lessons [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=1567.76s)]
*  that I've learned since the war in Ukraine but you also touch an important nerve because [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=1572.64s)]
*  I think the West was caught off guard as a result of the pushback and the fact that a number of [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=1579.8400000000001s)]
*  countries did not sort of immediately rally to their own tune. Sure there was the UN General [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=1589.3600000000001s)]
*  Assembly resolutions and what have you but it was also what has been quite revealing in the last [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=1597.36s)]
*  18 months or so is the way in which countries themselves crafted their or sought to craft [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=1605.84s)]
*  their own response on the one hand showing sympathy to Ukraine especially when you couch it [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=1613.9199999999998s)]
*  in language of imperialism and colonisation I mean that immediately is understood by the world [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=1622.08s)]
*  outside the West but nonetheless I think it was a wake-up call for a number of Western countries, [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=1629.9199999999998s)]
*  the US in particular, because the number of people were now referencing Iraq, Afghanistan, [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=1637.4399999999998s)]
*  Libya you know and also suggesting that Ukraine was not exceptional or any different from a number [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=1644.16s)]
*  of other crises happening in the world. In the year that of the invasion by Russia into Ukraine [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=1653.3600000000001s)]
*  the other deadly conflict that wasn't sort of getting that sort of maximum attention [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=1662.0s)]
*  and the full weights of multilateralism behind it was Ethiopia where we saw a very deadly [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=1668.96s)]
*  horrible violent conflict in Tigray as well and then you also had Yemen play now and you had other [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=1676.24s)]
*  you know we talked about the Sahel so I think a number of countries were looking and asking [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=1683.2800000000002s)]
*  why is this more exceptional, is it because you give more credence to a conflict that is happening [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=1690.0s)]
*  in Europe, is it because you give credence to a particular group of people and also that you [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=1696.4s)]
*  are preaching to us about rules based order and we have seen and I think the response was [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=1703.2800000000002s)]
*  you know don't talk to us about the rules when you have also been you know the ones who have [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=1710.3200000000002s)]
*  broken the rules so the rule makers are the rule breakers was very much the message and also this [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=1714.88s)]
*  was coming at a time so the double standard hypocrisy is one side of the argument the other [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=1722.08s)]
*  side of the argument is that you know you're coming to me now to ask me to you know put my entire being [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=1729.12s)]
*  into this crisis when you failed us at the moment where we needed support on Covid we saw that there [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=1736.0s)]
*  was no room for cooperation you put up the walls very nationalistic response and there was no [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=1743.52s)]
*  cooperation in terms of dealing with that and then the climate financing as well and then not [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=1750.48s)]
*  appreciating the fallout of what the maximalist approach to sanctions would mean to a number of [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=1756.48s)]
*  these countries they're already facing a very precarious economic situation so put all these [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=1764.08s)]
*  things together you get a crescendo of frustration agitation and you know an annoyance with a number [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=1771.3600000000001s)]
*  of rich advanced and countries that seem to put more weight into a conflict that was in their [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=1778.16s)]
*  region as opposed to to the rest of the world as well. That long shadow of Covid is such a fascinating [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=1784.64s)]
*  point and it probably applies to you know we could apply to our own lives and you know most [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=1790.88s)]
*  social policy issues domestically as well but it's a really it's a really fascinating point. Ukraine [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=1794.96s)]
*  seems like another case where the prospects for peace and for real negotiation just look pretty [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=1799.8400000000001s)]
*  dim at this point given the stated objectives of the actors and the seeming willingness of both [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=1806.08s)]
*  sides to continue fighting. I know you've you know cited in the past a piece that Edward Lutvak wrote [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=1811.4399999999998s)]
*  in Foreign Affairs in the late 1990s called Give War a Chance where he argued that you know all the [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=1816.32s)]
*  efforts at peacemaking and negotiation were you know just kind of prolonging settlements and making [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=1821.4399999999998s)]
*  the suffering worse and the only thing you could really do was to let wars play out and let the [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=1826.24s)]
*  stronger side win. That was the only real you know sustainable or stable piece. When you look [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=1831.12s)]
*  at Ukraine do you think that's the right the right analysis or do you see a path to you know some kind [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=1835.9199999999998s)]
*  of negotiation some some way of ending this war you know short of one side fighting to the point [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=1841.4399999999998s)]
*  that the other decides to give up? You know as a conflict prevention organization it would be very [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=1846.08s)]
*  hard for me to make that case so let me let me let me reframe the question a little bit in terms of [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=1851.84s)]
*  you know the prospect of a protracted conflict I think is is is real so the prospect of this [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=1861.12s)]
*  dragging on is real but the prospect of also Russia coming out of this also stronger is [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=1868.56s)]
*  none of those things off the table. I mean you know Dan you and I were both at Munich Security [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=1876.08s)]
*  Conference and you know it was a very sombre mood because I think it was very clear that you know [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=1882.0s)]
*  leaders who were gathering sort of two years into you know Russia's all out war on Ukraine [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=1889.92s)]
*  understood that we were now entering into a period of sort of what I would characterize as [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=1897.44s)]
*  uncertainty and worry about both the war's trajectory given Russia's recent battlefield [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=1903.6000000000001s)]
*  gains at that time in February and also the stalled American support and sort of European [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=1912.56s)]
*  security more broadly also we were talking at a time where Trump and Putin neither of them [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=1920.3999999999999s)]
*  were at Munich but both of them had made their presence so one in relation to the death of [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=1926.8799999999999s)]
*  Navalny but the other one in form of Trump's own position on on encouraging or claiming that he [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=1935.2s)]
*  would encourage Russia to attack NATO so I think it's in that framework that I look at Ukraine [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=1942.64s)]
*  in 2024 and I think sort of to answer your your question I think Ukraine faces the greatest peril [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=1950.56s)]
*  today since the invasion of 2022 and I say that for two reasons I think because the counteroffensive [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=1960.08s)]
*  hasn't worked in the way that Ukraine and its allies have projected from last year and because [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=1968.1599999999999s)]
*  Putin and we are talking in the week of the elections Putin has a confident stride about [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=1976.24s)]
*  him as well and I think partly because of those two factors I think alarmed by by this [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=1983.76s)]
*  Biden administration and certainly the European leaders and you know we all saw them in Munich [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=1990.96s)]
*  they've upped their own rhetoric warning against sort of Russia's potentially ability to claim [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=1998.8s)]
*  victory because of the advances that they're making but also about Ukraine's ability to call [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=2005.2s)]
*  through so how you avert Russia's advance and how you tip the balance back in Ukraine's favor over [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=2013.28s)]
*  the long haul I think are the two conundrums that the western allies face I mean we are where we are [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=2022.16s)]
*  because Russia has put its economy on a war footing ramping up its defense production it's securing [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=2029.68s)]
*  more weapons from abroad and filling its ranks by sort of drawing from the poor and and people in [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=2036.72s)]
*  prison and the west and Ukraine are not so doing this you know and then overblown expectations [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=2044.56s)]
*  quite frankly of Ukraine's counteroffensive I think is is one thing that we we need to sort of [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=2052.2400000000002s)]
*  state state upfront and you know it's a magical thinking about Russia's own sort of ability [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=2058.48s)]
*  or inability to continue to to wage the war and Europe's reliance on Washington has made I would [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=2066.1600000000003s)]
*  argue for a very toxic cocktail that delayed essential long-term planning and I don't know if [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=2073.84s)]
*  you were in the room Dan when JD Vance the senator Republican senator from Ohio was speaking but that [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=2081.2000000000003s)]
*  was a wake-up call you know he was also essentially saying that even with our supplemental support [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=2088.32s)]
*  Ukraine has still got a long way to go and then quite frankly the bottom line is that Ukraine [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=2094.56s)]
*  needs more well-trained more well-armed troops and that is the message for Europe today and it's a [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=2100.32s)]
*  it's a very tough message that European leaders need to grapple with and again I want to underline [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=2106.96s)]
*  you know I work for a conflict prevention organization we have lead in the western [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=2114.72s)]
*  support for Ukraine so I don't say this lightly but without a surge in western military aid [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=2120.56s)]
*  and the shift in Ukraine's strategy in addition to mobilization and training [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=2131.7599999999998s)]
*  and that means you know Ukraine building the solid defense lines in its rare its position [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=2136.72s)]
*  were worth an increase in the risks of battlefield breakthrough so and a tipping point for Russia and [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=2143.28s)]
*  that could all come together in the summer and you know what happens after the summer so yeah. [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=2150.5600000000004s)]
*  Let me attempt to end this conversation on if not an optimistic at least a somewhat constructive [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=2157.0400000000004s)]
*  note you know a lot of the structural factors that are contributing to this wave of global conflict [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=2162.0800000000004s)]
*  and the kind of seeming inability of the international institutions international community to to stop them [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=2170.24s)]
*  are probably not going to change in the coming years you know US-China tensions and US-Russia [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=2175.4399999999996s)]
*  tensions are going to continue to be a factor in geopolitics the kind of lack of faith in [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=2180.0s)]
*  the UN system and in other institutions I think is probably not going to change in the near term. [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=2185.52s)]
*  Is there anything that you see that you think is a kind of if not a cause for hope at least a kind of [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=2190.9599999999996s)]
*  basis to build on constructively in the kind of multilateral efforts to prevent conflict and [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=2195.6s)]
*  end conflict? You know out of every crisis you know there's always something that comes out of [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=2200.0s)]
*  it that sort of sharpens minds and it gets everybody back to the drawing board. What I've also found [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=2206.72s)]
*  interesting despite all my own agitations around the global south and how that's being projected [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=2212.88s)]
*  is that nonetheless an interesting space has opened up to put certain things on the table [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=2220.64s)]
*  and to force certain conversations especially for example around the international financial [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=2226.96s)]
*  institutions you know and how to deal with representation and making these more equitable [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=2233.28s)]
*  and reviewing who sits on the table and putting issues like climate financing adaptation [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=2240.4s)]
*  on the table. Now I am not for one second naive that any of these things are going to materialise [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=2247.36s)]
*  overnight but it's been interesting how a number of countries have been able to coalesce around [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=2254.88s)]
*  certain issues and have given a wake-up call to a number of rich advanced countries to say that [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=2262.48s)]
*  even if we can't reform or change you we can constrain you or we can restrain you or we can [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=2271.2000000000003s)]
*  call you to order we can challenge you on double standards we can challenge you in your property [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=2278.4s)]
*  the other thing that does keep me a little bit optimistic is that despite all the agitation [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=2284.72s)]
*  and frustration and questions about the legitimacy of multilateralism leaders still every single year [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=2292.3199999999997s)]
*  carry themselves off to your town New York and come and do the big summit tree even if they [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=2300.4799999999996s)]
*  build other alliances even if they're forming other groups whether it's called the bricks or [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=2307.04s)]
*  whatever even if they're forming all those other groups they still see multilateralism as a point [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=2311.92s)]
*  of order and as a point in which to ultimately negotiate or find practical reasons to stick [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=2319.04s)]
*  together at the UN and even to get big powers at the UN they will still put up their national [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=2327.52s)]
*  positions they will still put up their own interests but you know the solidarity when [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=2334.48s)]
*  it suits them suits them but nonetheless I still think there is something important about that [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=2339.76s)]
*  comfort thanks for such a rich and wide-ranging conversation and thank you for the fantastic [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUBeb0pKeUg&t=2347.44s)]
