Video Description: Less than a week ago, on June 12, Israel launched a barrage of attacks against Iran, targeting nuclear sites, missile depots, and military and political leaders. Since then, the two countries have exchanged a series of attacks.
Philip Gordon is the Sydney Stein, Jr. Scholar at the Brookings Institution and a longtime observer and analyst of the Middle East, and his writing has appeared in Foreign Affairs for over 20 years. He has also been one of the key practitioners of U.S. Middle East policy, as White House Middle East coordinator during the Obama administration and, more recently, as national security adviser to Vice President Kamala Harris.
Shortly after the start of the Trump administration, Gordon wrote in Foreign Affairs, to the surprise of many, about the opportunity Donald Trump had to make progress in the Middle East. On June 17, he joined Dan Kurtz-Phelan to discuss the dangers of this latest round of escalation—and also how wise U.S. policy could prevent it from ending in catastrophe.

# Philip Gordon: Iran, Israel, and the Middle East in Tumult | Foreign Affairs Interview
**Foreign Affairs:** [June 18, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg)
*  I'm Dan Kurtz-Faelin and this is the Foreign Affairs Interview. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=0.0s)]
*  I would caution in this case for all of those who are you know have the goal of regime change in [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=3.92s)]
*  mind or think Israel's already well on its way to victory be careful what you wish for because [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=10.92s)]
*  I would say in this case as in all previous cases the most likely result of a regime change in Iran [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=16.68s)]
*  would not be a liberal pro-western democracy that doesn't want nuclear weapons. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=23.439999999999998s)]
*  Less than a week ago on June 12th Israel launched a barrage of attacks against Iran targeting [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=28.32s)]
*  nuclear sites missile depots and military and political leaders. Since then the two countries [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=34.2s)]
*  have exchanged a series of attacks as we consider where all of this might lead I wanted to talk to [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=39.56s)]
*  Phil Gordon. Phil is a longtime observer and analyst of the Middle East as you can see in [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=44.36s)]
*  the pages of Foreign Affairs going back 20 years he's also been one of the key practitioners of [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=49.6s)]
*  US Middle East policy as White House Middle East coordinator during the Obama administration and [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=54.48s)]
*  more recently as national security adviser to Vice President Kamala Harris. Shortly after the start [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=60.04s)]
*  of the Trump administration Phil wrote in Foreign Affairs to the surprise of many about the [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=65.8s)]
*  opportunity Donald Trump had to make progress in the Middle East. With a new regional war just [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=70.6s)]
*  beginning Phil and I talked about the dangers of this latest round of escalation but also about [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=75.19999999999999s)]
*  how wise US policy could prevent it from ending in catastrophe. Phil thank you for joining me. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=80.4s)]
*  Great to be here Dan. Given how much could change in a matter of days or even hours or minutes I [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=94.08000000000001s)]
*  should note that we're speaking in the morning East Coast time on Tuesday June 17th it's a few [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=99.84s)]
*  days past the initial Israeli attacks on Iran that's sort of late last week we're still seeing [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=105.48s)]
*  rounds of missile and drone and other strikes going in both directions and what it will add up to is [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=111.08s)]
*  still of course far from clear but with those caveats Phil I'm eager to hear from you as someone [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=116.88000000000001s)]
*  who has both observed the Middle East for a long time and also as a policymaker had an important [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=122.60000000000001s)]
*  role in managing and responding to and preparing for crises in the region how a couple of scenarios [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=126.96000000000001s)]
*  could unfold first what would a major escalation from here look like and then second what would [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=132.52s)]
*  the path to de-escalation evolve if you kind of consider those two broad paths? [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=138.52s)]
*  Yeah I mean there's so many different directions this could go Dan. I mean Israel took an enormous [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=142.24s)]
*  gamble with this intervention obviously it's talking about it now as if it had little choice [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=147.52s)]
*  and Iran was on the verge of developing a nuclear weapon but I just don't think that was the case I [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=153.28s)]
*  mean I think they actually short-circuited a real opportunity to get the diplomatic deal that the [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=158.6s)]
*  Trump administration wanted that would have blocked Iran's path to a nuclear weapon we will [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=164.28s)]
*  now never know and you know we have debates for years and decades about this but it sort of forced [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=168.76s)]
*  Trump's hand and he's now like going along and following it so far so pretty good you could say [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=174.04s)]
*  because I think you have to be impressed with the intelligence and military capability that [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=180.56s)]
*  Israelis have demonstrated to take out the top leadership of the IRGC and nuclear scientists [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=186.58s)]
*  and the Air Force and other commanders unbelievably impressive to know where they were and be able to [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=193.06s)]
*  target them the ability to defeat most of Iran's incoming missiles you know we're all very much [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=198.98s)]
*  concerned about Iran's ballistic missile force Israelis have done an unbelievable technological [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=204.42000000000002s)]
*  job in defeating most of that some has gotten through and to set back the nuclear program [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=209.7s)]
*  sure we'll get into the degree to which it set back so you do have to acknowledge that they have [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=214.02s)]
*  accomplished a significant amount and done so in a very impressive way and yet it still raises all [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=218.66s)]
*  sorts of questions and risks one of the reasons to be concerned about a unilateral Israeli [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=225.3s)]
*  intervention in Iran to deal with the nuclear program was the risk that it would produce the [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=230.5s)]
*  very thing they were worried about which is an Iranian dash for a bomb I think it's the case [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=235.78s)]
*  Iran wasn't dashing for a bomb but it might be now and you know Iran still has enrichment [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=239.62s)]
*  capability they had a stockpile of low enriched and highly enriched uranium so they could actually [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=245.38s)]
*  be producing the scenario that they didn't want and then there are all sorts of other sort of [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=250.9s)]
*  quagmire possibilities that you can get into where they seek to escalate Iran escalates against [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=254.9s)]
*  Israel or the United States so enormous gamble again so far so kind of good but a few days into [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=260.98s)]
*  this is way too soon to really make an assessment do you see regime change in Tehran as the likely [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=267.46s)]
*  outcome of Israeli actions I mean whether or not that's the explicit objective of the Israeli [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=273.46s)]
*  government and Prime Minister Netanyahu is of course kind of you know not come out and said [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=278.34s)]
*  explicitly that that's what they're aiming for but he has kind of hinted that that might be what the [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=282.34s)]
*  actions produce yeah I mean it's definitely one of the objectives and as always when you know you [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=286.9s)]
*  have a conflict a war war aims fluctuate and there's not a single one you go back to the Iraq war [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=290.97999999999996s)]
*  we've been debating ever since then was about weapons of mass destruction or freedom and [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=296.82s)]
*  democracy or terrorism and I think the same is true about this Israeli intervention the narrowest [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=300.74s)]
*  goal was the nuclear one I mean clearly Israel didn't want Iran to develop a nuclear weapon [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=307.78s)]
*  they've gone after the nuclear sites so for sure another certain goal was just setting back [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=312.02s)]
*  Iranian military capabilities you know sort of what they did Hezbollah just decapitate take [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=317.7s)]
*  care of missiles Iran's been a threat to Israel for a long time and this was an opportunity even [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=322.9s)]
*  aside from the nuclear thing an opportunity to decimate and weaken Iran's military forces which [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=327.94s)]
*  have been used you know especially through proxies against Israel but it's also pretty clear that [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=333.06s)]
*  another Israeli goal is regime change and you know Netanyahu sort of hinted as much you know [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=339.62s)]
*  you don't have to choose between these things I think you know they did the mission for nukes and [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=345.85999999999996s)]
*  military capabilities and it's like you know if that happens to lead to regime change fine with us [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=350.58s)]
*  but I only think it dramatically changes what Israel is doing in Iran as part of that goal I [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=356.26s)]
*  would also note and more and I've you know written this in foreign affairs as well as a whole book [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=361.86s)]
*  about it it's easy to in the early days think mission accomplished first of all it's hard to [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=367.14s)]
*  do regime change and regimes can be more resilient than we've seen as you know we saw in Syria we [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=372.09999999999997s)]
*  tried to do a regime change and a decade later Assad was still in power but even when you get [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=376.58s)]
*  it done like with the Taliban or Saddam Hussein in Iraq or Gaddafi in Libya there is often a moment [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=381.38s)]
*  of you know it worked mission accomplished we got rid of the terrible regime and that's when the [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=388.26s)]
*  problems begin because you create a vacuum and I would caution in this case for all of those who [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=393.38s)]
*  were you know have the goal of regime change in mind or think Israel's already well on its way to [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=398.97999999999996s)]
*  victory be careful what you wish for because I would say in this case as in all previous cases [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=404.82s)]
*  the most likely result of a regime change in Iran would not be a liberal pro-western democracy that [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=411.7s)]
*  doesn't want nuclear weapons at best it would be a version of the Iranian military which would also [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=418.42s)]
*  have internationalist hardline goals at worst it would be a vacuum that you know divides people [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=423.46s)]
*  ethnically branches of the military conflict pulls in neighbors and we've seen that so often [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=430.1s)]
*  before so I would say you know where the goal of regime change is concerned be careful what you [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=434.74s)]
*  wish for important point no one would miss the Iranian regime you know first and foremost the [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=440.02s)]
*  Iranians it's a horrible regime it's a threat to its neighbors it interferes in its neighbors it [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=445.3s)]
*  represses human rights it would be a wonderful thing if that regime were gone but there's no [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=450.98s)]
*  guarantee that especially if it's gone you know at the hands of the Israeli military gets replaced [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=456.26s)]
*  by something much better I did go back and read the piece you wrote for foreign affairs [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=461.62s)]
*  I believe just before going back into to govern the Biden administration it was called the false [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=466.34000000000003s)]
*  promise of regime change the middle east and a line that jumped out at me as you summed up the [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=471.06s)]
*  lessons of all these cases you looked at for your fantastic book that came out around that time [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=475.54s)]
*  you saw a quote a pattern of self-delusion in this judgment that have time and again made [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=479.78000000000003s)]
*  regime change so tempting and ultimately so disastrous which captured the warning pretty [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=484.02s)]
*  well but I'm curious if you were back in government if you were in you know senior member [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=488.58s)]
*  of the white ass national security team as you were six or so months ago would you be actively [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=492.58s)]
*  trying to prevent that outcome are there other ways you'd be kind of preparing for for the risks [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=498.09999999999997s)]
*  here I mean you kind of have have looked these cases as closely as anyone what would you be doing [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=502.18s)]
*  if you were an American policymaker at this point yeah so I mean like I said what Israel is doing [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=506.82s)]
*  now like you can't tell the difference so they go after regime change you're not going after regime [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=512.18s)]
*  change so that's kind of a like hypothetical thing I mean the real issue is how long this goes on and [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=516.26s)]
*  what I would be doing again because I was skeptical that this was necessary to deal with the nuclear [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=522.42s)]
*  program I would try to stop it in the first place I think Trump actually didn't want it to happen you [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=527.54s)]
*  know all the signs are that he wanted to focus on diplomacy get this deal but then you know Netanyahu [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=532.8199999999999s)]
*  again forced his hand just decided he was going to do this and there Trump wasn't willing to stand [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=538.98s)]
*  in the way which I understand and then there's a real you know moral hazard problem in all of this [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=543.86s)]
*  and I don't have the answer to it which is that the United States has committed to Israel's security [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=548.1s)]
*  you know last thing we want to see is an Israel overrun or casualties in Israel and so the United [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=552.82s)]
*  States provides support political support military and so on great the problem is that is a guarantee [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=558.42s)]
*  to Israel that virtually whatever it does the United States and its amazingly powerful military [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=564.1s)]
*  will be there to back it and you know you mentioned nice service in the White House we saw this [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=569.94s)]
*  over and over again there were times we would have liked to see Israel go in a different direction [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=574.58s)]
*  whether vis-a-vis Gaza or Hezbollah or Iran but Israel knew that whatever it did we would be there [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=580.82s)]
*  to back it including with you know guided missile destroyers and air defenses and a THAAD system [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=586.58s)]
*  that we had to pull out of the United States that might have been for other contingencies and I think [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=591.94s)]
*  the same thing happened to Trump. Trump was like you know we want to do diplomacy don't initiate a [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=596.34s)]
*  conflict and Bibi was like well sorry I'm going to and then you know guess what now the United [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=601.3000000000001s)]
*  States is in and I think you're talking about Israel's goal of regime change another goal of [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=606.1800000000001s)]
*  Israel I think is to bring the United States directly into the conflict and they might succeed [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=610.34s)]
*  because you know they go in they accomplish a lot but it's not fully done and then they come back [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=614.98s)]
*  to Trump and say well there's still this fordo you know underground nuclear site and we can't [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=618.98s)]
*  really get it but you've backed us this far and you're kind of implicated already and like do you [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=623.54s)]
*  want this to succeed or not and then you know that's a dilemma because what is Trump going to do [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=628.18s)]
*  pull the plug on Israel or if Netanyahu and the Israelis go in a direction the United States [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=632.5799999999999s)]
*  doesn't want including regime change let's say you know they've mostly accomplished nuclear goals [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=638.9s)]
*  they decide they're going to keep up the bombing try to get Hamaneh and really change the regime [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=643.3s)]
*  and the United States is worried about that how do you stop them do you then say if you continue [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=647.3s)]
*  the war and you do go after leadership or regime change and Iran fires ballistic missiles at you [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=653.46s)]
*  we're not going to help you that's something that you know American presidents just haven't [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=658.5s)]
*  been prepared to do so I think that's you know getting at the issue of the U.S. has a lot of [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=662.58s)]
*  agency here but it's not easy I think maybe maneuvered Trump into supporting him so far he's [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=667.5400000000001s)]
*  trying to maneuver him to support even more but like to answer your specific question yeah if I [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=672.9000000000001s)]
*  was in the White House and that seemed to be the goal I would try to rein Israel in because I don't [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=679.14s)]
*  want to see the United States dragged into this conflict how do you assess the Trump administration's [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=684.02s)]
*  response over the last few days I mean leaving aside Trump's kind of face-saving efforts to [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=688.26s)]
*  insist that this wasn't you know something that was done behind his back yeah I mean face-saving [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=692.5799999999999s)]
*  is right because he did pivot I mean as recently as the night of the attack you know Secretary [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=697.22s)]
*  Rubio came out with that statement that seemed to distance the United States from the attack [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=702.18s)]
*  we know that for weeks and months Trump was focused on a deal and he even said he said [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=706.58s)]
*  publicly and privately that he was pressing Netanyahu not to you know unilaterally use force [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=711.38s)]
*  he warned him I think maybe forced to say Rubio initially came out and said like we had nothing [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=716.98s)]
*  to do with this there was a unilateral Israeli action and he even said he warned Iran not to [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=722.9000000000001s)]
*  go after U.S. troops didn't even say anything about responding against Israel which almost like left [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=728.1800000000001s)]
*  and out for the United States then I think Trump for the reasons I've said moral hazard and it plus [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=732.74s)]
*  it seemed to go really well right I mean they killed all the top commanders and then Trump comes [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=738.5s)]
*  out and acts as if this was his call you know they had 60 days to do it time ran out and you don't [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=743.62s)]
*  mess with me I think there's a possibility he was influenced by all of that taco talk right Trump [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=748.98s)]
*  always chickens out and decided he was going to make it look like he was the one who decided he [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=754.58s)]
*  ran out of patience and he was going to enforce this and that's where he's been so far but you [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=760.66s)]
*  know like on so many things he wavers back and forth and actually I think there's a consequence [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=765.86s)]
*  of the taco analysis in foreign policy the idea that he just blusters and bloviates and doesn't [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=772.1s)]
*  do something which can actually be very costly in this situation in that Iran had no reason to [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=777.38s)]
*  believe that the 60-day deadline was actually a deadline right Trump has so often you know made [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=783.38s)]
*  wild threats given people deadlines and we look at how he's handled tariffs and trade Iran had good [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=788.5s)]
*  reason to believe this was just one more thing and now I mean if it's actually the case that Trump [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=794.82s)]
*  was planning to support military intervention after 60 days but Iran didn't know that that's [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=799.94s)]
*  a consequence of making all these threats that you never follow up on the same is true now so now [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=804.74s)]
*  we're moving additional military forces to the region Trump is telling the people of Tehran to [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=810.5s)]
*  get out of Tehran he said you should have done a deal if Trump were generally consistent on this [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=816.1s)]
*  sort of thing that you know Iran might draw their conclusion and come and like negotiate a deal but [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=821.62s)]
*  given that he's just always throwing things around and you never know which ones are serious they [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=827.14s)]
*  could miscalculate again so I think it's a you know consequence of the general approach Trump [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=831.46s)]
*  approach to these things and and it's why you know people look at the nsc and say why do you need all [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=836.26s)]
*  these you know staffers there and it's this kind of process and clarity that is the reason we won't [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=841.5400000000001s)]
*  go down that rabbit hole but that's why you have process well but we should go down that rabbit [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=845.86s)]
*  hole because it's important you said look at the nsc there's nothing to look at because it's almost [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=849.62s)]
*  not there and that is also wild to me the notion that we're trying to manage a war [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=854.34s)]
*  without a national security council staff or without without a national security advisor and [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=860.66s)]
*  you can say oh you know Marco Rubio is the national security advisor you can't be secretary of state [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=864.58s)]
*  and national security advisor at the same time now he can forego all of his secretary of state duties [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=869.22s)]
*  traveling to caribbean and dealing with china and all of that and and manage this crisis but [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=874.34s)]
*  like he's not doing that and there's a cost to that too a good nsc process is not a guarantee [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=879.86s)]
*  it's not a sufficient condition to manage a crisis well but it's a necessary one and the idea that [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=885.62s)]
*  Trump is deciding these things without carefully planned options people thinking it through [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=891.7s)]
*  if we do that or if we do support this what if Iran responds against our bases who's thinking [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=896.98s)]
*  that through or we do have the right military defensive equipment in place what about the [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=902.26s)]
*  diplomatic pieces can we get british bases who's talking to them i mean there's an enormous amount [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=906.1s)]
*  of work that would have to be done by an nsc but you know he fired most of the nsc got rid of the [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=912.34s)]
*  experts has a lot of unqualified political appointees doesn't have a national security [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=917.86s)]
*  advisor that is really a you know a nuts way to go about managing a crisis where american lives [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=922.26s)]
*  are at stake and a lot more people occasionally cite henry kissinger as the one other person who [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=927.54s)]
*  has done both those jobs but when you go back and kind of read that history and read kissinger's [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=931.54s)]
*  memoirs it's just such a different system that it's not really a model that holds i think as you [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=936.02s)]
*  look at iran's options right now how much space for compromise does tiran have can the supreme [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=940.8199999999999s)]
*  leader kind of pivot on a dime and and rush towards a deal do you see it as logical for iran to to [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=946.66s)]
*  rush to break out to a nuclear weapons capability now i mean how do you think they're thinking of [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=952.5s)]
*  potential paths they're clearly under a lot of pressure right now and sending signals that they [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=957.06s)]
*  want to talk to the u.s but it's not totally clear to me what what their options are and how [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=961.22s)]
*  they think of those yeah it's important you brought that up because iran's options right [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=965.38s)]
*  now are terrible and that's why i actually don't exclude getting back to some sort of nuclear deal [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=969.22s)]
*  and you know you asked me what i would do in the white house i would still be focused on what sort [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=974.74s)]
*  of deal we could get you can say that's silly and like why is trump still even talking about [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=978.1s)]
*  deals it's nonsense you know the time for deals has passed they missed that window [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=983.0600000000001s)]
*  but the reason you can still talk or think about deals is iran's alternative to deals are terrible [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=987.78s)]
*  its military capabilities are severely weakened we've seen it's firing an awful lot of ballistic [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=993.78s)]
*  missiles most of them have been intercepted at a certain point they'll run out its proxies you know [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=998.8199999999999s)]
*  hezbollah and hamas primarily hezbollah has been decimated by previous israeli military activity [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=1004.42s)]
*  that was you know one of the other things that they used in the past the threat of unleashing [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=1010.5799999999999s)]
*  hezbollah if you mess with us or if you unilaterally attacked like israel they can't [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=1014.66s)]
*  threaten that anymore they could go after like us troops and bases which they've done before [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=1019.3s)]
*  with strikes through proxies but if that brought the us into the conflict which is a real possibility [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=1024.42s)]
*  now that wouldn't be in iran's interest they could go after their neighbors or shipping like they did [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=1030.34s)]
*  you know the first trump administration go after emirate or saudi oil production fuel facilities or [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=1035.7s)]
*  tankers but that would interfere with their better relations with their neighbors and possibly bring [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=1041.7s)]
*  more in so if you're sitting in tiran now and you know i watched this you know in the white [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=1046.5s)]
*  house in 2024 in the two cases where israel struck iran in april and october you know iran fired at [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=1050.8200000000002s)]
*  israel israel responded you know we watched the iranians try to think about their responses then [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=1059.7800000000002s)]
*  and they were they were already bad then and in october after in late october israel responded [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=1064.98s)]
*  took out more iranian air defenses the iranians never responded because they just thought about [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=1071.1399999999999s)]
*  it well they could respond and israel would hit them again it's obviously even worse now after [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=1076.1s)]
*  this last week of intensive bombardment so iran is really in a pickle now you flagged one option [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=1080.58s)]
*  for iran which could be the quote the dash for a bomb it's another option is you know develop [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=1087.3799999999999s)]
*  nuclear weapons possible they might be doing it as we speak we know they had a big stockpile of [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=1092.5s)]
*  each of you that they could use they have centrifuges in fordo and they have centrifuges [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=1097.78s)]
*  elsewhere but you know one can they really succeed in a short amount of time to enrich [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=1102.18s)]
*  uranium to sufficient quantities and weapons grade and even more importantly weaponize it [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=1109.06s)]
*  because as far as we know they didn't have the capacity to to weaponize it so i don't even know [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=1114.18s)]
*  that they can do it but trying could be a mistake as well because if we did get intelligence that [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=1117.94s)]
*  they were using fordo to develop a nuclear weapon that's the one thing that actually could bring [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=1123.62s)]
*  the trump administration i don't think it wants to be involved but trump has said iran can't have a [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=1128.7399999999998s)]
*  nuclear weapon previous presidents said that too and the united states would probably use force to [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=1133.1399999999999s)]
*  stop it so i said all of that is if you're sitting in terran now trying to think all right how do we [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=1136.6599999999999s)]
*  respond to this aggression all of those options are bad which is why i don't exclude that iran [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=1141.2199999999998s)]
*  could come back to the table it knows trump wants a deal it knows trump wants to avoid escalation [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=1148.1s)]
*  maybe do it that way just how much can israel set back the nuclear program on its own i mean there [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=1152.74s)]
*  people often point out that israel does not have the whatever 30 000 pound bombs the bunker busters [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=1158.3400000000001s)]
*  that could destroy fordo but it does have a lot of capabilities and has surprised all observers [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=1163.0600000000002s)]
*  with what it can do yeah no it already has i think significantly set it back we don't know [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=1168.74s)]
*  exactly how much and you're right fordo is the main thing because it's you know deep underground [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=1173.78s)]
*  will probably impenetrable to the israelis and they have advanced centrifuges there [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=1178.82s)]
*  that they could use to enrich but you know as you know that's not the entire process to develop a [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=1182.9799999999998s)]
*  nuclear weapon so we know israel has already set back iran's enrichment program by striking the [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=1188.26s)]
*  pilot enrichment planet natanz and even by denying power seems to have affected the [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=1193.06s)]
*  centrifuges varied in natanz they've hit centrifuge manufacturing capability they've [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=1197.1399999999999s)]
*  hit a lot of the scientists that would be necessary and again even without israeli strikes [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=1202.82s)]
*  there were questions about how long it would take iran to figure out how to weaponize the material [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=1207.7s)]
*  once they had it so i think they've already set back the program a significant amount and that's [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=1212.26s)]
*  why you know fordo becomes the the big outstanding question but i think without that it's still [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=1218.8999999999999s)]
*  there are still very much open questions about whether iran could successfully dash to a bomb [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=1223.46s)]
*  even if it wanted to there have been cases in the past relatively distant past at this point i think [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=1227.94s)]
*  of you know pakistan or or north korea where the u.s did not have a great grasp of the extent of a [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=1233.94s)]
*  nuclear program do you have confidence that we would know if if iran were rushing to break out [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=1240.3400000000001s)]
*  at fordo as well uh no i don't know and obviously another consequence of this is that you know [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=1246.18s)]
*  there aren't going to be i.e. inspectors working in iran iran announced the other day in the wake [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=1251.94s)]
*  of the strikes that it was not going to cooperate with the iaa and share what it's doing in the past [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=1257.3s)]
*  it you know mostly there was a lot of transparency in centrifuge production and uranium enrichment [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=1262.26s)]
*  and now we're flying blind they could have moved nuclear material out like we don't know where the [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=1268.1s)]
*  60 is could have been moved out to other parts of iran if you're iran and you're trying to build a [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=1273.1399999999999s)]
*  nuclear weapon you would ideally want to do that at a place like fordo not just because it's deep [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=1279.3799999999999s)]
*  underground but because you would have a lot of advanced centrifuge cascades to do it with but you [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=1284.18s)]
*  don't have to do it that way if they were preparing for this and had even some older centrifuges and [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=1290.42s)]
*  fewer of them at some other site and iran's a big place you know our intel is amazing and his [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=1297.0600000000002s)]
*  really intelligence amazing but it's a big place so if you could get some of that already enriched [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=1301.7s)]
*  nuclear materials to even a small number of cascades somewhere else in a small place that [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=1306.26s)]
*  we didn't know about you could turn it into weapons grade again still huge for you know how [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=1311.7s)]
*  do you get it from there to the weaponization people can they actually detonate it even if [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=1315.78s)]
*  they could detonate it how would you marry it to a missile or something to use it so i think we're [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=1319.14s)]
*  still a long way from that but that's what they could and would do if they were trying to weaponize [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=1323.6200000000001s)]
*  now the reason the obama administration in 2015 we did the jcpa nuclear deal focused on enrichment [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=1329.6200000000001s)]
*  and fissile material is it's much more observable than weaponization you can see even though i just [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=1336.82s)]
*  said you know you can do small centrifuges if you really want to enrich a large amount of uranium [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=1342.74s)]
*  to weapons grade you want a large number of centrifuges spinning and that's easier to find [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=1347.9399999999998s)]
*  than the things you would do if you were trying to weaponize which could be much more easily [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=1353.62s)]
*  hidden so that's you know to your question about like do we know it's harder to know on the [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=1358.6599999999999s)]
*  weaponization thing could be some university somewhere in some building where people are [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=1363.62s)]
*  working on this which is much harder to see from a satellite than an industrial enrichment plan [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=1367.3799999999999s)]
*  i want to try to pull us back a bit from the immediate crisis and focus on the region more [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=1373.3s)]
*  broadly by going back to a piece you wrote in in february about america's opportunities in the [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=1378.02s)]
*  middle east and the relatively good position that going into the trump administration you argued the [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=1383.4599999999998s)]
*  united states was in to kind of come up with a regional balance and regional order that would [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=1388.6599999999999s)]
*  prevent their recurrence of the kinds of problems that have been one of the perhaps distractions [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=1393.3s)]
*  for u.s foreign policy or thornyest problems for u.s foreign policy for the last couple of decades [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=1397.94s)]
*  a new orondio was one of those opportunities but that was just part of it and i think it's just [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=1402.18s)]
*  worth stressing you're writing this piece a month or so after you'd left government as a senior [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=1406.18s)]
*  member of the white house national security team and as national security advisor to vice president [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=1411.62s)]
*  kamala harris which is to say in some ways this cut against what we might have expected from [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=1416.26s)]
*  someone who'd just been on the losing side of an election against donald trump but you did write [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=1420.42s)]
*  that along with the strategic lands to be inherited trump's unpredictable nature could [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=1424.74s)]
*  give him leverage with iran israel and the gulf states how did you see the regional situation then [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=1429.54s)]
*  or you know put differently why did you see trump is having an opportunity in a region that has you [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=1435.3000000000002s)]
*  know not offered a lot of them over the last the past few decades and and how do you see the regional [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=1439.7s)]
*  situation now both before we started this immediate crisis and as you see it developing [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=1444.26s)]
*  in these past few days yeah no that was there was the very first piece i wrote after leaving [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=1449.46s)]
*  government and it emerged from so as i looked back after four years in the white house working [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=1454.42s)]
*  all these things in a history before that of working in the middle east i sort of tried to [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=1459.78s)]
*  step back and think like where are we now and what are we leaving and it did strike me a bit [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=1463.62s)]
*  to my own surprise because i said at the time i'm not used to writing pieces with the words middle [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=1468.5s)]
*  east and opportunity both in the in the headline because as you say and as i wrote in the piece [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=1474.42s)]
*  president after president has had their moment of hope you know go back to clinton camp david but [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=1480.9s)]
*  bush after the iraq war obama the arab spring there always seems to be a moment where now we [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=1486.1000000000001s)]
*  finally have an opportunity we can make the best of this and alas for a whole bunch of complicated [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=1492.26s)]
*  reasons it usually doesn't work out very well so i was surprised to find myself concluding but you [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=1496.42s)]
*  know just trying to be honest thinking about it like what are we leaving and what is trump inheriting [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=1502.1s)]
*  and it did strike me that he was actually inheriting some real opportunities and and [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=1506.4199999999998s)]
*  you know you might or maybe implied you were surprised to hear that coming from me because [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=1512.1s)]
*  i'm not exactly a huge fan of trump's foreign policy in general but i had to acknowledge that [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=1515.86s)]
*  there was a chance at least that certain particular aspects of trump and his administration might make [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=1520.98s)]
*  it even easier for them to take advantage of these so on the on the strategic opportunity part [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=1526.74s)]
*  trump was inheriting a dramatically changed strategic landscape you know one of the reasons [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=1531.78s)]
*  everything was so hard in the middle east for previous presidents is you had this iran determined [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=1535.86s)]
*  to thwart stability and american aims and it had the means to do so but by the time trump took office [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=1540.74s)]
*  iran was weaker and more vulnerable than it had been since the iranian revolution and i'm not even [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=1546.98s)]
*  talking about the last week of israeli strikes even before that again the decimation especially [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=1551.62s)]
*  of hespala which was always the biggest iranian threat we compromised with iran on the nuclear [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=1557.78s)]
*  thing in 2015 one of the reasons is we didn't want to go to war because a war would unleash [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=1561.86s)]
*  hespala on israel and be a big mess that problem was significantly solved with what israel did to [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=1566.26s)]
*  hespala i mean hamas decimated as well iranian missile capability was another reason we were [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=1573.22s)]
*  really reluctant to you know confront iran too much because they would fire ballistic missiles [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=1578.8999999999999s)]
*  well in april and october we showed that israel together with us could largely defeat them [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=1583.46s)]
*  didn't mean the problem went away but gave you a lot more confidence that you could stand up to [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=1589.8600000000001s)]
*  iran and and not have to worry about that threat so that was an enormous opportunity for that trump [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=1594.02s)]
*  was inheriting and then on top of that you know it so happened that we finally got the gaza hostage [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=1601.14s)]
*  ceasefire deal in the waning days of the administration so after a terrible terrible period in gaza with [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=1606.58s)]
*  options all bad trump was inheriting a ceasefire that he could maybe take advantage of to finally [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=1613.46s)]
*  get that terrible war over the government lebanon changed lebanon you know it was [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=1618.18s)]
*  enormous headaches such terrible government dominated by hespala with hespala's defeat [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=1623.22s)]
*  or at least set back you had a new president new prime minister that you could work with [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=1628.5800000000002s)]
*  and then finally syria you know of all things we expected in the final months of the biden [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=1632.74s)]
*  administration there's so much is going on in the region the rapid fall of assad and replacement [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=1638.02s)]
*  with a government that was at least nominally committed to stability and ethnic integration [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=1643.7s)]
*  was stunning and you know no one wants to be naive or you know syria is always going to be hard but [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=1650.74s)]
*  that certainly counts as an opportunity as well iran and russia had bailed on assad he fell and [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=1656.18s)]
*  there was a lot to work with there so that's that's why i concluded wow you know could really make [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=1662.42s)]
*  something of this and then as i said i even acknowledged that trump might be in a particularly [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=1667.22s)]
*  good position to take advantage of all this even aiming off for you know what i describe you know [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=1672.1000000000001s)]
*  the threats and the history of that deal making and the lack of knowledge about the region and [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=1678.26s)]
*  the lack of process all of that his unpredictability could be an asset in dealing with for example iran [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=1684.02s)]
*  also a great contrast to us he had total control of his party in congress so that whatever he [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=1691.46s)]
*  chose to do he didn't have to worry about the politics like we did and an iran nuclear deal is [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=1697.14s)]
*  a great example of that i mean various reasons we could get into about why president biden never [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=1701.0600000000002s)]
*  managed to resume the nuclear deal that we wanted with iran but one of them was it just congress [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=1706.3400000000001s)]
*  would never have accepted it including democrats but trump could get through congress apparently [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=1711.7s)]
*  you know now he has a republican majority and they do whatever he says he can get through virtually [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=1717.38s)]
*  anything he wants and he even had you know maybe more leverage over israel so he put all that [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=1721.14s)]
*  together and i actually did think that trump was inheriting an unusually positive set of circumstances [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=1726.74s)]
*  in the middle east lingering on the the syria part of that for a moment just fascinated what it was [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=1732.66s)]
*  like for you to witness the sudden fall of of asad sitting where you were last november december [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=1737.8600000000001s)]
*  you'd been i believe in the in the white house and the obama administration is the the senior [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=1742.9s)]
*  middle east person when the civil war was was you know really escalating [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=1748.1s)]
*  did you have any suspicion asad's fall was coming i mean to the extent that it surprised i think [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=1755.3s)]
*  everyone you know people reading classified intelligence and not you know what were we all [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=1761.6999999999998s)]
*  missing that caused that to be such a surprise uh no it's a great question and i will acknowledge [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=1765.86s)]
*  that we didn't see that coming you always you know when you do middle east for a long time you [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=1770.98s)]
*  always have to be prepared for surprises anything can happen usually they're bad surprises rather [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=1774.18s)]
*  than positive surprises this one like i said so much was going on the reason gaza iran iraq the [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=1779.3s)]
*  houthis that we didn't imagine that the biggest news you know in that period could come from [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=1785.7s)]
*  syria you know i said before a regime change you never know regimes can be brittle and they can [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=1794.1000000000001s)]
*  last a long time until they don't you know mubarak people who predicted the mubarak regime in egypt [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=1798.18s)]
*  would fall like we're wrong 29 years in a row before they were right uh you just don't know [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=1803.86s)]
*  and in syria yes i was working on this in the obama white house that was in after the arab [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=1809.4599999999998s)]
*  spring people thought well you know ben ali fell in tunisia qaddafi fell in libya mubarak fell in [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=1814.6599999999999s)]
*  egypt asad will be next and it turned out to be a lot harder than that because he was more deeply [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=1820.6599999999999s)]
*  entrenched he had russian and hisbala and iranian backing and so for all of our efforts to accelerate [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=1824.8999999999999s)]
*  that process of getting rid of him it didn't work and i reached that conclusion fairly early [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=1830.98s)]
*  on in the white house that that was just not going to happen and you know an irony about syria is [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=1834.98s)]
*  sort of that it took many people you know a good decade to finally conclude that asad wasn't going [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=1841.38s)]
*  anywhere like just in time for him to finally fall because if you as you know like even the [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=1847.06s)]
*  regional partners who had been determined to get rid of him were finding the opposition trying to [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=1853.38s)]
*  overthrow him by 2024 we're like look he's there some of them want to you know let him back in the [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=1858.34s)]
*  arab league do trade and business if he's going to be there we might as well work with him and try [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=1864.82s)]
*  to pull him away from iran so people have kind of had given up largely on that goal of getting [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=1868.74s)]
*  rid of asad and then he fell like looking back it's not that surprising it was always unpopular the [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=1876.34s)]
*  opposition was still there and the biggest variables you know when people tried to overthrow him in [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=1882.26s)]
*  2015 russia with actual military force deployed to syria to stop it and hesbola came and fought [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=1887.46s)]
*  with asad in the united states like wanted to push him aside but wasn't prepared to go to war with [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=1894.42s)]
*  russia and iran and his ball to do it this time you know the opposition which turkey was supporting [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=1898.98s)]
*  while everyone else's eye was on some other ball was getting ready to advance and then asad calls [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=1904.3400000000001s)]
*  iran and they're like we got our hands full you know hesbola has already been wiped down and we're [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=1910.26s)]
*  dealing with israel good luck and russia you know all his deployed forces in ukraine and missiles [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=1914.34s)]
*  and airplanes and they weren't going to go to war for asad and guess what like without them he was [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=1920.34s)]
*  done syria was one of the opportunities as you noted that you highlighted in that piece trump on [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=1925.78s)]
*  his first i guess his first major trip as president to the middle east one of the notable parts of [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=1931.6999999999998s)]
*  that trip was his meeting with uh president al-shara of syria and commitment to lifting [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=1937.22s)]
*  sanctions though i haven't fully tracked what's happening with that in congress but [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=1941.54s)]
*  he did at least declare that as a goal did you see that as the right first step and you know as you [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=1945.62s)]
*  kind of look at syria over the coming months and years what will it take to really get it on the [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=1950.42s)]
*  right path and as you look at development so far do you see encouraging signs worrying ones how do [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=1955.3s)]
*  you kind of assess the state of that opportunity now yeah i do think that was the right move though [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=1960.8999999999999s)]
*  as you say and typically with trump you know there are no details he probably doesn't really know what [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=1965.62s)]
*  you know sanctions at which authorities the sanctions are under what kind of sanctions we [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=1970.26s)]
*  have and what it takes to lift them but the political signal of trump saying yeah we want [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=1973.7s)]
*  this guy to succeed and we should work with him i think was right and it's another example again [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=1978.34s)]
*  there's so many things to criticize the trump administration but this willingness to sometimes [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=1983.46s)]
*  do things regardless of what you know critics might say and there were some congressional critics [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=1988.34s)]
*  the people in his own administration didn't want to lift sanctions on syria and even like sit down [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=1993.78s)]
*  with them i think you know it's possible a democratic president might have worried about [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=1998.34s)]
*  sitting down with this you know terrible record on human rights and you know former terrorists and [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=2002.5s)]
*  there i'll say you know trump's willingness to do that i think was right just look let's cut [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=2008.34s)]
*  through all that we want this guy to succeed obviously there are things we need to see from [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=2012.02s)]
*  him in terms of government governance and human rights and minorities but we should do that so i [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=2015.54s)]
*  do think that was the right political signal to send give that regime reason to align with us rather [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=2020.74s)]
*  than with iran or russia as you say still a lot of work to be done the last couple months have [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=2028.1799999999998s)]
*  been a bit disappointing you know al-shara came in surprising people with his willingness to say [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=2034.8999999999999s)]
*  you know multi-ethnic society deal with the kurds not repress minorities even though you know we [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=2041.6999999999998s)]
*  shouldn't forget he was a sort of poster child for islamist extremism at the time and running [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=2047.3799999999999s)]
*  but he was saying and mostly doing the right things which i think made it right for us to [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=2054.02s)]
*  want to support him since then there's been you know again some of his people repressing minorities [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=2059.38s)]
*  doing sort of the depathification mistake that was made in iraq after 2003 so it's a bumpy road but [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=2064.98s)]
*  that was to be expected i still think on balance it remains an opportunity and i don't really [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=2072.2599999999998s)]
*  criticize the way the trump administration has been handling this to the extent that they are [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=2077.22s)]
*  and again i you know make that point that it's hard to do this without an nsc and qualified [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=2080.66s)]
*  people and they've like been changing their middle east team constantly i mean it's hard to really [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=2085.54s)]
*  have a sustained and consistent policy but given that i don't really have a major critique of what [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=2090.5s)]
*  they've done i think you know that's an opportunity that we kind of are following up on in the right [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=2095.94s)]
*  way i'm curious how you saw the the gulf part of that trip and the two things that stuck out were [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=2099.62s)]
*  first this speech that trump gave on you know no longer giving countries lectures how to live in [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=2105.94s)]
*  the country that had was responsible for killing jamal kashoggi and you know lots of other lots [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=2111.7000000000003s)]
*  of other things that go against a democratic liberal democratic values at least and then of [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=2116.18s)]
*  course the kind of big ai deals which you know i know i think people have different views on these [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=2121.3s)]
*  but it was just striking that you're kind of handing you know people say data is the new oil [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=2127.7000000000003s)]
*  the gulf is going to control the new oil just to control the old oil and i wonder if that'll be a [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=2132.66s)]
*  long-term cost for us as you as you saw that part of the trip did you see upside their opportunity [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=2137.22s)]
*  or or do you worry about the long-term consequences of both of those both i mean there's many things [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=2142.3399999999997s)]
*  there are upsides and then you also worry about the long-term consequences look i get the strategic [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=2147.22s)]
*  case for investing in the region and having the ai partnerships and data centers and keeping them [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=2152.4199999999996s)]
*  in our orbit and you know we in the biden administration tried to strike that balance too [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=2158.98s)]
*  and also made arrangements to work with those countries on ai and chips and data so it's not [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=2163.54s)]
*  as if that was a real departure at the same time you know the biden administration was focused on [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=2168.98s)]
*  making sure that the most advanced chips or ai models couldn't slip into the hands of china [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=2173.7s)]
*  but the goal is the same keep these countries that are really well placed to do ai i mean for [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=2181.78s)]
*  to do ai and data centers you know you need land you need a bunch of energy you need a bunch of [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=2186.66s)]
*  capital and you need a political commitment to do it there aren't a whole lot of countries in the [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=2191.7799999999997s)]
*  world ready to do that so i think the you know the bet on keeping them in our ecosystem and not [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=2195.7s)]
*  china's was the same trump pushed it even further and they have yet to come up or explain what they [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=2202.8999999999996s)]
*  plan to do to ensure that the technology doesn't get in china's hands so they're it's like tbd [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=2209.46s)]
*  the basic principle of investing and working in these countries is a good one but you know now we [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=2215.94s)]
*  need to see the specific details of the arrangements about how to do that again going back to my [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=2220.5s)]
*  process point i you know in the biden administration i can't tell you many meetings [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=2225.06s)]
*  were in the situation room with the national security advisor and the commerce secretary and [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=2228.18s)]
*  the defense secretary and and the technology teams really trying to figure out the way to do this [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=2232.82s)]
*  i don't get the impression that the trump administration is focused on that which means [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=2238.34s)]
*  the other part of my thing like do you also worry even as you support it [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=2242.98s)]
*  yes i worry about their ability to get that right what about the speech that trump gave the no more [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=2246.98s)]
*  lectures how to live i mean that is you know unexpected from him that's always been his [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=2252.42s)]
*  view and that's why a lot of our partners in the gulf are happy with him they don't get the lectures [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=2257.46s)]
*  on human rights and democracy that they used to get from previous presidents he's entirely [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=2261.46s)]
*  comfortable with the oil industry he's entirely comfortable with you know families being involved [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=2266.1s)]
*  in business so that was consistent what's not consistent is marrying that with the very [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=2271.06s)]
*  lectures that they keep making in europe about how to live so it was odd so trump gives that speech [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=2277.46s)]
*  and and by the way another part of that speech you're focusing like on the values intervention [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=2283.62s)]
*  part but another part of it was we don't get dragged into wars in the middle east and that's [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=2287.62s)]
*  you know put a pin in that as we deploy massive military forces into the middle east for possible [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=2293.46s)]
*  use in a conflict so that's the other part of that speech and traditional trump foreign policy to [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=2300.42s)]
*  to focus on and you know we haven't really talked about it but i think trump has always been divided [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=2306.66s)]
*  between his america first don't get involved in foreign wars instincts which are represented [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=2311.38s)]
*  manifestly in this administration by some of his top people who served in iraq it turns against it [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=2316.34s)]
*  begseth you know waltz gabard but then the other part of trump which is you know world leader [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=2320.7400000000002s)]
*  we're the strongest country in the world don't mess with us sometimes those two things are [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=2327.06s)]
*  intention there's certainly intention right now that's why you know he's clearly struggling [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=2330.9s)]
*  what to do in iran israel because you can't do both you find if you want to be the great power [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=2334.58s)]
*  and dictate who has nuclear weapons and who's ruling different countries but it's hard to do [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=2339.3s)]
*  that while also staying out of costly engagements in the region fascinating to see that play out [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=2345.38s)]
*  but you know to go back to the point i was making about inconsistency so in the middle east trump [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=2350.66s)]
*  makes a speech you know we don't tell you what to do you live lives the way you want hegseth goes [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=2356.18s)]
*  to singapore makes a similar speech national sovereignty we're not lecturing you or imposing [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=2360.8999999999996s)]
*  our views but then vance goes to europe and basically says you know we're looking for [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=2365.62s)]
*  civilizational allies and you're interfering with our cultural relations and we don't like the way [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=2370.66s)]
*  you practice free speech and we support and you know vance and trump and musk supporting you know [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=2375.94s)]
*  extremist parties in germany and having close relations with the autocrats in hungary there [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=2382.02s)]
*  they somehow seem really interested in the way people live and values and so on so that's a [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=2389.94s)]
*  another big inconsistency at the heart of the trump administration we'll be back after a short break [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=2395.3s)]
*  And now back to my conversation with phil gordon you talked earlier about the the moral hazard at [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=2400.82s)]
*  the heart of the u.s israel relationship and this kind of question of u.s leverage over israel has [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=2409.46s)]
*  been a really problematic one for american policy over the last uh certainly since the war on gaza [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=2414.5800000000004s)]
*  started but also going back long before that you know i think you've said that the u.s did too little [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=2420.9s)]
*  to press israel on humanitarian assistance and limiting civilian casualties but just to i mean [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=2427.62s)]
*  you look at that question of leverage a little bit more generally why has that been so challenging [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=2432.82s)]
*  i think people who have not worked on this in government look at and say this shouldn't be [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=2437.22s)]
*  that hard given the amount of support the u.s gives israel i think the iranian foreign minister [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=2441.7799999999997s)]
*  even said that a couple days ago when he said you know trump can make one phone call and end this if [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=2446.1s)]
*  he wants to what is more challenging about that than than people appreciate and as you look back [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=2450.74s)]
*  on american policy at least during the biden administration since october 7th are there [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=2455.62s)]
*  moments where you thought the u.s had more ability to shape israeli action that if you know you go [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=2460.58s)]
*  back and run it again you would you would handle somewhat differently yeah i mean you say what is [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=2465.7799999999997s)]
*  more challenging about that than people think everything it's really challenging and you know [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=2470.58s)]
*  we had criticism from both ends of that i think it's just simply not true that trump could pick [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=2475.94s)]
*  up the phone make a call people said the same not biden like the war ends it's not that [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=2480.42s)]
*  simple if trump wanted to have a major and massive confrontation with israel and cut off arms and [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=2485.62s)]
*  leave israel alone in its confrontation with iran uh no doubt that would influence the israeli [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=2491.62s)]
*  thinking how much i don't know maybe it would still run the risk of doing this and like dare trump not [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=2498.74s)]
*  to defend them as ballistic missiles are raining down and you have a huge domestic debate congress [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=2503.94s)]
*  gets involved you're seen as responsible for abandoning israel and you know that's the moral [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=2508.8199999999997s)]
*  hazard piece that i was talking about before so it's not at all easy the strategic piece is hard [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=2514.82s)]
*  too and you know this is what biden administration confronted in gaza because it's a legitimate [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=2520.7400000000002s)]
*  point on the arms support right political support is one thing but we provide a lot of israel a lot [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=2525.7000000000003s)]
*  of weapons and people usually point to that as the leverage that we had fair enough and there's some [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=2530.5s)]
*  leverage in that but then you have to be willing to live with the consequences of your decisions [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=2537.1400000000003s)]
*  and the problem was you know israel was doing things in gaza that we didn't want them to do [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=2541.78s)]
*  but cutting off weapons when they faced genuine and actual threats from hezbollah and these were not [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=2547.94s)]
*  an iran and the houthis these were not hypotheticals iran was firing ballistic missiles [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=2553.0600000000004s)]
*  at israel you know fueling them loading them up and to say in that moment you got houthis hezbollah [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=2558.6600000000003s)]
*  and iran like determined to really go after israel to say well to get you to change your policy in [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=2564.6600000000003s)]
*  gaza we're going to cut off the weapons you'd have to then accept that israel would be vulnerable [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=2570.82s)]
*  to all of these missile threats raining down on tel aviv and elsewhere and you could say oh no [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=2575.38s)]
*  but just make the threat and then israel would comply in gaza and you don't have to worry about [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=2581.06s)]
*  it then you can keep supporting them maybe but what if israel which was traumatized by october 7 [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=2584.82s)]
*  and saw its national interests at stake and has a lot of weapons in its own said respectfully we're [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=2590.82s)]
*  just doing this anyway and then the iranian missiles start to fly so that's why it's not [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=2595.46s)]
*  easy now you can still come down and say gaza is so important and what israel was doing there [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=2599.86s)]
*  is so objectionable let's just do it anyway we cut them off and we see what happens but don't [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=2604.82s)]
*  pretend that you wouldn't have to face real consequences of that decision you also asked [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=2609.7000000000003s)]
*  about you know looking back you said i've i've said that we didn't succeed in getting israel [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=2616.34s)]
*  to do enough i think that's like obvious i mean you can have the policy debate about what else [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=2621.7000000000003s)]
*  we might have done but results wise it was a humanitarian catastrophe and we pushed all along [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=2627.14s)]
*  for israel to do more to do better on civilian casualties and allow humanitarian assistance in [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=2635.14s)]
*  and i would note that it had an impact you know the overall result was catastrophic and terrible [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=2639.3799999999997s)]
*  but the u.s made a difference and you know i think it's worth comparison by the administration of the [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=2646.9s)]
*  trump administration at the beginning of the conflict in october 2023 israeli defense minister [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=2651.94s)]
*  said that's it you know no food no water no fuel we're cutting them off and we said no like you [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=2658.5s)]
*  can't do that we understand you have to respond militarily you're going to go in but you have to [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=2665.62s)]
*  provide humanitarian assistance and then all along israel ended up permitting significant amounts [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=2670.26s)]
*  including hundreds of millions of dollars worth of united states and a million tons of aid [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=2676.18s)]
*  that saved a lot of lives now again was it nearly enough no it wasn't and i'll only be able to look [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=2680.58s)]
*  back with regret on the situation in gaza which is an unspeakable tragedy but did it make a [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=2687.14s)]
*  difference yes and is it different from the trump administration which then came in and gave israel [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=2691.94s)]
*  a green light to do the very things that we said no to two years before and then israel did impose [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=2696.58s)]
*  you know it broke the ceasefire that trump had inherited started using military force again [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=2702.9s)]
*  started implementing and talking about occupation smashing buildings did it in complete blockade for [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=2707.7s)]
*  over two months of no food and fuel at all and just made clear that that was you know almost a [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=2713.62s)]
*  case of collective punishment until amos would give in that's a real difference so no biden [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=2719.3799999999997s)]
*  didn't manage to do nearly enough but you see the difference with what trump has done [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=2725.54s)]
*  i mean it strikes me that there was so much focus on ceasefire negotiations [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=2730.98s)]
*  and that's incredibly complex there are multiple parties involved the the humanitarian piece was [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=2734.82s)]
*  always a bit more you know was more perplexing and why you didn't have you know samantha power [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=2740.82s)]
*  just kind of standing on the outside of gaza saying we're going to wave through trucks and [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=2745.46s)]
*  you know instead you had the kind of embarrassing spectacle of the pier that didn't work just seemed [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=2749.7000000000003s)]
*  like a bigger policy failure than the than the ceasefire which got so much attention look as i [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=2754.82s)]
*  said it was a policy failure you can't conclude anything else not enough food and humanitarian [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=2759.94s)]
*  assistance got to people i mean we actually did have samantha power leading on them all the time [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=2765.3s)]
*  as well as everybody else yeah and we can you know look back and try to see what else we might have [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=2770.18s)]
*  done i i i think we should have done more because it was even an israel strategic interest to allow [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=2775.7000000000003s)]
*  in more and the pier i don't know people mock the pier and yes it's pathetic that we had to resort [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=2782.18s)]
*  to a pier when there were land crossings that could have been open and that's enormous frustration [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=2787.22s)]
*  and and highly unfortunate but that doesn't mean you don't do the pier and you know as we were [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=2792.3399999999997s)]
*  briefed pier is costly doesn't get nearly enough same with air drops nowhere near what you can get [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=2796.98s)]
*  in in trucks but i think the view you know the people are on the table was if it can feed some [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=2802.58s)]
*  people then let's just do it you know while we work on the other things so i don't really [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=2808.3399999999997s)]
*  accept you know all the critiques of the air drops and the pier [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=2813.3799999999997s)]
*  and again it's like embarrassingly pathetic because it's nowhere near enough but you're [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=2817.2999999999997s)]
*  going to really argue that we shouldn't get the additional stuff in but yes i mean to your other [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=2820.8999999999996s)]
*  point i think we as much as we did and tried to do could and should have done more because the [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=2824.9799999999996s)]
*  situation and the outcome in gaza was unacceptable and is even more unacceptable now as you assess [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=2831.2999999999997s)]
*  israeli objectives in gaza now obviously the the ceasefire that you could focus on in the [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=2839.3s)]
*  february piece is long gone and things continue to be incredibly grim and awful on the ground in gaza [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=2845.0600000000004s)]
*  as you look at israeli objectives though i mean do you kind of go to the what looks like the kind [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=2851.7000000000003s)]
*  of bockham's razor assessment of this which is that they're aiming for reoccupation of at least [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=2857.3s)]
*  part of gaza forcing at least some palestinians to leave i mean how do you read those those [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=2862.82s)]
*  objectives well one point is you know there are different israelis with different objectives [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=2867.14s)]
*  and certainly there are those in israel who want to conquer the whole place drive all palestinians [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=2871.94s)]
*  out and occupy that was like completely fantastical under the biden administration you know i think [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=2875.7799999999997s)]
*  they couldn't have imagined we'd ever go along with that but trump has kind of endorsed it and [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=2881.46s)]
*  even led the way saying you know they should the palestinians should leave and we'll rebuild the [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=2885.06s)]
*  place so that's unfortunate because it is actually giving hope to those who want to to decimate [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=2889.22s)]
*  the place i also think israel you know aside from the nuances or differences among the israelis [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=2895.1400000000003s)]
*  has an unattainable strategy and that's been the problem from the start they for understandable [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=2900.82s)]
*  reasons that we share want to get rid of hamas and make sure hamas has no part in governance [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=2906.98s)]
*  understandable how could you expect them to live with that after you know what hamas did but at the [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=2911.38s)]
*  same time they refuse to accept for example any role for the palestinian authority which you know [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=2917.1400000000003s)]
*  as flawed and corrupt and ineffective as it is exists has trained security forces recognizes [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=2922.66s)]
*  israel works with israeli security forces so if you're without hamas and you rule out any [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=2928.8199999999997s)]
*  thing related to the pa who's going to run gaza then you actually do either have to occupy it [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=2934.66s)]
*  israeli forces run the place or you have to chase out you know two million palestinians or kill them [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=2940.5s)]
*  and those last two options you know are are totally unacceptable so that's the problem and [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=2945.7799999999997s)]
*  one reason this has gone on so far is that israel has unattainable objectives had the objective [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=2951.3s)]
*  been to decimate hamas or at least get it to the point where it couldn't rule gaza and then to work [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=2957.86s)]
*  and genuinely find palestinians who could take on governance as a security may be backed by arabs [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=2963.3s)]
*  that's you know still hard but at least it's realistic but now you know given the way israel [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=2969.3s)]
*  has constructed this they're leaving themselves only the option of you know of displacement of [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=2974.98s)]
*  people in israeli occupation which is a terrible outcome and you see this now is you know going [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=2980.26s)]
*  back to the humanitarian point by not working with any of the un agencies or ngos and setting [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=2985.3s)]
*  up this foundation you know it's been a complete catastrophe and until they accept a more realistic [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=2990.5s)]
*  goal for the future of gaza that's what we're going to be living with and again the trump [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=2996.98s)]
*  administration has given them a complete pass trump has shown himself willing to stand up to israel on [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=2999.94s)]
*  a lot of other things you know pursuing a nuclear deal that iran didn't like talking directly [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=3005.2200000000003s)]
*  to hamas about at least an american hostage ending a ceasefire with the houthis without a pledge that [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=3010.18s)]
*  the houthis wouldn't attack israel sitting down with the syrian new leadership that israel is [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=3016.18s)]
*  bombing as we speak i mean trump has hardly shied away from telling israel when we have a difference [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=3021.62s)]
*  but on the question of gaza he just like yeah do whatever you want and the result of that has been [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=3028.4199999999996s)]
*  catastrophic do you worry about various west bank scenarios which could involve re-annexation could [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=3032.66s)]
*  involve the collapse of the pa yes that's the thing you know there's so much going on even like [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=3037.94s)]
*  the gaza thing you know people were rightly focused on you know all these people trying to [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=3043.06s)]
*  get food and being killed and now you know we only have so much bandwidth to be talking about [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=3047.3s)]
*  these things and already gaza was overshadowing the west bank and then you know now and then the [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=3051.86s)]
*  houthis was overshadowing gaza and now iran israel is overshadowing everything but it's overshadowing [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=3056.02s)]
*  like i said you know people are being killed in iran and israel right now it's terrible but i think [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=3061.2200000000003s)]
*  45 palestinians were killed yesterday just trying to get food i mean it's a horrific [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=3065.54s)]
*  horrific situation that is not getting the attention it deserves and the west bank [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=3071.7799999999997s)]
*  similarly and there again i you know the trump administration deserves some of the blame israel's [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=3076.82s)]
*  take advantage of this situation to expand settlements you know almost unconstrained [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=3083.3s)]
*  trump lifted the penalties and sanctions that the biden administration had put on settlers for [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=3089.7s)]
*  extremist activities now you can say that wasn't enough and i think we should have done more [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=3094.9s)]
*  to curb settlement expansions and settler violence even under the biden administration but [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=3100.26s)]
*  at least there was that trump has basically said he's got an ambassador to israel that [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=3105.06s)]
*  publicly says he doesn't believe in the two-state solution and sees the west bank as part of israel [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=3110.98s)]
*  so yeah there's plenty to worry about in the west bank and israel has a lot going back to [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=3118.02s)]
*  the very place we started the regime change and now can go wrong israel's got a lot on its plate [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=3124.66s)]
*  right now you know only so many munitions and you know you can't exclude another uprising in [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=3129.46s)]
*  tafada in the west bank on top of what's going on in gaza you get the houthis still attacking in iran [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=3135.7s)]
*  so you know all of that calls for real diplomatic efforts to try to bring some of these things to [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=3141.14s)]
*  a close rather than to escalate them i'm struck by how often i hear from the people in the region [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=3147.62s)]
*  and people spend a lot of time there about the the potential instability of the of jordan of [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=3153.54s)]
*  the jordanian government is that an acute acute worry as these dynamics in the west bank and gaza [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=3159.06s)]
*  get worse and worse yeah i mean you know it's funny you use the word acute this is kind of [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=3165.22s)]
*  what i'm getting you only have so many only so many things get to be acute right it's not as acute as [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=3169.7799999999997s)]
*  iran israel right now or even the houthis or gaza or maybe even the west bank but if those things [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=3175.3s)]
*  were in a normal place it would be acute and it also you know just as i said about you know mubarak [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=3180.9s)]
*  people were predicting egyptian instability and following of art for ages and it it didn't happen [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=3186.6600000000003s)]
*  for decades until it did it's easy to say we've heard that all before and you know it's okay but [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=3190.7400000000002s)]
*  sure with i mean fortunately now some of the syrians may be able to go back to syria but [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=3197.14s)]
*  you know you get a million displaced syrians pouring into jordan with no jobs and raising [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=3201.2200000000003s)]
*  ethnic tensions and then palestinian spillover from the west bank and or gaza you know it's [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=3207.14s)]
*  a rough neighborhood and and sure there's pressure on jordan the united states has [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=3212.5s)]
*  normally long been a strong supporter of jordan providing military and economic assistance [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=3216.58s)]
*  i think there's some question about that going forward in the trump administration which is [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=3221.8599999999997s)]
*  cutting you know aid generally so you know it may not be as acute as most of the other things we've [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=3225.3799999999997s)]
*  talked about but yes it's one more thing that could easily go on in the middle east without [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=3233.06s)]
*  appropriate attention and resources as you think about u.s policy towards israel and future [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=3237.06s)]
*  administrations in which you know you may may serve or not do you see it as time to move beyond [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=3243.2999999999997s)]
*  the two-state solution and diplomacy around it as the right move for u.s policy and you know if so [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=3248.66s)]
*  what would it mean what would the new paradigm look like yeah now that's a really tough question [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=3253.7799999999997s)]
*  because i am realistic enough to acknowledge that it's hard to see a two-state solution anytime [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=3258.34s)]
*  soon it's just unrealistic with the degree to which settlements have expanded israeli public [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=3264.58s)]
*  attitudes about it the lack of an agreed and unified you know moderate palestinian governance [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=3269.54s)]
*  that could be the head of the palestinian state so it's a bit silly right now to talk about a [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=3275.78s)]
*  two-state solution on the other hand like it still remains the question what's the alternative [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=3280.82s)]
*  it's not credible or realistic to me to imagine you know one israel in which [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=3286.74s)]
*  arabs and jews you know work hand in hand and nobody pays attention to ethnicity eventually [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=3291.14s)]
*  that would be a palestinian majority so like couldn't be democracy and then you have a minority [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=3297.94s)]
*  of jews ruling over a majority of arabs so i still think you know ultimately we're going to have to [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=3302.4199999999996s)]
*  get some version of that but i'm not naive enough to like sit here today and tell you that that's [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=3307.3799999999997s)]
*  any realistic near-term goal even in the obama administration when i was doing middle east [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=3313.3s)]
*  and it was it was already pretty you know incredible a bit of a stretch then you remember [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=3319.2200000000003s)]
*  secretary carry went to congress and said i think he said like we have 17 months before the window [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=3324.02s)]
*  of close i don't know the math behind the 17 months but what he was getting at is you know [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=3328.7400000000002s)]
*  his settlements expand and attitudes change we have an opportunity we should get this done now [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=3333.46s)]
*  or it's only going to be worse now he's certainly right about that about you know only being worse [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=3338.34s)]
*  10 years later for a ton of reasons but we used to talk with other officials then [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=3341.94s)]
*  we could still then at least credibly say that there's a peace process and we're trying to [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=3346.5s)]
*  deliver to states and we would say to each other what would we do and say if it like ever got to [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=3350.26s)]
*  the point where that was just like laughable and you couldn't say it with a straight face like we [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=3355.2200000000003s)]
*  might be there now but i still don't know what the realistic alternative is looking ahead to [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=3360.5s)]
*  the democratic primary that's going to start presumably you know the minute polls close in [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=3366.9s)]
*  the 2026 midterms or possibly even before that given where things are i just imagine that both [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=3371.3s)]
*  gaza and this set of questions is going to be a really explosive one in those debates a bit like [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=3376.82s)]
*  iraq in 2007 and eight for sure it was already deeply divisive during the last presidential [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=3382.9s)]
*  election obviously with vice president harris who then became a candidate i was caught in the middle [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=3388.5800000000004s)]
*  all of that and caught in the middle in the sense that you really couldn't [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=3393.62s)]
*  bridge the gap between the two sides which would deeply deeply dug in there wasn't a ton of space [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=3397.38s)]
*  between them you know as you know vice president harris took a view which you know was basically [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=3403.2200000000003s)]
*  a genuine view that you shouldn't have to choose that israel had the right to self-defense and we [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=3408.7400000000002s)]
*  should always be there to make sure israel had what it needed to defend itself and at the same [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=3414.5s)]
*  time the situation in gaza was unconscionable and there needed to be greater and more effective [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=3419.3s)]
*  efforts on civilian casualties and humanitarian assistance and there should eventually be a [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=3424.5800000000004s)]
*  palestinian state with dignity and security for both sides that was genuinely a belief that's [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=3428.6600000000003s)]
*  kind of the line we took in the campaign and yet the party was still deeply divided between those [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=3433.1400000000003s)]
*  who were suspicious and didn't think we were committed enough to israel and those who were [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=3438.82s)]
*  furious that we weren't doing more to improve the situation in gaza and i fear as you suggest [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=3442.82s)]
*  we're gonna rerun that debate maybe even in more severe form because as bad as it was then if this [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=3449.38s)]
*  like goes on and is still going on then and israel is even more pursuing displacement and occupation [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=3455.1400000000003s)]
*  the trump administration is giving it a green light you could see a real debate within the party [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=3460.98s)]
*  about how to handle that situation in the hope of allowing us to end on a somewhat more uplifting [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=3465.7000000000003s)]
*  note or at least what for what qualifies as uplifting now you wrote a piece that i find [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=3471.62s)]
*  really interesting in the financial times calling on policymakers to really learn from trump's [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=3477.54s)]
*  willingness to challenge conventional wisdom and political obstacles you alluded to some of this [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=3481.94s)]
*  earlier beyond the middle east do you see other areas where u.s foreign policy could benefit from [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=3487.14s)]
*  a little bit more of that spirit a little more of that willingness yeah i think the rule generally [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=3492.98s)]
*  applies i mean i wrote that about the middle east because trump had just come from the middle east [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=3497.62s)]
*  and had just done a series of things that seemed like politically controversial and that we weren't [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=3501.46s)]
*  able to do you know in some cases to my frustration and then he did and he got away with it so to [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=3506.7400000000002s)]
*  speak so i think you know i'm really applauding not even necessarily the specifics of those things [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=3511.86s)]
*  but more the style and attitude of just saying like here's what i think and here's what i'm [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=3519.7s)]
*  going to do and i realize there'll be critics but too bad and that's where i think you know [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=3525.14s)]
*  i'm sort of implicitly critical of previous democratic presidents i think people give you [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=3531.7799999999997s)]
*  credit for just authenticity and strength and if you look like you're uncertain and you're doing [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=3536.9s)]
*  it for political reasons then they sense that and hold it against you and like all of these things [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=3543.46s)]
*  are hard and controversial so you're just going to have opponents but i think taking a clear and [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=3548.8199999999997s)]
*  strong and i would say in our case principled stand i want to be clear that i would recommend [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=3554.5s)]
*  for democratic leaders different things to take a stand on than some of those trump did or would [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=3559.3s)]
*  like you know taking a plane from cutter i would not recommend high levels of corruption to [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=3564.74s)]
*  democratic leaders but you know even just standing by and defending what you're doing i think people [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=3569.06s)]
*  appreciate that strength obvious caveat is trump controls his party in the way that democratic [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=3574.18s)]
*  leaders don't so you know could have done that one of the things i gave trump credit for is like [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=3579.7s)]
*  doing the nuclear deal even though it was controversial and like the israelis didn't [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=3585.54s)]
*  want him to pursue it but if you just say look we're doing this now it would have been harder [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=3589.22s)]
*  for biden to do that because even within his own party there would have been criticism and yet i [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=3593.54s)]
*  would still recommend just saying look this is the right thing to do and we're doing it and like [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=3597.22s)]
*  defying your your critics to oppose you i think that style as much as in any particular policy [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=3601.8599999999997s)]
*  issue has a lot to be said for it phil thank you so much for doing this today and i will say [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAHTpNzs9sg&t=3608.66s)]
