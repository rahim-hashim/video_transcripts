Video Description: In just a few short years, the United States’ China policy has undergone nothing short of a revolution. Few people have been more central to that shift than Matt Pottinger. He was a reporter in China for Reuters and The Wall Street Journal, then a U.S. Marine, deploying to Iraq and Afghanistan. He went on to become the top policymaker on Asia and the deputy national security adviser in the Trump administration. 
Pottinger argues in a new essay for Foreign Affairs that even though Washington’s China strategy has already gotten much tougher, it still has a ways to go—to take on more risk and lay out a clear, if radical, goal for the kind of China the United States wants to see. His views are a window into what China policy might look like if Donald Trump returns to the White House.

# Matt Pottinger: Searching for an Endgame With China | Foreign Affairs Interview
**Foreign Affairs:** [July 11, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw)
*  I'm Dan Kurtz-Faelin, and this is the Foreign Affairs Interview. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=0.0s)]
*  We think that you have to aim at victory, just like Beijing is aiming at victory. Xi Jinping [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=6.0s)]
*  is not aiming for a stalemate. He's aiming for something much more than that. And we need to do [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=10.64s)]
*  the same. In just a few short years, America's China policy has undergone nothing short of a [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=15.52s)]
*  revolution. Few people had been more central to that shift than Matt Pottinger. He was a reporter [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=22.48s)]
*  in China, then a U.S. Marine, and then he went on to become the top policymaker in Asia and the [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=28.0s)]
*  deputy national security adviser under President Trump. Pottinger argues in a new essay for Foreign [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=33.76s)]
*  Affairs that, even though Washington's China strategy has already gotten much tougher, it still [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=38.72s)]
*  has a ways to go. To take on more risk and lay out a clear, if radical, goal for the kind of China we [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=44.16s)]
*  want to see. His views are a window on what China policy might look like if Trump returns to the [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=50.16s)]
*  White House. Matt, thanks so much for the widely read and fervently debated essay that you co-authored [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=55.36s)]
*  with Congressman Mike Gallagher for our May-June issue. It was called No Substitute for Victory, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=65.6s)]
*  and thanks as well for joining me today. Thanks for having me. I want to start by stepping back [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=70.8s)]
*  a bit. This is not a moment in American political history where we see bipartisan convergence on [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=75.92s)]
*  almost any issue, but as I think becomes clear in interesting ways, there's a high level of [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=82.96s)]
*  certain consensus about the challenge from China. We're arguing about what to do about it, but there [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=87.36s)]
*  is, I think, a view of what the threat is, what the challenge is that is quite different from [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=91.44s)]
*  what it might have been 10 years ago. How would you describe that consensus, and to the extent that [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=96.55999999999999s)]
*  there is a kind of new paradigm in U.S. foreign policy, what does that look like? Yeah, I think [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=101.36s)]
*  there is a new consensus. I think most Americans agree, and also a lot of national security [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=106.0s)]
*  practitioners or former practitioners would agree, that Beijing is posing a severe challenge [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=112.24s)]
*  to American national security and prosperity, and even to our democracy increasingly. If you look at [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=119.36s)]
*  the interview, I think it was in April, that Secretary of State Tony Blinken gave an interview [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=125.75999999999999s)]
*  to CNN where he said Beijing is now crossing the threshold into what looks to be real interference [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=129.6s)]
*  in our democracy. And I don't think there are too many holdouts left that don't think that [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=137.52s)]
*  Beijing isn't the greatest national security challenge we face. In part, it's because Beijing [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=143.36s)]
*  is now so closely tied to the other adversaries that are challenging the U.S. and our allies, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=148.72s)]
*  Russia, Iran, Iran's proxies like Hamas. Beijing hosted a high-level delegation from the terrorist [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=155.76000000000002s)]
*  group Hamas on the same day in April that Secretary of State Tony Blinken was in Beijing. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=163.12s)]
*  They didn't bother to inform him that their next meetings were going to be with Hamas after he was [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=168.64000000000001s)]
*  about to leave town. So there is, as you put it, an agreement on the existence of a threat. There is [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=176.0s)]
*  less agreement on the precise nature and modalities, and still less agreement on what we [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=184.16s)]
*  should do about it. But the first step has been achieved, and that's a remarkable achievement. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=191.44s)]
*  I credit President Trump and his administration for really leading that shift, but I also credit [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=196.4s)]
*  President Biden and his team for embracing that consensus and sustaining several aspects of the [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=201.92s)]
*  Trump administration policy and in some cases improving upon it, particularly when it comes to [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=209.36s)]
*  export controls on Beijing's high technology. So in the essay, you get into some of those [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=214.4s)]
*  continuities, also some of the divergences where you see differences or tensions between [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=220.64s)]
*  either your preferred approach or the Trump approach and what Biden has done. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=226.0s)]
*  I'd say one of the core critiques that you make is about this idea of managing the competition. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=229.83999999999997s)]
*  The overarching idea of the piece is that, as you and Mike Gallagher put it, [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=235.83999999999997s)]
*  according to you here, the United States shouldn't manage competition with China. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=240.95999999999998s)]
*  It should win it. When you look at that question of management, I think there are a number of [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=244.16s)]
*  responses you can make to it. I think some of the Biden administration voices would point to [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=248.32s)]
*  fentanyl tox or AI tox as something the US has gotten out of that, but I think there are two [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=253.35999999999999s)]
*  that come through most clearly. The first one is about this idea of buying us time. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=258.71999999999997s)]
*  Rush Doshi made this point in his response to you and Mike. He says that your approach, [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=263.12s)]
*  risks runaway escalation and could force a moment of reckoning before the United States has taken [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=269.36s)]
*  the very steps the authors recommend to strengthen its defense industrial base [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=274.32s)]
*  and improve its competitive position. I think Neil Ferguson, who's written about [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=278.64s)]
*  detente and Kissinger and is generally considered a hardliner on these questions, [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=282.8s)]
*  also says about detente that this is a way of tactically stalling in order to shore up our [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=287.44s)]
*  position. It's not a permanent state. Do you see anything to that buying time argument and [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=292.71999999999997s)]
*  engaging in diplomacy as a means of giving the US space and time to develop the tools that it needs? [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=297.84s)]
*  I appreciated Rush Doshi's critique of our piece. I think it was the most substantive of the [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=304.8s)]
*  critiques that I've read in various places so far. I would remark before I talk about that idea of [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=310.48s)]
*  buying time and managing competition, I would remind listeners that Mike Gallagher and I, [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=316.56s)]
*  in our piece, spent quite a lot of time talking about things that we think President Biden's [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=322.56s)]
*  policies doing well. Now, the problem that Mike and I point out that you just teed up is that we [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=327.68s)]
*  don't think that aiming as, in essence, at the end state of managing competition is a sufficient [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=335.2s)]
*  or wise policy that has a good chance of succeeding. We think that you have to aim at victory, [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=343.44s)]
*  just like Beijing is aiming at victory. As Mike and I write, Xi Jinping is not aiming for a stalemate. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=349.84000000000003s)]
*  He's aiming for something much more than that, and we need to do the same. Part of competing to win [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=355.36s)]
*  involves elements of management. We're not saying that we don't try to maintain high channels of [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=362.24s)]
*  communication with Beijing. We've been explicit ever since I was in office, and even through that [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=368.56s)]
*  piece, we're strongly in favor of the idea of the President of the United States maintaining a [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=373.76s)]
*  frequent open channel of communication with Xi Jinping. We think, in fact, it's the only channel [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=378.24s)]
*  that really matters because anything below the level of Xi Jinping is mostly on transmit and not [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=383.68s)]
*  on receive. The Chinese Communist Party officials who show up are under immense pressure to make [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=390.8s)]
*  points, and they also don't have much of an audience at the top of the Chinese government to [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=396.64s)]
*  listen to and transmit our points. The only way to really get a reliable message transmitted to Xi [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=402.16s)]
*  Jinping is to talk to Xi Jinping. This idea of buying time, if we go back and we look at [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=408.16s)]
*  the U.S. policy during the 1970s, where there was a similar rationale that was operating. Remember, [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=415.76000000000005s)]
*  we had just suffered a defeat in Vietnam. You had the Watergate scandal was playing out. The U.S. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=422.16s)]
*  public opinion was very much divided. You had the culture wars. You had anti-war protests. You had [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=430.08000000000004s)]
*  all the stuff from the 60s that tumbled into the 70s and really were demoralizing a big part of [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=435.76s)]
*  the American body politic. There was this thought that we should probably tone down [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=442.32s)]
*  our competitive instincts vis-a-vis the Soviet Union in order to buy time, lick our wounds, [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=448.56s)]
*  sort of figure things out. But what really took shape was something that did not allow us to buy [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=454.4s)]
*  time and gather strength, but in fact put us in a relatively worse position over the course of [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=461.04s)]
*  the 1970s as the Nixon administration came to an end and President Ford took office and then Jimmy [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=467.6s)]
*  Carter took office. You had three administrations pursuing detente and the U.S. position vis-a-vis [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=474.0s)]
*  the Soviet Union grew worse, not better, over the course of that period of time. The Soviet economy [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=479.44s)]
*  strengthened as the Soviets made the most of tying Europe to greater dependency on exports of oil [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=485.36s)]
*  and other energy from the Soviet Union. The Soviets began to muck around in Africa, several [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=493.36s)]
*  parts of Africa, as well as in the Caribbean and in Central and South America. They began to muck [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=500.0s)]
*  around in the politics of, of course, Afghanistan and Central Asia and eventually just launched an [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=506.08000000000004s)]
*  all-out invasion of Afghanistan in 1979. They were playing in Portugal. They were starting to [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=511.52s)]
*  play around in the politics of Europe, in Western Europe. So by the end of this decade, Zbigniew [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=517.6s)]
*  Brzezinski really was the one who began to question whether detente itself might be the problem, [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=524.0799999999999s)]
*  that the very nature of detente itself was inviting aggression from our adversaries, [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=531.12s)]
*  to carving out new areas of cooperation. So by the end of it, Zbigniew Brzezinski really [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=536.4s)]
*  persuaded President Carter to pivot in the final year of the Carter administration to a more [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=541.76s)]
*  hard-nosed, you know, hard-line policy against the Soviets that I think was exactly right. I think [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=546.32s)]
*  they learned from the mistakes. Carter ended up losing that election. Ronald Reagan came in. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=551.76s)]
*  Everyone was fearful of Reagan. People thought that he was a lightweight or that he just [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=557.2800000000001s)]
*  was going to be a little bit crazy. He ended up being perhaps the most successful U.S. President [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=561.36s)]
*  of the Cold War era in synthesizing all of the lessons learned from all of our mistakes and all [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=567.76s)]
*  of our successes in the previous decades, going all the way back to George Kennan at the very [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=574.0799999999999s)]
*  outset of the Cold War. And most of the critiques of us have not contested nor addressed the fact [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=580.0799999999999s)]
*  that the Reagan administration was the most successful Cold War strategy, as proven by the [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=586.48s)]
*  fact that he brought it to a peaceful ending. His vice president, George H.W. Bush, brought it to [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=591.52s)]
*  a landing just a couple of years after President Reagan left office. So there's another, I think, [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=597.36s)]
*  smart rejoinder to the idea that we should have a kind of more openly risk-tolerant approach [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=603.36s)]
*  towards China, and that's that it will cause panic among our allies, first of all allies and partners, [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=608.88s)]
*  and then second, that it will alienate much of the developing world, the Global South, where [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=615.92s)]
*  there is to some degree a contest for influence between the U.S. and China, and that we need to be [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=622.56s)]
*  seen to be responsible and careful in order to maintain all those partnerships. Do you see any [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=628.4799999999999s)]
*  value to that, any tension there? Let's start with the Global South because you just mentioned two [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=635.12s)]
*  important ideas, but they're actually not interlinked. The reason that the Global South [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=640.08s)]
*  is flummoxed by the United States and disappointed in the United States is not because we're [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=644.5600000000001s)]
*  competing in this great power competition and contest with China. It's that we're not showing [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=649.76s)]
*  up. We're just not showing up. When I talk to African leaders, I talk to leaders in Latin America, [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=656.0s)]
*  Central Asia, and other parts, they just say, where are you guys? They're not saying we're really [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=662.88s)]
*  worried about your competition with China. They'd be happy to play us off of one another, [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=667.44s)]
*  but they can't even do that because we don't show up. There's a lot more that we need to do in that [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=671.7600000000001s)]
*  respect. Now, when it comes to this idea of other allies, our democratic allies who are treaty allies [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=676.1600000000001s)]
*  of the United States in the NATO footprint of Europe and the Western Pacific, look, what I did [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=682.4000000000001s)]
*  when I was in office, even before I was Deputy National Security Advisor, I was the coordinator [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=688.32s)]
*  for our Asia policy, as the Senior Director for Asia. I had someone on staff at all times [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=692.48s)]
*  whose primary job was to engage with our European allies. So even though I was responsible for Asia, [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=698.48s)]
*  we were doing a lot of work with the Europeans. A lot of that was quiet, it was behind closed doors, [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=704.8000000000001s)]
*  but we were always keeping them well-informed in Brussels, in Berlin, in Paris, in London, [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=708.8000000000001s)]
*  and onwards. We were keeping them well-informed about our thinking, our assessments, and the [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=714.5600000000001s)]
*  direction that our policy was going. None of them said, don't do that because we're not ready to do [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=719.6s)]
*  that. What they said was, well, keep us informed. We're interested in continuing to exchange our [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=726.48s)]
*  observations on this front. And over time, lo and behold, we found that the European Union adopted [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=732.8000000000001s)]
*  some of the rhetoric and some of the actions that both the Trump and then the Biden administration [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=739.84s)]
*  undertook. So it's not that they, the wrong way to think about it is we have to have a perfectly [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=744.88s)]
*  united consensus policy with all of our European allies before we can move forward with defending [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=750.32s)]
*  America's interests vis-a-vis China. That's not a good way to think about it. We need to actually [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=757.12s)]
*  step forward, step out and lead, and hope through good exchanges and information that many of our [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=762.4s)]
*  allies will follow us. And that is exactly what has happened. So I don't like the idea of us [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=770.48s)]
*  watering down our policy to match a less assertive standard that sometimes emerges from Brussels, say. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=775.6800000000001s)]
*  I'd rather that we step forward and lead by example. Ductus exemplo, which is, by the way, [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=783.76s)]
*  the Marine Corps motto at the officer candidate school is ductus exemplo. And then if you lead, [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=789.6s)]
*  people will follow. And that is actually what's happening. I don't want to get into this question [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=795.28s)]
*  of whether Xi Jinping and other senior Chinese leaders would prefer a second Trump term or a [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=800.32s)]
*  second Biden or other Democrat term. We're having this conversation today when Biden is still [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=805.84s)]
*  the candidate, but there's lots of reporting and rumors that have a possible change. So [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=810.32s)]
*  we'll see where that goes. But you do hear from Chinese officials and scholars this [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=814.72s)]
*  belief that if Trump does return, there will be certain risks that the Chinese government face, [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=821.9200000000001s)]
*  the CCP would face, but also that it would have some effect on the alliances and partnerships [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=827.12s)]
*  that have been one of the great successes of the Biden foreign policy. They say, look, we're [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=833.6s)]
*  foreign a world of blocks. Our block doesn't look that great if it's Russia, China, North Korea [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=837.76s)]
*  against Japan and Australia and India and South Korea and the NATO allies. But they say, look, [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=843.44s)]
*  all those, that beautiful block of yours, that's going to come apart when Trump comes back. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=849.92s)]
*  Just given everything he says about Article 5 and NATO and threatened with raw troops from South [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=853.76s)]
*  Korea and slapping tariffs on Japan or India, do you see any risk of that? [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=858.72s)]
*  What I would say is, first of all, if the United States under any president begins to really turn [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=863.68s)]
*  its back on our allies, that would be a godsend for Xi Jinping and for his axis of chaos. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=869.92s)]
*  Putin, the Ayatollah, little shrimps who are making noise now, the Castro remnant regime [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=878.4000000000001s)]
*  in Cuba and Maduro's regime in Venezuela and so on. Of course, let's not forget about Kim Jong-un. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=885.84s)]
*  They would throw a pretty big wild party in celebration of the United States turning its [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=891.76s)]
*  back on NATO or even individual NATO allies or turning its back on South Korea and so forth. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=898.1600000000001s)]
*  No question about that. No question. But if we look at the first term of President Trump, [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=904.72s)]
*  what did he actually do? There was a lot of hand wringing and concern that he was going [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=910.8000000000001s)]
*  to abandon allies. By the end of that term, I would argue our relationship with Korea, Australia, [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=915.6s)]
*  and Japan was stronger than what we had inherited. The press never likes to talk about [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=924.4s)]
*  how deeply disconcerted the Japanese government was with the Obama administration or even Taiwan's [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=930.32s)]
*  government. We had much better relations and much more productive working ties with Taiwan [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=937.12s)]
*  under Trump than we had under Obama, according to all of the foreign leaders or several that [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=943.0400000000001s)]
*  I've talked to in several countries in the Western Pacific. So it's important to remember [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=948.8000000000001s)]
*  that actually ties strengthened. With respect to NATO, there was a real threat made by President [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=952.8s)]
*  Trump to say, look, if you're not going to pay your way, you're on your own. By the end of the [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=960.9599999999999s)]
*  administration, I think Jens Stoltenberg, the secretary general of NATO, summed it up best. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=966.7199999999999s)]
*  He said President Trump turned out to be the best dues collector in NATO history. There was a [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=972.4s)]
*  cumulative increase of hundreds of billions of dollars of spending by the European NATO allies, [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=978.32s)]
*  and now the majority of NATO allies actually have met the 2% of GDP spending threshold. 2% of their [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=983.6800000000001s)]
*  GDP they now spend on defense. Europe as a whole, aggregately, has also met the 2% threshold, [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=991.2800000000001s)]
*  according to, I think, the most recent support coming out of the NATO secretary general's office. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=1000.24s)]
*  That's a great tribute to President Trump's time in office. Now, what does that mean about a second [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=1005.36s)]
*  term? I think it's absolutely crucial that President Trump, even as he shows some tough love to our [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=1010.48s)]
*  allies to get them to step up in ways that will make us all safer, it's really important that the [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=1017.76s)]
*  pressure that he applies be applied in ways that don't threaten the existence of those alliances. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=1023.36s)]
*  I think there are ways to do that. You can actually find ways, maybe even to tariff countries that [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=1030.8000000000002s)]
*  aren't meeting their obligation in defense spending so that the U.S. recoups some of the [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=1035.76s)]
*  money that we're spending on their behalf. But you can do that without threatening the very existence [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=1040.88s)]
*  of the alliance. I'm very hopeful if President Trump wins, I'm hoping that that's where he comes [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=1046.0800000000002s)]
*  out. That's where he came out the first term. Certainly the people that I think he still trusts [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=1051.2s)]
*  and talks to who might be part of the second Trump term are not looking to dismantle NATO. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=1055.52s)]
*  They're looking to strengthen it. Yeah. I mean, I would guess that the person who deserves most [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=1060.8799999999999s)]
*  credit for European defense spending going up is Vladimir Putin, not President Trump or President [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=1064.6399999999999s)]
*  Biden for that matter. You can make the same argument that Japan's defense spending, which [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=1069.6s)]
*  is in the process of doubling right now, owes much to the man in Beijing who serves as the current [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=1074.16s)]
*  dictator there. So I want to go to the second big plank of the argument in the essay. The first [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=1081.04s)]
*  part of it is this notion that we need to accept more friction. The second is clarity of goal, [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=1086.8799999999999s)]
*  what we're trying to achieve in competition with China. And I think in some ways this has been, [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=1091.92s)]
*  in some ways, the most useful part of the debate that has been sparked by the essay. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=1096.8799999999999s)]
*  You argued that we should have a clear objective of changing the nature of government in China. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=1101.44s)]
*  You're very careful to say this is not about an Iraq style regime change, but you do say [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=1106.96s)]
*  in answer to the question, what would winning look like? According to you and Mike here, [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=1111.68s)]
*  China's communist rulers would give up trying to prevail in a hot or cold conflict [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=1115.1200000000001s)]
*  with the United States and the Chinese people from ruling elites to everyday citizens [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=1119.2s)]
*  would find inspiration to explore new models of development and governance [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=1123.76s)]
*  that don't rely on repression at home and compulsive hostility abroad. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=1127.52s)]
*  That sentence is the, that's the money quote of sort of what we envision as the end state. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=1132.08s)]
*  Now it's important that what we said was that Chinese people themselves, including ruling [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=1136.56s)]
*  elites, find inspiration to pursue or experiment with models that are not compulsively hostile [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=1141.1999999999998s)]
*  to the United States and Chinese neighbors and others. I don't believe that that should be as [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=1149.12s)]
*  controversial as some have interpreted it to be. What we're saying is we're rooting for the Chinese [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=1155.04s)]
*  people to find a better model that serves them a lot better, a less repressive model [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=1160.4s)]
*  and one that also doesn't result in, you know, mass death happening outside of China's borders [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=1165.3600000000001s)]
*  through their mismanagement of emergent diseases and their dangerous experiments [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=1171.8400000000001s)]
*  with dangerous pathogens or through their state subsidized trade in fentanyl, illicit fentanyl. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=1176.8000000000002s)]
*  Fentanyl precursors, right? Just to be, to be precise about it or? [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=1184.16s)]
*  Well, so if you look at the, if you look at the supply chain for illicit fentanyl, [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=1187.28s)]
*  we're not talking about the stuff that they give you when you're getting surgery in a hospital, [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=1191.52s)]
*  that like the, the, the legal small doses of medical grade fentanyl, I'm talking about the [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=1195.92s)]
*  stuff that's killing upwards of 80,000 Americans a year and utterly destroying and melting the [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=1201.92s)]
*  fabric of communities all across this country. China was selling that stuff direct into the [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=1208.0s)]
*  United States and these were Chinese state owned enterprises. They were sending it by mail. They [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=1214.56s)]
*  were intentionally mislabeling the mail. And during the Trump administration, president Trump [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=1218.96s)]
*  was able to persuade Xi Jinping to classify those drugs in a category that required far greater [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=1223.84s)]
*  strictures so that this stuff couldn't just be sent directly to us. What the Chinese Communist [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=1232.0s)]
*  Party pivoted to do was have all the companies that were creating the fentanyl continue producing [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=1237.12s)]
*  and exporting the chemicals, the precursor chemicals that make it, but send it straight [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=1243.44s)]
*  to the drug cartels in Mexico. And not only are there customers, illicit cartels, but Beijing, [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=1249.2s)]
*  according to Congress, a bipartisan report that came out earlier this year from Congress, Beijing [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=1258.3200000000002s)]
*  continues to provide state subsidies for those businesses to continue producing and exporting [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=1263.3600000000001s)]
*  all of that junk that gets turned into the synthesized poison that continues to kill us [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=1271.12s)]
*  by the tens of thousands each year. Now, what has also now come out is greater information about the [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=1276.8799999999999s)]
*  role of China in the money laundering. In fact, the vast majority now of the money laundering [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=1283.36s)]
*  on behalf of the cartels, so when they sell their poison on American streets, [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=1290.2399999999998s)]
*  they don't rely on their own networks now to repatriate the profits from the drug trade. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=1294.8s)]
*  They rely on Chinese money laundering networks. Those networks are not going to be able to [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=1301.2s)]
*  operate without Beijing at least winking an eye, if not doing more than merely winking an eye. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=1308.3999999999999s)]
*  Even if Beijing is not the one dealing the stuff on our streets, they're providing state subsidies [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=1315.52s)]
*  for all of the stuff that gets sold to the cartels to get turned into the fentanyl to kill us. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=1321.92s)]
*  And then the money round trips its way back to the cartels via Chinese illicit money laundering [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=1326.5600000000002s)]
*  networks. Let me ask two questions about that end state. I think what the ideal outcome is is clear. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=1332.0800000000002s)]
*  What is the theory of success? When you talk about using American tools and accepting some [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=1339.52s)]
*  risks to help bring that about, what are we able to influence? What's the theory of the case here? [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=1344.24s)]
*  Yeah, the reason that Marxist-Leninist regimes are compulsively hostile is that they don't have [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=1348.96s)]
*  a very compelling model on their own in and of themselves. Most Chinese people are not [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=1354.72s)]
*  communists. There's probably 95 million members of the Chinese Communist Party out of 1.3 or now [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=1360.0s)]
*  less than 1.3 billion Chinese people. Their population is rapidly shrinking. The vast majority [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=1368.8s)]
*  of Chinese people not only don't belong to the Chinese Communist Party, but they don't believe [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=1374.4s)]
*  in communism. And so the whole edifice supporting this idea of Marxist-Leninist single party [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=1377.36s)]
*  dictatorship that doesn't respect rule of law, that impinges on people's rights and freedoms [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=1384.6399999999999s)]
*  routinely in ways that people in China don't like, the substitute for this threadbare ideology now [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=1390.8799999999999s)]
*  is we're going to make China great by basically building a regional and global empire. And then [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=1397.6s)]
*  we'll be rich and strong. And so, fuqiang, that's the Chinese phrase, rich and strong, [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=1403.6s)]
*  rich and strong. And the Chinese Communist Party is the ones that are going to get you there. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=1409.12s)]
*  The way that they're trying to make China rich is really at the expense of law-abiding free market [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=1413.36s)]
*  economies, as well as poorer developing countries around the world. And so if they are not able to [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=1420.7199999999998s)]
*  grow through those means, it stands to reason. It's merely an observation. It's not a call [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=1428.72s)]
*  on my part for the United States to do something that compels regime change. Mike and I, in that [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=1434.4s)]
*  sentence you just read, were really making the same observation that George Kennan made all the way [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=1440.08s)]
*  back when he wrote his article for Foreign Affairs Magazine, which was that a Leninist system that is [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=1444.4s)]
*  unable to achieve its global vision through hostile means ultimately will start to sag [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=1451.12s)]
*  and then possibly collapse under its own rotten weight. That is what we're describing. And what [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=1457.2s)]
*  we're saying is we shouldn't be fearful of that. In fact, what we should really be looking to shape [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=1464.0800000000002s)]
*  is the aftermath of the Chinese Communist Party so that we give China its best chance at becoming [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=1469.2s)]
*  its best self on behalf of the Chinese people. It's not a call for us to try to subvert. We said [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=1474.64s)]
*  explicitly we're not calling for regime change and subversion here. What we're saying is we should [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=1480.96s)]
*  not fear the outcome that is predicted by history, was predicted by George Kennan, that actually [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=1484.48s)]
*  unfolded in the wake of Ronald Reagan's successful policy. So I don't think that that should be [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=1491.28s)]
*  something that is controversial or that should be called reckless and dangerous like one commentator [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=1498.0s)]
*  called our piece. Is there any end state that you would find acceptable or that would allow [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=1504.56s)]
*  some kind of accommodation that would still have the Chinese Communist Party in power? [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=1509.92s)]
*  If the Chinese Communist Party were not trying to poison 80 plus thousand Americans to death a year, [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=1514.64s)]
*  if the Chinese Communist Party were not stealing hundreds of billions of dollars worth of American [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=1521.76s)]
*  intellectual property each year, if the Chinese Communist Party were not actually the main backers [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=1526.64s)]
*  of proxy wars against Europe and against countries in the Middle East via their proxies Russia and [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=1532.16s)]
*  Iran, I would revert back to the policy that I first advocated for when I was preparing to come [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=1538.88s)]
*  into office, which was something more like this idea of a coexistence and trying to find a balance [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=1545.68s)]
*  and try to say, look, you know, we're not trying to fundamentally change you, but by the same token, [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=1552.0s)]
*  you better not be directly harming our prosperity, national security and public health and the rest. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=1557.6000000000001s)]
*  The problem is I've since graduated from that hopeful vision through experience when the facts [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=1564.48s)]
*  change. So does my opinion. So I just don't think that we are up to date with the reality of how [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=1571.3600000000001s)]
*  deeply antagonistic Xi Jinping's vision and goals and actions are now. And that's why I wrote the [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=1578.96s)]
*  piece for you together with Matthew Johnson and David Fythe back in late 2022 called Xi Jinping [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=1586.24s)]
*  in his own words, where we visited some of the things that Xi Jinping was saying, not when he was [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=1591.28s)]
*  talking to the public audiences at Davos or standing in the Rose Garden. It was what Xi Jinping was [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=1596.08s)]
*  saying in secret speeches to the central committee of the Chinese Communist Party, which we were [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=1601.2s)]
*  eventually able to get a hold of those speeches months or years after they were delivered. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=1605.84s)]
*  That was the real guidance that Xi Jinping was giving. And it was inherently hostile to anything [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=1610.08s)]
*  like a modus vivendi or coexistence. There's no trace of coexistence in the internal speeches [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=1616.08s)]
*  as an end state for Xi Jinping. He's going for the whole loaf of bread. He's not looking to split it. [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=1623.6s)]
*  We'll be back after a short break. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=1630.48s)]
*  And now back to my conversation with Matt Pottinger. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=1636.8s)]
*  HOFFMAN I mean, there's a lot of commentary that focuses on Xi Jinping's role and everything that [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=1639.6s)]
*  is particular about him that makes coexistence difficult. But your journey, you don't need to [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=1646.6399999999999s)]
*  go back into your life story in great detail. But my sense of your radicalization on this issue, [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=1652.32s)]
*  if you could put it that way, started long before Xi Jinping was in power when you were a [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=1658.1599999999999s)]
*  Wall Street Journal reporter in China in the 90s and aughts, where you started to see some of the [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=1662.8799999999999s)]
*  elements of what we're seeing now. I mean, is everything really going to go back to [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=1669.04s)]
*  the kind of Deng Xiaoping era accommodation even after Xi Jinping? [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=1673.3600000000001s)]
*  POTTER Look, one of the things Mike wrote, I can't remember the exact phrasing, [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=1677.2s)]
*  but it was later in the article, what we said was Xi Jinping, who is committing genocide, [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=1680.16s)]
*  according to Tony Blinken and Mike Pompeo, they agree on that much, that China is committing [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=1684.88s)]
*  genocide against some of its own people. It's waging these proxy wars. It's doing all these [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=1689.92s)]
*  things. It is unrealistic to think that a dictator who's doing all of those things right now [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=1695.12s)]
*  is going to be a reliable partner that we can solve global problems with. I think that is [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=1701.1999999999998s)]
*  pure fantasy. I even think that is irresponsible and dangerous, okay, to make that kind of an [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=1706.2399999999998s)]
*  assumption. But I think we said something to the effect in the article also that we need to wait [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=1712.08s)]
*  until China produces a leader that we can do business with, right? And we didn't define that [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=1717.84s)]
*  it has to be a democratically elected leader. What we said was that the People's Republic of China, [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=1723.84s)]
*  as practiced by a single party dictatorship under Xi Jinping right now, is compulsively hostile, [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=1729.84s)]
*  is rapidly undermining our interests, including here at home with information warfare, [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=1736.32s)]
*  efforts to interfere our elections, and so on. So let's not make life easier for Xi Jinping. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=1742.7199999999998s)]
*  Let's not give him the means to expand the sources of his belligerence, which are his economic power [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=1749.12s)]
*  and his access to high technology. Imagine if for a moment Vladimir Putin had a $17 trillion economy, [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=1757.76s)]
*  like China purportedly does, rather than merely a $2 trillion economy that Russia reportedly has [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=1765.9199999999998s)]
*  today. Think of how immense the damage would be beyond the damage that Putin is already doing [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=1773.76s)]
*  if he had a $17 trillion economy at his back. I'm glad Putin only has a $2 trillion economy, [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=1781.28s)]
*  and I'd like to make that economy a lot smaller than $2 trillion now in light of what he's doing. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=1788.72s)]
*  The same is true of China. I don't wish Chinese people ill, and in fact Chinese people are voting [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=1794.16s)]
*  with their feet. Anyone who can, irrespective of their social strata, is trying to flee China [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=1800.24s)]
*  right now, many of them successfully, a lot of them to come to the United States. So it's not that I [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=1805.76s)]
*  mean the Chinese people harm. I do mean to deprive Xi Jinping of the sources of his aggression, [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=1811.76s)]
*  and one of them is high technology that can be weaponized, and the other is just sheer economic [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=1820.32s)]
*  power that he can use to fund what is already the largest military buildup since the Nazis. [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=1826.72s)]
*  Let's talk about what has historically been one of the thorniest issues in the US-China relationship, [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=1833.3600000000001s)]
*  and today is probably one of the biggest flashpoints, and that's Taiwan. You, of [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=1837.84s)]
*  course, have a new book about Taiwan. You wrote a piece with Andrew Erickson and Gabe Collins, [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=1841.3600000000001s)]
*  drawing from that book in Foreign Affairs a few months ago. You have, I think, been fairly clear [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=1845.6000000000001s)]
*  that you would embrace a policy of what's called strategic clarity, I mean being explicit about our [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=1851.2s)]
*  willingness to step in and use US force if Beijing tries to take Taiwan by force. Joe Biden has said [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=1856.08s)]
*  that, I believe, four times, unclear exactly what that means about the policy, but he's certainly [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=1863.1999999999998s)]
*  gone farther than any president before us, and that includes Trump, who I think even recently has [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=1868.32s)]
*  said that he would not say anything clear about it, would maintain his version of ambiguity. [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=1872.48s)]
*  President Trump's statements are in tune with 40 years of American strategic ambiguity. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=1877.9199999999998s)]
*  Biden's are much closer to something like strategic clarity, given that, at least according to the [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=1885.52s)]
*  Constitution, Biden and not his staff are the ones who actually make policy, and so I take [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=1890.08s)]
*  President Biden at his word when he says four times that he would come to Taiwan's defense if [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=1896.8s)]
*  China were to attack. I think that future presidents and future candidates for president [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=1902.24s)]
*  probably shouldn't back away from that new line that's been drawn. That said, I don't spend a [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=1908.08s)]
*  lot of time on the debate between ambiguity and clarity because I think it is a sideshow [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=1913.92s)]
*  relative to the question of do we have credible capability to back up anything we say with respect [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=1922.0800000000002s)]
*  to Taiwan, and that's the first cornerstone for effective deterrence, much more than anything we [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=1928.8000000000002s)]
*  say rhetorically. The more complicated or an equally complicated dimension of this problem is [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=1934.5600000000002s)]
*  scenario short of that full-scale invasion that people worry about, and that's much closer to [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=1941.36s)]
*  what we're seeing now, both around Taiwan and also in South China Sea. People call this [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=1946.96s)]
*  gray zone tactics or salami slicing. You can characterize it in different ways, but [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=1951.92s)]
*  it's in some ways hard to imagine the US going to war with China over an old World War II or a [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=1956.24s)]
*  boat that's stuck on a reef in the South China Sea that the Philippines controls, or because a [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=1962.6399999999999s)]
*  Chinese Coast Guard ship has gotten a little bit too close to Taiwan shore. I mean, the South [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=1968.16s)]
*  China Sea might be the most useful place to play this out given how urgent it is. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=1973.44s)]
*  The reason that Beijing has picked a completely and almost irrelevant spec on the map to start [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=1978.0s)]
*  waging gray zone pressure is precisely because they know that we are psychologically inhibited [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=1987.76s)]
*  from viewing that spec on the map as strategically important or these tactics as a military attack. [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=1994.48s)]
*  Beijing is trying to come in just under the threshold of what it would take to actually [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=2002.72s)]
*  awaken an American response. Why are they doing that? They want to show the world. They want to [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=2007.84s)]
*  show the Philippine people, followed by the people of Taiwan, that resistance is futile, [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=2013.28s)]
*  that you cannot actually win because the United States isn't going to be there for you, just like [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=2019.04s)]
*  they're not there for second Thomas Scholl, where a squad of Philippine Marines are bravely guarding [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=2024.8s)]
*  the sovereignty of the Philippine nation. So I think we need to start getting a lot more [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=2030.8799999999999s)]
*  serious in terms of imposing costs on Beijing for the actions it's already undertaking. [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=2037.2s)]
*  If you were in your old job of Deputy International Security Advisor and you were [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=2043.52s)]
*  tasked with delivering a message to a Chinese counterpart about what the consequence of another [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=2047.44s)]
*  incident like the one that we just saw at second Thomas Scholl. I would speak with actions rather [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=2052.64s)]
*  than merely words and I would start making it easy for them to spot things that have just made [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=2057.36s)]
*  the bar that much higher for them to succeed in bullying the Philippines or in trying to [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=2064.64s)]
*  assert jurisdiction over Taiwan's near waters. What might something like that be? I mean, [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=2071.36s)]
*  we don't need a full set of options. Well, I'll throw some ideas out there. I mean, for one, [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=2076.88s)]
*  if President Marcos were to request the help, I would advise the president to start providing [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=2082.08s)]
*  a helicopter airlift to Philippine troops on those offshore outposts close to the Philippines that [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=2090.4s)]
*  are administered by the Philippines but which are now being threatened by China. I would help them [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=2099.44s)]
*  do that. I would start inviting Japan to get more directly involved. Japan has a very capable coast [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=2103.84s)]
*  guard. Why not start putting some Japanese coast guard cutters forward to the Philippines and more [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=2109.68s)]
*  coast guard cutters into the Western Pacific? I would certainly be trying, as I tried to do when [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=2115.6s)]
*  I was in office, to significantly beef up the United States Coast Guard, to give it more of a [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=2120.48s)]
*  budget rather than having them just be a hand-me-down sort of budget from portions of the US Navy budget. [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=2125.28s)]
*  The coast guard is awesome and it is our own gray zone tool. So let's beef that way the heck up. [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=2132.32s)]
*  If that means that we have to buy or lease some ships because America's own shipbuilding capacity [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=2139.1200000000003s)]
*  has fallen into disarray, the Europeans as well as the South Koreans and the Japanese are great at [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=2146.0800000000004s)]
*  making ships. Combined, they make almost as many ships as China. Let's start leasing ships from our [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=2151.68s)]
*  friends and allies. It's probably going to be cheaper frankly than us building our own in some cases. [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=2158.08s)]
*  Some of your former colleagues in the Trump administration have been critical of US support [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=2163.2799999999997s)]
*  for Ukraine on the argument that it distracts us from deterring China in the Taiwan Strait or [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=2168.08s)]
*  elsewhere in the Indo-Pacific, that we should really kind of focus resources there and that Ukraine [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=2174.8799999999997s)]
*  is a kind of black hole of resources and strategic focus that we need to walk away from. [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=2179.28s)]
*  Trump himself has not been exactly, when given the opportunity to declare coming to Ukraine, [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=2184.4s)]
*  he's evaded it and JD Vance and others, but your possible vice presidential pick, have been even [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=2189.36s)]
*  sharper about the need to step away from Ukraine. How do you see that connection? [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=2194.88s)]
*  Yeah, my view is you need a bigger pie instead of trying to slice the pie differently. I agree with [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=2198.5600000000004s)]
*  those views that we need to do much more to give Beijing something to think about in order to [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=2205.04s)]
*  deter Xi Jinping from taking actions against Taiwan. That means more money than was made [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=2211.2s)]
*  available for that theater in the last important supplemental. What I would not argue for is us [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=2216.4s)]
*  turning our back on Ukraine and pretending that it'll all work out, that Europe will, [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=2223.84s)]
*  without American leadership, step up. The Europeans are doing more and more [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=2228.96s)]
*  all the time. They need to do much more still. That's going to require American leadership, [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=2233.6s)]
*  not American abandonment. If Ukraine falls, has anyone really done a careful analysis of [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=2238.0s)]
*  what would be required in new manpower, new European spending, new US spending, in order to [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=2243.92s)]
*  defend now the NATO line, which is going to be right up against Russian occupied Ukraine? That's [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=2250.24s)]
*  going to be multiples of what we're spending to keep Ukrainians fighting bravely and to ensure [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=2257.36s)]
*  that Russia at least doesn't gain more ground than it's already taken. It's prudent. It's not [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=2263.52s)]
*  ideological. It's not romantic. This is just practical. We're going to end up spending a hell [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=2270.32s)]
*  of a lot more money if Ukraine falls than we're spending right now to keep them in the fight. [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=2275.6800000000003s)]
*  Xi Jinping would presumably see that as an encouraging sign. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=2280.7200000000003s)]
*  No doubt. For those who say, therefore, we shouldn't, who cares what Xi Jinping thinks? [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=2284.48s)]
*  That's not what this is about. My counter argument to that is think about what we would have to spend [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=2291.36s)]
*  if Ukraine falls. Put Xi Jinping aside for a minute. What would we have to spend just to ensure [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=2296.1600000000003s)]
*  that NATO does not end up getting probed and attacked? It's going to be multiples of what [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=2301.84s)]
*  we're spending right now. We're being penny wise, pound foolish when we argue [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=2308.56s)]
*  Ukraine's not really a valid place for us to be helping right now. [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=2313.84s)]
*  Dave So, speaking of Xi Jinping perception, turning that back on the United States, [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=2318.0s)]
*  when you were in office, you resigned on January 6th. Given the events at the Capitol, I don't [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=2323.04s)]
*  imagine that was primarily because of what it meant for the US-China relationship. But truly, [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=2327.52s)]
*  China watches that kind of event and senses a distracted adversary. Any disruption to the [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=2332.72s)]
*  democratic process of this year would send a similar signal. [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=2339.12s)]
*  David Yeah, China made hay of January 6th. Their [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=2341.68s)]
*  propagandists did. They're trying to make hay of President Biden's disconcerting performance in [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=2343.68s)]
*  his debate. We need to do better on both fronts. But what I'll say is, the United States has the [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=2349.52s)]
*  ability, we often don't do it until we've exhausted every other option, but we have the ability to [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=2357.84s)]
*  course correct and to regenerate and to refresh and renew and to do so in ways short of revolution. [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=2363.36s)]
*  If any system can do it, it's ours. That's why our system is so worth preserving. So I would say, [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=2372.88s)]
*  enjoy the laughter while you can get it, Beijing and Moscow. We'll see who wins the marathon. [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=2378.48s)]
*  Let me ask one final question that is similarly forward-looking along the lines of that [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=2384.0s)]
*  Churchillian note. Without presuming anything, if there is a second Trump term come 2025, [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=2389.04s)]
*  what do you think the next big strategic moves on China should be? [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=2395.6s)]
*  David If you look at United Front messaging [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=2399.04s)]
*  and Chinese diplomacy, the thing that it prizes more than anything else, the thing that it wants [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=2402.96s)]
*  to preserve in its bilateral relationship with the United States above all else, is access to our [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=2407.92s)]
*  technology and our laboratories. That's number one. I would start taking a much harder look at [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=2413.36s)]
*  that. That doesn't mean a wholesale decoupling, but what it means is making it a lot harder for [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=2418.6400000000003s)]
*  people to gain access to labs when we have a reasonable suspicion that those people are [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=2424.88s)]
*  really there to bring that technology back home to serve Beijing's military buildup and the [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=2431.92s)]
*  weaponization of technology on behalf of the Chinese security services. We can do a lot better [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=2437.28s)]
*  than we're doing on that front and still preserve people-to-people ties, still have Chinese [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=2441.68s)]
*  immigrants and also Chinese students come study in the United States, but we need to be much more [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=2447.8399999999997s)]
*  hardline about it. Number two is just the deterrence piece, making sure that we've got a military [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=2451.8399999999997s)]
*  that's up to the task of credibly being ready and able to defeat our foes so that we won't have to [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=2457.2799999999997s)]
*  fight and defeat our foes. The trade element, which President Trump has been most vocal about, [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=2463.2799999999997s)]
*  is also critical. I'm glad that President Biden increased tariffs on certain areas. [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=2469.2s)]
*  I think President Trump, if he's elected, would go farther and faster. I don't want to see just a [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=2475.2799999999997s)]
*  200% tariff on Chinese EVs. I want to see an outright ban on Chinese EVs, including the [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=2480.3199999999997s)]
*  building of Chinese EVs in the United States, because it's still the Chinese supply chain, [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=2487.04s)]
*  and that's a national security threat to the United States. We should not be allowing China [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=2491.2799999999997s)]
*  to export its excess capacity in production in order to wipe out our manufacturing industry [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=2496.0s)]
*  and make China richer so that it can do its worst. [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Res-P1ErFvw&t=2502.08s)]
