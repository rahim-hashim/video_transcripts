Video Description: Foreign Affairs invites you to listen to its podcast, the Foreign Affairs Interview. This episode with Amaney Jamal was originally published on November 16, 2023.
As the war in Gaza continues, the question of Hamas’s future has become paramount. But it has also raised questions about the years of Hamas rule in Gaza—and the group’s support among Palestinians. 
Amaney Jamal is dean of the Princeton School of Public and International Affairs and co-founder of Arab Barometer, which conducts public opinion research across the Arab world. 
Her most recent survey of Palestinian public opinion wrapped up on October 6—the eve of Hamas’s attack. As she wrote in a recent piece for Foreign Affairs, “The argument that the entire population of Gaza can be held responsible for Hamas’s actions is quickly discredited when one looks at the facts.”

# Amaney Jamal: What Do Palestinians Think of Their Own Leaders? | Foreign Affairs Interview
**Foreign Affairs:** [November 21, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_pA25nSt2o)
*  I'm Dan Kurtz-Faelen and this is the Foreign Affairs Interview. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_pA25nSt2o&t=0.0s)]
*  What we know from this conflict from the get-go is violence only breeds more violence. If violence [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_pA25nSt2o&t=5.92s)]
*  was going to solve this conflict, it would have been solved by now a long time ago. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_pA25nSt2o&t=11.120000000000001s)]
*  As the war in Gaza continues, the question of Hamas's future has become paramount. But it has [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_pA25nSt2o&t=17.28s)]
*  also raised questions about the past years of Hamas's rule in Gaza and especially its support [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_pA25nSt2o&t=22.400000000000002s)]
*  among Palestinians. Aminah Jamal is Dean of the Princeton School of Public and International [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_pA25nSt2o&t=27.6s)]
*  Affairs and co-founder of Arab Barometer, which conducts public opinion research across the Arab [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_pA25nSt2o&t=32.800000000000004s)]
*  world. Her most recent survey of Palestinian public opinion wrapped up on October 6th, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_pA25nSt2o&t=38.08s)]
*  the eve of Hamas's attack. As she wrote in a recent piece for Foreign Affairs, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_pA25nSt2o&t=43.6s)]
*  the argument that the entire population of Gaza can be held responsible for Hamas's actions [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_pA25nSt2o&t=47.68000000000001s)]
*  is quickly discredited when one looks at the facts. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_pA25nSt2o&t=52.64s)]
*  Aminah, thank you so much for joining me today and for the fascinating and really revelatory piece [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_pA25nSt2o&t=57.6s)]
*  that you wrote for Foreign Affairs a few weeks ago. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_pA25nSt2o&t=65.36s)]
*  Thank you so much, Dan. It's a real pleasure to be with you. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_pA25nSt2o&t=67.68s)]
*  So let's start with the really astonishing polling your team at Arab Barometer was doing [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_pA25nSt2o&t=70.4s)]
*  in the West Bank and Gaza really up until literally the eve of Hamas's attacks on October 7th. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_pA25nSt2o&t=76.16s)]
*  What were you looking for and what did you find regarding Palestinian views of Hamas, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_pA25nSt2o&t=82.4s)]
*  especially among those who live in Gaza? Typically, you know, the Arab Barometer [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_pA25nSt2o&t=87.2s)]
*  surveys tap into the attitudes of ordinary citizens across the Arab world in terms of [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_pA25nSt2o&t=91.68s)]
*  social life, economic life, and political life. And one of the set of political questions we ask [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_pA25nSt2o&t=96.64s)]
*  are levels of trust and confidence in the existing regime and if they are to vote, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_pA25nSt2o&t=101.92s)]
*  who will they vote for? So when we asked respondents how much trust they had in the [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_pA25nSt2o&t=106.48s)]
*  Hamas regime, about 67% said they had no or little trust in the Hamas government. So that's [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_pA25nSt2o&t=111.36s)]
*  two-thirds of the Palestinian population on Gaza saying they had little to no trust in Hamas. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_pA25nSt2o&t=118.16s)]
*  Furthermore, when we asked respondents if elections were held today, who would you vote for? [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_pA25nSt2o&t=126.0s)]
*  And about a quarter, 24% said they would vote for Ismail Haniyeh. So just looking at those two [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_pA25nSt2o&t=131.92s)]
*  metrics leads us to believe that Hamas enjoyed very little support at the eve of this catastrophe [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_pA25nSt2o&t=138.24s)]
*  that we're witnessing and Ismail Haniyeh, the leader of Hamas, also enjoyed very little support. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_pA25nSt2o&t=145.68s)]
*  You've been doing this kind of polling for many years. Is this in line with what you've seen in [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_pA25nSt2o&t=152.24s)]
*  the past? Is there a kind of clear trend in terms of support for Hamas and Gaza and among Palestinians [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_pA25nSt2o&t=157.84s)]
*  on the West Bank as well? Yeah, so what we've seen then is across the board, Palestinian confidence [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_pA25nSt2o&t=162.8s)]
*  in the existing regimes, whether it's the Palestinian Authority on the West Bank or the Hamas [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_pA25nSt2o&t=168.88000000000002s)]
*  government on Gaza, has been declining. And why has it been declining, especially since the COVID [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_pA25nSt2o&t=173.44s)]
*  pandemic? Because of course, we've seen all these new economic realities, whether it's inflation, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_pA25nSt2o&t=179.36s)]
*  cost of living, food shortages, labor shortages, and still in Gaza and the West Bank, you have an [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_pA25nSt2o&t=184.0s)]
*  abundance of unskilled labor available to sort of service these economies. And you've seen the [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_pA25nSt2o&t=188.88s)]
*  cost of living rise. So on the eve of these surveys, what we saw in Gaza is three-fourths [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_pA25nSt2o&t=194.88s)]
*  of the Gazan population were reporting that they could not afford to buy food in the previous 30 [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_pA25nSt2o&t=200.4s)]
*  days or that they ran out of food and they couldn't afford to buy food in the last 30 days. So that [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_pA25nSt2o&t=209.04s)]
*  basically tells you that three-fourths of the Gaza population before all this devastation were [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_pA25nSt2o&t=214.32s)]
*  reporting food insecurity. And that percentage is up since 2021 when we surveyed Palestinians in Gaza, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_pA25nSt2o&t=220.56s)]
*  then only 51%. Still, half the population reported food insecurity. Today, it's three-fourths. So [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_pA25nSt2o&t=229.76s)]
*  there's tremendous poverty. On top of it, a lack of faith in the existing government. There's a [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_pA25nSt2o&t=236.0s)]
*  similar story on the West Bank, although there the economic situation is not as dire, but [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_pA25nSt2o&t=241.6s)]
*  nevertheless, the PA has gradually over time lost the trust and confidence of the Palestinian [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_pA25nSt2o&t=247.92s)]
*  population because of public mismanagement of funds, corruption, abuse of power. But also [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_pA25nSt2o&t=253.28s)]
*  important to note, Dan, on the PA side, remember the PA was a creation that came out of Oslo. And [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_pA25nSt2o&t=259.2s)]
*  that whole project of the Palestinian Authority was that it would work with Israel to manage and [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_pA25nSt2o&t=266.88s)]
*  control and oversee areas A and somewhat B of the West Bank in return for a future Palestinian [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_pA25nSt2o&t=273.44s)]
*  state. Well, now they've become this really governing authority, this security authority. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_pA25nSt2o&t=280.8s)]
*  And even we see like even with these protests on the West Bank today, the Palestinian Authority is [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_pA25nSt2o&t=285.28s)]
*  also trying to push back or at least control many of these protests. So the PA is seen by many [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_pA25nSt2o&t=290.56s)]
*  Palestinians as a security arm, and even worse, a security arm of the Israeli occupation, [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_pA25nSt2o&t=297.68s)]
*  without ever delivering real peace. Is there any sense of a viable political alternative, [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_pA25nSt2o&t=303.36s)]
*  some other path if neither the PA or the Hamas leadership in Gaza is seen as particularly [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_pA25nSt2o&t=309.6s)]
*  successful or effective? Right. Well, so this is a really good question, Dan. So it sort of like [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_pA25nSt2o&t=315.92s)]
*  relates to this question of what's going to come after all of this? Like, what is the governing [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_pA25nSt2o&t=319.76s)]
*  authority going to look like? And you know, we still don't know exactly that question. A lot of [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_pA25nSt2o&t=323.44s)]
*  it is going to be contingent on how all this ends. But let's just assume for a moment that Hamas is [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_pA25nSt2o&t=327.44s)]
*  completely eradicated. It does raise the question of whether Fatah and or some combination of the [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_pA25nSt2o&t=332.0s)]
*  PA can govern over Gaza. My sort of sense of having studied this conflict now for over two decades [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_pA25nSt2o&t=338.0s)]
*  is that if you want a Palestinian authority and a Fatah government or a technocratic government [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_pA25nSt2o&t=344.96000000000004s)]
*  simply to come back to Gaza and be told by Israel and the international community, [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_pA25nSt2o&t=351.52s)]
*  please govern your people, control them, be an extension of this Israeli occupation on Gaza, [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_pA25nSt2o&t=356.32s)]
*  that that's going to be a failed project. I mean, we are also hearing stories, Dan, right now [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_pA25nSt2o&t=362.72s)]
*  on the West Bank that there are splinters or emerging splinters from within the ranks of the [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_pA25nSt2o&t=367.76s)]
*  PA. There's a lot of frustration. So you might think that that might be the most obvious route. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_pA25nSt2o&t=372.24s)]
*  But if that's not linked to a concrete plan that's going to go somewhere. And what do I mean by [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_pA25nSt2o&t=378.32s)]
*  where it's going to go? Go towards a genuine two state solution. Israel is going to find itself [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_pA25nSt2o&t=385.44s)]
*  over and over trying to patch up the West Bank in Gaza, unless we see ethnic cleansing of Gaza [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_pA25nSt2o&t=391.2s)]
*  right now. You're going to just try to patch this up with any government that can repress the people. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_pA25nSt2o&t=397.92s)]
*  And then every now and then we're going to see this boiling up happen over again. We've seen it [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_pA25nSt2o&t=404.32s)]
*  over and over almost every three to five years, Dan, there's a cycle of violence here. And the big [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_pA25nSt2o&t=408.8s)]
*  elephant in the room has never been addressed. And peace work is difficult work. It's not basically [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_pA25nSt2o&t=414.16s)]
*  a sound bite that people should say on camera that we call for a two state solution. We hope [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_pA25nSt2o&t=421.52s)]
*  for a two state solution. We advocate for a two state solution while the realities on the ground [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_pA25nSt2o&t=429.59999999999997s)]
*  of the West Bank have changed, as you know. But also just playing lip service to this cause [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_pA25nSt2o&t=433.84s)]
*  without doing the work is not going to suffice. So either the international community, as it sort [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_pA25nSt2o&t=439.52s)]
*  of thinks about what governance is going to look like in Gaza, it needs to equally be worried about [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_pA25nSt2o&t=445.44s)]
*  and concerned about and be planning for what is the solution to this conflict? What does peace look [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_pA25nSt2o&t=453.2s)]
*  like? How do we get there as an international order? What is your sense of the level of [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_pA25nSt2o&t=460.16s)]
*  support among Palestinians for a two state solution versus other kinds of, you know, [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_pA25nSt2o&t=466.24s)]
*  bi-national state or other solutions? And is there still a sense of that, you know, again, [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_pA25nSt2o&t=470.56s)]
*  going back to October 6 when you were doing this, these surveys that there was still faith that that [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_pA25nSt2o&t=474.8s)]
*  was possible despite all that has happened in recent years. So there are two questions here, [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_pA25nSt2o&t=480.0s)]
*  right? One is, what is your preferred solution for the ongoing Palestinian-Israeli conflict? [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_pA25nSt2o&t=485.28000000000003s)]
*  The other question is, relatedly, do you believe that a peaceful solution is still possible? So [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_pA25nSt2o&t=491.68s)]
*  let's answer that first question. The first question is, we asked Palestinians in Gaza, [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_pA25nSt2o&t=499.36s)]
*  among these three options, which one do you think is the most viable solution? First was a two state [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_pA25nSt2o&t=504.32s)]
*  solution. The second was one state solution. And the third was a Confederate state. We also allowed [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_pA25nSt2o&t=510.24s)]
*  for a fourth option, which was other, where people could write in their responses. What we found in [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_pA25nSt2o&t=515.12s)]
*  our survey is about 80% selected one of those three options, which more or less basically is [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_pA25nSt2o&t=520.48s)]
*  considered as recognizing Israel or dealing with Israel. But the vast majority of those who [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_pA25nSt2o&t=526.56s)]
*  responded cited the two state solution, around 52-54% cited the two state solution. About 20% [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_pA25nSt2o&t=532.7199999999999s)]
*  wrote in other, and they cited armed struggle, armed resistance against Israel. So that's one in five. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_pA25nSt2o&t=540.3199999999999s)]
*  But nevertheless, the majority cited a two state solution. When you look at other surveys, [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_pA25nSt2o&t=546.56s)]
*  we did not ask this on the Arborometer survey, but when we look at other surveys, [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_pA25nSt2o&t=553.28s)]
*  what's clear also is that when you ask Palestinians on Gaza and in the West Bank, [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_pA25nSt2o&t=557.4399999999999s)]
*  is a two state solution still viable? The majority of Palestinians believe that it is no longer [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_pA25nSt2o&t=563.28s)]
*  viable due to the realities on the ground. And what do we mean by the realities on the ground? [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_pA25nSt2o&t=569.8399999999999s)]
*  The expansion of settlements into the West Bank that basically has not allowed for not only a [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_pA25nSt2o&t=574.64s)]
*  contiguous Palestinian state, but the West Bank today is divided up in enclaves in such a way that [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_pA25nSt2o&t=579.2s)]
*  it's not clear how you can even organize a state. So you in one of your previous answers, you know, [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_pA25nSt2o&t=585.2800000000001s)]
*  mentioned this declared objective of destroying Hamas. It's hard to kind of understand exactly [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_pA25nSt2o&t=592.1600000000001s)]
*  what the Israeli theory of success there is given what is happening now. Do you see that as remotely [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_pA25nSt2o&t=597.36s)]
*  viable and just going to the public opinion and support dimension of this have previous conflicts, [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_pA25nSt2o&t=603.44s)]
*  previous rounds of fighting affected support for Hamas among Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank? [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_pA25nSt2o&t=609.84s)]
*  And what do you expect given just the sheer number of civilian casualties and all the images of horror [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_pA25nSt2o&t=615.2s)]
*  and experience of atrocity that we're going to see in the weeks ahead and have seen in the past weeks? [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_pA25nSt2o&t=621.04s)]
*  I'm just going to start out by saying like what we know from this conflict from the get go is [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_pA25nSt2o&t=625.76s)]
*  violence only breeds more violence. If violence was going to solve this conflict, it would have [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_pA25nSt2o&t=630.08s)]
*  been solved by now a long time ago. So regardless of what is happening in Gaza right now, there will [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_pA25nSt2o&t=635.44s)]
*  be and must be a diplomatic solution and diplomatic negotiations, not only to release the hostages, [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_pA25nSt2o&t=642.24s)]
*  which is a little bit surprising that we're not seeing more diplomatic efforts to get that done, [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_pA25nSt2o&t=648.64s)]
*  but also to stop the bombing on condensed civilian areas where, you know, today the [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_pA25nSt2o&t=653.04s)]
*  death toll is upwards of 11,500. I mean, at some point, the world community is going to say enough [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_pA25nSt2o&t=659.76s)]
*  is enough. And we're still waiting to hear how much seriously has Hamas been weakened by all of this. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_pA25nSt2o&t=665.68s)]
*  So violence is going to breed more violence. We also know this from our previous polling when [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_pA25nSt2o&t=672.3199999999999s)]
*  there are these cycles of violence, support for Hamas increases. I'm not entirely sure how [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_pA25nSt2o&t=678.16s)]
*  that's going to play out now, given the devastation, given the fact that about 1.5 million people have [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_pA25nSt2o&t=683.68s)]
*  been displaced. I'm really quite honest with you, Dan. I'm not sure if at some point that [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_pA25nSt2o&t=688.48s)]
*  Rafah border is going to be open and you're going to see just displacement, given the sheer [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_pA25nSt2o&t=693.8399999999999s)]
*  atrocities right now on the ground. So it really depends on what happens now. It's very critical. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_pA25nSt2o&t=698.0799999999999s)]
*  So let's just think about the day after for a moment. Some people are saying that maybe Hamas [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_pA25nSt2o&t=703.92s)]
*  will be weakened. It's not going to be eradicated. Some will argue that eradication policies hardly [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_pA25nSt2o&t=708.56s)]
*  ever succeed. Others have argued, look, let's learn from what happened in Iraq. When we went [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_pA25nSt2o&t=713.36s)]
*  into Iraq, there was this very robust debate happening in DC amongst the White House and the [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_pA25nSt2o&t=720.3199999999999s)]
*  State Department about whether or not the entire Ba'ath regime, Saddam Hussein's Ba'ath regime, [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_pA25nSt2o&t=726.0s)]
*  should be pulled down and basically eradicated. But if you look at theories of state development, [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_pA25nSt2o&t=731.84s)]
*  state formation, the number one thing that you need for any governing authority is you need a [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_pA25nSt2o&t=737.9200000000001s)]
*  government to be able to have the means of control over its population. So the debate that ensued [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_pA25nSt2o&t=745.44s)]
*  during that time period was that, well, if we pull down the entire government, [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_pA25nSt2o&t=753.12s)]
*  there's going to be a political vacuum and chaos will ensue. And the other argument was, no, [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_pA25nSt2o&t=757.6800000000001s)]
*  you have sort of mid-level Ba'ath career folks and lower level Ba'ath career folks. Let's pull them [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_pA25nSt2o&t=763.6s)]
*  out and make sure that they become part of the ruling coalition in Iraq. The decision was not [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_pA25nSt2o&t=771.6800000000001s)]
*  to do that. The decision was to take out the whole regime and everybody saw what ensued afterwards. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_pA25nSt2o&t=777.28s)]
*  Now we're looking at Gaza. So one argument that you're seeing floating around in DC is there [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_pA25nSt2o&t=782.08s)]
*  should be a diplomatic effort to pull out mid-level and lower level elements of Hamas in so far as they [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_pA25nSt2o&t=788.08s)]
*  sort of denounce terrorism and are willing to work with a new governing authority simply for having [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_pA25nSt2o&t=795.2800000000001s)]
*  an aura of legitimacy in Gaza. The other argument is there's going to be a complete bypassing of [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_pA25nSt2o&t=801.5200000000001s)]
*  Hamas and maybe the PA will come back. Regardless of whichever option happens, [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_pA25nSt2o&t=807.2s)]
*  a governing authority also has to deliver to its people its aspirations. It can't simply be an [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_pA25nSt2o&t=814.08s)]
*  authority that represses its own people. So that's what we have to keep in mind moving forward. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_pA25nSt2o&t=819.2s)]
*  We'll be back after a short break. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_pA25nSt2o&t=825.0400000000001s)]

*  of the US government about extending authority of a reconstituted Palestinian Authority over Gaza. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_pA25nSt2o&t=892.72s)]
*  Salam Fayyad, the former PA Prime Minister, wrote a version of this in our pages laying out a way of [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_pA25nSt2o&t=899.84s)]
