Video Description: How can you reframe innovation to not seem so scary? Jason Feifer — editor in chief at Entrepreneur Magazine, podcast host, and author of Build for Tomorrow — shares the importance of "the bridge of familiarity." Instead of telling people to use new things, it's best to guide them to better versions of old things.

# Building an Innovation Bridge with Jason Feifer
**The a16z Podcast:** [March 04, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B41oKdepx8M)
*  In the 1800s, the car was introduced. People didn't call it the car. They called it the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B41oKdepx8M&t=0.0s)]
*  horseless carriage. And that, of course, is if they were being generous. If they were [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B41oKdepx8M&t=9.200000000000001s)]
*  not being generous, they would call it the devil wagon because they totally thought these [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B41oKdepx8M&t=12.56s)]
*  things were the devil wagon. And they would throw rocks at them. And if you drove down [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B41oKdepx8M&t=16.48s)]
*  the street in one of these early cars, somebody would literally yell, get a horse, get a horse. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B41oKdepx8M&t=21.76s)]
*  They would go, get a horse at you. And when people tell the story now of how cars became [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B41oKdepx8M&t=27.2s)]
*  the dominant mode of transportation, what they tell is the story of Henry Ford. Henry Ford [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B41oKdepx8M&t=34.64s)]
*  revolutionized manufacturing and therefore made cars cheaper and more accessible to the masses. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B41oKdepx8M&t=39.68s)]
*  And though that is true, it skips over an important point, an important part of the story that [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B41oKdepx8M&t=44.879999999999995s)]
*  I heard from a car historian. And it was something that Henry Ford was the beneficiary of. It goes [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B41oKdepx8M&t=49.36s)]
*  like this. So in the earlier days of the car, people are calling it the devil wagon. They're [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B41oKdepx8M&t=54.64s)]
*  throwing rocks at it. And the auto industry is trying to understand what on earth is wrong. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B41oKdepx8M&t=59.52s)]
*  And they start to look at the way in which they're advertising the car. And they [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B41oKdepx8M&t=66.4s)]
*  realize that they are advertising the car as a replacement to the horse. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B41oKdepx8M&t=74.72s)]
*  They're saying, get rid of Dobbin, Dobbin being the generic name of a horse, like spot for a dog, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B41oKdepx8M&t=78.96s)]
*  get rid of Dobbin and get this car. This car is so much better than your stupid horse. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B41oKdepx8M&t=86.0s)]
*  But here's the thing. People hated that. They found that offensive and they should have [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B41oKdepx8M&t=91.44s)]
*  because they loved their horse. Their horse was a member of the family. And as far back as they knew, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B41oKdepx8M&t=95.67999999999999s)]
*  every generation of their family had a horse. And now here come these people saying, I have a [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B41oKdepx8M&t=100.16s)]
*  totally better way for you to be. And your old way is stupid. People hate that because people [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B41oKdepx8M&t=107.04s)]
*  hate new things. What they like is better versions of old things. So what we need to do as innovators [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B41oKdepx8M&t=114.08000000000001s)]
*  is we need to build what I like to call the bridge of familiarity. And that bridge goes not from us, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B41oKdepx8M&t=122.48s)]
*  the people with a great new thing to the people who we want to have that great new thing. That [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B41oKdepx8M&t=129.44s)]
*  is not the direction to build the bridge. You build the bridge the other way around. You start [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B41oKdepx8M&t=134.32s)]
*  with where they are and you build towards you. So back then, the shift that the auto industry made [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B41oKdepx8M&t=138.4s)]
*  was that they stopped talking about the car as a replacement to the horse. And they started talking [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B41oKdepx8M&t=148.95999999999998s)]
*  about the car as a better horse. So they started popularizing terms like horsepower and naming cars [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B41oKdepx8M&t=157.2s)]
*  after horses, which we still do today with the Bronco and Mustang. Oh, it's kind of like my horse. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B41oKdepx8M&t=163.28s)]
*  And I can sort of respect it like and use it like my horse. Well, that makes a lot more sense to me [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B41oKdepx8M&t=168.8s)]
*  than someone just coming along and telling me to get rid of my horse. This is what we always need [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B41oKdepx8M&t=173.6s)]
*  to keep in mind. And what I find, I was just talking about a guy who, and he had a product [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B41oKdepx8M&t=178.16s)]
*  that was called, they were calling it chicken chips. Chicken chips. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B41oKdepx8M&t=185.28s)]
*  Chicken chips. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B41oKdepx8M&t=190.64s)]
*  Chips. Like out of a bag, like potato chips. But chicken chips. Now, does that sound appealing to [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B41oKdepx8M&t=191.92000000000002s)]
*  you? No, I was going to say, I'm not sure where you're going with this, but I would definitely [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B41oKdepx8M&t=198.88s)]
*  not grab that off a shelf. Yeah. And that's the thing. It did really well in taste tests. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B41oKdepx8M&t=202.8s)]
*  People really liked the product. Nobody was buying it. Because chicken chips sounds disgusting. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B41oKdepx8M&t=208.24s)]
*  So after a bunch of kind of consumer insights research, they changed from talking, from calling [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B41oKdepx8M&t=213.6s)]
*  it chicken chips to protein chips. Why? Because people are already familiar with protein bars [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B41oKdepx8M&t=221.52s)]
*  and protein packs and protein shakes. So the idea of it being protein first now signals to an [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B41oKdepx8M&t=229.52s)]
*  existing audience. And where's the protein coming from? Well, you can find out that it's coming from [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B41oKdepx8M&t=237.52s)]
*  chicken. And that little shift completely unlocked sales for this company. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B41oKdepx8M&t=243.12s)]
*  I love that you brought up a current application of this, because that was going to be my question. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B41oKdepx8M&t=250.16s)]
*  There are so many cases where there is pushback. And in many cases, rightfully so, whether it's [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B41oKdepx8M&t=256.32s)]
*  Web3, whether it's autonomous vehicles, whether it's different versions of space, there's a lot [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B41oKdepx8M&t=261.2s)]
*  of pushback in some of these new emerging, perhaps exciting industries. And I think you're right that [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B41oKdepx8M&t=266.64s)]
*  there is that familiarity gap where people are just like, why do I care if people are going to [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B41oKdepx8M&t=272.24s)]
*  Mars? I have problems on Earth. Or why do I care if something is decentralized? Tell me why that [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B41oKdepx8M&t=277.36s)]
*  matters. And so I think it's important to use those frames of just why does this matter? [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B41oKdepx8M&t=283.52000000000004s)]
*  That simple question. Why does this matter to someone today? And even, like you said, using [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B41oKdepx8M&t=290.32s)]
*  simplistic terminology can completely shift. And I think another area that this reminds me of is, [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B41oKdepx8M&t=295.2s)]
*  as I mentioned, AI is, we went through AI summer, things are still trucking ahead very quickly, [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B41oKdepx8M&t=301.44s)]
*  but it's like, how can you reframe something to not sound so scary? Someone who's a designer is [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B41oKdepx8M&t=306.88s)]
*  like, oh, this artificial intelligence bot is creating art based on my artwork. That sounds [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B41oKdepx8M&t=312.4s)]
*  really bad. And in some cases, I can see how there is a negative consequence. But yeah, just thinking [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B41oKdepx8M&t=319.76s)]
*  through how this can be framed as something new. And I will just add one more thing there, which is [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B41oKdepx8M&t=325.68s)]
*  your examples of cars and applying horses to them reminded me of a conversation I had recently, [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B41oKdepx8M&t=332.0s)]
*  which is someone basically saying, I want to get an electric vehicle, but man, I just love hearing [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B41oKdepx8M&t=340.47999999999996s)]
*  the sound of my car. They just love that familiarity. And I was like, huh, I wonder, I mean, [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B41oKdepx8M&t=346.47999999999996s)]
*  I could see an electric vehicle company one day, maybe just like adding in that sound for [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B41oKdepx8M&t=352.56s)]
*  familiarity. It's not creating the same emissions, but again, giving someone that [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B41oKdepx8M&t=357.03999999999996s)]
*  bridge that you talked about that familiarity bridge of what they like and what they love and [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B41oKdepx8M&t=360.96s)]
*  what they're familiar with. And then just giving them almost like a little step towards the next. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B41oKdepx8M&t=364.88s)]
*  Totally. Elevators used to be obviously hand operated. And then by the time we got to the [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B41oKdepx8M&t=369.84s)]
*  1950s, automatic elevator technology existed, but people didn't want to get in them, because they [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B41oKdepx8M&t=375.03999999999996s)]
*  were used to having a human being operating it. And consider it, there's literally no other example [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B41oKdepx8M&t=380.56s)]
*  in the world, or at least that the average person will use in which you walk into a completely [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B41oKdepx8M&t=390.56s)]
*  enclosed space with no windows and no human operator, and it moves you. It's not that I [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B41oKdepx8M&t=396.64s)]
*  was like it. And so people weren't getting into these things. Now there were also all these kind [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B41oKdepx8M&t=403.44s)]
*  of interesting fear mongering campaigns happening from elevator operator unions that were also [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B41oKdepx8M&t=407.52s)]
*  contributing to it. But anyway, you know, one of the ways that one of the ways that the elevator [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B41oKdepx8M&t=411.76s)]
*  industry found could get people inside the doors was by recognizing that what people needed wasn't [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B41oKdepx8M&t=416.79999999999995s)]
*  necessarily a actual human. What they needed was the feeling that there was a human involved [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B41oKdepx8M&t=423.28s)]
*  and that there was a human touch. There was a human that would be there to their aid if something [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B41oKdepx8M&t=429.2s)]
*  went wrong. And simply adding in a soothing female voice that said things like going up, [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B41oKdepx8M&t=435.92s)]
*  going down, floor one, floor two, that that by itself helped a lot of people feel comfortable [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B41oKdepx8M&t=443.52000000000004s)]
*  getting into the elevator. So that reminds me a lot of your example with the electric car making [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B41oKdepx8M&t=450.40000000000003s)]
*  that noise. I mean, we do things like that all the time. Potato chips are engineered not just for [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B41oKdepx8M&t=455.12s)]
*  flavor, but for crunch. And there's a reason for that. It's because people are looking for those [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B41oKdepx8M&t=458.96000000000004s)]
*  kinds of things as signals of quality. So you have to understand where people are and then start to [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B41oKdepx8M&t=462.88s)]
*  build from there. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B41oKdepx8M&t=467.84s)]
