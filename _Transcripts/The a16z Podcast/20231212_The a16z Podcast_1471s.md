# Big Ideas in 2024: Programming Medicine’s Final Frontier with Jorge Conde
**The a16z Podcast:** [December 12, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wnNIGsIOvY)
*  Precision delivery of medicine. Entertainment franchise games absolutely exploding. Small [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wnNIGsIOvY&t=0.0s)]
*  modular reactors and the nuclear renaissance. Plus, AI moving into very complex workflows. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wnNIGsIOvY&t=6.4s)]
*  Now these were just a few of the major tech innovations that partners at A16Z predicted [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wnNIGsIOvY&t=13.44s)]
*  last year. And our partners are back. We just dropped our list of over 40 plus big ideas for [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wnNIGsIOvY&t=18.88s)]
*  2024. A compilation of critical advancements across all our verticals. From smart energy [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wnNIGsIOvY&t=25.439999999999998s)]
*  grids to crime detecting computer vision to democratizing miracle drugs like GLP-1s [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wnNIGsIOvY&t=31.04s)]
*  or even AI moving from black box to clear box. You can find the full list of 40 plus [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wnNIGsIOvY&t=36.56s)]

*  description below. But on deck today, you will hear directly from one of our partners [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wnNIGsIOvY&t=51.12s)]
*  as we dive even more deeply into their big idea. What's the why now? What opportunities and what [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wnNIGsIOvY&t=56.64s)]
*  challenges are on the horizon? And how can you get involved? Let's dive in. As a reminder, the content [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wnNIGsIOvY&t=62.4s)]

*  investments in the companies discussed in this podcast. For more details, including a link to [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wnNIGsIOvY&t=86.72s)]
*  our investments, please see a16z.com slash disclosures. Hi, my name is Jorge Conde. I'm [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wnNIGsIOvY&t=91.6s)]
*  one of the general partners here at Adresin Horowitz. I'm on the Bio and Health team where [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wnNIGsIOvY&t=100.8s)]
*  I focus on investments in the life sciences. My big idea for the year is programming medicine's [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wnNIGsIOvY&t=104.72s)]
*  final frontier. Where are the reusable rockets for biotech? Traditional drug development is painstakingly [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wnNIGsIOvY&t=110.72s)]
*  time consuming, risky and expensive. It's highly bespoke too. One molecule has no bearing on the [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wnNIGsIOvY&t=117.03999999999999s)]
*  next molecule that gets developed. Like traditional rockets, they're one time use only. That's [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wnNIGsIOvY&t=123.68s)]
*  changing. SpaceX's rocket reusability has transformed space travel, lowering costs and [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wnNIGsIOvY&t=129.52s)]
*  expanding horizons. Similarly, potentially curative programmable medicines like gene therapy [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wnNIGsIOvY&t=135.60000000000002s)]
*  can reuse components like the delivery vehicles used to target specific cells while swapping out [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wnNIGsIOvY&t=142.32000000000002s)]
*  the genetic cargo. The next mission uses the same rocket to deliver a different payload to a new [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wnNIGsIOvY&t=148.64000000000001s)]
*  destination. The FDA is looking to the skies and taking a page out of the FAA's approach to [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wnNIGsIOvY&t=154.16s)]
*  aviation safety. Rigorous yet adaptive. Recently launching its own new office for therapeutic [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wnNIGsIOvY&t=159.76s)]
*  products and piloting Operation Warp Speed for Rare Disease to create more transparent and flexible [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wnNIGsIOvY&t=165.76s)]
*  processes for evaluating and approving programmable medicines. Imagine a future where we redeploy, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wnNIGsIOvY&t=172.0s)]
*  not reinvent, innovation. It will revolutionize how we make medicines and where these medicines [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wnNIGsIOvY&t=178.0s)]
*  can take us. All right. So Jorge, I feel like this big idea is so compelling. This idea of [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wnNIGsIOvY&t=184.0s)]
*  programming medicine certainly sounds like something that the whole world could benefit from. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wnNIGsIOvY&t=189.84s)]
*  But before we get into that, maybe you could just break down a little bit further why traditional [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wnNIGsIOvY&t=196.32s)]
*  drug development is, as you say, so painstakingly time consuming, risky and expensive. And maybe [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wnNIGsIOvY&t=201.52s)]
*  also just put a number to that. Like how long does it really take for drugs to be developed in 2023 [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wnNIGsIOvY&t=208.08s)]
*  terms? Sure. So first of all, the reason why it's so painstaking, it's so time consuming, [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wnNIGsIOvY&t=213.76s)]
*  it's risky and expensive is because we're putting something into human beings. And so of course, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wnNIGsIOvY&t=220.95999999999998s)]
*  the bar of what we're going to do should be and is exceedingly high. In terms of how long it takes, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wnNIGsIOvY&t=226.07999999999998s)]
*  these are averages of averages, of course. But on average, it could take anywhere between 10 [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wnNIGsIOvY&t=234.23999999999998s)]
*  to 15 years to develop a drug, to get it to patients. And that's obviously a very, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wnNIGsIOvY&t=239.36s)]
*  very long time, especially in diseases where people are desperately in need for better [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wnNIGsIOvY&t=245.36s)]
*  treatments. So why does it take 10 to 15 years typically? Well, typically there are three stages [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wnNIGsIOvY&t=249.92000000000002s)]
*  in developing a medicine. The first one is what we would call the actual drug discovery stage, [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wnNIGsIOvY&t=256.0s)]
*  which is the work that goes into finding a target in a disease that you would like to hit [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wnNIGsIOvY&t=262.24s)]
*  with a medicine. In some cases, that target is already known. In some cases, you're looking to [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wnNIGsIOvY&t=269.92s)]
*  discover new targets to go after to have better treatment options for a given disease. That can [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wnNIGsIOvY&t=276.56s)]
*  take many, many years, even in that first phase. The second phase is what we call preclinical [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wnNIGsIOvY&t=281.52s)]
*  development. So now it's this work of once you have a target you think is worth hitting, [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wnNIGsIOvY&t=287.59999999999997s)]
*  and you have a molecule that you think hits that target, you have to do all of the work to develop [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wnNIGsIOvY&t=293.59999999999997s)]
*  that molecule into a medicine to ensuring that it has all the qualities of what you want a medicine [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wnNIGsIOvY&t=299.44s)]
*  to have in terms of how it's absorbed and how it's metabolized and where it goes to into body [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wnNIGsIOvY&t=305.2s)]
*  and whether or not it's toxic. And if so, how much of it is toxic? All of that work we do in [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wnNIGsIOvY&t=310.24s)]
*  what we call preclinical development outside of humans. We do this in dishes and cells. We can do [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wnNIGsIOvY&t=316.72s)]
*  this in animal models like mice or even monkeys. And that, as you can imagine, also takes many, [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wnNIGsIOvY&t=322.40000000000003s)]
*  many years. And then of course, there's the third phase, which is the most important phase, which is [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wnNIGsIOvY&t=327.28000000000003s)]
*  what we call clinical development, which is the terms that many would be familiar with in terms [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wnNIGsIOvY&t=332.08000000000004s)]
*  of human clinical trials, where there's a phase one trial, a phase two trial, and a phase three [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wnNIGsIOvY&t=339.92s)]
*  trial. And that process can take anywhere between five to seven years. And so when you add up all [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wnNIGsIOvY&t=344.48s)]
*  of those phases, the drug discovery phase, the preclinical development phase, the clinical [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wnNIGsIOvY&t=351.36s)]
*  development phase, that's how you get to these 10 to 15 years. And I should add that once you're [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wnNIGsIOvY&t=355.44s)]
*  done with clinical trials, you now have to file for regulatory approval. So here in the U.S., [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wnNIGsIOvY&t=361.28000000000003s)]
*  you file with the FDA. The process by which these applications get reviewed by the FDA, [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wnNIGsIOvY&t=366.48s)]
*  despite the FDA's best efforts, can take one, sometimes even two years to go through. So again, [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wnNIGsIOvY&t=373.44000000000005s)]
*  when you sum all of that up, you can see why it can often take well over a decade to make a medicine. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wnNIGsIOvY&t=379.04s)]
*  Absolutely. And to your point, the bar being high is a very reasonable concept. But where does [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wnNIGsIOvY&t=386.96000000000004s)]
*  programmable medicine come into play here? And how does that maybe change the paradigm across each of [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wnNIGsIOvY&t=393.20000000000005s)]
*  those stages? Or where does it have the potential to really reshape that arc? [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wnNIGsIOvY&t=398.56s)]
*  Yeah, so I think this is where the concept of a programmable medicine potentially could be [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wnNIGsIOvY&t=404.0s)]
*  very transformative to how we think about developing drugs. And that is because in [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wnNIGsIOvY&t=409.04s)]
*  a programmable medicine, there are multiple components that could be, as I described, [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wnNIGsIOvY&t=414.64s)]
*  redeployed for different applications. So let me give you an example. A gene therapy is this idea [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wnNIGsIOvY&t=420.0s)]
*  that you can deliver a genetic payload. In other words, you can deliver a gene to a cell [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wnNIGsIOvY&t=427.04s)]
*  that has a defective version of that gene. If we're able to make a medicine that does that, [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wnNIGsIOvY&t=435.20000000000005s)]
*  that can deliver one gene to a given cell type, it becomes increasingly likely that we'll be able [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wnNIGsIOvY&t=440.96000000000004s)]
*  to deliver a different gene to a different cell type for a different disease. And that's very [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wnNIGsIOvY&t=447.84000000000003s)]
*  different than the way we traditionally make medicines. If you think about a traditional [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wnNIGsIOvY&t=453.44s)]
*  medicine, like a chemical, a molecule, that is a chemical that is tested and designed for [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wnNIGsIOvY&t=457.44s)]
*  a specific disease, a specific target. The second you switch the target, we don't reuse the atoms [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wnNIGsIOvY&t=465.36s)]
*  in the molecule and try to fit them into a new target. We just design a different molecule. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wnNIGsIOvY&t=472.48s)]
*  And that's why I say, you know, in traditional drug development, one molecule has very little [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wnNIGsIOvY&t=476.96s)]
*  bearing on the next molecule you design. But in the case of these programmable medicines, [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wnNIGsIOvY&t=482.88s)]
*  where all the components can be reused, you just have to essentially redirect or redeploy [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wnNIGsIOvY&t=487.52s)]
*  components like, you know, delivery vehicles for gene therapies, or in the case of a gene [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wnNIGsIOvY&t=495.12s)]
*  editing medicine, just redirect what edit you want the enzyme or the protein to make. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wnNIGsIOvY&t=500.88s)]
*  And that is where the programmability comes in. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wnNIGsIOvY&t=508.24s)]
*  And that sounds huge, right? Just so I understand you correctly, [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wnNIGsIOvY&t=512.48s)]
*  when you're talking about the reusability of these medicines, it's basically the equivalent [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wnNIGsIOvY&t=516.0s)]
*  of the reusable rocket is the almost like the, you basically would have already gotten [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wnNIGsIOvY&t=522.72s)]
*  a certain drug approved to be able to deliver something. Each time you're reiterating on that, [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wnNIGsIOvY&t=532.0s)]
*  would you then need to have the specific genetic, almost like payload in there, [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wnNIGsIOvY&t=538.4000000000001s)]
*  reapproved, but most of that legwork has already been done? Am I thinking about that correctly? [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wnNIGsIOvY&t=544.5600000000001s)]
*  That's right. In this analogy, what we would love to see become possible is that, [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wnNIGsIOvY&t=549.2800000000001s)]
*  the rocket in this case is the vehicle by which you ensure that your payload is delivered, right? [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wnNIGsIOvY&t=556.4s)]
*  And some of the most common ones that we know in terms of what would be rockets here are the LNP [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wnNIGsIOvY&t=562.48s)]
*  molecules that all of the COVID vaccines that many of us received were delivered. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wnNIGsIOvY&t=569.6s)]
*  The COVID vaccine was mRNA. mRNA had the instruction for what it wanted your body to make, [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wnNIGsIOvY&t=574.0s)]
*  and that was encapsulated in this LNP particle, lipid nanoparticle. It's like a little ball of fat. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wnNIGsIOvY&t=579.2s)]
*  Similarly, for a lot of gene therapies, instead of using an LNP particle, we use something called [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wnNIGsIOvY&t=588.0s)]
*  an AAV, which is an adapted virus. It stands for adeno-associated virus. There have been examples [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wnNIGsIOvY&t=593.12s)]
*  in the clinic where payloads have been delivered with LNP or payloads have been delivered with AAV. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wnNIGsIOvY&t=601.84s)]
*  For different applications, all you're swapping out is the cargo, the instruction of mRNA that's [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wnNIGsIOvY&t=608.72s)]
*  in that LNP or the instructions or the genetic cargo that's in that AAV. This is very timely [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wnNIGsIOvY&t=614.0s)]
*  because the FDA is starting to signal that they are looking for ways to be increasingly adaptive [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wnNIGsIOvY&t=620.96s)]
*  to ensure that they can adequately review these therapies that are reusing components, [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wnNIGsIOvY&t=629.12s)]
*  but do so in a way that will be both rigorous but also adaptive and therefore hopefully more speedy. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wnNIGsIOvY&t=636.56s)]
*  Where people don't have to start from scratch because they already have that rocket [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wnNIGsIOvY&t=642.4s)]
*  that is reapplicable. Tell us a little more about that where the FDA seems to be taking maybe some [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wnNIGsIOvY&t=646.88s)]
*  inspiration or at least that's what you allude to with the FAI. What can they learn from the rocket [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wnNIGsIOvY&t=652.88s)]
*  reusability in this analogy? What also may be fundamentally different? What are you taking [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wnNIGsIOvY&t=660.7199999999999s)]
*  from some of the new announcements like the new Office of Therapeutic Products? [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wnNIGsIOvY&t=665.68s)]
*  I think there's a lot of things to take from this. The first one is that I think there's [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wnNIGsIOvY&t=670.4s)]
*  real recognition here that we are seeing meaningful innovation in terms of the kinds of medicines we [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wnNIGsIOvY&t=674.8s)]
*  can make. The FDA is appropriately trying to find ways to retain their rigor because again, [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wnNIGsIOvY&t=682.2399999999999s)]
*  they have an extraordinarily high obligation to ensure safety and efficacy in patients, [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wnNIGsIOvY&t=690.56s)]
*  but to move hopefully more quickly to attempt to keep up with all the innovation we're seeing. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wnNIGsIOvY&t=696.4799999999999s)]
*  They've pushed forward on several fronts that I think are already pointing us in that direction. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wnNIGsIOvY&t=704.4s)]
*  The first one is they've announced an Office of Therapeutic Products whose mandate and mission [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wnNIGsIOvY&t=710.88s)]
*  is to find ways to do exactly what we've been describing. I think the industry, the drug [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wnNIGsIOvY&t=718.7199999999999s)]
*  development industry now has a partner in the FDA in trying to find the best paths forward along [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wnNIGsIOvY&t=725.76s)]
*  the lines of what we talked about. The second is they are also trying to innovate themselves. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wnNIGsIOvY&t=732.7199999999999s)]
*  The FDA is looking to be more nimble and is running experiments to find ways to do exactly that. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wnNIGsIOvY&t=738.7199999999999s)]
*  For example, many of us would be familiar with Operation Warp Street, which was the effort by [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wnNIGsIOvY&t=747.28s)]
*  the government to try to ensure that the COVID vaccines could reach all of us in a very, very [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wnNIGsIOvY&t=753.5999999999999s)]
*  timely manner given the nature of the pandemic. Well, the FDA has said there are so many intractable [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wnNIGsIOvY&t=759.12s)]
*  diseases, many rare genetic diseases that have no good therapeutic or treatment options. They are [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wnNIGsIOvY&t=765.28s)]
*  launching a pilot program mirroring the concept of Operation Warp Speed, but to apply that to [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wnNIGsIOvY&t=773.2s)]
*  rare diseases where they are going to run some experiments to see different ways that the agency [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wnNIGsIOvY&t=779.76s)]
*  can interact with industry to get these medicines more quickly to the patients that so desperately [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wnNIGsIOvY&t=785.0400000000001s)]
*  need them. I think those are very, very promising signs that both the industry and the government [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wnNIGsIOvY&t=791.9200000000001s)]
*  are looking for ways to ensure these innovations reach patients in a timely and responsible manner. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wnNIGsIOvY&t=798.72s)]
*  There are also other proof points that we can point to that are happening every day right now. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wnNIGsIOvY&t=804.1600000000001s)]
*  For example, several companies that are developing cutting edge gene editing medicines are starting [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wnNIGsIOvY&t=810.4s)]
*  to get approvals by the FDA to move forward with some of their key clinical trials. There had been [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wnNIGsIOvY&t=817.84s)]
*  a moment in time where the FDA was being more hesitant, but I think as they've started to [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wnNIGsIOvY&t=825.04s)]
*  evaluate these technologies more carefully, they've started to develop a path forward for [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wnNIGsIOvY&t=829.8399999999999s)]
*  these medicines to continue to get developed. The breaking news is that the first CRISPR therapy [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wnNIGsIOvY&t=835.5999999999999s)]
*  has been approved. This is a therapy for sickle cell anemia and beta thalassemia that was developed [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wnNIGsIOvY&t=842.3199999999999s)]
*  by a biopharmaceutical company called Vertex Pharmaceuticals working with another company [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wnNIGsIOvY&t=849.4399999999999s)]
*  called CRISPR Therapeutics. This is a therapy for essentially curing a genetic disease, [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wnNIGsIOvY&t=854.56s)]
*  in this case, sickle cell anemia, by taking the relevant cells out of the body, editing them [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wnNIGsIOvY&t=861.8399999999999s)]
*  with the CRISPR gene editing technology, and putting them back in the body in a way that results in a [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wnNIGsIOvY&t=870.0s)]
*  functional cure. This is a big deal for so many reasons. The first one, it's the first time [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wnNIGsIOvY&t=877.52s)]
*  that a CRISPR therapy has been approved as a medicine. The second reason why this is a big [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wnNIGsIOvY&t=882.96s)]
*  idea, a big deal, is that I think it's an important milestone to this point about the future of what [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wnNIGsIOvY&t=888.96s)]
*  programmable medicines could look like. Now that you have a first approval, you've demonstrated [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wnNIGsIOvY&t=894.96s)]
*  that a CRISPR editor could be safely used as a medicine, so now if it edits something differently, [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wnNIGsIOvY&t=901.0400000000001s)]
*  the process for getting that approved should hopefully be shorter and faster. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wnNIGsIOvY&t=908.24s)]
*  The third reason I think that this is a big deal in terms of a milestone is, relatively speaking, [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wnNIGsIOvY&t=913.6s)]
*  how quickly this has happened. You asked me at the beginning, how long does it take to make a drug? [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wnNIGsIOvY&t=919.6s)]
*  I said about 10 to 15 years on average. It's barely been 10 years since the concept of CRISPR [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wnNIGsIOvY&t=926.64s)]
*  was discovered and described in the scientific literature. We went from the initial discovery [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wnNIGsIOvY&t=934.48s)]
*  of CRISPR as a potential use as a medicine all the way to an approval in just over 10 years. That is [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wnNIGsIOvY&t=939.92s)]
*  lightning fast in this world. It's just an exciting moment in time, I think, for the industry and [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wnNIGsIOvY&t=948.8s)]
*  hopefully for all the various patients that are looking for better solutions and treatments for [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wnNIGsIOvY&t=955.36s)]
*  their disease. Maybe you could just speak a little more to that. If we are able to see this confluence [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wnNIGsIOvY&t=960.0799999999999s)]
*  that you're discussing and this idea of programmable medicine becoming a reality, [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wnNIGsIOvY&t=966.64s)]
*  what does that really mean in terms of the speed of therapies coming, the number of them, [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wnNIGsIOvY&t=971.6s)]
*  the new business models that might be unlocked, how this might ultimately end up impacting patients? [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wnNIGsIOvY&t=978.7199999999999s)]
*  Any high-level thoughts about this, if we are moving to this new paradigm, what that really means? [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wnNIGsIOvY&t=984.56s)]
*  Yeah, I think it means a couple of things. The first one is I think it means that for the benefit [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wnNIGsIOvY&t=990.5600000000001s)]
*  of patients, every time we run a clinical trial with these types of medicines, we're not starting [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wnNIGsIOvY&t=996.8000000000001s)]
*  from square zero or from square one because we already know something about the various [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wnNIGsIOvY&t=1003.12s)]
*  components in the therapy. That's the first thing. The second thing is that generally speaking, [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wnNIGsIOvY&t=1009.36s)]
*  these programmable medicines are going after diseases where the cause of the disease is very [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wnNIGsIOvY&t=1016.0s)]
*  well known. In other words, it's a known mutation and it's the ability to intervene has been [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wnNIGsIOvY&t=1022.16s)]
*  in an effective way has been what's been elusive for us. In a lot of ways, these new programmable [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wnNIGsIOvY&t=1029.76s)]
*  medicines are just a fundamentally new superpower. We can go after diseases that we weren't able to [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wnNIGsIOvY&t=1035.12s)]
*  go after before. As a result, the third thing that I think this means for all of us is that we may [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wnNIGsIOvY&t=1040.0s)]
*  be on the cusp where the elusive C word is a reality that we might actually have cures for lots [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wnNIGsIOvY&t=1045.76s)]
*  of very intractable problems. That is a very new day indeed. That is something that it just has not [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wnNIGsIOvY&t=1053.12s)]
*  been very common in our industry. I think there's lots of reasons to be excited. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wnNIGsIOvY&t=1059.84s)]
*  Yeah. As you're talking, I'm actually smiling because it's impossible not to be excited. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wnNIGsIOvY&t=1064.96s)]
*  But I guess just to close things off, you've painted this beautiful picture of what may be [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wnNIGsIOvY&t=1072.0s)]
*  to come. Could you share a little bit more about the blockers, if any, whether regulatory, whether [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wnNIGsIOvY&t=1075.92s)]
*  it has to do with the fundamental science that's coming on board? What would you say if this reality [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wnNIGsIOvY&t=1081.44s)]
*  that you're painting were to not come to pass? What would those reasons be? And also maybe for [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wnNIGsIOvY&t=1088.5600000000002s)]
*  those listening, how can builders get involved? How can they actually help make this reality come [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wnNIGsIOvY&t=1095.28s)]
*  true? Yeah. First of all, in terms of the blockers, I think there are several and I think they are [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wnNIGsIOvY&t=1100.48s)]
*  important and some of the blockers should be there. The first one is everything I'm describing [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wnNIGsIOvY&t=1106.88s)]
*  in terms of these programmable medicines has another side of the coin to it, which is these [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wnNIGsIOvY&t=1112.72s)]
*  are largely speaking permanent medicines as well. If you take a pill and you have a bad reaction [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wnNIGsIOvY&t=1118.88s)]
*  or adverse event or toxic reaction to that pill, you just stop taking the pill and eventually [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wnNIGsIOvY&t=1129.04s)]
*  your body will clear it and hopefully the toxicity has been addressed. In the case of making a [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wnNIGsIOvY&t=1134.8799999999999s)]
*  permanent edit in DNA, if there is an error, if there is a toxicity that comes from making that [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wnNIGsIOvY&t=1141.28s)]
*  edit something inadvertently, it's permanent or at least it has the potential to be permanent. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wnNIGsIOvY&t=1148.72s)]
*  And so for that reason, the FDA appropriately has an extraordinarily high bar for how they think [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wnNIGsIOvY&t=1155.0400000000002s)]
*  about evaluating the safety of these medicines and how they think about which diseases are [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wnNIGsIOvY&t=1160.64s)]
*  probably the most appropriate to go after with something that is potentially a cure but also [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wnNIGsIOvY&t=1166.64s)]
*  potentially permanent. So that's one blocker that is going to need to be addressed systematically [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wnNIGsIOvY&t=1172.88s)]
*  and it should be. A second blocker is one of the most, the only medicines that work [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wnNIGsIOvY&t=1180.96s)]
*  are the ones that get to patients and these programmable medicines have a couple of challenges [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wnNIGsIOvY&t=1188.56s)]
*  in terms of accessibility. The first one is these are not pills you get over the counter. These are [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wnNIGsIOvY&t=1195.1200000000001s)]
*  very complex medicines and so therefore the process by which you get treated can be a very long [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wnNIGsIOvY&t=1201.6000000000001s)]
*  and difficult process. So I just described the approval of CRISPR therapy for sickle cell anemia. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wnNIGsIOvY&t=1211.2s)]
*  The process by which you get the treatment could take months because you have to go, [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wnNIGsIOvY&t=1220.32s)]
*  you have to get your cells removed, the cells get edited. In this case, you actually have to get a [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wnNIGsIOvY&t=1227.1200000000001s)]
*  form of therapy to kill your internal cells so you can replace it with the corrected ones afterwards. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wnNIGsIOvY&t=1233.3600000000001s)]
*  And that could be a long stay at the hospital. So that whole process could take several months. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wnNIGsIOvY&t=1241.3600000000001s)]
*  So the accessibility of these therapies will limit how many people can get them and when. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wnNIGsIOvY&t=1246.08s)]
*  And the second element to accessibility is cost. And today, these therapies can cost on the order [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wnNIGsIOvY&t=1253.68s)]
*  of millions of dollars. Now, on the one hand, that millions of dollars of cost is justified because [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wnNIGsIOvY&t=1262.0s)]
*  a lot of R&D went into it. They're very expensive to make and manufacture. It's very expensive to [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wnNIGsIOvY&t=1269.92s)]
*  manufacture all these components I'm describing. And that's number two. And then number three, [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wnNIGsIOvY&t=1275.52s)]
*  they provide a fair amount of benefit. In the case of treating a baby that had something like [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wnNIGsIOvY&t=1280.8799999999999s)]
*  somatic muscular atrophy that would have otherwise died, a one and done gene therapy from Novartis, [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wnNIGsIOvY&t=1286.24s)]
*  this is a therapy that's worth about its cost about $2.1 million effectively saves that baby's [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wnNIGsIOvY&t=1292.8s)]
*  life. So there's an incredible amount of value that comes from that. But the cost of discovering, [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wnNIGsIOvY&t=1300.8s)]
*  developing, manufacturing these therapies and the benefit that they come from also comes with a [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wnNIGsIOvY&t=1305.68s)]
*  very hefty price tag and that's going to limit accessibility. So that's one of the other key [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wnNIGsIOvY&t=1310.3999999999999s)]
*  blockers, I would say, that we're seeing in this space. Now, how can builders help? I think builders [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wnNIGsIOvY&t=1316.6399999999999s)]
*  can help in a very important way, which is if there is one technology on this planet that can [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wnNIGsIOvY&t=1321.92s)]
*  scale better than anything else we know of, it's biology. And so all of the things I'm describing [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wnNIGsIOvY&t=1328.24s)]
*  in terms of blockers to access at some point can be addressed by improving our ability to engineer [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wnNIGsIOvY&t=1336.48s)]
*  biology to address some of these limitations. So improved biology can make manufacturing much more [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wnNIGsIOvY&t=1344.5600000000002s)]
*  scalable and therefore much less expensive. Improving the kinds of interventions and the [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wnNIGsIOvY&t=1351.1200000000001s)]
*  precision by which these programmable medicines work can address some of these questions of [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wnNIGsIOvY&t=1358.96s)]
*  permanence or toxicity. So where the builders can really help is just become better programmers in [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wnNIGsIOvY&t=1363.76s)]
*  biology and from that, we will get better applications at higher scale and at lower cost [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wnNIGsIOvY&t=1370.64s)]
*  and hopefully get them in the hands of patients more quickly. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wnNIGsIOvY&t=1376.32s)]
*  That's amazing. And maybe one super quick question to end things off is, you know, [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wnNIGsIOvY&t=1379.6s)]
*  a lot of our listeners are familiar with the idea of exponentially decreasing cost and things like [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wnNIGsIOvY&t=1384.08s)]
*  software. Do you see that same kind of curve being applied here when you're talking about decreasing [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wnNIGsIOvY&t=1390.56s)]
*  costs? Is that really the future that you're painting where these things instead of costing [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wnNIGsIOvY&t=1396.72s)]
*  millions of dollars, we're talking thousands? Is that really in the future? [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wnNIGsIOvY&t=1400.96s)]
*  That's the hope. And the possibility is there. Because again, you know, biology can scale [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wnNIGsIOvY&t=1404.8s)]
*  exponentially. We all did come from one cell and here we are. We're sitting here. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wnNIGsIOvY&t=1410.72s)]
*  That's such a great point. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wnNIGsIOvY&t=1414.56s)]
*  Yeah. So I think, you know, but there's work to be done there. We haven't seen it yet. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wnNIGsIOvY&t=1416.24s)]
*  But that's the promise and that's the hope. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wnNIGsIOvY&t=1420.32s)]
*  All right. I hope you enjoyed this big idea. We do have a lot more on the way, [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wnNIGsIOvY&t=1422.48s)]
