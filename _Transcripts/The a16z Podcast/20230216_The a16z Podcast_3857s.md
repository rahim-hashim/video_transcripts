Video Description: A small minority – likely less than 1% – of the world can code. Yet also widely known that the skillset yields outsized returns, with developers generating some of the highest paying salaries out there.

But even this field is quickly shifting, especially with the advent of wide-scale AI. Today we get to chat with Amjad Masad, CEO and founder of Replit, about these foundational shifts.

We dive into how Replit has integrated AI into its platform and the implications on both current and future developers. It’s easier than ever to learn to code, but is it still worthwhile? And does the 10x engineer really exist? Listen in to find out.

# The 1000x Developer with Amjad Masad
**The a16z Podcast:** [February 16, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o)
*  And we're seeing people making software in 30-minute increments. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=0.0s)]
*  Someone the other day put a request for a landing page up. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3.6s)]
*  They attached a Figma file. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=6.44s)]
*  They got it back in 30 minutes. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=8.120000000000001s)]
*  That's really never been done before. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=10.200000000000001s)]
*  And why shouldn't have it existed like that before? [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=11.96s)]
*  It's hard to find concrete numbers, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=16.04s)]
*  but some estimates predict that less than 1% of the world [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=17.6s)]
*  knows how to code. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=20.36s)]
*  Yet it's also widely known that the minority of people [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=21.6s)]
*  who know how to not only consume but create software [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=24.6s)]
*  yield outsize returns. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=27.72s)]
*  With some developers generating some of the highest paying salaries out there. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=29.2s)]
*  But even this field is shifting quickly, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=32.88s)]
*  especially with the advent of wide-scale AI. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=34.52s)]
*  And in this interview, we get to chat with Amjad Massad, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=37.2s)]
*  founder of Replet, an integrated development environment [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=39.68s)]
*  that allows you to code live in the browser. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=42.120000000000005s)]
*  Here we chat about how Replet has tackled the difficult problem [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=44.6s)]
*  of making coding fun, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=47.08s)]
*  but also how it's now integrating AI into its platform via Ghostwriter [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=48.519999999999996s)]
*  and the implications of these shifts on both current and future developers [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=52.400000000000006s)]
*  in addition to the applications that can be built. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=56.04s)]
*  As a personal anecdote, I actually taught myself to code in 2018. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=58.519999999999996s)]
*  And to this day, it's one of the best decisions I've ever made. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=62.199999999999996s)]
*  And despite screaming this from the rooftops, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=65.24s)]
*  still many other people find it extremely daunting. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=67.72s)]
*  My journey took around 300 hours. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=70.67999999999999s)]
*  Yes, I tracked it. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=72.44s)]
*  But with the advancements in tooling and technology, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=73.64s)]
*  it may actually be easier than ever to learn to code. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=76.64s)]
*  And I was surprised to hear from Amjad [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=79.56s)]
*  just how quickly he thinks people can get up to speed today. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=81.4s)]
*  Let's get started. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=84.16s)]
*  As a reminder, the content here is for informational purposes only, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=86.0s)]

*  For more details, please see a16z.com slash disclosures. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=100.32s)]
*  Amjad, thank you so much for joining the A16Z podcast. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=104.2s)]
*  It's my pleasure. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=107.2s)]
*  I've been listening to this podcast for a really long time, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=108.2s)]
*  so it's great to be finally on. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=110.44s)]
*  Yeah, well, we're happy to have you. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=112.2s)]
*  So just to set the tone for listeners, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=113.76s)]
*  you are the founder and CEO of Replet. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=116.92s)]
*  I think you're also the head of engineering now, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=119.16s)]
*  but we'll get to that. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=121.04s)]
*  Can you just share what Replet is [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=123.04s)]
*  and what it's like to be a part of this podcast? [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=125.2s)]
*  So, Amjad, I'm going to start with a question [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=128.08s)]
*  that I've been getting a lot of questions about. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=130.48000000000002s)]
*  I want to share what Replet is, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=132.52s)]
*  and I'm probably getting a little ahead of myself, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=134.52s)]
*  but how it differs from maybe other similar products [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=137.0s)]
*  or development environments, whether it's SCORM [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=140.68s)]
*  or just other IDEs out there. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=142.96s)]
*  I like to think about Replet as the technology [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=145.48000000000002s)]
*  that reduces the distance between an idea and a product. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=151.68s)]
*  The moment any person in the world [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=155.28s)]
*  gets an idea for a piece of software [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=158.88s)]
*  and the distance between having that idea [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=162.08s)]
*  and making something in the world is typically very large. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=165.52s)]
*  The internet has really reduced things down further, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=169.12s)]
*  and we think Replet is the ultimate answer there [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=172.28s)]
*  where we want to get to a place where the moment you get an idea, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=177.72s)]
*  you just Replet, and that's where the name came from. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=183.44s)]
*  And we do that in a number of ways. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=187.24s)]
*  One way is that we just simplify the development process. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=189.48s)]
*  Crucially, we don't make it stunted. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=192.88s)]
*  Like a lot of tools think that to simplify is to reduce the power. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=195.8s)]
*  We actually keep the power [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=202.2s)]
*  while also making the process a lot more enjoyable and learnable. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=204.35999999999999s)]
*  We also superpower it with AI. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=209.04s)]
*  We also have various courses and things [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=211.36s)]
*  that can teach you how to code. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=214.64s)]
*  If you don't think coding is for you, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=216.48s)]
*  then you can hire someone from our community [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=219.24s)]
*  to make the program for you. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=221.20000000000002s)]
*  So we have this thing called Replet Bounties [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=222.92000000000002s)]
*  where you can just put a price on a project you want to get done, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=225.08s)]
*  describe the project, and then a combination of an AI [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=230.16s)]
*  and a human being will get that done for you. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=233.92000000000002s)]
*  And so it's really ultimately about that idea [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=236.32000000000002s)]
*  of getting from idea to product [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=238.56s)]
*  and will help everyone in the world [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=241.20000000000002s)]
*  kind of have access to that superpower that we call software. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=244.56s)]
*  I love the way you put that [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=248.84s)]
*  because you've kind of represented the different modalities [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=250.44s)]
*  depending on where someone is and their proficiency [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=253.24s)]
*  or at least their hypothetical proficiency [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=255.92000000000002s)]
*  in terms of being able to code. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=257.84000000000003s)]
*  And regardless of where they sit, [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=259.76s)]
*  getting them to that end product, that end vision that they want. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=261.6s)]
*  And we'll get to Ghostwriter, we'll get to Bounties. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=265.88s)]
*  Those are two things that have been released recently. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=267.76s)]
*  But I want to give people a real sense [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=270.6s)]
*  of some of the stories behind Replet [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=272.36s)]
*  because that's something that's really gripped me [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=274.84000000000003s)]
*  as someone who's been following the company [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=276.72s)]
*  for a period of time. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=278.72s)]
*  And I'll call it two, but then I want to play a quick game [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=280.08000000000004s)]
*  so that we can share more of these stories with the audience. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=283.08000000000004s)]
*  So two things that I remember. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=285.92s)]
*  One is recently shared a 13-year-old kid [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=287.68s)]
*  that set up a sizable crypto mining operation via Replet. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=291.20000000000005s)]
*  Another example that I saw a while back was these two kids, [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=296.44000000000005s)]
*  they looked maybe six years old, maybe seven years old, [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=301.24s)]
*  crashing a computer science teacher conference [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=304.0s)]
*  and sharing their startup pitch to the listener. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=307.20000000000005s)]
*  So I just thought those were incredible examples. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=310.92s)]
*  Getting to this idea of a game, [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=312.92s)]
*  I've come up with five or so different scenarios. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=314.68s)]
*  I have no idea if these scenarios [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=318.08000000000004s)]
*  have actually happened on Replet. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=319.96000000000004s)]
*  I haven't shared them with you prior to this. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=321.20000000000005s)]
*  But I think they might stimulate either other stories [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=323.64000000000004s)]
*  that have happened on Replet, [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=326.92s)]
*  or you can tell me if these things have indeed happened. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=328.32000000000005s)]
*  So let's give it a shot. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=330.8s)]
*  The first one is someone has started learning to code via Replet. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=333.12s)]
*  They haven't gotten a computer science degree. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=338.76s)]
*  They haven't done a boot camp. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=341.15999999999997s)]
*  They've learned within Replet [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=342.15999999999997s)]
*  and since been hired as a developer at a fang company. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=343.84s)]
*  Has this happened yet? [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=348.15999999999997s)]
*  I would say it happened, yes. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=349.76s)]
*  So we've had someone who learned to code on Replet, [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=351.2s)]
*  primarily on their own, [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=355.68s)]
*  became a very productive community member [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=357.28s)]
*  and applied to work at Replet. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=360.36s)]
*  And we thought they're very talented, [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=363.71999999999997s)]
*  but at the time there wasn't a really good fit for them. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=365.24s)]
*  And so they started applying for other companies. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=367.8s)]
*  I helped them apply for other companies [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=369.76s)]
*  and they ended up at Google actually. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=372.71999999999997s)]
*  That's awesome. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=375.92s)]
*  Let's move on to the next one. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=376.76s)]
*  Someone has used Replet to build over 50 projects. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=377.92s)]
*  Now you can use your own definition of project here. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=380.92s)]
*  These don't need to be full blown startups, [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=384.68s)]
*  but have you seen someone build that magnitude [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=386.4s)]
*  of projects on Replet? [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=388.88s)]
*  Yeah, I think that's a fairly reasonable number of projects. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=391.23999999999995s)]
*  So there's a six-year-old developer, his name is Rehan. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=397.03999999999996s)]
*  He's one of our most prolific programmers. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=400.79999999999995s)]
*  He actually built a bunch of interesting projects [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=403.67999999999995s)]
*  where he reverse engineered how Replet works [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=408.2s)]
*  and he built an unofficial API. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=413.2s)]
*  One of his unofficial APIs is a security program [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=417.36s)]
*  that searches people's Reples to find Discord tokens. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=421.12s)]
*  So a lot of people build Discord bots on Replet [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=427.64s)]
*  and they copy and paste the tokens in clear text [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=429.71999999999997s)]
*  as opposed to putting them in our encrypted service, [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=432.68s)]
*  the Secrets Manager. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=435.28s)]
*  And so he would find those tokens, [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=436.44s)]
*  he would invalidate them [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=438.96s)]
*  because Discord has service to invalidate those. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=440.12s)]
*  And then he would send them a notification. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=443.0s)]
*  He would say like, hey, we found [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=444.6s)]
*  you've exposed your token. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=446.92s)]
*  So that's one example of a project he made. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=448.96s)]
*  He was and still is one of the most prolific bounty hunters [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=451.48s)]
*  and he built one of our earliest bounties, [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=456.72s)]
*  which was a startup that wanted to build [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=460.08s)]
*  like a stable diffusion based t-shirt generator. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=464.52s)]
*  So he would generate a t-shirt based on a prompt [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=467.52s)]
*  and then get it printed and send to you. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=470.32s)]
*  Like there isn't one week where I don't see Rehan producing [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=472.28000000000003s)]
*  like a new piece of software. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=476.16s)]
*  That's amazing. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=478.48s)]
*  So I would say like 50 is probably [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=479.40000000000003s)]
*  on the low side of things here. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=482.20000000000005s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I undershot it, I guess. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=484.72s)]
*  Let's rapid fire through the last three. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=487.28000000000003s)]
*  The third one is someone has built an app on Replet [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=489.56s)]
*  and through that app has since made a million dollars [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=492.16s)]
*  or more from it. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=495.16s)]
*  A million dollars, I don't think that happened yet. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=496.36s)]
*  There are people that are on trajectory [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=500.24s)]
*  to doing that right now. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=502.68s)]
*  And so there are like bounty hunters [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=504.4s)]
*  that are making thousands and thousands of dollars a week. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=507.52s)]
*  And I think that'll continue to grow. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=510.67999999999995s)]
*  There are startups that are starting entirely [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=512.4s)]
*  on Replet today. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=514.88s)]
*  There are a couple of AI startups [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=516.0s)]
*  that have their entire stack built on Replet. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=518.4s)]
*  And presumably one of those projects [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=523.4s)]
*  will maybe get to a million dollars. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=527.76s)]
*  There are a couple of earlier examples of startups [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=529.88s)]
*  that sort of prototype their projects. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=533.2s)]
*  For example, Fig is this command line autocomplete tool [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=535.4000000000001s)]
*  that this YC startup, I think it was like YC 20 [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=540.96s)]
*  or something like that or YC 21. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=544.2s)]
*  And it's used by tens of thousands of engineers. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=546.12s)]
*  And the original product was entirely built on Replet. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=549.36s)]
*  They're starting to sell. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=553.6800000000001s)]
*  I don't think they're making a million dollars [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=554.88s)]
*  but maybe that's another example of maybe on the path [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=557.0s)]
*  to a million dollars. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=560.84s)]
*  But I would say it would be a success [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=561.8000000000001s)]
*  if someone like an individual person [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=564.32s)]
*  just made a million dollars. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=566.44s)]
*  I think that's really my dream. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=567.96s)]
*  And I hope we can get to that this or next year. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=569.32s)]
*  That's awesome. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=572.2s)]
*  And I should mention, there's a time element to this. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=573.0400000000001s)]
*  I believe Replet was it founded in 2016. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=574.5600000000001s)]
*  That's right. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=577.52s)]
*  So we're around six to seven years later. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=578.36s)]
*  So let's see how things progress. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=580.64s)]
*  Next one is someone over the age of 90. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=582.52s)]
*  I went a little crazy with this one. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=587.52s)]
*  Someone over the age of 90 has used Replet. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=589.8s)]
*  Has this happened? [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=592.0799999999999s)]
*  Someone who ended up working at Replet, [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=593.24s)]
*  their grandpa in India is like a physics PhD. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=597.24s)]
*  They do a lot of like physics sort of writing. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=602.4799999999999s)]
*  And in one recent paper they published, [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=605.74s)]
*  they used Replet to write a physics simulation. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=609.3599999999999s)]
*  And Replet was published as part of that paper. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=613.64s)]
*  I don't believe they're 90, [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=616.4799999999999s)]
*  but they're definitely 70 plus. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=617.8s)]
*  Okay, final one. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=620.68s)]
*  Strangers have met via Replet. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=621.52s)]
*  Maybe it's the forum, [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=623.36s)]
*  maybe working on a project together [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=624.2s)]
*  and have since gotten married. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=626.04s)]
*  Man, that would be awesome to know. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=630.0s)]
*  I haven't heard of it. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=631.68s)]
*  If that happens, [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=633.0s)]
*  I know there are some community members [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=634.38s)]
*  that like recently got married. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=636.22s)]
*  I don't think they met on the community, [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=638.52s)]
*  but I've certainly like seen some people date [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=641.76s)]
*  and things like that, but married. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=644.72s)]
*  I haven't heard that yet. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=647.3199999999999s)]
*  Well, I had to ask it. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=649.16s)]
*  Like I said, I hadn't shared these with you beforehand. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=650.0799999999999s)]
*  So I went from what I think are maybe more ordinary scenarios [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=652.4s)]
*  and maybe more extraordinary. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=656.24s)]
*  One story though, let me mention is that, [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=657.48s)]
*  there's a story in the news about [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=660.16s)]
*  the world's youngest Microsoft Azure AI certified programmer. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=662.64s)]
*  And naturally someone looked them up [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=668.12s)]
*  and they found them that they're on Replet. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=669.68s)]
*  This kid is six years old. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=671.92s)]
*  Oh my goodness. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=673.9s)]
*  And if you go to the Replet profile, [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=675.76s)]
*  they have a thousand followers on Replet. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=678.48s)]
*  And they just like, [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=681.48s)]
*  they have games with thousands and thousands of runs. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=683.2800000000001s)]
*  And they're just like completely prolific. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=687.7600000000001s)]
*  And I just can't wrap my head, [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=690.44s)]
*  especially now that I have kids, [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=691.8000000000001s)]
*  I can't drop my head around to like a six year old, [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=693.9200000000001s)]
*  like doing this like every day. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=696.12s)]
*  And that's like pretty freaking amazing. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=698.0400000000001s)]
*  That's incredible. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=700.48s)]
*  Because just as a reminder, [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=701.36s)]
*  six years old, that's grade one, I believe. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=703.12s)]
*  In grade one, I believe I was learning [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=705.6800000000001s)]
*  to like trace letters so that I could write the alphabet. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=707.88s)]
*  Wow, that's incredible. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=712.0s)]
*  Are there any other stories worth mentioning here? [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=714.5s)]
*  Any top of mind scenarios, [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=716.64s)]
*  like a six year old who's coding on Replet? [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=719.4399999999999s)]
*  One of my favorite stories is one day I wake up [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=723.72s)]
*  and I see my Twitter blowing up and I go on Twitter. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=726.84s)]
*  I find that this Indian mom and dad are tagging me [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=729.6s)]
*  and saying that I corrupted their child. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=734.32s)]
*  Their kid is totally addicted to Replet. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=736.12s)]
*  They're supposed to go to IIT. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=738.28s)]
*  As you know, IIT requires a lot of preparation, [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=740.76s)]
*  but that kid is not interested in it. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=743.84s)]
*  So not studying at all and just programming all the time. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=746.16s)]
*  And I actually felt pretty shitty about it [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=750.32s)]
*  because it started going viral. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=753.04s)]
*  A lot of people were like pretty negative about the parents. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=755.4s)]
*  Apparently it hit a nerve in some discourse in India [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=759.12s)]
*  about how parents push their children really hard [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=762.6800000000001s)]
*  on IIT. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=765.68s)]
*  And so I reached out and tried to help. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=767.16s)]
*  I tried to talk to the kid and tell them like, [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=769.64s)]
*  hey, you should listen to your parents. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=771.92s)]
*  And then a few months after that, [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=774.0799999999999s)]
*  India was hit pretty hard with COVID, [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=777.88s)]
*  if you remember the issue there. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=780.1999999999999s)]
*  And that kid wrote the application [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=783.0799999999999s)]
*  that first responders are using to find equipment, [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=786.1999999999999s)]
*  to find oxygen, to find all these things. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=790.3199999999999s)]
*  And it went totally viral. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=793.32s)]
*  It brought down our website. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=795.4000000000001s)]
*  That's how viral it went. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=798.32s)]
*  And in my mind, I was like, [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=800.12s)]
*  his parents should be really proud now. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=802.12s)]
*  And then something even more fantastic happened. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=804.6s)]
*  Out of that experience and him going viral using his skills, [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=807.08s)]
*  he got a job and now he gets paid more [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=811.2800000000001s)]
*  than his entire family. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=814.72s)]
*  And so you go, it's just sort of this hero's journey. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=816.24s)]
*  You go from getting blamed for someone ruining their future [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=819.24s)]
*  to actually turns out that they actually did [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=822.92s)]
*  a huge favor to their future. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=824.64s)]
*  And I think that's the sort of power of software [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=827.1999999999999s)]
*  and they don't know and things like Replib. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=830.4799999999999s)]
*  That's beautiful. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=832.8399999999999s)]
*  And something that also stands out to me from that story, [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=833.88s)]
*  which we'll touch on throughout this interview [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=836.92s)]
*  is this idea of coding being fun. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=839.28s)]
*  Like this kid really just wanted to code all the time. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=841.7199999999999s)]
*  And as someone who taught myself several years ago, [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=845.16s)]
*  prior to learning, I thought coding was really dull, [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=848.16s)]
*  just something more prescriptive [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=853.64s)]
*  instead of creative and artistic. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=855.0s)]
*  And again, using this word fun. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=857.16s)]
*  And after I learned to code, I saw it in a different light. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=859.04s)]
*  And I think that's really important is this idea where [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=862.8399999999999s)]
*  it's like, how do you make coding fun? [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=865.3599999999999s)]
*  So what are your thoughts there? [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=866.88s)]
*  How have you been able to design Replit [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=868.0s)]
*  to actually enhance people's creativity [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=870.92s)]
*  and make them want to come back [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=873.28s)]
*  and make them see this skill in a new light? [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=874.64s)]
*  I think most things that are fun tend to be devoid [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=878.48s)]
*  of a lot of drudgery routine work. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=884.48s)]
*  You know, when you're playing a video game, [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=889.32s)]
*  you're not like building the video game every time [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=891.6s)]
*  or setting up the TV or doing some like rote IT task. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=894.08s)]
*  When you are doing a sports hobby, you're in the flow, [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=900.36s)]
*  you're doing the thing you're excited about doing. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=905.04s)]
*  The problem with coding is that a lot of the maintenance [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=907.52s)]
*  around the development environment and the packages [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=910.8s)]
*  and the integration of all the different components [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=913.6s)]
*  was the thing that engineers [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=917.52s)]
*  were spending most of their time doing. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=919.64s)]
*  The moments they were coding, they were an absolute bliss, [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=921.28s)]
*  but those moments were actually very little [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=924.6s)]
*  in terms of the, if you think about the pie charts [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=928.3199999999999s)]
*  of what it meant to work as a programmer. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=930.92s)]
*  So the first thing that Replit does [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=933.48s)]
*  is remove the need to do all the setup. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=935.88s)]
*  That in itself made programming a lot more fun. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=939.08s)]
*  And then at the collaborative aspect, [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=943.64s)]
*  like a lot of what we find fun in life [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=947.08s)]
*  has to do with other people. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=949.76s)]
*  We're just social animals, right? [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=951.08s)]
*  And so like, if I can share my program with you [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=952.72s)]
*  with just a link, that's really fun. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=956.56s)]
*  That's what makes Figma fun. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=958.84s)]
*  That's what makes any other collaborative tool fun [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=960.32s)]
*  is that I can just like send you a link [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=963.12s)]
*  and you're in there with me, [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=965.0s)]
*  or you can play it and try it out. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=966.52s)]
*  And then finally, there's like a lot of like [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=968.44s)]
*  explicit gamified elements of Replit. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=970.96s)]
*  For example, like we have a built-in currency called Cycles. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=973.84s)]
*  Cycles allow you to like earn from bounties. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=978.0s)]
*  You can spend it on AI or compute, or you can cash it out. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=981.08s)]
*  And it's built with a mindset of like, [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=985.52s)]
*  it feels like a, it feels like a Roblox. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=988.56s)]
*  It feels like one of those in-game currencies. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=991.64s)]
*  Well, I like your analogy of almost like the setup [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=995.36s)]
*  or the admin that goes into coding at times [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=998.56s)]
*  being a lot more overhead, [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1002.36s)]
*  where if you compare it to other activities out there, [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1004.12s)]
*  like I love playing soccer, for example. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1007.1999999999999s)]
*  If playing soccer required me to like put on my shoes [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1009.52s)]
*  and shin pads for an hour before every hour long game, [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1012.6s)]
*  I'd be like, man, this is really frustrating. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1015.84s)]
*  Like, I just want to get on the field. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1017.64s)]
*  And so that ratio is actually important. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1019.36s)]
*  Let's take a left turn and go straight to AI, [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1022.48s)]
*  which is, you know, the theme, I feel like, [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1025.4s)]
*  of the last six months with many companies. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1027.8s)]
*  But why don't you give listeners a quick overview [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1030.3400000000001s)]
*  of what Ghostwriter is and how it works. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1034.22s)]
*  So Ghostwriter is like a pair of programmer that is an AI. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1036.72s)]
*  We think about it as this embodied thing [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1042.64s)]
*  that helps you achieve your goals of making software. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1045.68s)]
*  And so it helps you in every aspect of software creation, [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1049.3600000000001s)]
*  whether that's typing code, [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1054.4s)]
*  it provides this type ahead component similar to Gmail [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1056.1200000000001s)]
*  to either complete lines of code or entire functions [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1060.4s)]
*  or entire classes. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1063.2s)]
*  So you're going to see that happen as you're typing. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1064.74s)]
*  You also can generate sort of entire programs. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1067.52s)]
*  So you can do right click generate [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1070.72s)]
*  and you can give it a prompt [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1072.44s)]
*  in the same way you could stable the fusion, [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1074.08s)]
*  dollar your prompt and generate entire images. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1076.04s)]
*  You can give it a prompt and generate entire programs, [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1078.48s)]
*  entire programs that run entire like applications. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1081.32s)]
*  And then you can highlight a piece of code [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1084.8799999999999s)]
*  and you can right click and you can transform it. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1086.56s)]
*  Finally, like the ability to talk to Ghostwriter [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1089.44s)]
*  is the final piece here. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1094.92s)]
*  And we're actively working on it [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1096.8799999999999s)]
*  and it's our number one priority. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1099.04s)]
*  It'll be like a chat box inside Replet [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1101.32s)]
*  and it'll both chime in when things happen [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1104.72s)]
*  that it could help. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1108.2s)]
*  So for example, if you get an error, [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1109.6799999999998s)]
*  it would be like, I can help you with that. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1111.6s)]
*  Like a Clippy like thing, hopefully not as annoying. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1113.84s)]
*  But Clippy was way ahead of its time. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1117.12s)]
*  So it'll be like, you know, you got an error. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1119.1599999999999s)]
*  Like if you want, I can try to help you with that. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1121.36s)]
*  Or you can just sort of ask it like, [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1124.0s)]
*  hey, like I wrote this code, can you write tests for it? [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1125.8s)]
*  But it's really remaking the IDE as we know it. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1129.36s)]
*  I would also say it's less binary in a way. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1134.86s)]
*  Something I've been thinking a lot about [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1137.4399999999998s)]
*  as I've learned more about how AI is being implemented [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1138.8799999999999s)]
*  with code is when I learned [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1142.1599999999999s)]
*  one of the most frustrating aspects of learning [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1143.76s)]
*  was just the binary nature of code. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1145.8799999999999s)]
*  When you get into a bad error, [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1147.76s)]
*  it's just like, no, no, no, no, no, no. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1149.6799999999998s)]
*  And then eventually you hit a yes. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1152.12s)]
*  And sometimes that takes way longer than is comfortable. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1153.8s)]
*  And so what I like about this idea [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1157.4s)]
*  of having this sidekick is just the nuance to that [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1160.0s)]
*  of someone being, or someone, the AI being able to say, [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1164.2s)]
*  oh, have you tried this yet? [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1167.2s)]
*  Oh, did you mean this by your code? [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1168.96s)]
*  Like this is what your code is trying to do. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1171.24s)]
*  Is that what you intended? [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1173.4s)]
*  Getting suggestions. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1175.0s)]
*  And again, having the learning curve be less like a no, no, [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1176.0800000000002s)]
*  no, no, yes, and more like a gray that evolves into a yes. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1178.96s)]
*  Like a gradient descent, sort of how you train an AI actually. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1183.96s)]
*  So yeah, I 100% agree with that. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1188.0s)]
*  I think it humanizes the process as opposed to this [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1190.64s)]
*  like mechanistic sort of trial and error thing. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1194.0s)]
*  It allows us to iterate a lot faster on tools. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1196.24s)]
*  Like traditional IDEs are very hard to build. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1198.68s)]
*  They're super complex, classic algorithms. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1203.0s)]
*  I'm sure you remember stuff, [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1206.48s)]
*  but like some of these IDEs are super big. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1208.0s)]
*  Like you download IntelliJ. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1210.56s)]
*  That's like a couple of gigabytes of stuff. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1213.28s)]
*  And they're clunky. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1216.2s)]
*  They take up a ton of RAM. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1217.32s)]
*  Like try starting Xcode. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1220.04s)]
*  It's kind of like, it just consumes your computer. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1221.92s)]
*  And the cool thing about the AI revolution [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1226.72s)]
*  is that the AI is going to be running in the cloud. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1228.6s)]
*  You're going to give it a prompt, [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1231.08s)]
*  like what you're talking about, what your code is about. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1232.3999999999999s)]
*  And it'll be able to implement suggestions [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1235.32s)]
*  and implement features and tools [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1238.56s)]
*  without having this heavy algorithmic, [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1241.1599999999999s)]
*  hard to maintain sort of piece of software. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1245.1999999999998s)]
*  So I'm really excited about that. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1248.8s)]
*  And as a startup, you always want to catch [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1250.56s)]
*  a new platform shift. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1253.3999999999999s)]
*  And with Replit, I feel like [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1256.28s)]
*  we're catching this platform shift. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1257.8799999999999s)]
*  And the older IDEs will not be able to adapt [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1259.8799999999999s)]
*  as fast as we can. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1262.08s)]
*  Well, something that I've heard you talk about [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1263.52s)]
*  is also a decision that you made, [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1265.3999999999999s)]
*  which was to build Ghostwriter on top of your own models. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1267.84s)]
*  So something like a co-pilot is built on top of GPT-3, [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1271.8s)]
*  to my knowledge. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1275.4399999999998s)]
*  And that's a decision to be built off another platform, [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1276.24s)]
*  but you went a different route. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1280.3999999999999s)]
*  So can you speak a little bit more [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1281.84s)]
*  to how you made that decision [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1282.9199999999998s)]
*  and what kind of inputs led to that output? [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1284.1999999999998s)]
*  Well, first of all, how crazy it is [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1288.6s)]
*  that Microsoft had to depend on another company [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1290.0s)]
*  whereas Replit built our own thing. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1293.1999999999998s)]
*  There are multiple ways to answer this. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1296.3600000000001s)]
*  One of them is UX. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1298.2800000000002s)]
*  UX is inherently inseparable from the infrastructure [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1300.24s)]
*  for how a product works. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1306.2800000000002s)]
*  I think most people think that they're separate things, [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1308.88s)]
*  but if you're serious about making products, [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1311.68s)]
*  you know, a famous Alan Kay quote to Steve Jobs, [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1314.44s)]
*  he told Steve Jobs, [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1319.44s)]
*  "'If you're serious about making software, [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1320.48s)]
*  "'you have to make hardware.' [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1321.96s)]
*  And that's why Apple is this full-stack company, [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1323.56s)]
*  is because they think about everything [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1326.8s)]
*  from the transistor to the touch, right? [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1328.92s)]
*  And so I think for us, it was just, [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1331.04s)]
*  like, if this is gonna be a core interaction [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1334.08s)]
*  with our platform, we have to be able to optimize it, [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1337.12s)]
*  and we have to get the latency down [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1341.48s)]
*  to the point that we feel [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1343.76s)]
*  it's gonna be a really great user experience. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1346.12s)]
*  And we weren't able to really get that [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1348.6s)]
*  when we're hitting something over an API, [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1350.44s)]
*  because the latency will be all over the place. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1353.12s)]
*  We couldn't get the caching right. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1355.48s)]
*  We couldn't get the, you know, location right. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1357.04s)]
*  We didn't have control about any of these things. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1360.28s)]
*  That's a huge downside of being a consumer of a mere API. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1362.68s)]
*  And then the other part is the strategic part, [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1366.24s)]
*  which is, like, if you think, [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1368.92s)]
*  if you believe that this is primary platform shift, [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1371.2s)]
*  and this is gonna be a core part of your technology, [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1375.2s)]
*  then you have to build it. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1379.84s)]
*  If you call yourself a technology company, [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1381.48s)]
*  that means you've built technology, right? [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1383.8s)]
*  It doesn't mean you're just, like, building glue code [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1385.76s)]
*  on top of, like, existing technology. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1389.08s)]
*  Finally, we think that we have a bit of a data advantage, [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1391.08s)]
*  and that data advantage will compound over time, [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1395.64s)]
*  and so will allow us to train more advanced AIs over time. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1399.04s)]
*  So all these three reasons just made sense for us [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1405.56s)]
*  to bring at least part of it in-house. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1408.96s)]
*  I should say that we still use OpenAI [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1412.3200000000002s)]
*  for a lot of the sort of, like, bigger workloads [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1414.16s)]
*  that require really large models. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1419.96s)]
*  Something that I found really interesting [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1422.0400000000002s)]
*  was Daniel Gross and Nat Friedman [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1423.8400000000001s)]
*  were on the Stratechery podcast, [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1425.8400000000001s)]
*  and they talked about how they ultimately, [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1428.76s)]
*  I mean, they're investors, [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1430.88s)]
*  they're not the creators of Copilot, [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1431.8000000000002s)]
*  but how Copilot ultimately got to the interface [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1433.16s)]
*  that it now is. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1436.64s)]
*  And originally, they actually wanted to create it [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1437.76s)]
*  as a chatbot. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1439.72s)]
*  So people will run into an error, [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1441.0s)]
*  they're gonna wanna talk to someone and ask, [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1442.28s)]
*  hey, how do I fix this? [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1444.44s)]
*  And they're gonna get a response and implement it. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1445.76s)]
*  But ultimately, they ended up kind of pivoting [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1447.8s)]
*  to what you might imagine as, like, a robot on your shoulder [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1450.76s)]
*  that only speaks up when it has confidence. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1454.04s)]
*  And so I know it's the early days of Ghostwriter, [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1456.28s)]
*  but thoughts on how you got to the specific interface [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1458.88s)]
*  that is Ghostwriter today and how you, as you said, [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1462.32s)]
*  kind of linked the UX that people see [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1466.1200000000001s)]
*  to what's happening in the backend [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1468.56s)]
*  as you're building these models. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1470.04s)]
*  So I think there's two modalities. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1472.0s)]
*  One is pull and one is push, right? [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1475.6399999999999s)]
*  So pull is the human knows what they want [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1478.3999999999999s)]
*  and they're gonna ask for it. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1481.68s)]
*  You write a prompt, you're gonna wait a little bit [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1482.92s)]
*  and you're gonna get it. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1484.92s)]
*  And then there's push, which is the robot on your shoulder [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1485.8799999999999s)]
*  that is, like, continuously suggesting improvements. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1489.56s)]
*  And there are trade-offs to both. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1493.76s)]
*  The push model is actually fairly expensive [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1495.24s)]
*  because you're computing all the time. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1499.0s)]
*  It needs to actually be fairly low latency [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1501.12s)]
*  so that can make you a smaller model. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1503.56s)]
*  So you're going to use a super large model. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1505.52s)]
*  And on the other hand, on the sort of pull model, [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1507.56s)]
*  like I'm asking something, [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1511.6s)]
*  I'm actually gonna formulate my question [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1513.08s)]
*  in a way that the AI could understand it better. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1515.28s)]
*  I'm gonna be able to wait to get a much, [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1518.6s)]
*  to give the AI time to think or to compute. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1521.28s)]
*  And so I would say it's not either or, you have to do both. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1524.2s)]
*  And I think that's the fundamental UX innovation [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1528.28s)]
*  we brought to this space is that [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1530.36s)]
*  we call it society of models. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1531.76s)]
*  Copilot uses a single model. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1533.68s)]
*  Replet uses like three different models of different sizes. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1535.56s)]
*  So the smallest models is the model over your shoulder, [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1538.92s)]
*  continuously giving you suggestions. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1542.3999999999999s)]
*  Then a medium-sized model to do the transformations [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1544.84s)]
*  and things like that. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1547.6s)]
*  Then a super large model, [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1548.6399999999999s)]
*  the kind of model that you would wanna talk to, [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1549.76s)]
*  chat GPT style model. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1551.6399999999999s)]
*  That's great. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1553.08s)]
*  And I guess that shows a concrete example [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1553.92s)]
*  of the capabilities you get from developing your own models [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1556.88s)]
*  and really being able to fine tune them [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1560.72s)]
*  to specific use cases. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1562.3600000000001s)]
*  Let's zoom out a little bit and talk about, [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1563.88s)]
*  right now we're at the beginning of this phase [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1566.5600000000002s)]
*  where AI is being applied to code. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1569.0800000000002s)]
*  Copilot came out, what was it like a year ago or so? [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1571.72s)]
*  Ghostwriter came out recently, [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1574.2800000000002s)]
*  but we're in, you might say the first inning. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1576.5600000000002s)]
*  So if we extrapolate to maybe say Ghostwriter v4 [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1579.16s)]
*  or Copilot v6, many years from now, [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1582.7600000000002s)]
*  I wanna think about how you see the overall environment [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1585.92s)]
*  for developers emerging or evolving. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1590.0s)]
*  So on one hand, I could see how people might argue, [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1593.16s)]
*  you know what, having this technology, [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1596.24s)]
*  being able to just tell a computer, [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1598.68s)]
*  hey, I wanna create this app, go basically build it for me [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1600.88s)]
*  or at least build the fundamentals for me, [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1604.48s)]
*  is going to create this wave of really low quality developers [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1606.3200000000002s)]
*  who don't really know what they're doing. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1610.88s)]
*  We're just relying on this AI crutch [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1612.52s)]
*  to be able to do a lot for them. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1615.08s)]
*  I could also see an argument though, [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1616.8s)]
*  if we're talking about some of these suggestions [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1618.48s)]
*  within their development environment, [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1621.3999999999999s)]
*  this actually creating better developers. [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1623.72s)]
*  They understand a little bit more about [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1625.28s)]
*  how their code is being executed. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1627.28s)]
*  Maybe they more quickly pick up new skills, [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1628.72s)]
*  new languages, new frameworks, [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1630.72s)]
*  because they have this assistant. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1632.3999999999999s)]
*  And so just curious to know how you see this all evolving [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1634.8799999999999s)]
*  and again, this kind of ecosystem of engineers changing. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1638.6s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, anytime you make something more accessible, [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1643.48s)]
*  you just get the entire gamut of things. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1646.88s)]
*  Like Instagram made photography way more accessible [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1650.72s)]
*  and you get like a long tail of crappy photographs, [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1654.92s)]
*  but you also discover people [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1658.92s)]
*  who would have never been photographers, right? [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1660.04s)]
*  Everything in the world is like that. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1663.24s)]
*  Like YouTube, most of their creators don't get any views, [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1664.84s)]
*  but then a few creators like PewDiePie, pre-YouTube, [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1668.72s)]
*  would have been just a kid in Sweden, [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1673.1599999999999s)]
*  not a super celebrity, right? [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1675.4799999999998s)]
*  And so making things accessible [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1677.0s)]
*  gets you a lot more people involved. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1680.1599999999999s)]
*  And the trade-off you're making [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1683.0s)]
*  is that you're going to get a lot of noise, [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1684.08s)]
*  but you're going to discover time [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1686.56s)]
*  that wouldn't otherwise be discovered. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1688.56s)]
*  I think that's good for the world. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1690.8799999999999s)]
*  So with software engineering becoming more accessible [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1693.1999999999998s)]
*  because of AI, [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1696.0s)]
*  I do think we're going to get a lot more developers. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1698.28s)]
*  I think we're going to get way, way more developed, [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1700.4799999999998s)]
*  probably 10X. [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1702.6s)]
*  So right now there's like 30 million developers in the world. [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1704.4399999999998s)]
*  There's probably 300 million developers [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1707.28s)]
*  by the end of the decade. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1708.84s)]
*  And the way I see the developer market evolving [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1710.1599999999999s)]
*  to accommodate this new technology [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1714.08s)]
*  is that there's going to be this bit [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1716.6s)]
*  of a bimodal distribution. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1718.84s)]
*  So bimodal distribution meaning there's no middle end, [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1720.4399999999998s)]
*  there's a large tail on both sides, right? [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1723.7199999999998s)]
*  So the middle end is the sort of, [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1726.76s)]
*  the glue code plumber type developer that we have today, [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1730.92s)]
*  I think that'll go away. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1735.0800000000002s)]
*  And the reason that'll go away is because [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1736.2s)]
*  platforms are going to be a lot more expressive. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1738.2s)]
*  They're going to be able to be programmed [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1740.72s)]
*  using natural language. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1742.1200000000001s)]
*  A lot of the cloud platforms are just pulling [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1743.68s)]
*  better abstractions. [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1745.72s)]
*  Things like Replit will just like make backends [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1746.76s)]
*  a lot more accessible. [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1749.28s)]
*  And so the middle end I think will probably disappear [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1750.52s)]
*  because of that, because of pressure from both sides. [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1754.8000000000002s)]
*  The front end engineers is going to get way, [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1757.48s)]
*  way more powerful. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1759.28s)]
*  So front end engineer will be able to build [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1761.08s)]
*  full stack products just because they have access [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1763.24s)]
*  to all this really powerful platforms. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1765.36s)]
*  And they're going to be able to just produce a lot more code [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1767.52s)]
*  and be able to use AI in every part of the coding process. [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1770.24s)]
*  Whether it's testing, CI, CD, design, [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1774.24s)]
*  everything is going to be sort of powered by AI [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1777.48s)]
*  just made a lot better, [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1780.68s)]
*  including quality control, by the way. [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1781.92s)]
*  So that's sort of on the front end side. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1783.76s)]
*  And then on the sort of backend low level [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1785.92s)]
*  sort of platform engineering, [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1788.28s)]
*  I think those people are just going to get [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1790.2s)]
*  a lot more powerful. [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1792.32s)]
*  Like imagine John Carmack, right? [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1793.92s)]
*  John Carmack is what we call a 10X developer today. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1795.72s)]
*  Imagine giving him a army of AI developers [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1798.56s)]
*  that he could delegate work to, [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1803.72s)]
*  that he could ask questions of, [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1807.04s)]
*  that you're just going to make him 100X, [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1811.3999999999999s)]
*  a thousand X more productive. [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1814.8s)]
*  And so you're going to have maybe fewer [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1816.48s)]
*  of those sort of low level 10X engineers, [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1820.24s)]
*  but they're going to be a thousand X engineers. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1823.8s)]
*  And so maybe a single company would need two or three [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1826.1200000000001s)]
*  like elite engineers, [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1830.32s)]
*  and then maybe dozens of front end engineers [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1832.6s)]
*  kind of building all these products [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1835.04s)]
*  and maintaining with a customer seat. [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1836.3600000000001s)]
*  But those like core group of elite engineers, [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1838.44s)]
*  their impact is just going to be tremendous. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1842.0s)]
*  They're going to be demanding a lot more money. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1844.64s)]
*  They're going to be making a lot more money. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1846.64s)]
*  So if engineering is really your craft, [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1848.48s)]
*  it's not going away. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1851.68s)]
*  And it's actually, you're going to be able [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1852.88s)]
*  to actually be accentuate your power. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1854.3600000000001s)]
*  I think it's funny that you mentioned the 10X engineer, [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1857.44s)]
*  because a lot of people make fun of this concept [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1859.5200000000002s)]
*  of a 10X engineer, because you don't see, [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1862.1200000000001s)]
*  for example, 10X plumber, [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1864.76s)]
*  because you're a little bit limited in the leverage [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1866.1200000000001s)]
*  that you can get with your time in a scenario like that. [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1868.88s)]
*  But we know that one of the reasons [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1871.6000000000001s)]
*  there truly can be 10X engineers is because software [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1874.16s)]
*  can actually give you leverage. [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1876.96s)]
*  And so if you enhance the power that software can provide, [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1878.3600000000001s)]
*  it's actually not crazy to your point [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1882.4s)]
*  to imagine a 100X engineer or a 1000X engineer, [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1884.3600000000001s)]
*  if you basically have these like robot developers [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1887.7600000000002s)]
*  that you can rein in and apply in a specific direction. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1891.0400000000002s)]
*  It's scale, right? [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1895.5200000000002s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1896.48s)]
*  It's a concept of scale. [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1898.16s)]
*  It's a concept of like, [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1899.24s)]
*  this is what technology has allowed us to do [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1900.8000000000002s)]
*  since the dawn of humanity. [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1903.4s)]
*  You go from collecting crops manually by hand [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1905.8000000000002s)]
*  and doing everything to using animals, [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1910.0s)]
*  to then using robots, [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1912.88s)]
*  and now a single farmer can maintain entire acres of farms [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1915.16s)]
*  just because of all the technology they're using. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1919.0400000000002s)]
*  That's technology, right? [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1921.68s)]
*  I mean, the 10X denialism is kind of funny to watch. [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1922.8000000000002s)]
*  Like every one of those people [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1928.8400000000001s)]
*  that say 10X engineers don't exist, [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1931.16s)]
*  knowing their heart of hearts that 10X engineers exist [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1933.5600000000002s)]
*  and they probably worked with someone [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1936.28s)]
*  they highly respected and admire. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1937.48s)]
*  The reason they say that is just politically motivated. [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1939.68s)]
*  They just don't like that the fact that some people [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1942.4s)]
*  can be better than other people. [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1945.72s)]
*  And that's just a fact in life. [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1947.28s)]
*  It's uncomfortable to accept that some people [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1949.0400000000002s)]
*  actually do bring more value to different organizations. [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1951.76s)]
*  All right, so with the bimodal description [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1954.92s)]
*  that you've shared, I have to ask the question, [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1958.3200000000002s)]
*  which is just simply, is it still worth learning to code? [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1961.8s)]
*  To me, it feels like it's more worth it today [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1964.68s)]
*  because it's a tide that raises all boats, right? [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1967.28s)]
*  Like we said, the 10X becomes a 1000X, [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1971.6000000000001s)]
*  but like a 0.1X becomes a 10X, right? [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1974.48s)]
*  So if you're someone who's previously maybe [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1978.92s)]
*  whose impact with coding is gonna be very minimal, [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1983.6000000000001s)]
*  now it's gonna be meaningful [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1987.3600000000001s)]
*  because there's this rising tide. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1989.68s)]
*  Previously, you learn a bit of coding, [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1992.4s)]
*  you learn how to plug together some frameworks [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1994.4s)]
*  and create some UI. [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1997.04s)]
*  Going from that to doing a little bit of parsing, [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=1998.5600000000002s)]
*  for example, parsing some text on that or not, [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2001.72s)]
*  is very hard. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2004.72s)]
*  Right now, you can just use GPT-3 to do the parsing, right? [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2006.68s)]
*  So you're doing the basic coding, [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2010.4s)]
*  and then anytime you find something [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2013.16s)]
*  that's a little difficult, [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2014.44s)]
*  you can plug in GPT-3 in that place. [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2016.04s)]
*  And so I actually think that programming becomes [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2019.08s)]
*  more fun and impactful because of that. [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2022.3999999999999s)]
*  So it's like totally worth doing, [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2024.6s)]
*  even more worth doing than before, [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2026.44s)]
*  because you're gonna get more done. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2029.44s)]
*  You're not gonna get as stuck. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2031.08s)]
*  Yeah, I think too how quickly people can probably learn. [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2033.52s)]
*  I wonder if you have any data on this, [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2036.68s)]
*  but when I learned, I don't know why I did this, [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2038.3999999999999s)]
*  but I decided to track how many hours I was spending [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2041.3999999999999s)]
*  from when I first started [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2044.8s)]
*  to when I actually felt proficient. [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2046.52s)]
*  And for me, that number ended up being 300 hours. [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2048.88s)]
*  Maybe I was slow, maybe I was fast, I don't know. [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2052.56s)]
*  But it kind of shocked me in a way, [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2055.2799999999997s)]
*  because if you actually distill 300 hours down to, [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2057.08s)]
*  if you were learning full-time, [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2062.08s)]
*  which I know not everyone can do, [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2063.7999999999997s)]
*  that's less than two months. [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2065.48s)]
*  And now I think to the tools we have today, [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2066.7999999999997s)]
*  and I'm like, gosh, we can probably do it [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2068.72s)]
*  way faster than 300 hours. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2070.56s)]
*  So any thoughts on how quickly someone can actually [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2072.04s)]
*  get to proficiency with the tools that we have? [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2074.88s)]
*  So I know you're a fan of Balajan, [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2079.2400000000002s)]
*  he was on your podcast. [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2081.48s)]
*  He has this beef with media, [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2083.2400000000002s)]
*  and so he wanted to show that the New York Times [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2086.2000000000003s)]
*  is a bunch of bots, right? [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2088.76s)]
*  And so he put in a bounty on Replette. [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2090.28s)]
*  He was one of our early adopters of bounties, [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2095.28s)]
*  and he wrote, it's like, [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2097.12s)]
*  I want someone to build the GPT Times. [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2099.04s)]
*  It's sort of like New York Times, [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2104.04s)]
*  just totally based on tweets. [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2107.1200000000003s)]
*  You give it a tweet, and it goes and generate an article [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2109.6400000000003s)]
*  written in the style of the New York Times. [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2114.04s)]
*  So actually, it should be up now, [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2116.36s)]
*  so if you go to the gpttimes.com, [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2119.28s)]
*  so that's basically like the site [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2122.28s)]
*  that was built using the bounties program. [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2124.8s)]
*  And the person who built it was on day 80, [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2127.92s)]
*  I think, of 100 days of Python. [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2132.28s)]
*  So 100 days of Python is one of our programs [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2134.64s)]
*  to learn how to code. [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2137.3199999999997s)]
*  And we say you can do a day of Python [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2138.72s)]
*  in basically 20 minutes. [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2142.3599999999997s)]
*  So if you was on day 80, spending 20 minutes, [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2144.64s)]
*  how many hours is that? [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2147.96s)]
*  That's 26 hours. [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2148.92s)]
*  So in 26 hours, they were able to do, [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2150.56s)]
*  to build an entire website using AI [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2154.8399999999997s)]
*  and earn $1,800 from biology. [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2157.6s)]
*  I think your answer, I mean, [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2161.96s)]
*  maybe that guy was an outlier, [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2163.04s)]
*  but we're seeing it all the time, [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2166.16s)]
*  where it's like, it's taking weeks for someone [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2167.6s)]
*  to get to a place where they can build things. [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2170.7599999999998s)]
*  And I think that's really what matters. [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2173.2s)]
*  I think that's incredible, [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2175.2799999999997s)]
*  because I think one of the best decisions I made [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2176.8s)]
*  was learning to code, because you just, [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2179.44s)]
*  to me, it really was like a foundational shift [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2180.96s)]
*  in understanding the world around me, [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2184.08s)]
*  because again, so much of what we do is digital, [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2185.6s)]
*  it is online. [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2188.56s)]
*  And so even if you don't want to go [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2189.4s)]
*  and be the developer that's hired to build products, [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2190.96s)]
*  just having that understanding, [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2194.04s)]
*  and it's kind of crazy when you think about it, [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2195.44s)]
*  if you were to actually position that before and after [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2197.64s)]
*  to people and say, well, now it only takes 30 hours, [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2200.44s)]
*  that's like, you could do that in a week. [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2204.04s)]
*  You could take four days off from your job, [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2206.2400000000002s)]
*  go through this, and I know there's a difference [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2209.92s)]
*  between the 20 minutes a day and a straight shot, [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2211.6s)]
*  but that's pretty incredible. [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2214.88s)]
*  So the final thing I wanna ask you about [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2216.2400000000002s)]
*  when it comes to AI is how this might shift, [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2218.2s)]
*  not just how quickly we can code [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2222.12s)]
*  or how quickly we can learn to code, [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2224.6s)]
*  but how this may fundamentally change [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2226.64s)]
*  what we can do with code. [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2228.8799999999997s)]
*  So let me give you two examples [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2230.16s)]
*  to kind of shape up the question. [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2231.4399999999996s)]
*  The first is when we learned that computers [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2233.04s)]
*  were better at chess than humans, [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2236.72s)]
*  we didn't just learn that fact, [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2238.68s)]
*  we also learned that there were all these other moves [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2240.6s)]
*  or modalities to chess that we had never considered, right? [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2243.68s)]
*  It kind of reframed the way we saw the game. [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2246.68s)]
*  And then another example is one [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2249.8799999999997s)]
*  that our games team shared recently, [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2252.72s)]
*  where basically if you've heard of the flight simulator game, [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2254.3999999999996s)]
*  you can basically like, you know, in the digital world, [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2256.9199999999996s)]
*  fly and land an airplane and fly it around the earth. [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2259.7999999999997s)]
*  And it's got this 3D model of the earth [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2262.8799999999997s)]
*  that was built off of the 2D model from Google Earth. [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2265.8799999999997s)]
*  And that 3D model was built with AI [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2269.3599999999997s)]
*  and it only could have been built with AI. [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2272.08s)]
*  So those are two examples of how this technology [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2274.04s)]
*  not only maybe made things faster, [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2278.0s)]
*  but actually made things possible, if that makes sense, [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2280.68s)]
*  things that weren't prior available. [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2283.6s)]
*  So have you seen any glimpses of that [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2286.32s)]
*  or any thoughts around just like having, [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2288.12s)]
*  you know, we could position it as somewhat of a superpower, [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2290.56s)]
*  having that superpower accessible, what does that change? [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2292.96s)]
*  Man, this is such a brilliant question. [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2296.36s)]
*  Like I actually haven't thought about it as much [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2298.28s)]
*  and I think I should. [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2301.24s)]
*  Like, you know, your example with chess [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2302.72s)]
*  also happened with Go, you know, with the Lacey doll game. [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2305.9599999999996s)]
*  Do you remember that move? [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2309.0s)]
*  That basically what happened is the AI made a strange move [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2310.68s)]
*  that made it, gave it a disadvantage in the near term [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2316.2s)]
*  and a huge advantage in the long term. [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2319.16s)]
*  And they were so confused about it [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2321.2s)]
*  because it's almost like alien intelligence [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2322.4399999999996s)]
*  intruding on this thousand year old game, right? [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2324.9599999999996s)]
*  And producing this fundamentally novel move. [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2329.0s)]
*  So I don't think we've seen that entirely in programming yet, [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2332.24s)]
*  but I'd be definitely on the lookout for that. [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2336.12s)]
*  What I would say we've seen is that tasks [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2339.3599999999997s)]
*  that were previously would require a ton of work, [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2343.24s)]
*  like a ton of insane amount of laborious work [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2347.9199999999996s)]
*  getting done like that. [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2350.9199999999996s)]
*  You know, for example, the parsing question. [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2351.8399999999997s)]
*  GPT-3 is incredibly good at parsing. [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2354.2799999999997s)]
*  If you give it a malformed JSON, it will still parse it. [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2356.9599999999996s)]
*  Writing parsers is one of the hardest things [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2361.08s)]
*  you can do in programming. [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2363.4s)]
*  Writing parsers in GPT-3 is one of the easiest thing you could do. [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2364.6s)]
*  You could just spend 15 minutes in the open AI playground. [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2369.12s)]
*  And so really that goes from a task that requires hours [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2372.0s)]
*  and maybe days and weeks of building and testing [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2375.7599999999998s)]
*  to something that takes a 15 minute. [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2378.84s)]
*  And so that's a fundamental phase shift [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2380.36s)]
*  in how we do things that's actually quite clear. [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2382.92s)]
*  I think there are ways in which we haven't totally explored [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2387.9199999999996s)]
*  how to use LLMs in programming. [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2393.9199999999996s)]
*  Can you create back end as a service using LLMs? [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2396.9199999999996s)]
*  So basically, Firebase, but entirely [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2400.16s)]
*  using natural language. [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2403.8799999999997s)]
*  So Firebase is this great project [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2405.3999999999996s)]
*  that Google Cloud acquired. [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2408.3199999999997s)]
*  And Firebase allows you to have a back end [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2411.2799999999997s)]
*  without any back end knowledge. [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2413.7599999999998s)]
*  You just start storing data and all just retrieving data [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2414.92s)]
*  and it just works. [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2418.12s)]
*  Can you have a back end that's completely programmable [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2419.7200000000003s)]
*  using natural language? [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2422.7200000000003s)]
*  Can I describe my application and just [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2423.76s)]
*  write the front end for it and just have [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2425.84s)]
*  the back end taken care of? [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2427.4s)]
*  I think that if that's possible, that'll [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2429.44s)]
*  cut down on how many engineers you need on your team. [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2431.2400000000002s)]
*  That'll cut down on time to create a prototype. [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2434.56s)]
*  And so I think that will be incredibly exciting. [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2437.16s)]
*  But your question was more like, what [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2440.2000000000003s)]
*  if something fundamentally was not [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2442.84s)]
*  possible that became possible? [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2447.0s)]
*  I don't think we've seen that yet. [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2450.1200000000003s)]
*  But I do want to think a little harder about it [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2451.52s)]
*  and really be opening my eyes wide about it. [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2454.52s)]
*  Maybe one thing I'll mention is one direction that [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2457.7200000000003s)]
*  could happen is the action model. [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2460.76s)]
*  Have you looked at action models at all? [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2463.4s)]
*  No, no. [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2465.88s)]
*  It'd be great if you could describe what they are. [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2466.76s)]
*  Yeah, so transformer models are the models [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2469.08s)]
*  underpinning large language models. [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2472.56s)]
*  So that's what everyone knows, GPT. [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2475.04s)]
*  GPT stands for Generative Pre-trained Transformer. [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2477.2s)]
*  So you take a transformer. [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2480.72s)]
*  That's a type of model architecture. [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2482.24s)]
*  And you throw a huge corpus at it. [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2484.44s)]
*  And it learns a ton of things. [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2486.7599999999998s)]
*  And then you can program it using prompting. [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2488.96s)]
*  That's basically what GPT is. [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2491.2s)]
*  Now you can do a different type of transformer [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2492.64s)]
*  where you take a transformer. [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2495.68s)]
*  Instead of throwing a ton of text at it, [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2497.88s)]
*  you throw a ton of actions at it. [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2500.32s)]
*  So what are actions? [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2503.5600000000004s)]
*  For example, actions could be all the mouse and keyboard [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2505.36s)]
*  events in a browser. [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2509.28s)]
*  So I'll just take all of that, this raw stream of data, [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2511.1600000000003s)]
*  and just train a transformer to do that. [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2515.28s)]
*  So now the transformer encodes knowledge [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2518.36s)]
*  about how to use a browser. [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2521.48s)]
*  That's wild. [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2523.96s)]
*  What can you do with that? [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2525.44s)]
*  You can now instruct the transformer [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2527.16s)]
*  to go book an Airbnb for you, to go do more complex tasks, [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2529.7599999999998s)]
*  like find the place with the best weather [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2536.04s)]
*  in this time of year and book an Airbnb for me [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2539.3999999999996s)]
*  and my family. [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2541.3999999999996s)]
*  So that's quite interesting. [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2542.52s)]
*  I would say that wasn't possible before. [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2544.64s)]
*  So I think that's a fundamental area. [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2547.64s)]
*  If action transformers became mainstream [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2550.44s)]
*  and as powerful as GPT, then I think [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2556.48s)]
*  it'll unlock a new programmable platform. [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2560.0s)]
*  Because now it's almost like everything has an API suddenly. [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2564.2400000000002s)]
*  Yeah, that's fascinating, actually. [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2569.96s)]
*  Because in the past, it's like a specific database has an API [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2571.92s)]
*  that you can plug into. [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2575.96s)]
*  But now this idea where anything in the browser, anything [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2576.96s)]
*  on the web could potentially be transformed into its own API [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2580.2s)]
*  without setting up the specific API yourself, [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2583.32s)]
*  that the language model could actually figure that out. [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2587.36s)]
*  That's fascinating. [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2590.0800000000004s)]
*  And I think to your point, we haven't [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2591.36s)]
*  seen these specific examples of wasn't possible, now possible [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2592.92s)]
*  yet, because we're really early. [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2597.0800000000004s)]
*  But even just as we've discussed so far, [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2598.92s)]
*  the amount of foundational development [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2601.84s)]
*  that is required from engineers today that will soon [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2605.7200000000003s)]
*  be abstracted just opens that time up, that brain capacity up [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2608.4s)]
*  to apply to something new. [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2613.16s)]
*  So I think it's a little bit inevitable for something [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2615.0s)]
*  to emerge. [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2618.56s)]
*  We're just not sure what that something is. [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2619.12s)]
*  I want to ask you very quickly about mobile as well. [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2621.12s)]
*  Because up until now, desktop has really [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2624.6s)]
*  captured most of development. [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2627.56s)]
*  I can't think of many developers who code on their phone. [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2630.2s)]
*  But it sounds like this might be changing. [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2632.64s)]
*  In fact, I heard you actually say [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2634.3599999999997s)]
*  that you think millions of people [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2635.72s)]
*  will code on their phone. [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2637.7999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, if you think about what we've been talking about [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2639.48s)]
*  the idea that your primary development experience will [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2642.96s)]
*  include a big portion of chat. [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2647.0s)]
*  And the best way to do chat is on your phone. [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2649.48s)]
*  Everyone texts on their phone. [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2652.04s)]
*  Everyone talks on their phone. [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2653.96s)]
*  And I think that being able to generate software [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2656.24s)]
*  by talking to your phone is going [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2659.84s)]
*  to be a very clear thing that will happen. [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2662.44s)]
*  At minimum, being able to instruct your AIs [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2665.36s)]
*  while you're on the go and review their work, [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2670.32s)]
*  that's obviously going to happen. [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2673.2400000000002s)]
*  But as typing becomes less of an issue on the phone, [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2674.88s)]
*  then actually making complete pieces of software [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2679.1200000000003s)]
*  will make a ton of sense. [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2681.84s)]
*  Because you're just prompting, and you're reprompting, [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2683.6800000000003s)]
*  and you're reviewing, and then prompting, and reviewing, [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2687.56s)]
*  and prompting. [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2690.52s)]
*  That iterative loop is very clearly [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2691.6800000000003s)]
*  going to work very well on the phone. [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2696.0800000000004s)]
*  And actually, it could be more delightful on the phone. [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2699.48s)]
*  Because you could do a lot of swiping sort of activity. [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2701.88s)]
*  Like with my team, we joke, we call it Tinder for code, [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2705.2s)]
*  where if you prompt the AI and it gives you a piece of code, [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2709.2s)]
*  you could say yes or no. [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2713.08s)]
*  Say no, then it gives you another piece of code. [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2714.6s)]
*  And maybe you give it another prompt, [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2717.96s)]
*  or maybe it asks you another question. [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2719.48s)]
*  So that iterative piece of making software using AI, [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2721.56s)]
*  I think really lends itself nicely [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2726.8s)]
*  to the concept of a phone. [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2728.76s)]
*  And then the other thing is that it's not just the phone, [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2732.48s)]
*  it's the tablet. [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2734.96s)]
*  How crazy it is stuff that we don't have good IDEs [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2736.6800000000003s)]
*  on the tablet. [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2742.0s)]
*  It's kind of surprising that Microsoft [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2742.8s)]
*  hasn't made VS Code for the tablet. [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2745.0s)]
*  So we're the first major IDE for the tablet as well. [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2747.1600000000003s)]
*  And I think you can do everything [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2751.6400000000003s)]
*  that you could do on desktop on tablet. [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2753.1200000000003s)]
*  You can attach a keyboard to that. [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2755.84s)]
*  And you can go to any coffee shop in the world. [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2757.84s)]
*  Everything happens at cloud. [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2760.6800000000003s)]
*  Your storage is in the cloud. [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2762.6000000000004s)]
*  Your AI is in the cloud. [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2764.2000000000003s)]
*  You don't need that much local capability. [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2765.84s)]
*  And you can just write software on that. [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2769.2000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, I haven't thought of that, actually. [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2771.92s)]
*  But it's true. [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2774.08s)]
*  I have never seen someone coding on a tablet, [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2775.04s)]
*  just like I've never really seen someone coding on mobile. [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2777.52s)]
*  But let's see how that evolves. [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2779.88s)]
*  Another feature you've developed that you alluded to earlier [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2781.52s)]
*  was bounties. [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2784.32s)]
*  So can you tell listeners a little bit more [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2785.68s)]
*  about what this is, this idea of bounties, [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2787.96s)]
*  and also just a little bit more about how it's going so far? [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2790.8399999999997s)]
*  Yeah, so bounties is part of our portfolio of products [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2793.92s)]
*  that make it easy to make software. [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2801.68s)]
*  So we realize that not everyone in the world [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2803.8399999999997s)]
*  wants to be a coder. [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2806.8799999999997s)]
*  And I think a combination of the network effects on Repled [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2808.6s)]
*  and being able to discover a lot of software engineers, [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2811.24s)]
*  like the kind of guy who made the GPT Times for Bology, [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2814.12s)]
*  and the AI revolution, and what's happening in currencies, [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2819.3599999999997s)]
*  whether cryptocurrency or centralized currency, [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2828.64s)]
*  there's a lot of interesting things. [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2830.6s)]
*  I think it's a bit of a trifecta that [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2832.16s)]
*  allows us to build what I think is a fluid software labor [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2835.2799999999997s)]
*  market. [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2840.2s)]
*  I'm a big fan of this theory, called the theory of the firm. [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2842.08s)]
*  The fundamental observation is that full-time employment [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2849.3199999999997s)]
*  is a bug. [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2852.04s)]
*  It's not a feature of the market. [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2853.08s)]
*  The reason why full-time employment exists [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2854.56s)]
*  is because the transaction cost of doing something [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2857.44s)]
*  is really high. [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2860.72s)]
*  Uber is an example of something bringing the transaction [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2861.6s)]
*  costs almost down to zero. [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2864.56s)]
*  And by doing that, it creates a huge amount of flexibility [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2866.84s)]
*  in the market. [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2870.16s)]
*  So anyone can enter the market. [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2871.72s)]
*  Anyone can do the work. [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2872.9599999999996s)]
*  And they can do it at their own terms. [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2874.12s)]
*  And there's no binding contract between the different parties. [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2875.7599999999998s)]
*  Software has been something that's [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2879.7999999999997s)]
*  been very hard to actually contract out. [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2881.9199999999996s)]
*  And when you do contract out, you get a lot of problems, [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2885.68s)]
*  a lot of issues running the software. [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2888.4399999999996s)]
*  You get a lot of quality issues. [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2891.4399999999996s)]
*  So the fact that Repled is a fully integrated place, [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2893.8799999999997s)]
*  with high quality software engineers using it, [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2896.8399999999997s)]
*  allows us to be a place where someone [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2900.24s)]
*  can go put a description for a piece of software [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2902.04s)]
*  that they need to get done. [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2904.7999999999997s)]
*  And then a developer, a high-quality developer, [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2907.0s)]
*  can go and, using AI, can make that software very quickly. [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2910.4799999999996s)]
*  And we're seeing people making software [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2916.4399999999996s)]
*  in 30-minute increments. [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2918.16s)]
*  So someone the other day put a landing page, [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2920.08s)]
*  a request for a landing page up. [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2923.16s)]
*  They attached a Figma file. [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2925.08s)]
*  They got it back in 30 minutes. [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2926.7599999999998s)]
*  That's really never been done before. [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2928.8s)]
*  And why shouldn't have existed like that before? [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2930.6000000000004s)]
*  And so I think the combination of all the technologies [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2934.32s)]
*  we're building allows us to create this marketplace. [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2937.2000000000003s)]
*  How are you thinking about this bounties marketplace [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2941.0s)]
*  among the existing marketplaces? [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2944.1600000000003s)]
*  Because it sounds like, and let me know if I'm wrong, [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2946.04s)]
*  this is more peer-to-peer. [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2949.2000000000003s)]
*  I post a project. [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2950.36s)]
*  Someone within the community puts their hand up, [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2951.96s)]
*  or maybe they're matched. [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2954.32s)]
*  But when I think about the existing marketplaces [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2955.44s)]
*  or developers out there, their job, in many of these cases, [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2958.72s)]
*  is to vet a bunch of developers and say, OK, you [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2962.3599999999997s)]
*  have this skill set. [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2965.08s)]
*  You're this good of a developer. [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2966.4399999999996s)]
*  And then also vet their clients and say, OK, [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2968.12s)]
*  this is a good project. [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2970.48s)]
*  This is worthwhile for us to introduce into this marketplace. [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2972.0s)]
*  And then they match people. [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2975.72s)]
*  And then, of course, those marketplaces [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2977.04s)]
*  take some commission for doing so. [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2978.7599999999998s)]
*  And so since many of these already exist, [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2981.7599999999998s)]
*  how do you see bounties as an ecosystem, [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2984.48s)]
*  differentiating or maybe providing something new [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2987.64s)]
*  to people within the community? [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2990.7599999999998s)]
*  I think it's already differentiated. [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2994.24s)]
*  And the reason it's already differentiated [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2995.8799999999997s)]
*  is because the development environment [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2997.52s)]
*  is built into the system. [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=2999.08s)]
*  If Uber was a marketplace to connect you to people, [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3000.92s)]
*  and then they have to go get their own car, right? [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3004.8799999999997s)]
*  So you have to go meet someone at a coffee shop, [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3007.72s)]
*  and then you and them go get a car. [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3010.96s)]
*  That's an absurd example. [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3014.3599999999997s)]
*  But that's what happens at Upwork or some [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3015.52s)]
*  of these marketplaces. [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3018.2s)]
*  I ask for a piece of software. [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3019.68s)]
*  And then you go make it in something that I don't know. [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3021.92s)]
*  And then you send me a zip file. [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3024.96s)]
*  And then what do I do with that? [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3026.84s)]
*  And Replit, I just sent you a link, [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3028.7599999999998s)]
*  a link to a computer that's running [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3030.84s)]
*  your application. [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3033.36s)]
*  That's fundamental innovation on top of that. [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3034.68s)]
*  And then all the services just being integrated right there. [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3037.68s)]
*  You're opening up AI API key. [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3041.44s)]
*  The cloud runtime, all that stuff, the database, [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3044.04s)]
*  we just added Postgres support. [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3047.04s)]
*  Just Replit being this complete platform [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3049.88s)]
*  just makes this process a lot more efficient. [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3051.8s)]
*  That's actually a great point because when [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3054.84s)]
*  I think about other scenarios where people hire developers [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3057.44s)]
*  to create projects, I think one of the massive gaps [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3061.84s)]
*  is, as you said, the standardization. [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3065.8s)]
*  But it's also, if we think about the AI tools [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3068.32s)]
*  that you're integrating, if someone gets a project [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3070.48s)]
*  and they can actually read the code, [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3073.12s)]
*  and maybe they're not a developer, [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3075.44s)]
*  but have some level of understanding of like, [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3076.68s)]
*  this was what I got back. [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3078.56s)]
*  I think that's actually massive differentiation [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3080.52s)]
*  because in the past, they just get back this code [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3082.7599999999998s)]
*  that they can't understand at all. [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3084.88s)]
*  If they need to refactor anything or change anything [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3086.6s)]
*  or get a new developer to work on it, they really struggle. [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3089.04s)]
*  And they really also struggle to have some sort of sentiment [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3092.48s)]
*  in terms of how good the code is. [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3095.4s)]
*  Yep, exactly. [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3097.72s)]
*  And we want to create more market dynamics in the future [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3099.2s)]
*  that are more interesting. [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3106.12s)]
*  For example, this concept from crypto called staking [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3107.7999999999997s)]
*  and the idea that people being able to stake their money [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3112.8399999999997s)]
*  in order to say, I'm gonna build this, [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3118.96s)]
*  I'm gonna build this better than anyone. [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3121.0s)]
*  So I'll put up a bounty for a thousand bucks [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3122.52s)]
*  and you, Steph, will say, I'm so sure [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3125.3599999999997s)]
*  of my ability to do that. [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3127.08s)]
*  I'm willing to put up a hundred bucks [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3129.64s)]
*  that'll be able to deliver on time. [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3131.36s)]
*  And if I don't, you can take my hundred bucks. [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3132.76s)]
*  I love that. [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3135.0s)]
*  And so I think there's a lot of innovation to do in market. [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3136.08s)]
*  And you can also integrate some kind of AI things [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3140.4s)]
*  on top of that. [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3143.6s)]
*  So for example, you can have a sort of AI project manager [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3144.44s)]
*  where an AI takes one bounty and splits it into 10 bounties. [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3148.32s)]
*  So we have this experiential product [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3153.4s)]
*  that I tweeted about recently, [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3156.12s)]
*  and it's basically the moment you put in a bounty, [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3157.96s)]
*  we actually generate the scaffolding for the code. [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3160.52s)]
*  Scaffolding and programming is basically [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3165.68s)]
*  the structure of the code. [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3167.3199999999997s)]
*  And then every function that is not implemented, [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3169.7999999999997s)]
*  that function could be its individual bounty. [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3173.4s)]
*  So I think once you add all these sort of innovations [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3176.7599999999998s)]
*  together, I think you're gonna get this super fluid market [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3179.36s)]
*  of AIs and humans that you can go from an idea [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3184.48s)]
*  to a product just like that. [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3188.96s)]
*  And crucially, like you said, [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3191.0s)]
*  the product that you're gonna get [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3192.32s)]
*  is something that you're gonna be able to iterate [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3193.84s)]
*  on the future and get more bounty creators [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3195.6s)]
*  to contribute to it's a live in artifact [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3198.2000000000003s)]
*  that's working on the platform as opposed to like, again, [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3201.44s)]
*  like a zip file thrown over the wall to you. [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3204.56s)]
*  I love the idea of people being able to like legitimately [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3206.92s)]
*  bet on themselves if they want to participate, [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3211.92s)]
*  if they wanna take on a bounty, [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3214.56s)]
*  because actually when I talked to Balaji in our interview, [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3216.36s)]
*  we talked about this idea of evidence versus confidence. [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3219.44s)]
*  So someone can have a lot of confidence and say, [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3222.16s)]
*  hey, I have these requisites on my CV, [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3224.16s)]
*  or I have this degree from somewhere. [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3226.6800000000003s)]
*  And that distills a lot of confidence in other people [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3228.52s)]
*  that they can get something done. [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3230.92s)]
*  But what's better than confidence is evidence [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3232.28s)]
*  that you can actually get it done. [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3234.48s)]
*  And if you can show, hey, I've done this project before, [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3235.8s)]
*  like literally here's my work. [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3240.88s)]
*  And also I'll put, as you said, put $500 down to say, [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3242.6000000000004s)]
*  hey, if you don't like it, like you can have my $500. [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3246.0800000000004s)]
*  Like that is more than confidence. [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3248.84s)]
*  That is like evidence that you can do the work [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3250.6000000000004s)]
*  and you're willing to put your money where your skills are. [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3252.6800000000003s)]
*  With that said, let's move on to the very final section [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3255.76s)]
*  and we'll just rapid fire go through these questions. [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3257.88s)]
*  They are questions that I've actually seen Sam Altman [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3260.44s)]
*  from OpenAI talk about as four different important questions [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3264.2000000000003s)]
*  that he thinks are relevant to this advent of AI, [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3269.24s)]
*  especially as it progresses. [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3273.64s)]
*  Again, taking the lens of not just Ghostwriter V1, [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3275.56s)]
*  but Ghostwriter V10 quite a ways away from now [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3278.72s)]
*  and how good, how proficient it can get. [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3282.3199999999997s)]
*  So I'll just read you each question. [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3285.6s)]
*  I just wanna get your like raw take on each of these. [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3287.8799999999997s)]
*  So the first question is, with that technology, [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3290.2799999999997s)]
*  how do you think that fundamentally changes society? [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3295.2799999999997s)]
*  I think that's something I care deeply about, [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3299.96s)]
*  which is equality of opportunity. [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3302.12s)]
*  So I think just the ability that anyone in the world [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3306.16s)]
*  being able to contribute and build something [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3309.7599999999998s)]
*  is just beautiful and just amazing. [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3312.3599999999997s)]
*  It allows us to include everyone [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3314.3599999999997s)]
*  and anyone who's willing to work hard. [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3317.3599999999997s)]
*  And that's like the real Americanism in my opinion. [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3319.56s)]
*  That's like what America's built upon is the idea is that [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3323.56s)]
*  if you're willing to do the work, [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3326.7599999999998s)]
*  and if you do the work right, [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3328.84s)]
*  you're gonna get rewarded for it. [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3330.12s)]
*  And I think that's beautiful. [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3331.36s)]
*  However, I think that comes with also increased inequality. [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3334.0s)]
*  I think there's gonna be the pie is gonna be bigger, [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3338.52s)]
*  but also there's gonna be differences between, [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3342.36s)]
*  again, like the 10 X different [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3344.96s)]
*  becomes a thousand X difference. [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3346.44s)]
*  And that's gonna create some political issues [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3349.2400000000002s)]
*  because I think it was gonna create envy [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3352.2000000000003s)]
*  and it's gonna accentuate some differences. [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3354.52s)]
*  And I think that part's not gonna be fun. [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3359.28s)]
*  And I think reasonable people should be able to [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3363.6s)]
*  like say it like it is. [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3366.7599999999998s)]
*  And that's why I think the 10 X denialism [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3368.24s)]
*  is a small sort of symptom of a larger issue [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3373.16s)]
*  and the issue of just being uncomfortable [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3377.48s)]
*  of people being rewarded more [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3380.4s)]
*  because they have a better ability of doing something. [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3383.32s)]
*  So that's just gonna be a big issue [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3387.6800000000003s)]
*  that society is gonna have to deal with. [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3389.6400000000003s)]
*  I agree exponential technology means potentially [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3392.04s)]
*  exponential gains from certain people and not others. [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3395.48s)]
*  And that's not necessarily inherently bad, [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3399.1600000000003s)]
*  especially if the pie is growing. [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3400.88s)]
*  But yes, I agree with you. [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3403.0800000000004s)]
*  That's going to be something that is divisive. [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3404.2000000000003s)]
*  That actually relates to question number two, [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3407.1200000000003s)]
*  which is how do we ensure that it benefits us all? [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3409.52s)]
*  Now that does not mean it benefits us all equally, [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3414.56s)]
*  but how do we ensure that this technology [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3417.64s)]
*  is something that widely benefits [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3419.32s)]
*  the people participating in society? [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3422.8s)]
*  I think as much as possible having competition [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3425.08s)]
*  is gonna be important. [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3428.2s)]
*  I think a world in which just one company controls [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3429.48s)]
*  the biggest AI models is not gonna be great, [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3433.68s)]
*  but neither do two or three companies. [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3436.64s)]
*  I think the lesson we learned from the last generation [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3439.52s)]
*  of big tech is that especially if there's a monoculture [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3442.48s)]
*  like the Silicon Valley, [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3447.8399999999997s)]
*  you're gonna have similar decisions made. [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3449.52s)]
*  And so how do we prevent that in the world of AI? [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3452.7599999999998s)]
*  That's something that's very important. [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3455.64s)]
*  I think open source plays a part in that. [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3457.72s)]
*  I think as much as possible, [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3460.3599999999997s)]
*  pushing this technology to be easy to run [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3462.68s)]
*  and easy to develop and not necessarily something [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3465.48s)]
*  that's sort of closed off and like a few people can control. [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3468.64s)]
*  I think a lot of what's called AI alignment today [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3471.64s)]
*  is not really aligning with what [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3475.0s)]
*  the average human being wants. [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3477.88s)]
*  It's aligning with like what the sort of [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3480.32s)]
*  Silicon Valley average sensibility is, [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3484.08s)]
*  which I don't think it's good. [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3488.28s)]
*  Like I think that we should try to build [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3489.56s)]
*  as much as possible neutral technology. [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3491.8s)]
*  So my bias is gonna be more freedom, [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3494.92s)]
*  more decentralization. [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3497.96s)]
*  Yeah, ultimately these models are a tool. [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3499.64s)]
*  The tool itself is neutral, [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3502.0s)]
*  but the application of the tool or the technology [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3503.92s)]
*  often isn't neutral or it doesn't always [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3508.16s)]
*  happen to be neutral. [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3510.28s)]
*  And they hate the fact that it can be neutral [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3511.44s)]
*  and they think that neutral is bad. [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3514.96s)]
*  And I think that's where we really need to push back [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3517.2400000000002s)]
*  is that no, actually it should be neutral [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3519.7200000000003s)]
*  and then the user have to decide what to do with it. [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3522.52s)]
*  Right, yeah, I think that's a good modifier. [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3525.36s)]
*  I'm gonna combine the final two into one question. [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3528.24s)]
*  You can maybe touch on either or both of them, [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3531.32s)]
*  but the question is given again, [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3534.32s)]
*  if we imagine the exponential nature of this technology, [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3536.48s)]
*  the evolved form of it, how do we deploy it safely? [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3540.04s)]
*  And you can kind of interpret the word safe [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3544.48s)]
*  in your own terms. [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3546.68s)]
*  How do we deploy it safely? [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3548.64s)]
*  And also maybe how does governance play a role in that? [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3549.88s)]
*  I just like the word safety. [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3553.6400000000003s)]
*  And I think a lot of the problems in the world today [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3556.0s)]
*  and so the way our world is shaping up [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3562.32s)]
*  is this concept of safetyism is that, [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3565.52s)]
*  this concept of just like that, [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3569.12s)]
*  companies need to ensure our safety [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3570.84s)]
*  and then they encroach on our freedom to ensure our safety. [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3573.96s)]
*  It's such a stupid topic, [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3578.68s)]
*  but there was the recent gas stove debate, right? [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3580.96s)]
*  Whatever government official that kind of said [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3584.76s)]
*  they might consider banning gas stoves. [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3588.44s)]
*  That kind of impulse of like, we know better than you, [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3590.8s)]
*  sort of the nanny state impulse, I think it's bad. [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3593.48s)]
*  And I think it actually, [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3596.36s)]
*  every time governments have created sort of atrocities [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3597.84s)]
*  have come from that idea. [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3602.04s)]
*  The government wanted the American people to be safe [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3604.2s)]
*  from the Japanese. [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3607.44s)]
*  That's why they create Japanese internment camps, right? [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3608.36s)]
*  You can use safety to do the most abhorrent thing [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3610.8s)]
*  in the world. [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3614.84s)]
*  And so I think we need to be skeptical. [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3616.04s)]
*  Anyone who's talking about safety, [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3617.96s)]
*  they probably want something bad for you. [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3619.56s)]
*  And so that would be my bias is that safety is bad. [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3622.12s)]
*  Or at least when they wanna impose something [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3625.96s)]
*  under the guise of safety, I would be super skeptical. [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3629.28s)]
*  And then on the question of governance, [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3633.6s)]
*  I would also be skeptical of that. [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3637.2s)]
*  So maybe I'm showing myself the librarian impulses here, [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3638.52s)]
*  but like, I don't think anyone is inherently responsible [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3643.6s)]
*  for governance of technology. [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3649.48s)]
*  Look, I think government has a role to play. [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3651.8799999999997s)]
*  The government sort of moves slow [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3655.3199999999997s)]
*  and that's good that it moves slow [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3657.52s)]
*  because it needs to learn what's happening, [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3659.3199999999997s)]
*  what's the system is. [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3661.52s)]
*  Like, if the government moved really fast [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3662.96s)]
*  on regulating cars, [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3665.08s)]
*  they would have gotten super wrong. [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3666.08s)]
*  And it's now like making self-driving move a lot slower [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3667.88s)]
*  than it should be just because the regulations [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3671.96s)]
*  is mounted up. [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3673.96s)]
*  But I think the sort of the process in the US [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3674.96s)]
*  is actually fine for regulation, just like move it slow [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3678.56s)]
*  and let's learn what's happening in the real world. [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3682.6s)]
*  And then let's react to that [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3686.0s)]
*  and let's have a reasonable debate and discussion. [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3687.84s)]
*  I think a democracy at the end of the day [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3690.92s)]
*  will arrive at the right decisions [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3693.04s)]
*  if there's sufficient freedom. [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3695.0s)]
*  And I'm a big fan of debate and vicious debate [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3697.48s)]
*  in order to arrive at the truth, [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3701.2s)]
*  but that just gonna take time. [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3704.2s)]
*  And the problem now is that there are some people [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3706.48s)]
*  talking about AI takeoff being so fast [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3709.48s)]
*  that you need to react to it really quickly. [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3713.12s)]
*  And I think that'll get us into trouble actually. [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3715.68s)]
*  If you're gonna force politicians [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3717.8s)]
*  to understand this technology before it's even deployed, [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3719.68s)]
*  you're really asking for trouble. [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3722.92s)]
*  But I do think on the flip side of that, [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3725.7200000000003s)]
*  something beautiful that's happened in the last year or so [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3727.6800000000003s)]
*  is that this technology has taken off really quickly, [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3731.0s)]
*  but it also has done so in a way where it's gotten [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3733.84s)]
*  in the hands of consumers. [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3736.04s)]
*  And you see this, if you look at the charts of like chat, [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3737.44s)]
*  GPT for example, their speed to 10 million users [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3740.1200000000003s)]
*  was so much quicker than Facebook or Snapchat [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3743.2400000000002s)]
*  or other apps in the past. [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3745.76s)]
*  And so I think while it is inviting some skepticism [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3747.96s)]
*  to say, oh my gosh, this is happening so quickly. [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3751.92s)]
*  We don't know the implications. [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3754.3599999999997s)]
*  I also think you're going to see a level of pushback. [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3756.0s)]
*  Cause at that point, you're taking something away [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3759.3999999999996s)]
*  from people, the superpower as we talked about it. [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3763.08s)]
*  It's important to notice stuff [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3765.9199999999996s)]
*  that nothing as catastrophic happened. [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3767.52s)]
*  Like this technology and just now massive deployment [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3770.72s)]
*  and nothing as bad as the sort of less wrong [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3773.52s)]
*  sort of AI safety is sort of part of the debate [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3777.2799999999997s)]
*  have said it's gonna happen. [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3781.64s)]
*  And so it's important to recognize this [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3784.3999999999996s)]
*  because the people that are gonna be arguing [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3788.2799999999997s)]
*  for extra controls and everything are gonna [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3791.56s)]
*  always paint a future picture of catastrophe. [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3796.48s)]
*  But like the question to ask them is like, [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3800.52s)]
*  like, okay, now there are millions of people [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3802.56s)]
*  already using this, like nothing really bad happened. [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3804.2799999999997s)]
*  So what are you actually worried about in concrete terms? [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3807.9199999999996s)]
*  Yeah, and I think your time dimension is so important here [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3811.68s)]
*  because to your point, you look at technologies like cars [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3814.2799999999997s)]
*  and they were worried in the early days [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3816.96s)]
*  about cars scaring horses. [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3818.44s)]
*  And I think just having a layer of humility to say, [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3820.16s)]
*  we don't know how this is gonna shake out. [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3824.64s)]
*  I'm super optimistic about the future of this technology [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3826.72s)]
*  and everything that's happening. [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3830.08s)]
*  I think it's really lovely. [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3831.2s)]
*  And I think it's like the best time to be a builder. [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5rdhzT53o&t=3833.2s)]
