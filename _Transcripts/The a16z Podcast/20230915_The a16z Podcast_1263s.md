# Can AI Truly Unlock Your Second Brain?
**The a16z Podcast:** [September 15, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzV_7kPPYPE)
*  There's actually this opportunity for information to not need to be organized. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzV_7kPPYPE&t=0.0s)]
*  It's not as simple as just plugging into GPT-4 and calling it a day. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzV_7kPPYPE&t=4.5600000000000005s)]
*  Same search for multiple different people should actually yield different results. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzV_7kPPYPE&t=9.040000000000001s)]
*  I want an AI that calls me out on my b****. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzV_7kPPYPE&t=12.96s)]
*  I think we're gonna have to add that as a potential knob. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzV_7kPPYPE&t=16.32s)]
*  Does it actually adapt to who you are? Does it learn about who you are? [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzV_7kPPYPE&t=19.04s)]
*  That's where I think the magic really starts to happen. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzV_7kPPYPE&t=22.32s)]
*  Some people spend more time organizing their second brain than actually using it. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzV_7kPPYPE&t=25.04s)]
*  There's a crazy amount of innovation that's happening in this space right now [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzV_7kPPYPE&t=29.52s)]
*  that's just been really exciting to see. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzV_7kPPYPE&t=32.08s)]
*  Since the rise of the computer, humans have been gripped by the idea of having a second brain. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzV_7kPPYPE&t=38.24s)]
*  But has reality held up to that promise? [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzV_7kPPYPE&t=45.04s)]
*  How many people spend more time organizing their second brains [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzV_7kPPYPE&t=48.239999999999995s)]
*  instead of leveraging the information within them? [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzV_7kPPYPE&t=52.4s)]
*  How many people constantly look for a better-to-do app [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzV_7kPPYPE&t=54.96s)]
*  instead of actually checking the to-do's that they're organizing? [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzV_7kPPYPE&t=57.839999999999996s)]
*  And how many people have an endless stream of data that they'd love to one day process, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzV_7kPPYPE&t=61.199999999999996s)]
*  but they just don't have the right tools or time to do so? [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzV_7kPPYPE&t=66.96s)]
*  Due to the structured, directive nature of computers to date, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzV_7kPPYPE&t=70.72s)]
*  computers have been a shell of maybe the second brain that we've long hoped for. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzV_7kPPYPE&t=74.08s)]
*  Still incredibly powerful, but also requiring discrete instruction from the director. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzV_7kPPYPE&t=78.24s)]
*  But within the last year, consumer AI has shown up to party. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzV_7kPPYPE&t=83.84s)]
*  Now capable of processing simple language prompts and interfacing with unstructured data. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzV_7kPPYPE&t=87.36s)]
*  Possibly fundamentally changing this game. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzV_7kPPYPE&t=93.03999999999999s)]
*  So today we chat with the founders of Mem, Kevin Moody and Dennis Su, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzV_7kPPYPE&t=96.16s)]
*  as we explore what's gotten in the way of a true second brain. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzV_7kPPYPE&t=101.36s)]
*  And how AI might actually change the game. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzV_7kPPYPE&t=105.6s)]
*  And Mem itself is one such company trying to reinvent this space. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzV_7kPPYPE&t=108.8s)]
*  So they can speak to the why now, but also the very real cost of making this vision a reality. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzV_7kPPYPE&t=112.39999999999999s)]
*  But first, here is a wild stat about just how much is lost in productivity within organizations. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzV_7kPPYPE&t=118.72s)]
*  As a reminder, the content here is for informational purposes only. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzV_7kPPYPE&t=127.36s)]
*  Should not be taken as legal, business, tax or investment advice, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzV_7kPPYPE&t=130.95999999999998s)]
*  or be used to evaluate any investment or security, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzV_7kPPYPE&t=134.4s)]
*  and is not directed at any investors or potential investors in any ASECZ fund. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzV_7kPPYPE&t=136.95999999999998s)]
*  For more details, please see asecc.com slash disclosures. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzV_7kPPYPE&t=141.68s)]
*  I'd love to start out with this statistic, which is crazy in my mind. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzV_7kPPYPE&t=155.12s)]
*  I couldn't believe this, but it's basically knowledge workers apparently spend 2.5 hours a day, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzV_7kPPYPE&t=160.0s)]
*  which is around 30% of their time in a workday, searching for information. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzV_7kPPYPE&t=166.96s)]
*  And this stat is from 2016, but it really wouldn't surprise me if this is still [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzV_7kPPYPE&t=172.08s)]
*  the reality of working in the information age. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzV_7kPPYPE&t=176.48000000000002s)]
*  I almost think that that's probably an understatement, the 2.5 hours number. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzV_7kPPYPE&t=179.92000000000002s)]
*  I think that it's definitely still relevant, if not increased since 2016. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzV_7kPPYPE&t=184.72s)]
*  I think in part because it's so much easier to produce unstructured information, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzV_7kPPYPE&t=192.32000000000002s)]
*  share information, the barrier for creating content and sharing it within your team. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzV_7kPPYPE&t=196.96s)]
*  Being productive as a part of a team has gone down, [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzV_7kPPYPE&t=202.48000000000002s)]
*  and so you just get more and more information that then your coworkers and teams [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzV_7kPPYPE&t=205.84s)]
*  are trying to parse through to get through their day-to-day jobs. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzV_7kPPYPE&t=210.4s)]
*  But I think something interesting there, you mentioned 2.5 hours per day just searching, [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzV_7kPPYPE&t=213.68s)]
*  is this probably hidden time sink too, which is you don't even know that you are looking for [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzV_7kPPYPE&t=218.95999999999998s)]
*  some sort of shared piece of information. You just begin doing your work for the day or for the week. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzV_7kPPYPE&t=225.04s)]
*  And at the end of that week, you realize you've just reinvented the wheel, that somebody else [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzV_7kPPYPE&t=230.07999999999998s)]
*  on your team or some other team in your company did that exact same work. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzV_7kPPYPE&t=234.72s)]
*  And it already exists in some spreadsheet somewhere or some document somewhere. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzV_7kPPYPE&t=238.56s)]
*  And then I think the question I have in my head is how much time are people actually [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzV_7kPPYPE&t=242.48s)]
*  spending then taking those things and then performing really mundane transformations [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzV_7kPPYPE&t=248.08s)]
*  or tasks on top of what they found? And I would imagine that that's at least another few hours. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzV_7kPPYPE&t=254.0s)]
*  I think what's really interesting is we're now entering this world where a lot of that work, [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzV_7kPPYPE&t=263.84000000000003s)]
*  and not just search. Search is just the beginning of really where people are going to get value. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzV_7kPPYPE&t=270.32s)]
*  Out of these new technologies. But I think it's going to be really interesting to see how [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzV_7kPPYPE&t=278.8s)]
*  the entire workflow of a knowledge worker changes over the next few years. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzV_7kPPYPE&t=284.56s)]
*  Exactly. And I feel like if we go back and look at the arc of knowledge management, [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzV_7kPPYPE&t=289.44s)]
*  let's truly go all the way back. You get the ability to write, and people were doing this [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzV_7kPPYPE&t=295.12s)]
*  on stone at first. At some point, the printing press arrives. Then you have individualized [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzV_7kPPYPE&t=299.36s)]
*  typewriters. The computer shows up at some point. The internet gives you access to almost everyone [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzV_7kPPYPE&t=305.04s)]
*  around the world these days. And so you have this promise of technology, which has rung true. It has [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzV_7kPPYPE&t=310.48s)]
*  given people the ability to codify and share information and knowledge in, you could say, [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzV_7kPPYPE&t=316.8s)]
*  exponentially better ways. Yet at the same time, if we bring ourselves back to that stat, [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzV_7kPPYPE&t=324.64000000000004s)]
*  it's kind of surprising that there still are just incredible inefficiencies in collaboration. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzV_7kPPYPE&t=329.76s)]
*  What do you think is preventing us from having this really streamlined back and forth between [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzV_7kPPYPE&t=334.96s)]
*  folks within an organization? Or even as an individual, I feel like a lot of people have [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzV_7kPPYPE&t=341.76s)]
*  this image of a second brain, but ultimately, it doesn't quite live up to the hype. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzV_7kPPYPE&t=345.91999999999996s)]
*  What's really interesting is all of the things that you've mentioned, all of these devices in [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzV_7kPPYPE&t=351.67999999999995s)]
*  the past, they've actually just primarily been broadcasting devices. If you really think about [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzV_7kPPYPE&t=356.47999999999996s)]
*  what is core to collaboration, sharing and broadcasting is only one aspect of that. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzV_7kPPYPE&t=361.91999999999996s)]
*  It's only one component. The other component is how do you actually [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzV_7kPPYPE&t=369.91999999999996s)]
*  digest and how do you actually consume that piece of information, that someone else is [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzV_7kPPYPE&t=377.28s)]
*  actually broadcasting? We've never truly had really hyper-personalized consumption devices. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzV_7kPPYPE&t=382.08s)]
*  Search is very much a personal problem. It's very much about, hey, I'm looking for this piece [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzV_7kPPYPE&t=389.2s)]
*  of information and the same search query, the same search for multiple different people [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzV_7kPPYPE&t=396.0s)]
*  should actually yield different results because you think about the world differently. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzV_7kPPYPE&t=401.2s)]
*  The tools that we've used up to this point really just don't model that reality. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzV_7kPPYPE&t=407.03999999999996s)]
*  If we look at it from the perspective of one piece of information and its life cycle, [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzV_7kPPYPE&t=411.76s)]
*  when information in an organization especially is captured, it's oftentimes really hard to know [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzV_7kPPYPE&t=417.12s)]
*  all of the people and all of the contexts in which that one piece of information could be useful. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzV_7kPPYPE&t=423.04s)]
*  If you think about a book being written, it's useful when somebody chooses to read it and [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzV_7kPPYPE&t=429.52s)]
*  how people come to discover that book is usually recommended or it's marketed. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzV_7kPPYPE&t=434.32s)]
*  When you think about an organization, so much information is getting created on a daily basis [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzV_7kPPYPE&t=439.6s)]
*  and oftentimes the times where that knowledge or institutional knowledge would be best used is [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzV_7kPPYPE&t=445.2s)]
*  weeks, months, even years down the road. The best effort attempt historically to organize [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzV_7kPPYPE&t=452.0s)]
*  that information is to use a traditional knowledge base. The person that's capturing that information [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzV_7kPPYPE&t=458.96s)]
*  is putting in a lot of time and effort into trying to organize it into a certain folder or [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzV_7kPPYPE&t=464.56s)]
*  certain file structure. Despite their best efforts, at the end of the day, that structure [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzV_7kPPYPE&t=469.36s)]
*  makes a lot of sense to them and varying levels of comprehensibility to everybody else on their [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzV_7kPPYPE&t=474.32s)]
*  team. Usually by the time they move on to another team or another company, that organization makes [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzV_7kPPYPE&t=480.15999999999997s)]
*  zero sense. I think one fundamental unlock and trend we're seeing and that we're pursuing is that [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzV_7kPPYPE&t=486.96s)]
*  historically after information was created, the onus was on the creator of that information [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzV_7kPPYPE&t=495.03999999999996s)]
*  to not only distribute but also organize that information within a company, for example. Now [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzV_7kPPYPE&t=500.48s)]
*  we think that there's actually this opportunity for information to not need to be organized [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzV_7kPPYPE&t=506.40000000000003s)]
*  and instead for some automated system or some AI to be able to come in and actually match every [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzV_7kPPYPE&t=511.52000000000004s)]
*  piece of information to the context and the situation in which it would be best used. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzV_7kPPYPE&t=517.28s)]
*  That way you can get past all of those inefficiencies that happen. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzV_7kPPYPE&t=522.24s)]
*  Totally. I'm just thinking through, it seems like there's maybe two aspects here. One of them is [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzV_7kPPYPE&t=526.0s)]
*  this idea that humans want to document, but in order to document, like you said, you have to spend [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzV_7kPPYPE&t=531.2800000000001s)]
*  so much time. Some people spend more time organizing their second brain than actually using it. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzV_7kPPYPE&t=538.72s)]
*  That's one part, but then there's also another part, which is just there's already this vast [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzV_7kPPYPE&t=544.1600000000001s)]
*  amount of unstructured data that other people have created. I guess getting to the bottom of [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzV_7kPPYPE&t=549.36s)]
*  given the technology that's evolved, what is the opening here? Are there new approaches that exist [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzV_7kPPYPE&t=555.6s)]
*  now that we have access to these LLMs or how are you guys thinking about turning the page? [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzV_7kPPYPE&t=562.48s)]
*  The organizational structure that we rely on is still very much so the folder. The folder is [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzV_7kPPYPE&t=568.1600000000001s)]
*  this thing that was this skeuomorphic representation of this file encampment that [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzV_7kPPYPE&t=576.8800000000001s)]
*  we used to have. Then when computers were first developed, really in the 1950s and 60s, [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzV_7kPPYPE&t=583.04s)]
*  we just said, hey, people understand how filing cabinets work. So why don't we just put filing [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzV_7kPPYPE&t=589.36s)]
*  cabinets on this computer so that it's a little easier for people to actually adapt to this new [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzV_7kPPYPE&t=594.48s)]
*  technology? Then that begs the question, well, it's been 60 years since that time where computers [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzV_7kPPYPE&t=598.8s)]
*  have been around. What makes this moment really special where we can actually say, hey, [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzV_7kPPYPE&t=606.56s)]
*  can we actually eliminate the folder? We think the answer is yes. Part of that is, [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzV_7kPPYPE&t=616.8s)]
*  I think the missing ingredient has always just been a lack of contextual understanding by machines [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzV_7kPPYPE&t=624.7199999999999s)]
*  of human language and of the knowledge that humans produce. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzV_7kPPYPE&t=632.48s)]
*  Computers, I think we've known for a long time, are far better than humans at very specific things [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzV_7kPPYPE&t=637.36s)]
*  like computation. It can store vastly more memory and all of these things, but it's never really [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzV_7kPPYPE&t=644.96s)]
*  been able to actually reason. They've never really been able to actually think. This new generation [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzV_7kPPYPE&t=651.6800000000001s)]
*  of LLMs, what they actually demonstrate is reasoning capabilities. That's where I think [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzV_7kPPYPE&t=659.52s)]
*  the magic really starts to happen when you can marry the reasoning capabilities of an LLM with [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzV_7kPPYPE&t=668.2399999999999s)]
*  the vast storage capabilities of computers from the past. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzV_7kPPYPE&t=676.8s)]
*  One way to think about this in terms of people wanted faster horses and instead the answer was [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzV_7kPPYPE&t=682.8s)]
*  cars is instead of having manually organized folders, you have automatically generated [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzV_7kPPYPE&t=690.16s)]
*  folders. At one point, I think that's the direction we thought made most sense. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzV_7kPPYPE&t=697.92s)]
*  I think that what has become apparent and what large language models have allowed is to flip [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzV_7kPPYPE&t=703.6s)]
*  that model on its head and recognize the fact that you actually don't want to organize a [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzV_7kPPYPE&t=710.16s)]
*  piece of information into one or even five folders. You want to organize it into almost [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzV_7kPPYPE&t=715.28s)]
*  an arbitrary number of folders, which are the different ways in which you're going to need to [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzV_7kPPYPE&t=720.48s)]
*  recall or retrieve that information. The thing that large language models now allow us to do [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzV_7kPPYPE&t=724.16s)]
*  is in a very generalized fashion, take any piece of text from any domain. It could be [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzV_7kPPYPE&t=729.52s)]
*  in the medical realm. It could have to do with real estate. It could have to do with technology [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzV_7kPPYPE&t=735.44s)]
*  and be able to comprehend that in such a way that then when it comes time for somebody to need to [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzV_7kPPYPE&t=741.2s)]
*  make use of that knowledge, they can ask very simple natural language questions, communicate [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzV_7kPPYPE&t=747.0400000000001s)]
*  in their own voice, and find the right answer without any intermediate categorization step [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzV_7kPPYPE&t=752.24s)]
*  even required. That's something that before the level of depth of comprehension that these large [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzV_7kPPYPE&t=757.28s)]
*  language models affords, it would not have been possible. Something that's really drawing my [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzV_7kPPYPE&t=762.64s)]
*  attention is this idea of proactivity, where not only can it reorganize your information in [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzV_7kPPYPE&t=767.52s)]
*  different ways, but it can actually step up and say, hey, this is going to be useful at this time. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzV_7kPPYPE&t=774.0s)]
*  I know you're working on this kind of project. Have you considered this? Which again, someone [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzV_7kPPYPE&t=780.08s)]
*  else in the organization maybe has already done. How are you guys thinking about that dynamic, [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzV_7kPPYPE&t=784.4s)]
*  which also feels fundamentally new? Yeah, I think the running joke here is Clippy was [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzV_7kPPYPE&t=789.2s)]
*  just ahead of its time. What's really interesting is the idea of Clippy and this proactive assistant, [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzV_7kPPYPE&t=795.6800000000001s)]
*  obviously, I think people have been attracted to this for a long time. It's so embedded in [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzV_7kPPYPE&t=806.8000000000001s)]
*  the sci-fi fantasies that society has for the world. In order for proactiveness to not be annoying [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzV_7kPPYPE&t=813.36s)]
*  and to cross that boundary into truly useful and then delightful, you actually have to have a deep [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzV_7kPPYPE&t=822.24s)]
*  understanding and the ability to reason about someone's life and what they're thinking about [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzV_7kPPYPE&t=830.4s)]
*  all of those things. If you think historically and honestly, even today with tools like [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzV_7kPPYPE&t=837.6s)]
*  with chat GBT, the quality of our interactions with computers are still very much limited by [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzV_7kPPYPE&t=847.6s)]
*  the instructions that we explicitly provide them. We used to have to provide instructions [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzV_7kPPYPE&t=855.36s)]
*  in code and obviously the sci-perably, but now a lot of the time we can just provide instructions [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzV_7kPPYPE&t=862.08s)]
*  in English, but we're still providing instructions. This is where things I think will get really [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzV_7kPPYPE&t=866.24s)]
*  interesting. If you actually have an understanding truly of who this person is, of what they care [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzV_7kPPYPE&t=872.32s)]
*  about, of what they know, then what you can actually start doing is flip that model on its head and say, [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzV_7kPPYPE&t=879.44s)]
*  instead of me constantly having to instruct this machine, what if the machine will just do things [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzV_7kPPYPE&t=886.24s)]
*  for me and then confirm afterwards? Hey, is this what you want done or what else do you need? [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzV_7kPPYPE&t=895.04s)]
*  Yeah, you're evolving with it. You can prompt it initially, but then it can also run on its own. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzV_7kPPYPE&t=903.8399999999999s)]
*  You can give it feedback and it can iterate instead of the really strict rules, hey, deliver [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzV_7kPPYPE&t=908.48s)]
*  me this specific email reminder every morning at 9 AM. You can't really iterate on because there's [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzV_7kPPYPE&t=913.5999999999999s)]
*  not any gray area. There's not any nuance or context like you guys have mentioned, [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzV_7kPPYPE&t=921.36s)]
*  but something that's coming to mind is just the cost of all this. We're talking about so [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzV_7kPPYPE&t=926.88s)]
*  many different applications that you're tying into, constantly working with data, maybe organizing it [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzV_7kPPYPE&t=930.5600000000001s)]
*  to some degree, parsing it, saving it somewhere, it has to be retained. I guess in a way it's so [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzV_7kPPYPE&t=936.5600000000001s)]
*  much more powerful that maybe a new business model can be built around this idea. You imagine how much [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzV_7kPPYPE&t=942.88s)]
*  people pay EAs and this is kind of paralleling that, but yeah, just how do you guys think about [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzV_7kPPYPE&t=948.56s)]
*  this evolution and how much it costs to do this, but then also maybe how you monetize it on the [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzV_7kPPYPE&t=954.9599999999999s)]
*  other side? Cost is a really interesting question and we think a lot about this because [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzV_7kPPYPE&t=959.04s)]
*  at the most fundamental level, we really want to democratize access to this sort of intelligence [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzV_7kPPYPE&t=967.04s)]
*  and give every person the power essentially of their own personal AI that can help them [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzV_7kPPYPE&t=973.36s)]
*  think better and do more. There's really two ways that we're currently focused on monetizing. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzV_7kPPYPE&t=979.6800000000001s)]
*  The first way is via the individual plan and I think you can actually similarly equate it to some [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzV_7kPPYPE&t=985.84s)]
*  of the other products on the market in terms of a free to use plan as well as a paid premium [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzV_7kPPYPE&t=990.5600000000001s)]
*  all access plan. That's one that we want to continue to figure out how to drive the price [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzV_7kPPYPE&t=997.84s)]
*  down, but one of the really promising trends is that the cost of compute and the cost of actually [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzV_7kPPYPE&t=1003.76s)]
*  running these models is coming down by an order of magnitude every several months. So given that [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzV_7kPPYPE&t=1010.08s)]
*  that trend is likely to continue, we think we're going to be able to actually serve all of these [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzV_7kPPYPE&t=1016.88s)]
*  things at just an incremental cost above storage. Separately, one of the things you really touched [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzV_7kPPYPE&t=1021.84s)]
*  on that I completely agree with is this idea of essentially what if we could actually give [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzV_7kPPYPE&t=1028.32s)]
*  each person their personal, like a personal EA. That really changes because if you think about the [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzV_7kPPYPE&t=1035.3600000000001s)]
*  value traditionally of whether it's note-taking apps or knowledge bases, it has been almost [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzV_7kPPYPE&t=1044.08s)]
*  exclusively focused on information retrieval. It's been, hey, the value ends at search. After [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzV_7kPPYPE&t=1050.4s)]
*  you receive a list of documents, that's where you're done. But we can actually go far beyond just [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzV_7kPPYPE&t=1056.88s)]
*  retrieving a list of documents now. We can actually do things with them. We can help you [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzV_7kPPYPE&t=1065.2800000000002s)]
*  think through problems. That is a much more valuable problem to solve than just pure information [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzV_7kPPYPE&t=1070.5600000000002s)]
*  retrieval. Now you can start framing the cost away from like, oh, this is relative to a typical [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzV_7kPPYPE&t=1079.28s)]
*  software subscription that I would make to rather comparing it to instead of hiring an employee or [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzV_7kPPYPE&t=1091.2s)]
*  hiring someone to do this thing, can I have the help of a truly personalized AI assistant? [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzV_7kPPYPE&t=1097.6s)]
*  And I think that is where the really exciting revenue opportunity also comes in the future. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzV_7kPPYPE&t=1105.2s)]
*  Lauren Ruffin I tweeted this a while ago, but I said, I want an AI that calls me out on my [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzV_7kPPYPE&t=1113.6s)]
*  bullshit. It's hard to hear that from a human, right? It's like, Steph, you're moving in the [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzV_7kPPYPE&t=1118.32s)]
*  wrong direction. You're not focused on the right things. And even in my personal life, you said [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzV_7kPPYPE&t=1123.44s)]
*  you wanted to exercise this amount. You said that you wanted to go to sleep at these times. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzV_7kPPYPE&t=1128.0s)]
*  You're not doing it. And I think there's an opportunity here also to personalization is so [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzV_7kPPYPE&t=1132.96s)]
*  inherent in some of the developments in AI, but to personalize the type of support that you're [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzV_7kPPYPE&t=1139.44s)]
*  getting. Stephen Kupryk [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzV_7kPPYPE&t=1145.68s)]
*  I love this example you're giving. We've been thinking a lot about personalization with the [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzV_7kPPYPE&t=1146.88s)]
*  chat with Mem and conversational experience and Mem as the assistant. And I think we're going to [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzV_7kPPYPE&t=1151.52s)]
*  have to add that as a potential knob is calling me out on my bullshit factor. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzV_7kPPYPE&t=1156.32s)]
*  Exactly. Yeah, this is a spectrum. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzV_7kPPYPE&t=1160.4s)]
*  Stephen Kupryk Yeah. And I think one of the perspectives [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzV_7kPPYPE&t=1162.72s)]
*  that we've developed is personalization is actually not just about, does this AI, [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzV_7kPPYPE&t=1165.6s)]
*  can this AI operate across the data that I provide? Even if this piece of technology [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzV_7kPPYPE&t=1174.08s)]
*  or this assistant actually can do things for you based on the knowledge that you provide it, [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzV_7kPPYPE&t=1178.56s)]
*  it still doesn't feel personalized because it doesn't feel like it's adapting to you. It doesn't [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzV_7kPPYPE&t=1185.84s)]
*  feel like it's learning from the interactions that you're having with it. It just feels like it is [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzV_7kPPYPE&t=1191.12s)]
*  able to kind of search across a bunch of information and then reply. And so I think a key fundamental [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzV_7kPPYPE&t=1195.84s)]
*  unlock in how we really think about personalization is not just does it have access to my personal data [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzV_7kPPYPE&t=1206.16s)]
*  and my personal knowledge, but rather does it actually adapt? Right? So internally we call this [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzV_7kPPYPE&t=1213.04s)]
*  adaptive AI. Does it actually adapt to who you are? Does it learn about who you are? And does it then [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzV_7kPPYPE&t=1218.24s)]
*  apply that in future interactions with you like a human would? Thank you so much for listening to [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzV_7kPPYPE&t=1223.92s)]
