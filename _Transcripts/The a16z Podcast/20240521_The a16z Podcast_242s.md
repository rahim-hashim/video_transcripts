# Can AI Advance Science? DeepMind's VP of Science Weighs In
**The a16z Podcast:** [May 21, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWzALLsU1XI)
*  What we have entered is basically an age where a single human mind cannot comprehend the data [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWzALLsU1XI&t=0.0s)]
*  that we are gathering about the universe. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWzALLsU1XI&t=10.84s)]
*  And this is true in any field you now encounter. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWzALLsU1XI&t=13.76s)]
*  It is true in biology. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWzALLsU1XI&t=17.84s)]
*  No biologist can sort of reason and analyze all the biological data that is being gathered. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWzALLsU1XI&t=19.68s)]
*  Physicists can sort of look at and analyze all the high-energy physics data that is being gathered. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWzALLsU1XI&t=25.240000000000002s)]
*  And even mathematicians cannot look and analyze all the large-scale mathematical simulation data. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWzALLsU1XI&t=31.48s)]
*  And I think what's happened is basically AI is not nice to have. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWzALLsU1XI&t=38.84s)]
*  It's basically almost a necessity for us to make sense and reason about any problem that we are now looking at. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWzALLsU1XI&t=45.0s)]
*  I have examples like in pure mathematics where concepts in, for example, topology, knot theory, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWzALLsU1XI&t=52.279999999999994s)]
*  and you describe a knot in two different definitions. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWzALLsU1XI&t=59.559999999999995s)]
*  There is an algebraic definition and there is a geometric definition. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWzALLsU1XI&t=63.72s)]
*  And mathematicians understood these characterizations but never understood the connections between them. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWzALLsU1XI&t=67.39999999999999s)]
*  And what we showed in one of our works is basically we generated a lot of data for knots [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWzALLsU1XI&t=73.88s)]
*  in these two characterizations and somehow, and we asked the neural network, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWzALLsU1XI&t=81.16s)]
*  can you make predictions about one characterization from the other? [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWzALLsU1XI&t=84.6s)]
*  And the idea was well, now it should be known. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWzALLsU1XI&t=88.6s)]
*  But in fact, it could make predictions. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWzALLsU1XI&t=91.47999999999999s)]
*  And when we really sort of, when we drill down, we found a very nice conjecture that nobody had sort of encountered. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWzALLsU1XI&t=94.52s)]
*  And we worked with mathematicians to then make a conjecture, not only make that conjecture, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWzALLsU1XI&t=103.47999999999999s)]
*  but actually prove that there was a very elegant, nice relationship between those two characterizations. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWzALLsU1XI&t=107.96s)]
*  So this is like completely fundamental discoveries in mathematics that were not, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWzALLsU1XI&t=115.32s)]
*  that were completely unknown to mathematicians now being uncovered by machine learning and AI models. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWzALLsU1XI&t=120.91999999999999s)]
*  And you, you are, we are seeing this across the board in any of the scientific areas that we are looking at. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWzALLsU1XI&t=128.44s)]
*  We are discovering new insights, new sort of patterns that were not expected, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWzALLsU1XI&t=134.92000000000002s)]
*  just because the techniques to analyze the raw scale of data did not exist. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWzALLsU1XI&t=142.28s)]
*  Yeah, I think amongst biologists, especially maybe 10 years ago and further back, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWzALLsU1XI&t=150.2s)]
*  I think there was often a belief that biology is just so complex that it is just incomprehensible, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWzALLsU1XI&t=155.32s)]
*  that there is no way to even understand it, there is no way to try to understand it. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWzALLsU1XI&t=161.79999999999998s)]
*  The only thing you can do is run the experiment and see what happens. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWzALLsU1XI&t=165.4s)]
*  And I think we are seeing the beginning of a shift where people are starting to think, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWzALLsU1XI&t=168.76s)]
*  well, you know, there are complexities and there is a lot we do not know, a lot to learn, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWzALLsU1XI&t=172.12s)]
*  but that AI actually can gather all that together and start to decipher this [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWzALLsU1XI&t=176.76s)]
*  and to be a natural language for biology. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWzALLsU1XI&t=181.64s)]
*  And I think there is going to be this really fun cultural shift where 10 years ago, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWzALLsU1XI&t=183.88s)]
*  people would say, oh, it is ridiculous that a computer could try to do these things. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWzALLsU1XI&t=188.44s)]
*  I think 10 years from now, people will be like, oh, it is a ridiculous stuff for a human being [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWzALLsU1XI&t=191.88s)]
*  to do that. You cannot load all these numbers in your head. That is just ridiculous to even say that. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWzALLsU1XI&t=196.04s)]
*  And we have seen this in other places, like chess. It seemed like impossible that a computer could [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWzALLsU1XI&t=201.24s)]
*  beat a grandmaster and then now there is not even worth trying. I think that is just a cultural [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWzALLsU1XI&t=206.92s)]
*  shift, but I do not think that is a bad thing. I mean, a forklift can lift much more than the [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWzALLsU1XI&t=212.36s)]
*  strongest weightlifter and we view that as a positive thing. It is always going to be us [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWzALLsU1XI&t=217.64s)]
*  and them. I think the interesting question will be is once you can do these things [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWzALLsU1XI&t=222.6s)]
*  that we cannot do, well, what do we do together with that? [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWzALLsU1XI&t=226.11999999999998s)]
