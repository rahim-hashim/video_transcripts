# AI: The Ultimate Healthcare Hire
**The a16z Podcast:** [December 18, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs)
*  The percentage of doctors that are over the age of 60 has reached like 45 percent. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=0.0s)]
*  Doctors and nurses have left the workforce actually in droves because of that burnout issue. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=4.72s)]
*  We're at a breaking point where the industry needs these solutions. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=9.28s)]
*  My big idea is what we call super staffing for health care. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=14.56s)]
*  And what that means is, you know, we've talked obviously about just the rampant [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=17.92s)]
*  challenges that exist in our health care industry. So much is broken about it. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=21.92s)]
*  But really one of the sort of underlying fundamental issues that we face is this supply [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=25.52s)]
*  demand mismatch between the amount of clinical supply that we have in the forms of doctors [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=30.8s)]
*  and nurses and other clinical service providers versus the level of demand that we as patients [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=36.0s)]
*  represent in the industry. And it's not just that the demand itself is high, it's that the nature of [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=41.68s)]
*  the demand keeps getting more and more complex. We've talked a lot about how the chronic disease [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=47.68s)]
*  burden in America is increasing over time. The number of diseases that any individual has is [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=51.76s)]
*  growing and growing. The number of drugs that we're all taking is growing and growing. And so, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=55.839999999999996s)]
*  again, not only is it that there's just a shortage of labor relative to the number of humans who need [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=59.839999999999996s)]
*  it, but also the nature of the work is also getting more complex over time. So let's dive into that. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=65.44s)]
*  Just how short are we in this clinical staff? Yeah, I mean, there's a lot of different numbers [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=70.8s)]
*  here. But I think generally speaking, when you look at, for instance, the number of doctors that [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=75.03999999999999s)]
*  we have estimated a shortage in, it's anywhere between, let's call it 60 to 100k doctors today, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=79.52s)]
*  as of today, in terms of the relative demand that we have in our system, and roughly about 75k to [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=86.24s)]
*  150k nurses. But I think probably one of the more interesting issues to unpack here is, what do we [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=91.11999999999999s)]
*  actually mean by shortage? So there's largely two schools of thought of how people define this. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=96.64s)]
*  One is simply the number of human clinicians that we have is one way to look at it. The other way [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=101.52s)]
*  to look at it, though, is given the number of nurses and doctors we do have, are they actually [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=107.12s)]
*  fully performing to the full extent of productivity that that number of laborers actually represents? [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=112.16000000000001s)]
*  And I think it's probably at the end of the day, a combination of both. But those are two different [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=118.88000000000001s)]
*  ways that people have cut that pie. And how did we get here? Like, if we think about it, a lot of [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=123.36000000000001s)]
*  people talk about population dynamics, right? A lot more people are getting old. But then there's [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=127.04s)]
*  also this maybe dynamic of just a skill shortage. And as you kind of touched on already, maybe what [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=131.6s)]
*  we need today is different from what we needed 10 years ago, 20 years ago. What is leading to [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=136.32s)]
*  the shortage? If you zoom out the lens entirely on this highly regulated industry, there's actually [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=140.72s)]
*  a structural and regulatory constraint on the amount of supply that we allow into the industry [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=146.16s)]
*  on any given time basis. Through education, you're saying? Education is one. Certainly, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=151.12s)]
*  the number of accredited medical schools is constrained, both in terms of actual accreditation, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=155.04s)]
*  but also in terms of funding. Standing up with medical schools is actually funded by federal [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=159.84s)]
*  dollars. And there's just a physical limit on that. The other version of that is licensure. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=163.28s)]
*  So once you get through your training, you have to be licensed at the state level to be able to [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=168.48s)]
*  practice medicine. And again, there's only a certain number of licensures that are approved [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=173.44s)]
*  on a given basis. You have to renew that every few years. So there's again, just sort of structural [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=177.76s)]
*  constraints in the industry level that constrain the supply side. In addition to that, once you [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=182.4s)]
*  are a doctor, there's all sorts of challenges, some of which you alluded to, of the job itself [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=186.96s)]
*  that have led to constraints. One is certainly the aging population. There's a ridiculous stat [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=192.32s)]
*  that in the last couple of years, the percentage of doctors that are over the age of 60 has reached [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=197.51999999999998s)]
*  like 45%, which is crazy. And so there's this huge kind of silver tsunami dynamic of what happens [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=202.48s)]
*  when all those doctors retire. There's going to be a huge gap just purely on the basis of age. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=209.51999999999998s)]
*  There's also the burnout issue. Just given everything that happened during the pandemic [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=213.6s)]
*  in particular, we put so much burden on our frontline staff and what we were asking of them [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=217.35999999999999s)]
*  to do was obviously very challenging. So doctors and nurses have left the workforce actually in [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=222.24s)]
*  droves because of that burnout issue. There's lots of surveys that show that upwards of 80% [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=227.44s)]
*  of doctors and nurses will say the number one issue in their lives is burnout due to their jobs. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=232.16s)]
*  And again, another ridiculous stat, upwards of 300,000 clinicians left the workforce in the [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=237.60000000000002s)]
*  year 2021. This is in America specifically? In America alone. And even in the last couple of [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=244.64000000000001s)]
*  years, about 7% of the country's total active physician workforce left their day jobs as being [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=250.32s)]
*  clinicians. Even if we were able to train like 100% of the capacity of our medical system, [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=256.4s)]
*  of our licensure system, the folks are just not sticking around because the job itself [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=260.64s)]
*  has so much overhead. The last thing I'll say is that doctors are increasingly taking on more and [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=265.44s)]
*  more administrative functions and academic functions. So another sort of amazing stat is, [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=269.84s)]
*  I used to live in Boston. Boston is actually the highest density of physicians in the entire [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=275.36s)]
*  country, but they have the worst access issues because the vast majority of doctors there are [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=279.84s)]
*  working in academic environments. So more than half of their time might actually be used on research, [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=285.91999999999996s)]
*  not on actual clinical activity. So I can go on and on, but these are some of the reasons why, [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=291.35999999999996s)]
*  even if you were to look at the number of doctors and nurses, there's a lot of other factors that [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=296.4s)]
*  play into the actual capacity that's represented in that pool of labor. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=301.12s)]
*  Yeah. And I want to get into how we maybe solve that with technology, but maybe we can also just [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=304.32s)]
*  quickly speak to what the patient feels. All of us, is it longer wait times at the hospital? [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=308.0s)]
*  Is it more expensive procedures? Is it not being able to even get healthcare in some cases? Can [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=313.76s)]
*  you kind of speak to the second, third order effects that ladder down to the everyday person? [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=318.56s)]
*  Yeah. I think the most obvious issue is wait times. And there are studies that show that the [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=322.8s)]
*  average wait time for, let's say, a specialist appointment across the country is like 50 days, [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=327.12s)]
*  and it can range from like 27 days on the bottom end and up to like 90 days on the high end, [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=332.08s)]
*  and even worse for certain subspecialties. And so that alone is obviously an issue. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=336.96s)]
*  The other related issue is that even when you're able to book an appointment, let's say a month [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=341.2s)]
*  out, there's data that shows that after the second week, like after 14 days, basically the no-show [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=345.68s)]
*  rate goes way up, right? Because your likelihood of actually committing to that date and not [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=351.03999999999996s)]
*  canceling or not just showing up altogether goes through the roof. And so one of the kind of [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=354.4s)]
*  exacerbating issues is that these slots are booked and therefore the doctor is kind of saving that [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=360.0s)]
*  time. But a lot of that just goes unused simply because the patients aren't showing up because [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=365.92s)]
*  they've waited so long for those appointments. To your second point, what happens is that, [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=370.40000000000003s)]
*  you know, if I have an issue and I need to see a doctor immediately, the longer I wait, the longer [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=375.36s)]
*  the chances is that it gets worse, right? I might end up in the emergency room, which obviously can [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=379.68s)]
*  be, you know, 10, if not 100 times more expensive to our healthcare system than that initial [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=383.92s)]
*  physician visit. And then certainly, I mean, another sort of issue, especially just given [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=389.12s)]
*  how much is happening around the consumer healthcare landscape these days. The other [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=393.44s)]
*  challenge is that, you know, the less easy it is for you to see an actual doctor, the more likely [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=397.28s)]
*  that you're going to go online and try to self-diagnose and, you know, get advice from [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=402.32s)]
*  folks who might not be medical- Dr. Google. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=406.32s)]
*  Exactly. And so those are some of the major issues, but I think the wait time piece is [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=408.16s)]
*  like kind of the underlying fundamental challenge that leads to all these negative outcomes. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=412.24s)]
*  Yeah. And I mean, you just spoke to like this idea of Dr. Google and that's where technology [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=416.56s)]
*  maybe is not playing the right role, but it sounds like technology maybe can play a better [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=419.92s)]
*  role. I just love to hear your take on that. Like, is it realistic that technology can actually [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=424.24s)]
*  come in and curb some of these issues? Yeah. I mean, I think that like the way to think about [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=428.32s)]
*  it is sort of absent technology, how would we solve this problem? And, you know, I think it [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=431.92s)]
*  boils down to like, how long are we willing to wait to solve this problem through just simply [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=436.8s)]
*  growing the supply side of our market? And also at what cost, right? To, you know, sort of take [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=440.64s)]
*  those seven to 10 years to like fully train a doctor is not a cheap endeavor. And so that's [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=446.88s)]
*  really where I see the opportunity for technology is to say, listen, what if we just assume that [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=451.12s)]
*  there are a fixed number of clinicians in our system? And if we just have to go with like the [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=455.92s)]
*  number of doctors and nurses that we have today, how can we increase supply and capacity? Well, [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=459.84s)]
*  there's two ways, and this is where this super staffing concept comes in, is how do we super [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=465.12s)]
*  staff by enabling every individual provider to be able to be more productive in their day-to-day [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=469.76s)]
*  work? So that could come in the form of things like co-pilots. How can I ensure that the amount [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=475.52s)]
*  of time that a given doctor is taking to make any given decision at the point of care in real time [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=480.64s)]
*  can be shrunken down such that they are just far more efficient with their decision making [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=485.91999999999996s)]
*  and that the caliber of the decision that's being made can be at parity with, again, the best of [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=490.96s)]
*  their peers on the basis of, you know, sort of great data and great decision support. So I think [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=496.79999999999995s)]
*  co-pilots is one way that you could imagine unlocking, you know, additional capacity within [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=501.92s)]
*  the current existing pool of clinicians. And then a second vector, which is a different form of [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=507.12s)]
*  super staffing, is how do you augment the current labor pool with autonomous agents? And largely, [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=511.92s)]
*  the form that that's taken today is if you were to unbundle the job of a doctor or a nurse, [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=518.96s)]
*  there is a very significant portion of what they do on a day-to-day basis that has nothing to do [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=523.9200000000001s)]
*  with patient care, that has nothing to do with the use of their unique clinical judgment. So can [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=528.32s)]
*  you take those tasks, largely administrative in nature or just communications based, and unbundle [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=532.72s)]
*  those and give those to an autonomous agent to then do at much better scale, with much better [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=538.32s)]
*  accuracy, with much better reliability, such that, again, the clinicians can actually focus on what [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=544.32s)]
*  they do best. And do you have a sense of what portion that is? Like, I know it will differ [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=549.9200000000001s)]
*  based on specialty and doctor, but like, are we talking that this administrative portion is like [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=553.84s)]
*  3% or is it 30%? It could be upward of 50%. Like, half of their job is mired in these, you know, [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=559.44s)]
*  clerical tasks that, again, take their time away from actual care delivery. So, you know, imagine [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=566.5600000000001s)]
*  like almost doubling the capacity of a given clinical labor pool simply by applying some of [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=571.6s)]
*  these unbundling tactics. Are we seeing tools like this already on the market? Where are we in the [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=576.8000000000001s)]
*  trajectory of LLMs or AI in particular entering this industry and actually reshaping it? [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=581.12s)]
*  Yes. And this is what's so exciting right now is that we are truly in like a golden era of healthcare [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=587.28s)]
*  technology adoption. And one of the dynamics that we believe is driving this rapid adoption cycle [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=591.92s)]
*  of these new AI tools is what we call this kind of leapfrog dynamic, where, you know, healthcare [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=598.16s)]
*  historically has been a laggard with respect to software-based technology. And we've always [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=603.36s)]
*  thought that that was sort of to the detriment of our industry and, you know, everyone else has [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=607.52s)]
*  these great workflow tools, these SaaS products. Because we didn't do that as an industry, we don't [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=611.28s)]
*  actually have the sunk cost bias that other industries are facing right now, where they say, [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=616.24s)]
*  like, we just spend billions of dollars laying out these workflow tools. We train an entire [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=620.96s)]
*  generation of our workforce to use these workflow tools. And now we're being faced with a decision, [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=624.72s)]
*  okay, gosh, do I need to spend yet another billion dollars on these new AI products, [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=629.04s)]
*  completely rip and replace this last generation of technology capabilities, and retrain my [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=633.04s)]
*  workforce on a whole new paradigm of how they do their work, versus in healthcare, where we're just [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=637.76s)]
*  simply leaping from we can't throw enough bodies at the problem to how do we actually augment our [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=642.8s)]
*  bodies and extend, you know, the number of bodies through these AI capabilities. And so we believe [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=647.52s)]
*  that that's driving a lot of the rapid adoption cycle that we're seeing right now. There's a few [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=653.28s)]
*  examples of this. So I mentioned kind of copilot versus autonomous. On the copilot side, there's [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=657.4399999999999s)]
*  this class of products called ambient scribe products, where it's a way for a doctor and a [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=662.88s)]
*  patient to be having a visit. And there's an ambient scribe literally listening so the doctor [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=669.92s)]
*  can actually make eye contact with you. They're not sitting there on their laptop and that AI scribe [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=674.32s)]
*  is specifically tuned to be able to translate that conversation into medical documentation that is [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=678.8s)]
*  compliant, that facilitates billing in the appropriate way, that, you know, completely [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=684.72s)]
*  captures the clinical context of that particular encounter, and then can be saved directly into [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=690.16s)]
*  the electronic health record. And so that is a class of products that has really taken off. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=694.48s)]
*  My doctor friends that I talk to are all using, you know, one of these products has completely [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=698.9599999999999s)]
*  transformed their lives. They're getting back hours of the day that are no longer being spent [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=703.28s)]
*  doing manual documentation, which is a requirement of their job. Another example is sort of a class of [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=708.4s)]
*  autonomous communication platforms where, you know, one of the biggest ways by which the [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=715.6s)]
*  healthcare system communicates with us is through call centers, right? And so there's companies like [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=720.48s)]
*  Hippocratic AI in our portfolio that has built an army of super staff, of folks who can actually [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=724.64s)]
*  play the role of either an outbound, you know, call center agent that is trained on very specific [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=730.64s)]
*  protocols, that are infinitely patient and can actually execute a number of tasks that otherwise [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=735.76s)]
*  would rely on humans to do. And what we're seeing is it's remarkable. Number one, you know, most [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=741.6s)]
*  hospitals have about 10 to 20 percent of their headcount open at any given time, and they simply [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=747.0400000000001s)]
*  just can't find enough people to fill those roles, namely in the call center setting. And so what [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=753.84s)]
*  they're saying is, gosh, if we can't hire people fast enough, like, how amazing is it that we could [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=758.0s)]
*  spin up, you know, not just one or two, but 10 or 20 of these autonomous AI agents that are actually, [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=762.8000000000001s)]
*  again, doing the same job as these humans would do. And what's also incredibly interesting and [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=768.72s)]
*  part of, you know, the why now for why we think this trend is going to be at a tipping point [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=773.44s)]
*  is they're starting to say, okay, why can't we just pay for this out of our labor budgets instead of [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=776.96s)]
*  our IT budgets? And one of the historical constraints with healthcare technology has been that the [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=783.0400000000001s)]
*  portion of the budget of, let's say, a hospital that's spent on IT has been a tiny fraction of [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=788.8000000000001s)]
*  what it is in other industries. The average is like 2 to 5 percent of budget goes towards IT in [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=795.12s)]
*  healthcare versus like 15 to 30 percent in like banking or financial services. And so now we have [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=799.76s)]
*  this huge unlock opportunity to say, rather than be constrained by that tiny IT budget, what if we [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=806.24s)]
*  tapped into the 60, 70 percent labor budget and actually be able to create, you know, additional [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=810.88s)]
*  leverage by deploying AI in that fashion? So these are some of the fascinating trends that we're [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=816.48s)]
*  seeing already happening in market that sort of demonstrate, you know, the sort of rapid adoption [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=821.76s)]
*  cycle of these new AI products. Is it just that there is such clear demand to fill these roles [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=827.6s)]
*  that we're seeing something different today? Or why does it seem like there has been this adoption [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=832.8s)]
*  or like jumping to participate in this AI wave when we didn't really see that in the pass wave? [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=836.8s)]
*  There is just a very high burden of integration, right? Like at the end of the day, if you're [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=841.68s)]
*  going to be introducing a new software tool into someone's workflow, it has to deeply integrate [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=845.4399999999999s)]
*  with, you know, an EHR type system or whatever other, you know, practice management system they [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=849.52s)]
*  might have. And, you know, those systems are 40, 50 years old. They don't always have great APIs. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=853.28s)]
*  And so just the amount of work and time and sort of customization that's necessary to get those in [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=858.0799999999999s)]
*  has been a huge barrier to adoption in the past. The second thing I would highlight is that these [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=862.96s)]
*  are just magical products, right? We have a company called Ambience Healthcare in our portfolio that [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=867.6s)]
*  creates one of these Ambience scribe tools. And when you look at the testimonial videos that they [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=871.4399999999999s)]
*  have from their doctor users, it's unbelievable. I mean, these folks are like literally in tears [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=874.72s)]
*  saying that it's, you know, if they've been a doctor for 30 years, it's like the first time [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=879.44s)]
*  that they've actually enjoyed the job of being a doctor because it's just allowed them to focus [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=883.12s)]
*  on the patient. The last waves of technology products that have been given to them have just [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=888.1600000000001s)]
*  increased the amount of complexity of their jobs, whereas these are doing exactly the opposite. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=893.0400000000001s)]
*  Are there challenges though to actually implementing this that you're seeing on the [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=897.6800000000001s)]
*  ground, whether it's the tools today or the things that you see on the horizon? [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=901.12s)]
*  The stakes are much higher, obviously, in the healthcare setting and, you know, the [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=904.24s)]
*  hallucination issues that you see with kind of the generalist foundation models, like that is [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=908.0s)]
*  just a non-starter. And so what we have seen and perhaps why there was maybe a little bit of lag [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=911.52s)]
*  relative to some of the generalist foundation models in terms of adoption in healthcare, but [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=916.0s)]
*  these companies that I'm describing have built specialist models in healthcare. One of the issues [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=920.16s)]
*  with the generalist foundation models is that, I mean, not an issue, it's obviously a huge feature [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=925.36s)]
*  that they are trained on internet data, like the entirety of all publicly available human knowledge, [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=929.92s)]
*  but the reality of healthcare is that the majority of sort of the esoteric, [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=934.88s)]
*  protocol-specific, compliance-specific information tends to not just be online, it tends to be in [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=939.92s)]
*  these proprietary systems behind the firewall, embedded into paper-based binders and things [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=946.0799999999999s)]
*  like that. And because of that, it is necessary for these companies to build specialist models [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=951.36s)]
*  that are trained on a different set of data, then they might extend, you know, some of those [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=956.48s)]
*  foundational model, generalist models, but they do need to ingest a different set of information [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=960.0s)]
*  and specifically be tuned for safety, right? And so people do need a specialist approach to [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=964.88s)]
*  tuning the foundation models to perform appropriately in this setting. Another one would be exactly what [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=969.6s)]
*  you said, the regulatory compliance issues associated with the use of autonomous AI in particular, [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=974.48s)]
*  and how that bumps up against FDA approval criteria, you know, under what circumstances do [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=980.4s)]
*  you need to get an AI tool approved by FDA or not? It's somewhat... [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=986.0s)]
*  Do you? [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=991.2s)]
*  Yes, in fact, one of the benefits that healthcare has had is that we are the only industry that [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=992.32s)]
*  actually has an existing regulatory framework for approving products, especially in the clinical [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=997.2s)]
*  setting. So there are already hundreds of AI radiology models or, you know, other models that [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=1002.64s)]
*  sort of help, like, automate the assessment and diagnosis of a given set of patients based on a [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=1008.32s)]
*  certain area of medicine. But how does that apply to a gen AI model? You know, there's a lot of work [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=1014.9599999999999s)]
*  being done right now by the FDA to really extend those models to be appropriate for these far more [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=1019.76s)]
*  dynamic systems that just have a lot more uncertainty than your standard kind of ML predictive [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=1024.32s)]
*  model modality, which is really what that system was designed for. The last thing I'll say is [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=1030.32s)]
*  reimbursement. There are some early signs that insurance companies are creating actual billing [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=1034.48s)]
*  codes for AI, where they now say that, you know, an AI-enabled, you know, visit or an AI-enabled [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=1041.68s)]
*  diagnostic can now be reimbursed differentially, and you can get, you know, sort of credit for [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=1049.1200000000001s)]
*  using these AI systems in a different way than if you were just, you know, not. And so that's really [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=1053.76s)]
*  exciting to see these new paradigms persist. But I think there's still very much a long pool until [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=1058.0s)]
*  we have the ability to say, okay, if I have a fully autonomous, like, AI therapist, like Slingshot AI, [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=1062.72s)]
*  which is one of our portfolio companies, how can we ensure that those will be systematically [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=1069.12s)]
*  reimbursed? At least at parity with what a human therapist might get reimbursed for that has yet [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=1073.1999999999998s)]
*  not been defined in our industry. So I think there's a lot of good early signs that there's [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=1079.36s)]
*  a willingness by the system to embrace these new paradigms, but still a lot of wood to chop in terms [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=1085.28s)]
*  of defining a comprehensive set of ways to get that in. Do you think that this has the potential [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=1090.6399999999999s)]
*  to kind of even reshape the ecosystem that already exists and not just augment it? [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=1095.2s)]
*  Yeah, I think there's a lot of, like, really amazing things that are now possible to do. So [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=1099.3600000000001s)]
*  one really interesting one is just, you know, we, part of the constraint of our current clinical [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=1104.56s)]
*  supply is that we do have state-by-state licensure, right? So if you, if I become a doctor, [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=1108.32s)]
*  I'm basically constrained by my geography. And if there's a poor patient who, you know, happens to [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=1113.68s)]
*  need my services in Montana, and I'm not licensed there, then, but I do have capacity, I'm not able [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=1118.64s)]
*  to serve that person. I think what this whole kind of AI world unlocks is that what, imagine that [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=1124.56s)]
*  you had national scale capacity, and the sort of the routing challenge becomes a really unique one [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=1130.56s)]
*  that actually could leverage AI, right? So there's this new concept that actually one of our portfolio [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=1137.44s)]
*  companies introduced called asynchronous medicine, which means, okay, the typical way we think about, [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=1141.76s)]
*  you know, seeing a doctor is you show up at their office, it's a 30-minute visit, it's face-to-face [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=1147.28s)]
*  and live, and it's highly transactional, though, right? So you're in and you're out, and then, [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=1151.92s)]
*  you know, months might go by, or years might go by between visits. Whereas asynchronous care is [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=1156.16s)]
*  something that completely flips that paradigm on its head and says, what if your doctor was in the [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=1161.3600000000001s)]
*  cloud, and any time of the day, 24-7, you could text them, you could, you know, send them a message, [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=1165.6000000000001s)]
*  and they would respond, you know, in near real time. But the level of sort of ongoing engagement [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=1171.3600000000001s)]
*  that you can have, like the friction to any one encounter with your doctor goes way down, [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=1177.52s)]
*  because you can text them at any time of day. And that's a new paradigm that, again, is kind [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=1181.2s)]
*  of purely enabled through these AI-powered clinic models, where you can have these doctors who are [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=1185.68s)]
*  available, you know, 24-7, who are using AI as co-pilots to enable them to be hyper-responsive to [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=1192.16s)]
*  any question that comes in. And so I do think that the nature of maybe how doctors do get trained, [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=1198.48s)]
*  and like what specialties actually exist that don't exist today, I think a lot of those contours are [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=1203.92s)]
*  very dynamically changing as we speak. Since this was your big idea for next year, [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=1209.04s)]
*  is there anything that you're specifically looking out for or excited to see? [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=1212.72s)]
*  We've just never seen the rate of technology adoption that we're seeing now ever in the history [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=1216.56s)]
*  of healthcare IT. You know, we've been waiting for these moments to sort of take what we know to be [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=1221.92s)]
*  the problems, and we know what the solutions can look like, but there's just been, again, like this [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=1226.56s)]
*  sort of barrier between the problem space and the solutions. And, you know, I think what we're seeing [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=1230.08s)]
*  now are signs that perhaps that wall has been broken. We're at a breaking point where the [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=1237.2s)]
*  industry needs these solutions, and therefore we're going to see much higher adoption than [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=1240.8s)]
*  we've ever seen before. I think it will come in the form of these super staff. I think we will [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=1244.56s)]
*  increasingly see adoption of these AI tools in the form of labor and, you know, coming from completely [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=1248.32s)]
*  different budgets, from completely different buyers than we've historically seen. And, you know, [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=1255.92s)]
*  I think this is all to lay down the groundwork to truly unlock the latent capacity that we have on [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=1260.4s)]
*  the supply side of our market that's been sitting there all along, but just hasn't had the right [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=1266.16s)]
*  technology modality to unlock it at scale. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0yt31WSGIs&t=1270.5600000000002s)]
