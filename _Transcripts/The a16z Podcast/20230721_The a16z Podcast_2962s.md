# Growth vs Efficiency: Can You Have Both?
**The a16z Podcast:** [July 21, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA)
*  We need to try to get back to like fundamentals and how do we actually iterate and ship fast? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=0.0s)]
*  We have to build products that are constantly evolving and that are constantly learning and [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=4.88s)]
*  evolving from those learnings. The only way really to stay ahead of that curve on that consumer side [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=9.6s)]
*  is get the lightnings keep hitting. I mean that sounds hard. Be real that's incredibly hard. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=14.88s)]
*  Second product hitting so rare. Third product hitting your generational company. It's like [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=20.64s)]
*  there's this big wave coming and it might hit your ship. Is there a way to avoid the wave? I [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=25.28s)]
*  don't think so. I think it's kind of a tsunami. If you sit there it's just going to wash you away. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=31.200000000000003s)]
*  People will want to talk to people. It's like community becomes much more important. Referral [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=34.64s)]
*  becomes much more important. Where the math becomes much more important. The new limiting [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=38.88s)]
*  factor is possibly creativity. That's a very very fun place to be. Despite it being easier than ever [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=42.400000000000006s)]
*  to build a product it may actually be harder than ever to grow one especially sustainably [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=48.88s)]
*  with many tried and true channels no longer working as they once did. Paid platforms were [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=54.72s)]
*  hit with app transparency tracking. SEO is now threatened by AI chat. Social graphs have moved [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=60.0s)]
*  to interest graphs. Product-led growth is easier than ever to copy and virality is just as transient [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=65.76s)]
*  if not more transient than before. And those are just a few of the examples that founders are facing. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=72.24s)]
*  So what growth green space still exists especially in an era of austerity? How do you balance [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=78.96s)]
*  efficiency and profitability while still growing? And what channels matter and how do you master them [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=85.11999999999999s)]
*  in 2023? These are just a few of the questions we address in this episode together with three people [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=90.16s)]
*  that have successfully grown companies through similarly confusing waves of the past. First off [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=96.16s)]
*  we have Gina Gotthelf now leading Latitude but perhaps most well known for her impressive reign [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=101.6s)]
*  as a VP of growth at Duolingo growing them from three to three hundred million users with no paid [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=107.36s)]
*  budget. We also have Kieran Flanagan join the conversation long-time SVP of marketing at HubSpot [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=114.08s)]
*  where he was a founding member of their international business all the way up to [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=120.08s)]
*  HubSpot hitting over one billion dollars in ARR. And finally we have our very own Brian Kim partner [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=123.84s)]
*  at A16Z who also held several leadership roles at Snap from their hyper growth days all the way [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=130.8s)]
*  through IPO. All right I won't keep you waiting any longer let's dive in. As a reminder the content [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=137.2s)]
*  here is for informational purposes only should not be taken as legal business tax or investment [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=144.32s)]
*  advice or be used to evaluate any investment or security and is not directed at any investors or [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=149.44s)]
*  potential investors in any A16Z fund. Please note that A16Z and its affiliates may also maintain [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=154.39999999999998s)]
*  investments in the companies discussed in this podcast. For more details including a link to [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=160.88s)]
*  our investments please see a16z.com slash disclosures. What are you seeing in terms of growth that still [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=165.76s)]
*  works in 2023? Are there white spaces that companies can can tackle? What's happening is kind of really [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=181.67999999999998s)]
*  interesting because there may be like AI is somewhat of a tailwind for like maybe 12 months or 18 months [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=187.76s)]
*  for the best people and then who knows after that maybe a headwind across everything. So I think [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=194.8s)]
*  certainly in search I really dug in there and there are lots of examples of the click-through [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=199.36s)]
*  rate decrease in and the amount of traffic you get from Google search pages decrease in but I still [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=205.84s)]
*  think there's like a lot of value in that. Paid ads very similar I still think there's a lot of value [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=210.24s)]
*  in that. What really happened with with the popularity and growth of the internet is like [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=213.84s)]
*  marketing growth became much more measurable and they could have a seat of the revenue table they [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=217.84s)]
*  could say I put a dollar in here and I get three dollars out here and the growth that's starting to [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=221.76s)]
*  happen today or where things are starting to shift is a little bit back to like this indirect [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=226.39999999999998s)]
*  causation. These channels like if you look at the platforms that that's growing it's like short [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=230.48s)]
*  short from video, TikTok, YouTube like these kind of media channels. If you look at where I think [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=234.95999999999998s)]
*  things will go with the evolution of AI people will want to talk to people so like community [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=239.92s)]
*  becomes much more important, referral becomes much more important, where the mouth becomes much more [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=245.12s)]
*  important. All of these things are going to shift us back into like the place where we have to be [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=248.8s)]
*  okay doing things where you can't measure everything directly all the time and I actually don't think [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=255.84s)]
*  that's a bad thing because I think the over index of measurements forces everyone into the middle [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=260.32s)]
*  and everything becomes like mundane and lacks creativity and so I think that there's like some [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=265.76s)]
*  pros and cons to actually this happening but there's certainly a change in terms of how you [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=272.16s)]
*  are able to do your work and actually relay the value of that work to like the founder who the [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=278.4s)]
*  founder is for the most part still going to be stuck in the binary give me three dollars for the [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=283.59999999999997s)]
*  dollar that I give you. We're almost like going back to the origins of advertising isn't that like [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=288.15999999999997s)]
*  there's that saying that says you need to hit someone seven times before they convert and [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=293.03999999999996s)]
*  Facebook maybe changed that maybe it was like two times and then it feels like we're sliding back [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=296.79999999999995s)]
*  in the other direction. I think it has always been the case that people need repetition to really [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=301.28s)]
*  notice something and yes more and more there's more media there's more for us to watch and listen [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=307.04s)]
*  to and we're more distracted so I think that that becomes even more the case but I may be [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=312.96000000000004s)]
*  simplistic but I don't think that much is changing because to me thinking about growth is about [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=320.40000000000003s)]
*  the framework for understanding what makes people tick what people care about how to reach one person [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=325.12s)]
*  or one media outlet or one channel whatever it is that will reach a lot more people in the most [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=332.0s)]
*  efficient way possible. What are the moments in your product that people really really care about [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=337.68s)]
*  meaning like number of people who actually encounter that moment and if you actually make [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=342.56s)]
*  a modification like make some sort of like a b-test or change you'll actually see significance as a [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=347.2s)]
*  school results on the other end because you know people really care about that one moment it could [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=352.0s)]
*  be a notification it could be a screen you know we we keep seeing these trends and and think that [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=355.92s)]
*  things grow and Ebb SEO rules are constantly changing because we're at the whim of algorithms [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=360.56s)]
*  and so we're just constantly trying to adapt. Places become saturated like at one point it [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=366.32s)]
*  was really trendy and cool to do ads inside the subway in New York City like that was like [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=370.32s)]
*  someone discovered that in 2012 which is funny because it feels pretty obvious then suddenly [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=376.96s)]
*  everyone was doing it everyone's testing with notifications and everyone's saying notifications [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=380.8s)]
*  are just there's too many and it doesn't matter I think all of those channels are still very [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=385.04s)]
*  relevant it's about finding how to actually impact how people feel and finding you know new [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=388.72s)]
*  ways of impacting people that are cheaper because less people are using it over and over so I think [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=394.88000000000005s)]
*  that that will continue to be the case and you know it just depends on on what's the trendy channel [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=399.68s)]
*  and what are people paying attention to but if you think a priori like that like how do I reach one [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=405.28000000000003s)]
*  that can then reach a lot or what are the things that I can modify that actually make a difference [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=410.16s)]
*  then I don't think that much has changed. I have like a slightly heretical take so this is going [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=414.71999999999997s)]
*  to be fun but you know when we talk about gross especially I know A16D we're all we're in the [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=419.35999999999996s)]
*  Silicon Valley and the stalwart what have you but when I think about gross this like gross tactic [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=424.64s)]
*  gross you know channels and you know even the word gross hack became very popular in that you know [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=429.44s)]
*  there's this this prevalent theory and sort of Kieran touched on it where you can put in a dollar [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=436.32s)]
*  and get back Y and like I put an X dollar get get Y back and I think that certainly became true and [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=441.36s)]
*  you know there became so many channels and there became so many wisdoms and tried and true tactics [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=448.40000000000003s)]
*  whether it's SEO or ambassador program or community building where everyone's trying to learn from [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=454.48s)]
*  each other I'm like how do I hack this thing Gina said something interesting where this is sort of [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=459.52000000000004s)]
*  how I think about it where like moments in the product when people go aha like this is great [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=463.52000000000004s)]
*  at the end of the day I think gross we're sort of conflating two things one is the actual product [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=467.68s)]
*  is is a sticky does it does it enable you to continue to come back because gross at the end [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=472.96000000000004s)]
*  of the day is like how many people continue to use your product it's like not a singular metric of [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=477.20000000000005s)]
*  like on day X how many people showed up well that's useful for today but actually for a company that [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=482.56s)]
*  is ongoing concern what you want to know is like how many people consistently show up and how does [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=488.16s)]
*  that grow right it's a cumulative concept which means that you know the fact that people come back [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=492.32s)]
*  day in day out is probably one of the most important factor in in assessing the gross [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=497.44s)]
*  potential and gross of it which to me goes back to a little bit of product where when people first [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=502.4s)]
*  come on like we all know this but you know the biggest drop off typically day one or day zero [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=508.48s)]
*  when you know people come on they do onboarding and maybe they didn't get to the aha moment quickly [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=513.2s)]
*  so why would they come back if they don't come back then your game as a gross is like how do [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=518.8s)]
*  I get more acquisition right because gross to me is also sort of a you know numerically almost [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=523.4399999999999s)]
*  an equation there's like you know people who showed up yesterday plus new people that you [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=528.3199999999999s)]
*  acquired minus the churn people plus the resurrected people that's sort of like an equation and when [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=532.64s)]
*  you think about you know how to get the retention of I think it all goes back to product why as [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=537.92s)]
*  founders and operators why is there gross in your product like why is it useful for more people [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=543.52s)]
*  and is is your product you know constructed in a way as Gina said like gets you you know helps [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=550.16s)]
*  people understand what your product is about when they first use it can you deliver that product [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=557.1999999999999s)]
*  value again and again consistently I think now we call it product like gross but it's honestly [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=561.92s)]
*  like a core product value and how you actually define that is one and a lot of things that we're [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=566.4s)]
*  also talking about here is like distribution so there's like a product and the distribution side of [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=571.04s)]
*  it and if we think of like distribution I think you know the panel is exactly right there you know [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=574.88s)]
*  there are uh you know areas where it's less good now and there are areas that are continuing to be [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=580.3199999999999s)]
*  good you know you talked about advertising there's that that's saying that you know you never know [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=585.8399999999999s)]
*  where half of it goes and you know maybe we're going back to that but you know I think there are [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=590.88s)]
*  many other areas that continue to do work work well whether a subway ad or remnant tv as a radio [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=595.6800000000001s)]
*  it depends on your product is and when your intended audience is if you're you know marketing [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=602.5600000000001s)]
*  or or appealing to young generation of you know gamers or communities or niche areas and [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=608.4s)]
*  reddit and discord are actually pretty good places I also think you know [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=615.12s)]
*  ATT did kneecap a lot of the sort of advertising paid advertising uh side of things but you know [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=619.6800000000001s)]
*  the ai like here and also talked about can also be used for that purpose right you know facebook or [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=625.6800000000001s)]
*  meta is investing heavily on you know ai side of it so that all sometimes all you need to do is [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=631.44s)]
*  just say hey like I have this idea here's like the base creative and now they're able to like [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=638.32s)]
*  change what how it looks to add different you know copy like change the thing to see what works [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=643.6s)]
*  automatically at scale with ai and deliver higher value and that's also you know very promising [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=649.52s)]
*  I think direction that we're seeing where the efficacy of the paid side it may also be [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=656.16s)]
*  restored yeah I mean I like the breakdown between there is product and there is distribution [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=661.04s)]
*  those ladder up to growth but maybe if we just attack this idea of building a good product [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=665.76s)]
*  that's not a new idea but it does feel like at least to me maybe we are in a different era where [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=671.84s)]
*  it's easier to copy products and so is it just about being a first mover in in an era where [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=678.08s)]
*  things are easier than ever to build and maybe Gina you can speak to that because Duolingo [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=683.92s)]
*  kind of famously grew with no marketing budget is that correct or very little marketing budget [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=688.16s)]
*  and it was it was exactly product-led growth that resulted in that company becoming so big [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=693.52s)]
*  yes so what I think has really changed with tech is that people could say oh my product is really [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=699.76s)]
*  good before but like it wasn't as easy to know whether a product is good or not good as it is [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=705.92s)]
*  now because you can actually see that in metrics in terms of as Ryan was saying just in terms of [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=710.64s)]
*  retention and people coming back again so now that defines what a good product is but it's not just [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=715.1999999999999s)]
*  about building a product that's good but also the fact that with tech we have to build products that [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=720.16s)]
*  are constantly evolving and that are constantly learning and evolving from those learnings but [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=727.04s)]
*  the main thing I think that like when you talk about Duolingo what we're trying to do at Latitude [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=731.04s)]
*  now which is my new company the importance of not just building a great product but understanding [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=736.7199999999999s)]
*  really clearly what your moat is and your moat needs to be something that makes it really hard [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=740.24s)]
*  to replicate your product and it can be anything right like so for example if Kim Kardashian [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=744.7199999999999s)]
*  launches a shoe that's exactly just like every other shoe that exists out there the moat is [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=750.24s)]
*  Kim Kardashian because her brand and her audience and like the fact that she is an influencer she's [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=754.5600000000001s)]
*  not telling people to buy the shoe that's a moat it means that like it's the thing that makes it [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=759.6800000000001s)]
*  really hard for you to go and just do that again with Duolingo the product is the moat and that's [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=763.9200000000001s)]
*  the most incredible thing because of what I just said before about the iteration and the iterative [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=769.6800000000001s)]
*  practice anyone at any particular moment in time and many did try could actually go and copy exactly [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=774.08s)]
*  what Duolingo was doing they could they in fact use the same font in many cases they use the same [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=780.32s)]
*  design colors like the same format you can do that but you don't have the data and the team behind [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=784.24s)]
*  it that knows how to use that data that is constantly learning from every single day of [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=790.48s)]
*  you know all of the usage that we're getting and understanding what's leading to every single [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=795.5200000000001s)]
*  decision and why we're modifying things in a particular way that's impossible to catch up to [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=799.9200000000001s)]
*  so at every moment in time even if you mimic exactly what Duolingo is there's no way you're [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=805.2800000000001s)]
*  going to get to the next day of Duolingo because you don't have all of that history or the knowledge [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=809.84s)]
*  of how to use that history so you could just spend all your time trying to like copy Duolingo [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=814.1600000000001s)]
*  every single day but that doesn't actually get you to solve a problem for a consumer and understanding [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=817.9200000000001s)]
*  how what you're doing is actually solving a real problem which is at the core of as we were saying [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=823.52s)]
*  a retentive product that people actually like and that defines a good product so it's not as easy as [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=828.96s)]
*  it sounds. It's definitely not as easy as it sounds. Kieran I want you to tap in here you now [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=834.96s)]
*  are the CMO at Zapier which I feel like actually is a great parallel to what Gina just said I mean [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=841.2s)]
*  Zapier has so many you could say clones or competitors right like I've used many of them [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=846.48s)]
*  many of them are cheaper how do you think about that differentiation and building a product and [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=851.9200000000001s)]
*  to Gina's point like getting the right data and involving it in a way that you can stay ahead you [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=856.4000000000001s)]
*  can have a moat. Yeah I think first remove your advantage is useful if you can build a healthy [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=861.28s)]
*  retention curve and that retention curve helps you make that product much better over time and so [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=867.4399999999999s)]
*  you're just like making it much harder to compete with you and that can be in all manner of things [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=871.04s)]
*  like Zapier's moat for some time was just they had much more expansive coverage of apps and the [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=874.48s)]
*  amount of things that you can automate with and then like more recently it's like how do how do [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=880.0s)]
*  we integrate AI how do we make automation much much easier for companies how can they actually do [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=883.4399999999999s)]
*  natural language within their apps like one of the things that's super interesting about [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=888.24s)]
*  the AI part just coming back like the distribution then the product part and the product life growth [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=891.84s)]
*  and like AI is a phenomenal unlock for product life growth because product life growth will get [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=896.88s)]
*  naturally built into every single product because every single product will have a natural language [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=900.96s)]
*  interface and so like you will actually be able to onboard the products and use products without [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=904.8s)]
*  actually any human intervention and I think that's an incredible like augmentation of like how [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=909.44s)]
*  apps work in general but I think the the moat part is going to be much more complex like I'm [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=915.6800000000001s)]
*  talking through the lens of b2b not through consumer apps but certainly for b2b it's going [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=924.0s)]
*  to be somewhat more complicated to figure out over time because AI does commoditize things and make [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=928.08s)]
*  things much easier to replicate and we've seen like AI may be one of the few platform shifts that [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=932.72s)]
*  actually skews towards the monopolies and conglomerates versus like these individual [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=937.12s)]
*  companies who just get sucked up and their features of these existing platforms like it [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=942.08s)]
*  kind of skews towards if you have distribution you might win because I think AI features might [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=945.5200000000001s)]
*  be more of a retention play than an actually new acquisition play which is like if you build the AI [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=949.84s)]
*  features into a platform no one will go leave to you to actually use all these different like point [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=955.12s)]
*  solutions so I think the moat thing is I think modes will exist in similar formats there may [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=959.6s)]
*  be just companies with less of them and I do think distribution is a moat retention is a moat network [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=965.9200000000001s)]
*  effects will still be a moat community is a moat and so I think I think of all of those things in [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=969.68s)]
*  relation to Zapter like how how are we touching on all of those things as we continue to grow the [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=973.12s)]
*  company one thing I want to respond to what Kieran said you know at latitude I would say the community [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=977.04s)]
*  is our moat but the reason why the community is our moat in addition to the distribution aspect [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=981.8399999999999s)]
*  of it is the trust building so trust can be a moat because that takes a while to build so for [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=986.88s)]
*  b2b product I think that's also super relevant because if someone can come into the market and [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=991.76s)]
*  just like offer the same product but you've built a brand on the Zapier side that is super [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=996.88s)]
*  trustworthy and you know and so people will will continue to to trust new features or new solutions [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=1002.08s)]
*  that you put out there instead of trying to you know maybe try a new product I think that that's [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=1008.88s)]
*  another aspect worth considering by the way Kieran how many times a day do you get asked if it's [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=1014.08s)]
*  Zapier or Zapier I don't even know if I say it correctly I say Zapier but it may be Zapier [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=1018.16s)]
*  no I heard one of the founders say it's Zapier it rhymes with happier because it makes oh there you [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=1023.92s)]
*  go okay great I learned something about I learned something about it that's how I thought about it [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=1030.8s)]
*  yeah it's Zapier yeah yeah it's the main reason I joined is just I like saying the word Zap's [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=1036.6399999999999s)]
*  like it's just a cool world I know we talked a little bit about b2b just talking about more [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=1041.12s)]
*  the consumer side gross and sort of thinking about distribution it has changed I think [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=1046.32s)]
*  you know a long time ago already Mark Zuckerberg at Meta already said you know it's a battle for the [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=1055.04s)]
*  you know home screen and more and more even recently people are downloading less and less [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=1060.4s)]
*  apps over time part one part two is it's harder and harder to get discovered in the app store [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=1066.56s)]
*  you know app store ranking is uh is hard to sort of get discovery now so now you have this issue [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=1074.48s)]
*  of one people are less willing to download brand new things and two even if they sort of kind of [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=1080.0800000000002s)]
*  heard about you it's like harder to get discovered so I think part one of the consumer side the [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=1085.3600000000001s)]
*  platforms have a lack of a better word maybe I can call it ossified where there are two distribution [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=1091.6000000000001s)]
*  platform google play and apple store great and they just distribute apps and people redownload [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=1098.64s)]
*  ton of apps they retry a lot of things but brand new things not so much or certainly less than [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=1104.5600000000002s)]
*  before so now you have this conundrum of like okay like it's just harder to break through the [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=1110.64s)]
*  noises and we talked a little bit about especially kieran talked about you know maybe ai is a is an [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=1116.24s)]
*  accelerant for retention maybe less of an acquisition I think that's that's correct and [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=1122.4s)]
*  that's interesting where also we have a lot of these like incumbents right like especially in [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=1126.72s)]
*  the consumer side incumbents come with incredible modes they already have the network effect they [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=1131.6000000000001s)]
*  already are synced to everything they already have login for everything they already have all your [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=1138.0s)]
*  data they know what you bought they they they know you so you talked about how to do how do you stay [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=1142.0s)]
*  ahead it's very very very difficult actually even if you have a clever hag all these companies come [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=1150.24s)]
*  up with incredible new consumer products and they enter the zeitgeist and through entering the zeitgeist [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=1159.1200000000001s)]
*  they're able to solve the you know first order question how do I break through the noise and [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=1167.2s)]
*  get distributed initially and have more people to try it out that alone is a feat that's incredible [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=1172.08s)]
*  if you have highly retentive product on top of that legendary that's amazing fantastic and all [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=1178.8s)]
*  these all these products that we talked about did have that now the question is okay copying [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=1184.24s)]
*  Gina you talked about people copying down to fonts I I understand that so deeply of that snapchat for [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=1189.52s)]
*  four or four or five years and yeah you know down to the font and every single like ui level yes they [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=1195.6s)]
*  copy everything and how do you actually fight that as a new entrant especially when incumbents come [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=1202.96s)]
*  bearing a lot of these already like weaponaries if you will that have retention and data and [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=1212.72s)]
*  everything it's hard and I and I think actually and this is like a sort of difficult answer [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=1218.72s)]
*  the only way really to stay ahead of that curve on that consumer side is get the lightnings keep [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=1224.72s)]
*  hitting which is so so so hard I think getting you know the first hit is so hard second product [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=1231.36s)]
*  hitting so rare third product hitting you're a generational company so you know it's sort of [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=1239.12s)]
*  that innovation curve that I think is like very interesting so for the companies that are newly [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=1246.56s)]
*  entering and bringing building new product and we're on the side of the builders right incumbents [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=1251.52s)]
*  may have like all the advantage but we want to see new products we want to see new you know [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=1256.08s)]
*  hungry founder that are building for the next generation and they're not happy with the current [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=1261.9199999999998s)]
*  set of solutions so the only way potentially is you know there are series of things but like step [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=1266.24s)]
*  one boss game is like how do you get through the distribution noise step two boss game is you know [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=1271.6799999999998s)]
*  how do you get retentive product great step three and this is like a holy grail in my mind is like [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=1276.08s)]
*  how do you keep hitting that lightning like get get that lightning to hit continue to enter zeitgeist [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=1280.64s)]
*  and for that you know I think it's thoughtfulness I think it's a structure of the company I think [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=1287.2s)]
*  the culture of the founders and the team of wanting to continue to put out the best and [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=1292.16s)]
*  brightest work that they have continuously versus potentially resting on laurels or optimizing for [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=1297.3600000000001s)]
*  things that have worked in the past and thinking that their first iteration product is what is [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=1303.44s)]
*  going to bring them to the next next next level because they may not be because the distribution [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=1308.08s)]
*  advantage of the incumbents as well as the difficulty of getting further discovery what's [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=1312.96s)]
*  an example of that that sounds really hard is there an example of a company that you've seen [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=1318.8799999999999s)]
*  execute on that hard mode really well today I mean you know one of the last examples I've seen in [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=1323.1999999999998s)]
*  you know one of our portfolio companies be real has done that too with with certain features but [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=1330.96s)]
*  if you think about the I'll talk about snaps is that's the name I know well and you know [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=1335.2s)]
*  it's been copied so many times what have you you know the first hit one may think is the [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=1340.0s)]
*  disappearing images that was revolutionary that people thought of images as something to keep on [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=1344.56s)]
*  your phone it's like for recording and for keep keepsakes you turn that into disappearing thing [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=1349.6000000000001s)]
*  which made the medium itself a message communication method that's revolutionary very interesting you [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=1354.72s)]
*  know sexting was the first use case but it like catapulted the company to new new new heights [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=1360.56s)]
*  great so that was going really well now then the kicker is they then started to add stories [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=1366.08s)]
*  right stories of you know these disappearing photos like linked together that shows you a day [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=1373.52s)]
*  in time in your life in a passive way but also goes away revolutionary in that in that sense then [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=1379.2s)]
*  that to me is the second zeitgeist hit that enabled the lights of you know of something [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=1385.9199999999998s)]
*  being copied too right everyone has them now everybody has it like like linkedin has stories [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=1391.6s)]
*  like no no dig on linkedin but like everyone has stories now so you know it's a medium and like a [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=1397.52s)]
*  it's a thing that worked really really well and potentially even burst like the short video [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=1403.52s)]
*  uh type thing uh that's trend so to think about the second innovation that's like a huge innovation [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=1407.6s)]
*  third also is you know they did a rest there it was like okay we we are seeing more and more people [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=1413.28s)]
*  abandon the front front result of the front facing camera what is the problem well they don't like [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=1419.28s)]
*  what they look like well let's add dog ears on people's face let's let's like rainbow pukes on [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=1423.76s)]
*  people's face and honestly and again that's another thing uh stuff where everyone copied like everyone [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=1430.4s)]
*  has lens now like it's it's very very ubiquitous in tiktok uh you know puking rainbows and stuff [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=1436.32s)]
*  rainbows blue eyes what have you but these augmented reality effects are are now prevalent [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=1443.12s)]
*  in consumer products so this is one example where i think each subsequent hits have essentially [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=1448.6399999999999s)]
*  catapulted the company to new heights and that i know from inside was very difficult very long [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=1455.76s)]
*  term with several bets going at the same time uh and became being very thoughtful what to kill and [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=1463.84s)]
*  what to put out there so it's that system of innovation is that hunger and continues continuous [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=1470.24s)]
*  past that i think is is very important that's feed and hunger and being able to like implement [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=1477.52s)]
*  all that at a fairly large and established company i think is a very difficult thing so [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=1482.32s)]
*  i think there's a cultural aspect i think they're the founders mentality of always wanting to be [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=1486.8s)]
*  ahead of the curve always implementing and sort of uh looping in the new products that the users [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=1492.0s)]
*  are looking for how do you foster that culture i think especially in 2023 where maybe budgets [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=1497.92s)]
*  aren't as big maybe some of the talent you had before is not used to that austerity or that [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=1504.0s)]
*  that idea of having to ship really quickly maybe spend less money and just figure it out i've talked [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=1510.24s)]
*  to a lot of companies this year that were cd public i feel like a lot of founders are actually [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=1515.76s)]
*  excited to get back to shipping like i like i think we went through this ballooning of companies [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=1524.16s)]
*  during covid and everyone's like wow like i don't really know how this company even [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=1529.92s)]
*  works anymore yes and we need to try to get back to like fundamentals uh and how do we actually [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=1534.8000000000002s)]
*  iterate and ship fast but i think what really is exciting in tech is like getting back to the reason [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=1540.96s)]
*  that people were excited to get into tech like certainly i was as a failed software engineer is [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=1546.64s)]
*  to do work like not to like figure out how to like coordinate hundreds of people but i actually like [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=1551.2s)]
*  to get back and do work and ship things and i think the faster you ship the more you learn so i think [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=1557.0400000000002s)]
*  it comes from the founder like i guess is a long-winded way to say like i think you'll have [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=1561.0400000000002s)]
*  some founders that embrace this and actually at the heart they actually thrive and they kind of [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=1564.8000000000002s)]
*  chaos they actually enjoy this period of time especially like a lot of founders who are building [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=1569.44s)]
*  with ai i've met lots who are like this is the best time to be a founder because we have no idea [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=1573.92s)]
*  how this is gonna go and they love that they don't they love like not knowing what the end result is [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=1578.88s)]
*  rather than just tweaking the dials and trying to eek out little bits of growth each and every day [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=1582.8000000000002s)]
*  and that trickles down from them right they they set the tempo and it's up to the rest of us to [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=1586.5600000000002s)]
*  up level to meet that bar this comes from two places one as as kieran said from the founder so [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=1590.96s)]
*  from the top and i think that what the founder can do is come up with artificial deadlines for [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=1596.0800000000002s)]
*  example we have to launch in september because we're doing an event for 4 000 people and that's [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=1600.72s)]
*  when we need to launch and that's it or like a duolingo would be like oh you know we told apple [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=1604.16s)]
*  that we're actually going to make this sprint and now that's that's there so we just have to do it [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=1608.64s)]
*  and so suddenly it's not like something that like can be pushed because there's this external [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=1613.6000000000001s)]
*  deadline a lot of times it was artificial because you kind of create it but now it's set in stone [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=1617.2800000000002s)]
*  so i think you can help from that perspective and the other one i think is actually creating a culture [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=1621.2800000000002s)]
*  from the very practical point of view of like a process like for example sprints you know so [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=1625.92s)]
*  you have like two weeks sprints and that's sort of the cadence at which things happen and maybe [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=1629.92s)]
*  that's the cadence at which you're doing ab testing making sure that you are prioritizing [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=1633.52s)]
*  as part of that sprint and that you actually have that you're not just shipping to ship because then [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=1638.6399999999999s)]
*  you can just like spray and pray we need to like really be learning from everything that you're [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=1643.6s)]
*  shipping and iterating so that has to be part of the process whether it be retrospectives or [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=1647.28s)]
*  whether it be having accountability like our our product team at latitude has a show and tell every [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=1652.4s)]
*  two weeks and where and sort of the whole company is there expecting to see what's evolved at [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=1657.6s)]
*  duolingo we had a practice of making sure that every experiment had a proper write-up in the [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=1662.0s)]
*  beginning with like all of the hypotheses and what we actually expected and then like two weeks later [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=1666.32s)]
*  to be able to come back and then look at all of those because otherwise we'd be running around [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=1671.04s)]
*  thinking about the next test and we'd forget to go analyze think about what we learned and apply [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=1674.56s)]
*  so i think that all of those you can sort of have little levers that create the culture from a [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=1679.28s)]
*  practical standpoint so that you can set and forget and not have to as a founder keep watching [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=1683.68s)]
*  and seeing if people are are moving fast and and you know and iterating so funny you mentioned the [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=1688.56s)]
*  artificial deadlines because i was i was thinking about this recently about how you know when you [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=1694.24s)]
*  go through college you have exams you have projects that have due dates and then when you enter the [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=1698.8799999999999s)]
*  workforce especially over the last few years you have those but they feel very very gray and so i [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=1704.1599999999999s)]
*  think it's a just a funny acknowledgement about how sometimes that works in the workforce but um [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=1709.36s)]
*  you know you spoke to experimentation how do you how do you think about that in you know in 2023 [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=1714.4s)]
*  should companies especially when things are tighter should they be leaning more into [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=1720.5600000000002s)]
*  experimentation because it's like okay we got to figure this out like kieran said we don't know [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=1724.88s)]
*  where ai is going or should they be really drilling down on you know maybe the one or two channels [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=1728.16s)]
*  that they know work i always think of like your growth initiative as a portfolio of bets and your [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=1733.1200000000001s)]
*  portfolio is like very similar to like how you think about investing you want to have a spread [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=1739.3600000000001s)]
*  across things that you have a high degree of confidence in and the thing that you have a high [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=1743.12s)]
*  degree of confidence in is where you have historical context to say we've done something similar [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=1746.2399999999998s)]
*  before and it will likely work and i can measure that against like what's the potential upside [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=1750.0s)]
*  but you definitely want to take some things that are like more my speculative guests now all my [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=1754.1599999999999s)]
*  speculative guests in terms of investment from 2020 to 2022 are all down by 80 so they definitely [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=1758.2399999999998s)]
*  do lose i've lost a lot of money but in terms of your growth portfolio you want to take those big [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=1763.84s)]
*  swings and i think one of the things that happened to your point stef like that phenomenon of like [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=1769.52s)]
*  this is kind of a deadline but it's not really a deadline that definitely is like that had that [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=1774.56s)]
*  definitely like i've been in tech for a while that definitely was not always the case and became the [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=1778.8799999999999s)]
*  case when tech was ballooning and i think it's good to get back to actually like this stuff truly [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=1783.6s)]
*  matters and hidden these dates truly matter but i think the other thing that we've got away from [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=1788.4s)]
*  is like having people in the company who will take risks who have deep convection about things who [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=1792.4s)]
*  will take risks who will like say hey we think this is the right thing to do give me a couple of [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=1797.12s)]
*  people and i'll either prove this at weekends or nights or evenings or and i'll figure out if this [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=1800.9599999999998s)]
*  is like worth doing or not and i don't have any historical context to say this is a good idea but [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=1805.4399999999998s)]
*  like i've talked to customers and i think this is the thing that's going to work and so i do think [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=1809.28s)]
*  that we need to have experimentation across the entire spectrum like from like high degree of [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=1812.8799999999999s)]
*  confidence high impact to like high like really game changer thing not a lot of content uh short [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=1816.6399999999999s)]
*  context to say this works but like it's a real thing we're doing and if you are at the point [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=1822.3999999999999s)]
*  where you can have statistical significance because you have a lot of users then i think you [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=1826.16s)]
*  know you have to everything and it needs to be an experiment even the things that you already know [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=1830.4s)]
*  like the channels that are already working because if it's not an experiment then you are not looking [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=1834.16s)]
*  at it from a very scientific perspective and gaining data that will actually tell you whether [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=1838.72s)]
*  you can replicate this when when you launch it to a lot of users so i don't think that but i agree [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=1842.8000000000002s)]
*  100 with with kieran in the portfolio approach it's not either or it has to be and um but i i do [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=1847.0400000000002s)]
*  believe in being as data driven as possible of course there are exceptions and there's an art to [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=1854.48s)]
*  things but to be as data driven as driven as possible and that's where you find experimentation [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=1859.44s)]
*  to be super important and if you are an early stage startup you need to take big swings because [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=1864.16s)]
*  if you get incremental improvements and things you're just not going to get anywhere you can [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=1868.72s)]
*  like improve things two percent over and over and no one will notice you and the way that i would [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=1873.44s)]
*  approach it from a very tactical perspective is i would list all of the ideas of things that i would [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=1877.68s)]
*  like to work on whether it be like trying to true channels that i want to iterate on or big swings [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=1882.0s)]
*  um and i would just try to rank them based on roi like how hard is it going to be to do this [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=1887.6s)]
*  what do i think is the return going to be and then just try and that's how i would use like [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=1892.88s)]
*  that's the information i would use to make a decision about the portfolio of things would [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=1897.28s)]
*  be working on as a team yeah just to give one example on the big bets just to because i think [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=1900.72s)]
*  sometimes it's like we think of these things as like the kind of ab test like for hubspot when [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=1905.52s)]
*  we acquired like acquiring the hustle for us was a bet right we had deep convection about the the [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=1910.8s)]
*  future of b2b mark or like content needed to be much more engaged and need to be part of the [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=1915.84s)]
*  everyday presence of how people you know interact with content wanted to engage with content but we [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=1921.04s)]
*  had never bought a media company before we had never actually had yeah we had like never had [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=1925.6s)]
*  like media talent that we had to like figure out how to integrate to the company um and we used [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=1931.2s)]
*  that talent to like build a podcast network you built the creator program for our staff we built [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=1935.68s)]
*  all of that all of this stuff are a really incredible presence on youtube and we got [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=1939.68s)]
*  incredible talent that i think is a real moat against most b2b companies because they do not [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=1944.0800000000002s)]
*  have this talent within that company that's like an example of like a sizable bet mapped to something [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=1948.0s)]
*  that we had deep conviction about um so i think that i think those kind of things do matter [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=1954.16s)]
*  there's like a fun matrix of like important and urgent and important non-urgent like the two by [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=1959.44s)]
*  two type thing and you know some of the bets are you know both important and non-urgent and [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=1963.76s)]
*  important and urgent um but then you have these other you know ideas where you have this inkling [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=1968.56s)]
*  um especially the consumer side it's nearly impossible to predict how something would do [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=1973.6s)]
*  uh especially if it's like a fairly large bet so there's a little bit of an intuition where [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=1979.2s)]
*  you know you sort of rank a couple of options and like look like i think there's a big product bet [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=1983.52s)]
*  and that that could be one of the experiments or sort of projects that that you work on kieran you [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=1987.6s)]
*  said something earlier where uh i really loved which is uh at the end of the day where we the [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=1993.04s)]
*  founders and operators do what they do because they want to ship ship things and you know ship [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=1999.36s)]
*  things that people use and uh back to the fundamentals i keep thinking it's one line or like [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=2003.68s)]
*  the calm sea uh never made good sailors and so you know we're not in a like a calm sc and then [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=2008.8799999999999s)]
*  you know what what what are good sailors made of and they're they're probably made of like a lot of [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=2015.28s)]
*  experience but also knowing how to do the basics really well really really really well [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=2020.1599999999999s)]
*  and so going back to that fundamentals to me is really interesting because there are two different [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=2024.24s)]
*  ways to deal with this which is like how do i get out of this and what do i do and there's all these [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=2030.24s)]
*  like tactics and hacks that you might be able to do but there's a other point of like no actually [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=2034.0s)]
*  the the way we become like an important generational endearing company is to get back to the foundation [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=2039.28s)]
*  and fundamentals and build stuff that people want to use and genuinely as helpful to them [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=2046.4s)]
*  and i and i think that constitutes some of the ways as as how people can think about making big [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=2051.92s)]
*  bets totally um maybe one topic we could just address directly is ai because on one hand it you [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=2056.7200000000003s)]
*  know you're all kind of speaking to this idea of the fundamentals right focusing on what really [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=2063.92s)]
*  matters but then you have this big wave like you know to use your sailor analogy brian it's like [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=2069.36s)]
*  there's this big wave coming and it might hit your ship and you got to figure out how to how to [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=2074.48s)]
*  integrate it avoid it how are you seeing companies really kind of intelligently creatively on more so [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=2080.4s)]
*  the distribution side or thinking about how companies can grow but you know look this is very [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=2087.44s)]
*  new and i i'm very new to understanding ai so i you know i'll just put that there but i think [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=2091.68s)]
*  that from a distribution perspective there's two ways to approach ai one what are the ways in which [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=2097.92s)]
*  we can use ai to reduce the work that we're putting into things so like when we're talking [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=2104.32s)]
*  about roi like that's the investment it's just like reduce amount of time spent on things like [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=2108.0s)]
*  for example copywriting or image generation i am a purist when it comes to copywriting so like i [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=2111.76s)]
*  think that everything needs to be like a you know pullitzer prize-winning copy so i don't actually [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=2117.04s)]
*  like copywritten by chat gpt but it's actually like 75 to 80 percent of the way there and so i [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=2121.6000000000004s)]
*  think that you can probably use that you know to benefit your company in many ways either by you [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=2127.36s)]
*  know helping organize ideas or coming up with a v1 of copy and i think you may be able to do that [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=2132.88s)]
*  with image and potentially video as well so i would i would think about how to leverage ai to reduce [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=2137.44s)]
*  work to automate things and just make things cheaper from the time and and spend perspective [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=2144.4s)]
*  jeanna by the way you got to incorporate that into your prompt you gotta say youtube youtube title [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=2149.52s)]
*  written by Pulitzer Prize winning writer yes i'm sure i think you know maybe we'll get there but [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=2155.92s)]
*  here's why i don't think it will get there because i think that human emotion and the ability that [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=2162.08s)]
*  humans have to understand each other and how to make each other feel is really going to be really [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=2165.92s)]
*  hard for ai to pick up on and so we are able to come up with just that one word or just that one [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=2170.24s)]
*  punctuation that really like drives a message and that's going to be hard to replicate unless it [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=2175.04s)]
*  becomes a little bit of a recipe at which point it stops impacting people because people become a [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=2180.16s)]
*  little bit numb to that but then that drives me to the second point in which i think we can use ai [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=2184.7999999999997s)]
*  interestingly which is people are very impressed by ai right now which means they're more likely [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=2189.52s)]
*  to pay attention which means they're likely to think it's funny which means they're likely to [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=2193.28s)]
*  think it's moving or shocking and all those are all things that help your brand become remembered [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=2197.12s)]
*  and ultimately that's what marketing and brand work is and so i would leverage ai in as much [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=2203.2000000000003s)]
*  as i can to accomplish that what i think of ai for distribution i kind of split it into two [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=2207.84s)]
*  categories and jeanna covered one of them which is there's a lot of people that are just using ai [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=2212.2400000000002s)]
*  to replicate the things they do and so that really is just like a cost saving you know marketing i [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=2216.08s)]
*  think might move from like more of a channel domain expertise to more a generalist like we [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=2220.08s)]
*  have generalists and early startups i think that will actually be true of late stage companies [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=2224.88s)]
*  because these generalists will be able to stitch together like these kind of micro apps to create [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=2228.56s)]
*  customer experiences by just using data sets and using ai modeling and that will suit like [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=2233.44s)]
*  operators and technologists that's great news by the way because like so many of us are generalists [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=2237.6s)]
*  and i'm like oh great i'll have a job yeah yeah and i think i think people are like enjoy data [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=2242.64s)]
*  enjoy learning how to use apps and are able to like think like product builders to think marketers [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=2247.7599999999998s)]
*  and growth people need to think like product builders like how can i use this to sit together [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=2251.44s)]
*  some sort of build an experience for someone and i actually how do i creatively do that with these [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=2254.96s)]
*  apps and data the other the so i think there's like the replicate what we already do and you [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=2260.24s)]
*  see a lot of this with like outbound sales right like that's the number one use case you see right [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=2264.8799999999997s)]
*  now hey i can drag in all this content and use chat tv t to create very very cool like outbound [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=2268.0s)]
*  sales the stuff that i'm interested in is like maybe maybe that's 90 the 10 is like what are [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=2272.48s)]
*  things you can do with ai that is not possible today that helps in distribution i'll give you [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=2277.76s)]
*  like one quick example so like if you if you come into zappier because it's like 6 000 apps and [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=2281.04s)]
*  there's i think if you actually all the different like triggers and things like millions of different [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=2285.52s)]
*  variations of what you could actually automate so how do how would i ever know to figure out like [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=2289.84s)]
*  what i can onboard you to or like what you need to do when you actually sign up as a user [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=2294.88s)]
*  and the best way i could do that is like build an automation guide just for you right and today [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=2298.88s)]
*  the way i would do that is i would get someone to reach out talk to you about your tech stack [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=2303.92s)]
*  figure out what role you are and then contextualize workflows in a language you understand [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=2307.52s)]
*  that are like contextual to your job right hey stef you're a marketer you want to generate more [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=2312.08s)]
*  leads you want to send leads to the sales team you want to enrich them you want to make sure [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=2316.32s)]
*  they can close and the customers more like you understand that language and you understand why [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=2319.04s)]
*  that's valuable again today human would need to reach out write the automation guide for you so [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=2322.24s)]
*  not economical not scalable we like one thing i've been testing is like we've been testing like chat [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=2326.4799999999996s)]
*  tv tv know to do this like grab data from like something like clearbit or something like that [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=2331.3599999999997s)]
*  tech stack be able to feed in your role be able to feed in contextual information about your tech [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=2335.04s)]
*  stack company and then have that write an automation guide for you and then actually be able to surface [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=2339.7599999999998s)]
*  that automation guide whether through sales whether through chat whether through all these [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=2344.24s)]
*  different mediums and it's really good like surprisingly good like the first time i did it [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=2347.52s)]
*  i was like boy like this is like wow like this is something we cannot do at scale today that's the [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=2351.84s)]
*  10 that i think if you do as a fast mover you get this like little window of time before everything [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=2357.2000000000003s)]
*  gets commoditized and everyone just does the same stuff that again if you have good retention you [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=2363.44s)]
*  actually get meaningful growth there because you have that retention curve you can get those users [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=2367.36s)]
*  to stick upsell cross-sell and actually that's really really valuable so there's the 90 that i [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=2370.7200000000003s)]
*  think most people are trying to replicate the things that we already do but that 10 like is [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=2375.2000000000003s)]
*  super interesting which is what are the things we can do at scale today that we could not do [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=2379.68s)]
*  previous to actually having this technology i'm smiling because uh i heard this quote once uh [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=2383.8399999999997s)]
*  which is that the best growth hacks are never shared um so you got to be careful kieran [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=2389.6s)]
*  sharing that 10 on the podcast i need to uh i'll keep the rest of the ones to ourselves [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=2394.48s)]
*  i'm smiling because this is such a fun conversation and and gina and kieran you both hit on like sort [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=2400.7999999999997s)]
*  of the non-replicability of like human and i'm thinking about this nikon ad that just like came [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=2406.0s)]
*  out a few days ago which is like don't give up on the real world and like it has these unbelievable [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=2410.88s)]
*  image of real places and like a fake prompt that like uh that would generate such real image and [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=2416.8s)]
*  it was a very powerful message of like look like yes you know ai can do a lot of things but don't [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=2423.12s)]
*  don't give up on the real world and it was very powerful and it's creative and you know can ai [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=2429.12s)]
*  come up with that i don't know but so like it it's very interesting the on the consumer side [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=2434.8s)]
*  a couple things uh going back to your question stef uh it was like what can the companies do to [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=2440.48s)]
*  use it to your advantage one is the willingness to try as gina said as is quite high meaning uh [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=2445.6000000000004s)]
*  at least for the consumers for the first time in a while they're willing to give it a shot they're [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=2453.84s)]
*  willing to actually download and use the product and try it out and go through the app download [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=2457.92s)]
*  on all the things which they weren't before so for the first time actually you have this window [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=2462.8s)]
*  of opportunity where people are willing to give it a shot so now acquisition side uh you have this [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=2467.84s)]
*  sort of potential window where you can appeal uh as like either first mover or great product to [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=2473.36s)]
*  to get a lot of sort of usage um you know kieran shared a zappier example where you could also use [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=2479.84s)]
*  it uh very strategically to deepen your core product value like why are people using the product [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=2485.76s)]
*  that you have out there and how do you actually use this new capability uh new wave if you will to [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=2490.4s)]
*  further strengthen and deepen the reason why people use your product and sure you can brand [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=2498.4s)]
*  it ai and make it sexy and like more people will be excited what have you but you know i learned [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=2504.48s)]
*  one thing from snap where the the luxury the the sort of lens product was a state-of-the-art ar [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=2510.0s)]
*  product like augmented reality product we did not call it augmented reality for four years and we [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=2515.7599999999998s)]
*  actually implicitly banned it inside a company to call it an augmented reality because that's [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=2521.2s)]
*  technology that's not the point the point is for users to giggle and use it and have that emotion [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=2527.12s)]
*  so as you think about like these new technologies that are being enabled and kieran talked about the [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=2533.2s)]
*  90 and 10 percent net new things but there are these like ways to deepen the core product value [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=2538.16s)]
*  of why your product exists that i think you know you can call it ai you don't have to call it ai [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=2543.76s)]
*  it could be abstracted away it doesn't matter if it makes the job that you do much easier in two [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=2547.76s)]
*  ways one either take care of the rot things that you're doing in a mechanical turkey way great [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=2553.76s)]
*  or you know all of a sudden deliver value that wasn't possible before because they were cost [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=2558.8s)]
*  prohibitive or net new i think that's incredible so you know people you talked about you know is [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=2563.6000000000004s)]
*  there a way to avoid the wave i don't think so i think it's kind of a tsunami if you sit there [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=2570.0s)]
*  it's just going to wash you away so you do need to respond and how you respond i think is important [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=2573.76s)]
*  where rather than saying oh there's like a new shiny thing we're going to bolt it on i actually [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=2579.6s)]
*  think it's going back to the fundamentals to say hey like why do our product exists and why do [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=2585.12s)]
*  customers use our product every day in a day in and day out how do i use this new capability to [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=2590.64s)]
*  actually augment that and make that even easier so i get very very excited about uh you know [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=2595.92s)]
*  existing companies as well as net new companies because they both now have a new thing why right [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=2604.48s)]
*  like for existing companies there are ways to actually deepen your mount actually and then use [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=2611.12s)]
*  this product abstracted away to make it so much more useful than before new companies all of a [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=2615.6s)]
*  sudden you have this moment in time where people are willing to give it a shot and then the [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=2621.28s)]
*  consumer side what i also get really excited about is there are these net new behaviors [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=2625.52s)]
*  right i know you know we talked about how we'll never sort of fully rely on you know computers for [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=2630.8s)]
*  creativity but you know the cost of creation has nearly gone to zero now the the post-production [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=2636.8s)]
*  of this podcast the actual creation the ums and ahs and the the i move and everything you can [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=2643.7599999999998s)]
*  actually pretty easily do that through ai potentially with a lot of new products out there [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=2649.6s)]
*  and then and all of a sudden you know maybe you don't need a huge studio maybe you don't need all [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=2653.84s)]
*  these amazing fancy gadgets to to do what we do and the bar is lower the entry entry point is lower [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=2658.6400000000003s)]
*  meaning that you know all of a sudden the marginal cost of creation overall whether it's image or [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=2664.96s)]
*  video or prompt or pie what have you maybe quite low which then means the new limiting factor is [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=2670.08s)]
*  possibly creativity and that's that's a very very fun place to be speaking of creativity i wanted [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=2677.52s)]
*  to end this with a little bit of a challenge a prompt for the three of you um you know we talked [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=2684.4s)]
*  about a lot of different things um we talked about product and distribution and how those come [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=2690.4s)]
*  together and you know one product that i work on is the a16z podcast and if we think about austerity [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=2695.84s)]
*  and trying to grow in turbulent times when you know maybe budgets aren't as high if we had [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=2702.72s)]
*  ten thousand dollars to grow the a16z podcast given all the channels that you could invest in [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=2707.3599999999997s)]
*  how would you think about that and please don't just tell me build a better product because we're [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=2713.4399999999996s)]
*  working on that but on the distribution side how would you use that money well from someone who [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=2717.52s)]
*  has built to try to build two podcasts my favorite word for podcast growth is like grind it is yeah [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=2724.0s)]
*  grand you know because there's not a lot of meaningful things that work for podcast promo [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=2729.52s)]
*  so like one idea i'll give you i'll just give you a wacky idea instead that may or may not be usable [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=2734.7200000000003s)]
*  so one of the things i would do and this has kind of been done i guess before but it might be a more [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=2740.08s)]
*  novel way to do it is like get your audience like pick 10 entrepreneurs from way back in the past [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=2744.4s)]
*  that are no longer with us like all the way back to henry ford and all these incredible entrepreneurs [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=2748.96s)]
*  get your audience to vote and like what's the number one person you would like to hear interviewed [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=2753.36s)]
*  in this pod uh get them to vote whatever the top one is use a 10k to give to someone to create an [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=2756.8s)]
*  ai version of that like person you know it's pretty easy to create a deep fake version and [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=2761.6800000000003s)]
*  then you should just interview them for half an hour and like put that out into the interweb and [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=2765.6800000000003s)]
*  that's probably a good way to like get interest in the podcast through something that will [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=2770.2400000000002s)]
*  hopefully get a lot of social traction i like that gina brian what would you do i have an equally [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=2775.52s)]
*  wacky idea uh being of consumer mindset i i think one of the distributed distribution channel that [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=2780.96s)]
*  works these days is tiktok so 10k not not a lot but uh you know maybe maybe the way to do it is uh [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=2786.56s)]
*  you know fight uh find a intentionally quite controversial topic we talk about it put uh use [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=2793.6s)]
*  ai to splice it up so that it's like entertaining and like very easy like to the point and then [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=2799.44s)]
*  essentially the call out is fight us stitch incoming fight us and like a hot take fight us [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=2804.32s)]
*  and they'll actually use that remix culture of the internet to let that sort of do what it does and [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=2811.12s)]
*  you know the reason why the dollar would be interesting is sometimes it's interesting to [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=2817.8399999999997s)]
*  seed these things so have like one or two you know influence or whatever you're like over [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=2821.6s)]
*  founders who like we can you know invite over and like here's a piece of content now go debate that [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=2826.64s)]
*  and actually be pretty brutal because like people love a good fight and put it out there and see [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=2832.48s)]
*  how that does i actually kind of love this idea even just the tag fight us is so strong it's cool [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=2838.48s)]
*  yes i thought about it and i have a very boring idea but this is what i would do i think that [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=2845.52s)]
*  your bet here would be to try to increase your audience by looking at places where your audience [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=2851.2000000000003s)]
*  isn't but you have a huge potential audience and for me that would be [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=2856.48s)]
*  people in older demographics that are very business savvy and have been very active their [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=2862.32s)]
*  whole lives and kind of get technology but are a little bit out of the loop and don't know what a [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=2866.64s)]
*  16z is and i've never heard of anything related to it and i have had conversations with brilliant [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=2870.64s)]
*  people in finance who are maybe like in their 60s let's say maybe even 50s who have no idea what a [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=2876.24s)]
*  16z is and which in my world is crazy and those people read the wall street journal and those [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=2881.6s)]
*  people read the new york times so i would go and do you know something with one of those massive [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=2886.48s)]
*  publications to reach those audiences the thing about growth is that it's not just about growing [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=2893.04s)]
*  but you have to grow in terms of like the right people so one way to game your question which is [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=2897.36s)]
*  something that girl seems to do all the time is i'm just going to go to a country where buying a [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=2902.0s)]
*  user or buying a listener is super cheap and i'm going to go and like you know do some sort of [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=2906.32s)]
*  massive campaign because ten thousand dollars goes so far in like southeast asia or like [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=2911.52s)]
*  latin american countries and then just get a bunch of people to listen to a 16z but it won't actually [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=2916.08s)]
*  matter because they're not your core audience but that's just you know that would be a gameable [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=2920.64s)]
*  response which i just want to leave here because i think it's really core to growth in order for [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=2924.7999999999997s)]
*  you to actually come up with a good growth strategy you have to think about how can you game this [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=2930.16s)]
*  problem and if you can easily game it then you're looking at the wrong thing totally thank you all [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=2934.48s)]
*  this was so fun thanks for listening to the a 16z podcast if you like this episode don't [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-WcoEe6OkA&t=2940.3199999999997s)]
