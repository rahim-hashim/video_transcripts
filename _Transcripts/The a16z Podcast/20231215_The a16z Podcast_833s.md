*  our investments, please see a16z.com slash disclosures. Hi, I'm Anish Chacharya. I'm a [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNGGwwrlu1Y&t=91.6s)]
*  GP on our consumer investing team, looking at all things AI apps. My big idea for this year is that [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNGGwwrlu1Y&t=101.44s)]
*  voice will actually be a new sort of emerging way to interact with technology and at the heart of a [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNGGwwrlu1Y&t=108.96000000000001s)]
*  new set of productivity apps. So the theory here is that voice is the way that humans have communicated [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNGGwwrlu1Y&t=115.52000000000001s)]
*  with each other since really the day that communication was born. But voice has never [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNGGwwrlu1Y&t=121.12s)]
*  really worked as an interface for technology. And I think one of the reasons for that is that [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNGGwwrlu1Y&t=125.84s)]
*  when you interact with a product using voice, you sort of have the unconscious expectations that you [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNGGwwrlu1Y&t=130.4s)]
*  would have of a human. So you expect it to actually be pretty flexible, cognitively sophisticated, and [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNGGwwrlu1Y&t=136.8s)]
*  really be able to interact with you. And most of the systems that exist today, or at least have [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNGGwwrlu1Y&t=142.8s)]
*  historically existed, are very inflexible. There's just these sort of logic trees, and if you don't [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNGGwwrlu1Y&t=147.12s)]
*  navigate them perfectly, then they just don't work. And we've all experienced that with Alexa [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNGGwwrlu1Y&t=152.72s)]
*  and some of the past generation voice assistants. So I think the go-forward idea is that AI and large [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNGGwwrlu1Y&t=156.96s)]
*  models really unlock humans' ability to interact with technology. I think the other thing that's [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNGGwwrlu1Y&t=162.4s)]
*  very interesting for productivity apps is that you could imagine some of the incumbent productivity [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNGGwwrlu1Y&t=167.76000000000002s)]
*  providers, Gmail for email, for example, they're going to build a lot of the obvious features, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNGGwwrlu1Y&t=173.04000000000002s)]
*  AI features, for those apps and experiences, but it's less obvious that they would prioritize [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNGGwwrlu1Y&t=178.56s)]
*  something that's voice first because it requires you rethinking the entire experience from the [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNGGwwrlu1Y&t=183.04000000000002s)]
*  ground up. So I really think it's an interesting area because it has previously never worked, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNGGwwrlu1Y&t=187.44s)]
*  and now this technology allows it to work, and it's not something the incumbents are obviously [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNGGwwrlu1Y&t=192.16s)]
*  going to build. So that's what I expect to see, hope to see, and invest in in 2024. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNGGwwrlu1Y&t=196.32s)]
*  All right. So Anish, I feel like that sounds really exciting, but voice has been pending for quite [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNGGwwrlu1Y&t=201.76s)]
*  some time. You addressed this a little bit, but I actually went back. I looked up the Gartner hype [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNGGwwrlu1Y&t=206.96s)]
*  cycle over the last decade. Speech recognition popped up in 2010, and that was actually in the [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNGGwwrlu1Y&t=211.51999999999998s)]
*  plateau of productivity. And yet, despite a lot of investment from a lot of big companies, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNGGwwrlu1Y&t=216.48s)]
*  we're talking Amazon, Google, Apple, feels like we're still waiting. And you addressed that maybe [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNGGwwrlu1Y&t=221.52s)]
*  there's some new technology on the horizon, but what would you say has been the limiting factor [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNGGwwrlu1Y&t=226.64000000000001s)]
*  thus far? I mean, it's simply that the old technology architecture doesn't allow you to [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNGGwwrlu1Y&t=231.04000000000002s)]
*  get to the level of fidelity that you need. So if you look at it, kind of the last 10% is where 99% [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNGGwwrlu1Y&t=236.08s)]
*  of the effort goes. And this is true of a lot of AI problems that were built on the old architecture. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNGGwwrlu1Y&t=241.44s)]
*  So self-driving is a great example of this. Sort of true interactive voice is a great example of [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNGGwwrlu1Y&t=246.88s)]
*  this. You can get to 90%. You just can't get to 99%. And this new technology really lets you get [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNGGwwrlu1Y&t=252.4s)]
*  to 99%. And you can see that if you've interacted with chat, GBT via voice, it's very compelling. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNGGwwrlu1Y&t=257.12s)]
*  If you used 11 labs, I mean, their work is very compelling. So it's clear that this now works. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNGGwwrlu1Y&t=262.4s)]
*  And really what we needed was a technology shift, not a sort of set of like financial resources that [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNGGwwrlu1Y&t=267.2s)]
*  incumbents have historically provided to make this work. Yeah. And you mentioned that existing [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNGGwwrlu1Y&t=272.48s)]
*  apps aren't necessarily equipped to build these experiences. Maybe you could just elaborate on [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNGGwwrlu1Y&t=277.44s)]
*  that and maybe also think through like, what would a voice first app even look like? [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNGGwwrlu1Y&t=282.48s)]
*  Yeah, that's a great question. So first, existing apps are built with a set of existing workflows. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNGGwwrlu1Y&t=288.88s)]
*  And anytime you modify the workflow, you have to think about how that affects all of the existing [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNGGwwrlu1Y&t=294.56s)]
*  users. This is why I'm sure there's a lot of creative people at Gmail, but it's very hard for [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNGGwwrlu1Y&t=299.68s)]
*  them to go to a dramatically different paradigm like a superhuman. And of course, we will try this [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNGGwwrlu1Y&t=304.40000000000003s)]
*  with inbox and ended up shutting it down. But there's a set of consumer expectations and a [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNGGwwrlu1Y&t=309.2s)]
*  huge audience that just expects a product to work a certain way. And to do something like a voice [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNGGwwrlu1Y&t=313.92s)]
*  first inbox, for example, you're just going to need a completely different set of workflows. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNGGwwrlu1Y&t=318.8s)]
*  So if Google does decide to do that, they're going to have to start from scratch along with everyone [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNGGwwrlu1Y&t=323.04s)]
*  else. So it's not obvious to me that an incumbent will build this. In terms of what the experience [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNGGwwrlu1Y&t=327.12s)]
*  would look like, you know, a great example is a lot of executives that I know when they're driving [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNGGwwrlu1Y&t=333.92s)]
*  into work in the morning, they'll phone their executive assistant, and they'll say, Hey, let's [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNGGwwrlu1Y&t=338.08s)]
*  go through my inbox together. Let's talk about what seems like it's a priority, what seems like [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNGGwwrlu1Y&t=342.48s)]
*  it's important, but not urgent, what's clearly spam, what are internal versus external asks, [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNGGwwrlu1Y&t=346.56s)]
*  and they will together sort of prioritize so that when that executive arrives, they're sort of ready [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNGGwwrlu1Y&t=352.24s)]
*  to go with everything they need to do. So an experience like that, I think would make enormous [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNGGwwrlu1Y&t=356.96s)]
*  sense, except now it's available to everyone, not just executives who have a dedicated assistant. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNGGwwrlu1Y&t=360.96s)]
*  Yeah, definitely. And you mentioned two specific areas that you're looking to in 2024, including [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNGGwwrlu1Y&t=366.23999999999995s)]
*  companionship and productivity. Here's to know what you're already seeing built there. Like, [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNGGwwrlu1Y&t=372.15999999999997s)]
*  are you already seeing builders create apps that are live and working in our voice first? Tell us [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNGGwwrlu1Y&t=376.96s)]
*  a little bit more about what you're seeing there. Yeah, there's a lot of cool exploration that's [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNGGwwrlu1Y&t=381.84s)]
*  happening in the voice space. So one of the ones that I'm the biggest fan of is a product called [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNGGwwrlu1Y&t=387.11999999999995s)]
*  tab. So tab has gotten a bunch of heat online and it's a, it's a very interesting founder and a very [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNGGwwrlu1Y&t=391.84s)]
*  interesting product idea where it's a pendant that you wear that sort of passively captures your [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNGGwwrlu1Y&t=397.12s)]
*  conversations throughout the day. And then it allows you to interact with all of that context, [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNGGwwrlu1Y&t=402.15999999999997s)]
*  ask questions, ask it to summarize. So it's a great example of someone who's really thinking [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNGGwwrlu1Y&t=406.88s)]
*  about this from a first principles perspective, a voice first perspective. I think the second [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNGGwwrlu1Y&t=411.44s)]
*  most interesting product outside of something like 11 is actually just chat GPT's voice module [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNGGwwrlu1Y&t=415.92s)]
*  and their voice sort of interface. So I guess I encourage everyone to go take a walk and just [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNGGwwrlu1Y&t=423.2s)]
*  have a chat with chat GPT. And you'll be amazed at how quickly you sort of forget that you're talking [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNGGwwrlu1Y&t=427.84s)]
*  to an AI and you fall into the flow of the conversation. So I'd say between tab, chat GPT, [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNGGwwrlu1Y&t=433.12s)]
*  and certainly what the team at 11 is doing, there's a lot of cool stuff to check out. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNGGwwrlu1Y&t=439.12s)]
*  Yeah. And as this tech gets better, I think what I'd love to hear your perspective on is really [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNGGwwrlu1Y&t=443.2s)]
*  like the unlikely or maybe unexpected is the better word type of experiences that right now [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNGGwwrlu1Y&t=448.8s)]
*  don't seem obvious, but I mean, I think it's easy for people to imagine, oh yeah, I can send an email. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNGGwwrlu1Y&t=456.72s)]
*  Oh yeah, I can start a song with my Alexa. But if we're really talking something foundational, [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNGGwwrlu1Y&t=461.6s)]
*  where voice becomes the primary potential modality for interacting with some of these [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNGGwwrlu1Y&t=467.12s)]
*  applications, can you just like think through like, what are the different contexts or like, [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNGGwwrlu1Y&t=473.04s)]
*  what might we imagine to be on the horizon? That's a little more significant than what we imagine with [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNGGwwrlu1Y&t=477.2s)]
*  voice today. I mean, it's it's trite to cite this, but I will anyway, which is simply the movie her [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNGGwwrlu1Y&t=483.36s)]
*  like that's it, you know, which is a passive sort of experience that has all the context that you [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNGGwwrlu1Y&t=489.36s)]
*  have where voice is the primary modality of interaction, and then you can fall back to a [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNGGwwrlu1Y&t=494.56s)]
*  screen if and when needed. So I like if we look back in 10 years, and that's the way that we [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNGGwwrlu1Y&t=498.8s)]
*  interact with technology, it won't feel like such a leap. Yeah. Well, I mean, I think the important [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNGGwwrlu1Y&t=504.08s)]
*  question then is that currently is not the primary modality. And so you have all of these companies [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNGGwwrlu1Y&t=510.32s)]
*  who really rely on a website or an app or a graphical user interface, which may become moot. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNGGwwrlu1Y&t=516.88s)]
*  If we really are moving in that direction. I mean, curious to know your perspective there on how [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNGGwwrlu1Y&t=524.32s)]
*  builders should be thinking about that potential paradigm if it really is voice first, like how do [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNGGwwrlu1Y&t=528.56s)]
*  existing companies integrate this thoughtfully? I don't know if it is moot. I think that there's [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNGGwwrlu1Y&t=533.84s)]
*  room for both. Like there's a lot more technology penetration to be had. So if you're a developer, [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNGGwwrlu1Y&t=539.52s)]
*  and you work in an IDE, you're probably faster hands on keyboard with screen than you're going [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNGGwwrlu1Y&t=544.64s)]
*  to be with voice, at least for now. And maybe the answer is some combination of the two. So I [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNGGwwrlu1Y&t=550.08s)]
*  actually, I think that there is a lot of room for existing products and existing modalities for [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNGGwwrlu1Y&t=556.08s)]
*  interaction. On the other hand, if you're maybe a senior citizen, you simply, I mean, maybe you're [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNGGwwrlu1Y&t=560.8000000000001s)]
*  interacting with technology, but you're really struggling with it. And this unlocks every product [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNGGwwrlu1Y&t=566.4000000000001s)]
*  for you potentially. So I think it's a market expansion positive some story, not a zero some [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNGGwwrlu1Y&t=570.4000000000001s)]
*  story. But I tend to always think that. So yeah, no, I agree. I think it's positive some, but how [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNGGwwrlu1Y&t=576.16s)]
*  would you, for example, if you're an application that does not have a voice first interaction mode, [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNGGwwrlu1Y&t=581.52s)]
*  should all builders be thinking about that incorporation or how would you think about that? [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNGGwwrlu1Y&t=586.88s)]
*  If you're an existing builder without this on your roadmap? I think the customer and the sort of [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNGGwwrlu1Y&t=591.8399999999999s)]
*  interaction pattern is so different that if I had an existing product, I would probably focus on [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNGGwwrlu1Y&t=599.28s)]
*  playing from my place of advantage, which is non-voice workflows, rather than trying to rethink [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNGGwwrlu1Y&t=605.36s)]
*  my product from the ground up around this. And look, there may be, the answer may be in the middle [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNGGwwrlu1Y&t=611.36s)]
*  where there actually are some workflows that are voice enabled that extend the existing workflow. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNGGwwrlu1Y&t=616.24s)]
*  But again, I think this is a sort of like a market expansion net new customer story rather than [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNGGwwrlu1Y&t=623.04s)]
*  someone taking existing. Yeah. And if founders are thinking about creating in this new environment, [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNGGwwrlu1Y&t=628.24s)]
*  are there any challenges you'd call out from your experience with some of these tools like 11 Labs [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNGGwwrlu1Y&t=634.5600000000001s)]
*  in terms of just maybe where we are in this arc and what can and can't be done? Look, I think you [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNGGwwrlu1Y&t=639.2s)]
*  have to retrain people. They need to know how to interact with these systems. And by default, [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNGGwwrlu1Y&t=645.12s)]
*  their expectations are going to be very high. It's going to be like, look, I should be able to [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNGGwwrlu1Y&t=650.88s)]
*  interact with this in the exact, with the same level of fidelity and responsiveness and sort of [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNGGwwrlu1Y&t=654.72s)]
*  flexibility that I can with a human. So if that's not what you're able to offer or what you intend [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNGGwwrlu1Y&t=660.24s)]
*  to offer, then it will require sort of training your customer to interact with you in the right [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNGGwwrlu1Y&t=666.08s)]
*  way. So I do think that there's an onboarding question. And then look, I think there's also a [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNGGwwrlu1Y&t=670.16s)]
*  just sort of a social patterns question where, you know, is it going to be socially acceptable to be [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNGGwwrlu1Y&t=673.84s)]
*  sort of talking into thin air? Now, arguably people are already doing that with their sort of [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNGGwwrlu1Y&t=680.8s)]
*  Bluetooth and AirPods. And so, you know, maybe we'll all change quickly together as a society, [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNGGwwrlu1Y&t=685.2s)]
*  but I think there'll be some period of time for which, you know, the early adopters are going to [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNGGwwrlu1Y&t=690.08s)]
*  feel a little crazy or that they look that way. You know, it's so funny you mentioned that my [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNGGwwrlu1Y&t=694.96s)]
*  husband's grandmother said the first time she ever heard someone talking on a cell phone, she thought [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNGGwwrlu1Y&t=699.2800000000001s)]
*  they were crazy because they were doing it in the supermarket. And she was like, why are they talking [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNGGwwrlu1Y&t=703.76s)]
*  to themselves? So maybe, you know, there's an element of that. Now, again, to run things out, [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNGGwwrlu1Y&t=707.76s)]
*  seems like there's a lot of opportunity on the table. We're talking about potential change in [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNGGwwrlu1Y&t=714.72s)]
*  interaction modality. If you're an entrepreneur, how would you even think about starting? What [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNGGwwrlu1Y&t=720.16s)]
*  would you look at? Yeah, tell me a little bit more about where you would begin. I mean, it's, [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNGGwwrlu1Y&t=724.96s)]
*  obviously, it's tautological that you can only begin at the beginning. Like, I think it's [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNGGwwrlu1Y&t=732.48s)]
*  impossible to infer what the end product is going to look like. And you've just got to start building. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNGGwwrlu1Y&t=735.84s)]
*  So, you know, I think I would try to build something useful and interesting and just [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNGGwwrlu1Y&t=742.08s)]
*  iterate from there. That's it. Look, I think the other thing that's interesting here is that some [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNGGwwrlu1Y&t=747.84s)]
*  of these technologies, if you're too pointed at the beginning in terms of product design, [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNGGwwrlu1Y&t=753.5200000000001s)]
*  then it can constrain you. I think that if you introduce the capability in an intelligent way, [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNGGwwrlu1Y&t=758.08s)]
*  your customers will pull you in a direction. I think some of the best product builders I've seen [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNGGwwrlu1Y&t=762.88s)]
*  have been willing to, you know, try to offer the capability in a way that is relatively neutral [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNGGwwrlu1Y&t=767.12s)]
*  and allow the customer set to pull them. Yeah. And per your advice earlier, for people to play [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNGGwwrlu1Y&t=772.96s)]
*  around with this tech themselves and to use voice more. 100% always just use their products, [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNGGwwrlu1Y&t=778.96s)]
*  just use the products. All right. I hope you enjoyed this big idea. We do have a lot more [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNGGwwrlu1Y&t=784.16s)]
*  in the way, including programmable medicine that's taking a page out of the Reusable Rocket playbook, [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNGGwwrlu1Y&t=788.72s)]
*  anime going mainstream and whether the consumer AI battleground may be moving from model to UX. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNGGwwrlu1Y&t=794.08s)]
