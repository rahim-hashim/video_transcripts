*  our investments, please see a16z.com slash disclosures. Hey everyone, my name is Grant Gregory. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LTWVO5cUJ4&t=91.6s)]
*  I'm an investment partner on the American Dynamism team. And this is my big idea for 2024, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LTWVO5cUJ4&t=101.84s)]
*  a new age of maritime exploration. Generations ago, our ancestors took to the seas to explore. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LTWVO5cUJ4&t=107.68s)]
*  And yet today, we know more about the surface of Mars than we do about our own planet, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LTWVO5cUJ4&t=114.56s)]
*  Seabed. A new age of maritime exploration is changing that and founders are leading the way. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LTWVO5cUJ4&t=118.72000000000001s)]
*  Maritime faces similar reliability and engineering challenges as air and space. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LTWVO5cUJ4&t=125.44000000000001s)]
*  And many of the technologies pioneered by the latest space age can be ready applied here too. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LTWVO5cUJ4&t=130.24s)]
*  Meanwhile, the size and importance of the commercial and defense markets provide [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LTWVO5cUJ4&t=135.76000000000002s)]
*  substantial reward. We're seeing companies like Flexport, Seronic, and Saildrone, and many others [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LTWVO5cUJ4&t=139.44s)]
*  have already started modernizing maritime. And we anticipate the continued geopolitical supply chain [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LTWVO5cUJ4&t=146.4s)]
*  and climate disruptions will further accelerate the demand for change here. Advances in AI, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LTWVO5cUJ4&t=151.76000000000002s)]
*  hardware, and computer vision present opportunities to transform our cities, ports, and trade networks [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LTWVO5cUJ4&t=156.8s)]
*  with autonomous modernized ferries, container ships, and fishing fleets. Robots will help [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LTWVO5cUJ4&t=161.84s)]
*  sustainably mine precious materials from the seafloor, map and survey waterways, and monitor [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LTWVO5cUJ4&t=167.76s)]
*  health of our ecosystems. New generations of naval and coast guard vessels, ships, and submarines [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LTWVO5cUJ4&t=173.28s)]
*  will set out to protect our supply chains and our shores. Technology is once again returning to [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LTWVO5cUJ4&t=179.52s)]
*  maritime. All right, Grant, you say that we know more about the surface of Mars than we do about [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LTWVO5cUJ4&t=185.2s)]
*  our own planet's seabed. This is kind of mind blowing if you really think about it because [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LTWVO5cUJ4&t=191.44s)]
*  we're so close to the sea and it's so integrated into our industries like defense and the supply [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LTWVO5cUJ4&t=195.92s)]
*  chain. So why is this? Why do we know more about Mars than our own seabed? Yeah, you know, it's a [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LTWVO5cUJ4&t=201.35999999999999s)]
*  great question. I think on the surface, it seems kind of silly. But, you know, when you think about [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LTWVO5cUJ4&t=209.92s)]
*  the raw surface area here, it's quite massive. The ocean covers 70 plus percent of the Earth. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LTWVO5cUJ4&t=216.4s)]
*  Trade is somewhere north of 55 percent of global GDP and over 80 percent of that by volume is [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LTWVO5cUJ4&t=222.48000000000002s)]
*  getting transported on the sea. And so you're dealing with something that has, frankly, just [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LTWVO5cUJ4&t=228.32s)]
*  substantial scale that we frankly don't have a lot of great line of sight into. If you think about [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LTWVO5cUJ4&t=232.32s)]
*  it, when we can look up into the stars, there's plenty of light. If you're looking down into the [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LTWVO5cUJ4&t=237.84s)]
*  water, you can only go so far before it fades into black. And so as a result, historically, [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LTWVO5cUJ4&t=241.76s)]
*  we've just had very little literal visibility into the ocean. And most of what we actually know about [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LTWVO5cUJ4&t=248.23999999999998s)]
*  the ocean seafloor today has been gathered from gravity data from satellites. And so it's a useful [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LTWVO5cUJ4&t=254.0s)]
*  starting point, but the resulting resolution we have is only about two square miles, I think. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LTWVO5cUJ4&t=260.71999999999997s)]
*  And when you compare that to something like our maps of Mars or Venus, those are by comparison 50x [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LTWVO5cUJ4&t=266.64s)]
*  more detailed. And so it's pretty astounding, especially when you consider how important the [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LTWVO5cUJ4&t=274.0s)]
*  ocean is for life. Ryan Peterson, a Flexport, has a great line that the oceans are the circulatory [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LTWVO5cUJ4&t=279.6s)]
*  system for the world. But fortunately, I think there's a lot of trends that are pointing in the [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LTWVO5cUJ4&t=285.12s)]
*  direction of us actually understanding our oceans much more visibly. Totally. And I think you make [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LTWVO5cUJ4&t=290.08s)]
*  a great point that it's literal darkness when you get not that deep and our oceans are pretty vast. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LTWVO5cUJ4&t=294.24s)]
*  But maybe you could share a little bit more about the reality of the maritime economy. So when we're [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LTWVO5cUJ4&t=300.56s)]
*  talking about the ships or the logistics that we all rely on, what does that look like in 2023? [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LTWVO5cUJ4&t=305.76s)]
*  And maybe you can also touch on why it feels like that's been largely untouched by some of the 21st [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LTWVO5cUJ4&t=311.76s)]
*  century technology that we're seeing in other industries. I think the one important thing to [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LTWVO5cUJ4&t=316.8s)]
*  call out is that maritime is a category that historically has been marked by pretty profound [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LTWVO5cUJ4&t=321.68s)]
*  innovation and changes. Just from a historical perspective, I mean, you started with something [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LTWVO5cUJ4&t=327.28000000000003s)]
*  like the sailboat, which today is quite de minimis, but at the time was very substantial. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LTWVO5cUJ4&t=332.64s)]
*  You created something like the sextant, the submarine, sonar even, and then something like [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LTWVO5cUJ4&t=338.96000000000004s)]
*  the shipping container that reduced global costs of transportation for goods by something like 99%. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LTWVO5cUJ4&t=344.32s)]
*  And so maritime in many ways has been the genesis of a lot of pieces of technology that have [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LTWVO5cUJ4&t=350.96s)]
*  fundamentally changed the world and give us today. But interestingly, a lot of the current state of [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LTWVO5cUJ4&t=356.32s)]
*  the art is very analog. And we're talking about an industry that still operates largely with pen, [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LTWVO5cUJ4&t=362.96s)]
*  paper, and maybe emails and phone calls. And I think part of that is just there's an inherent [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LTWVO5cUJ4&t=368.72s)]
*  amount of friction in trying to make logistics work and work on time. And as we've globalized, [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LTWVO5cUJ4&t=375.52s)]
*  the margin for error has increased substantially, and we're starting to see some additional other [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LTWVO5cUJ4&t=383.44s)]
*  pressures in the past few years in a number of ways. Yeah, so maybe we can talk to that. Why in [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LTWVO5cUJ4&t=389.35999999999996s)]
*  2024 does it seem like there's a true tipping point here to change that equation? The past three [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LTWVO5cUJ4&t=396.15999999999997s)]
*  years I think are a good place to start, which is whether it's COVID, supply changes, disruptions, [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LTWVO5cUJ4&t=403.28s)]
*  or geopolitical conflict and strife. All of these things are intimately connected to our oceans and [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LTWVO5cUJ4&t=409.35999999999996s)]
*  global trade. And so as a result, we've seen some pretty significant dislocations in the past number [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LTWVO5cUJ4&t=415.2s)]
*  of years. During COVID, we had the Ever Given ship blocking the Suez Canal. We had the LA Port [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LTWVO5cUJ4&t=421.35999999999996s)]
*  congestion famously. We've seen a rise in piracy. And then more recently, we had the Titan submarine [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LTWVO5cUJ4&t=427.68s)]
*  implosion. And I think they all point to the fact that our supply chains are intimately connected, [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LTWVO5cUJ4&t=435.12s)]
*  Maritimes at the heart of that, and the way of conducting things analog is not going to work [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LTWVO5cUJ4&t=443.36s)]
*  anymore. And so I think there's that backdrop, which is important to understand. And then there's [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LTWVO5cUJ4&t=449.52000000000004s)]
*  also some other larger, I think, deep currents here. One is the International Marine Organization [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LTWVO5cUJ4&t=455.36s)]
*  has been establishing new rules and guidance for both emissions, energy usage, and then also just [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LTWVO5cUJ4&t=462.24s)]
*  broader visibility and data maintenance. And so now ship owners have a real desire and need [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LTWVO5cUJ4&t=469.04s)]
*  to figure out how to make their fleet more observable, reliant, and performant. And then [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LTWVO5cUJ4&t=476.64s)]
*  also you're seeing just a real rise on the DoD side with renewed interest in the South Pacific [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LTWVO5cUJ4&t=482.15999999999997s)]
*  region. And again, that's tied to observability, deterrence, resilience, and a lot of these factors. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LTWVO5cUJ4&t=488.4s)]
*  And then I'd say on the final part too, encouragingly, we're seeing a wave of startups [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LTWVO5cUJ4&t=495.91999999999996s)]
*  that are entering more of a maturity stage. Flexport's a great example, and there's plenty [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LTWVO5cUJ4&t=503.28s)]
*  of others that have proven out this is a real market and there's real opportunity here to [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LTWVO5cUJ4&t=507.52s)]
*  digitize it. And it's difficult, but it's possible. And equally, we're seeing people from a lot of the [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LTWVO5cUJ4&t=512.48s)]
*  other American dynamism companies like SpaceX, Tesla, and Andrel, they're taking their learnings [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LTWVO5cUJ4&t=519.1999999999999s)]
*  and experiences and bringing them over to the ocean. Right. And some of those companies like [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LTWVO5cUJ4&t=524.96s)]
*  SpaceX are specifically in aerospace. So what are the innovations, whether it's in aerospace or [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LTWVO5cUJ4&t=529.36s)]
*  otherwise, that we can actually borrow now that we're in 2023 heading into 2024? What can be [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LTWVO5cUJ4&t=535.6s)]
*  copy and pasted or evolved as we look to maritime? There's a lot. I'd say there's a great way to [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LTWVO5cUJ4&t=542.88s)]
*  delineate it would be there's the processes and understanding how to build quickly and scalably, [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LTWVO5cUJ4&t=550.8000000000001s)]
*  and then there's the actual technology. And if you're to take an overly simplistic lens to all of [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LTWVO5cUJ4&t=556.88s)]
*  this, space and the ocean are both very unforgiving environments. If you have a hole in your rocket, [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LTWVO5cUJ4&t=562.0s)]
*  it's going to explode. And if you have a hole in your boat, it's going to sink. And so the status [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LTWVO5cUJ4&t=568.56s)]
*  quo here is that there's unrelenting physical forces that are acting adversely against anything [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LTWVO5cUJ4&t=573.12s)]
*  that you're creating and then putting into that environment. And so that creates a dynamic where [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LTWVO5cUJ4&t=579.28s)]
*  everything that you're building from an engineering perspective has to be both resilient, [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LTWVO5cUJ4&t=584.0s)]
*  hardened, and also needs to be incredibly performant in a whole range of scenarios. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LTWVO5cUJ4&t=590.4000000000001s)]
*  And then the water also is just like a very difficult environment. If you think about it, [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LTWVO5cUJ4&t=596.1600000000001s)]
*  electronics and water don't mix well at all. There's limited sensing capabilities. A lot of [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LTWVO5cUJ4&t=600.4000000000001s)]
*  the sensors that we use in other categories like radar and LIDAR GPS, they don't really work on the [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LTWVO5cUJ4&t=606.6400000000001s)]
*  water and they definitely don't work underwater. And then also you're just dealing with an [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LTWVO5cUJ4&t=612.4000000000001s)]
*  environment where everything's moving. You have wind, you have waves, you have currents, tides, [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LTWVO5cUJ4&t=616.64s)]
*  boats, and then wildlife. And so all of this needs to be hardened. And I think actually a good example [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LTWVO5cUJ4&t=621.36s)]
*  of some of the advances you can see on whether it's machine vision, robotics, autonomy, [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LTWVO5cUJ4&t=629.36s)]
*  other capabilities like ARC boats has done a great job of encapsulating what the future of [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LTWVO5cUJ4&t=635.6s)]
*  maritime looks like in that from a process and team perspective Mitch and Ryan delivered the Tesla [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LTWVO5cUJ4&t=641.28s)]
*  and SpaceX vision and mission to maritime. They're not just creating consumer boats that are [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LTWVO5cUJ4&t=649.28s)]
*  electrified. They're actually building better boats that are more user-friendly, they're more [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LTWVO5cUJ4&t=657.04s)]
*  functional, and they're way more appealing to the average consumer. But while they're doing that, [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LTWVO5cUJ4&t=661.04s)]
*  they're also creating a manufacturing process that understands that the factory is the product [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LTWVO5cUJ4&t=666.96s)]
*  and they're doing that in a way that scales beyond just their first ARC-1 boat but allows [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LTWVO5cUJ4&t=673.52s)]
*  them to eventually expand beyond to other product lines. And I think all that together is quite [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LTWVO5cUJ4&t=679.2s)]
*  important. We're seeing plenty of additional interesting developments on underwater imaging, [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LTWVO5cUJ4&t=684.48s)]
*  etc. And I guess the final encapsulation point is just space ultimately had to be done a lot of [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LTWVO5cUJ4&t=691.68s)]
*  things in-house and vertically integrated. And we're seeing a similar approach with maritime. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LTWVO5cUJ4&t=698.16s)]
*  Nicole Soule-Northam Right. I mean, ARC is such a good example. We talked to Mitch semi-recently, [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LTWVO5cUJ4&t=702.88s)]
*  and I think I use the term copy and paste, but you brought up a really good point, which is that [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LTWVO5cUJ4&t=708.64s)]
*  the aerospace industry got the ball rolling, but we now need entrepreneurs to basically take that [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LTWVO5cUJ4&t=714.4s)]
*  technology and specialize it for these different industries. He made a great point that a car will [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LTWVO5cUJ4&t=719.52s)]
*  continue rolling down the street for a pretty long while, even if the engine isn't running. A boat [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LTWVO5cUJ4&t=724.64s)]
*  will stop immediately, right? So each of these industries is unique. And so maybe you can speak [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LTWVO5cUJ4&t=730.4s)]
*  to some of the different applications so folks can get a sense of what may be on the horizon. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LTWVO5cUJ4&t=735.04s)]
*  If we do incorporate these new innovations, what are the kind of geopolitical supply chain or [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LTWVO5cUJ4&t=740.4s)]
*  climate applications that you are seeing built or that you see on the way? And maybe also how far [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LTWVO5cUJ4&t=745.28s)]
*  are we in that trajectory? Like, are these coming in a year, five years, 10 years? What can we expect? [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LTWVO5cUJ4&t=750.8s)]
*  Matt Svigel There's a lot of change happening and there's a dearth of problems to be solved. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LTWVO5cUJ4&t=757.12s)]
*  I think the good news is that we're seeing a ton of blue space here in terms of what can be done. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LTWVO5cUJ4&t=762.3199999999999s)]
*  And in some ways, we're quite early in this chapter, but in other ways, I mean, many of these [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LTWVO5cUJ4&t=768.48s)]
*  companies are progressing quite rapidly and have been adding for a while. And so you're seeing [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LTWVO5cUJ4&t=773.76s)]
*  some pretty profound changes. Maybe on the observability front, something that's been [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LTWVO5cUJ4&t=778.8s)]
*  really interesting is you have a problem that expands from deep water navigation and autonomy [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LTWVO5cUJ4&t=784.24s)]
*  that starts with route optimization, emissions management, but it also ends up in your ports. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LTWVO5cUJ4&t=790.4s)]
*  And so one thing that was pretty mind blowing is that we're dealing with the majority of our trade [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LTWVO5cUJ4&t=796.64s)]
*  in the U.S. is tied to the inland navigable waterways. And you have a mix of ocean water [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LTWVO5cUJ4&t=802.08s)]
*  and then sediment that's constantly changing the seafloor. And the current way that we navigate all [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LTWVO5cUJ4&t=809.2800000000001s)]
*  of this is we manually, every 100 feet, try and measure this where the bottom of the seafloor is. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LTWVO5cUJ4&t=815.12s)]
*  And as a result, it's changing and it's very inaccurate. And this is something that Sonor [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LTWVO5cUJ4&t=823.12s)]
*  and other pieces of technology historically have been great at solving. And now we're seeing [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LTWVO5cUJ4&t=829.28s)]
*  companies with machine vision and other technologies that are fastening this to the bottom of boats [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LTWVO5cUJ4&t=833.68s)]
*  and are doing this in a synchronized manner. And so that you're able to have a live map [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LTWVO5cUJ4&t=841.04s)]
*  of where the seafloor is, how many ships can go down a specific port path, etc. So that's one. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LTWVO5cUJ4&t=846.16s)]
*  I think the other way to think about this is you're taking a lot of the raw analog instrumentation, [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LTWVO5cUJ4&t=852.72s)]
*  you're digitizing that, similar to what Flexport has done with [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LTWVO5cUJ4&t=859.6s)]
*  customs and freight forwarding and now financing. And then you're also adding sensors, like I was [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LTWVO5cUJ4&t=863.36s)]
*  mentioning, to existing vessels and infrastructure. And you're using all that data to capture and [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LTWVO5cUJ4&t=869.28s)]
*  create more interesting and efficient route optimizations. And then I think the final thing [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LTWVO5cUJ4&t=875.68s)]
*  that's really been interesting is there's companies like ARC, but also Ceronic, Andoril, [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LTWVO5cUJ4&t=881.6s)]
*  with their dive platform that are building new versions of vessels from the ground up [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LTWVO5cUJ4&t=888.08s)]
*  with modern day assumptions on how should these vehicles operate in a digital world. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LTWVO5cUJ4&t=893.6800000000001s)]
*  And as a result, we're seeing some pretty impressive development on just like [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LTWVO5cUJ4&t=898.96s)]
*  hardware that re-envisions what something on the water should look like. And so now you don't have [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LTWVO5cUJ4&t=904.88s)]
*  to account for people in a boat, you can have something that lasts longer and go under the water, [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LTWVO5cUJ4&t=910.56s)]
*  can focus on mission planning, etc. Yeah, and maybe one specific application [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LTWVO5cUJ4&t=915.92s)]
*  that you can speak to is just the idea of autonomous fleets, right? So what does that enable? [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LTWVO5cUJ4&t=922.8s)]
*  Like you've mentioned in your big idea, the potential for mining or observation. What does [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LTWVO5cUJ4&t=927.76s)]
*  the ability, and I know that the idea of autonomous fleets isn't necessarily net new in 2024, but what [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LTWVO5cUJ4&t=933.68s)]
*  does that enable? Like are there second, third order effects of having that autonomy, which we're [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LTWVO5cUJ4&t=939.76s)]
*  also seeing increased on land, but instead in water in this case? Yeah, autonomy is interesting [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LTWVO5cUJ4&t=943.84s)]
*  because there's so many applications and it's, as to your point, it's been discussed for many years. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LTWVO5cUJ4&t=950.16s)]
*  I think there's the reality is that there's going to be different waves of autonomy in maritime. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LTWVO5cUJ4&t=957.76s)]
*  There's going to be the actual autonomy for deep water navigation, which frankly is probably less [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LTWVO5cUJ4&t=963.84s)]
*  difficult than some of the other problems. Like once you're in a port, you're navigating against [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LTWVO5cUJ4&t=969.5200000000001s)]
*  other vessels against a shifting tide and then also seafloor. And then there's also ideas of like, [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LTWVO5cUJ4&t=973.5200000000001s)]
*  can we ferry people from one port to another and actually make water transportation and navigation [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LTWVO5cUJ4&t=980.8800000000001s)]
*  much more efficient and renew that in a way that most people right now don't? [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LTWVO5cUJ4&t=986.5600000000001s)]
*  And then I think more broadly on the defense side or even on like some more of the fringe cases, [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LTWVO5cUJ4&t=992.8000000000001s)]
*  the goal is to create vessels that can go where people can't. And so whether that's the seafloor [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LTWVO5cUJ4&t=999.12s)]
*  and mining precious metals in areas where we can reduce our reliance on other countries for [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LTWVO5cUJ4&t=1006.72s)]
*  raw imports, or it's patrolling our coasts covertly in our alleys and protecting them [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LTWVO5cUJ4&t=1013.12s)]
*  or just navigating other issues. A lot of this stuff is quite useful. And to date, we've been [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LTWVO5cUJ4&t=1021.12s)]
*  quite limited based on where people can go. Again, probably the Titan implosion is unfortunately [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LTWVO5cUJ4&t=1027.6s)]
*  a good example of just the reality that humans can't survive very well in under immense pressure [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LTWVO5cUJ4&t=1033.6799999999998s)]
*  in the water. Yeah, that was definitely an unfortunate case. But speaking to that, [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LTWVO5cUJ4&t=1040.48s)]
*  there are going to be challenges I imagine along the way to some of the applications that you're [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LTWVO5cUJ4&t=1046.8s)]
*  describing. And you already spoke to how going deep underwater is just inherently hard, even when [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LTWVO5cUJ4&t=1051.28s)]
*  you're on the surface, it's just much more complex than being on land. So what are the key challenges [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LTWVO5cUJ4&t=1057.92s)]
*  that you expect on this path to modernizing maritime? I think like any industry that has [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LTWVO5cUJ4&t=1063.12s)]
*  robust history, it's going to be difficult to change. And there's many things that are kind of [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LTWVO5cUJ4&t=1070.08s)]
*  tied together. There are structural challenges, there's technological ones, and then there's [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LTWVO5cUJ4&t=1075.76s)]
*  ultimately challenges with adoption and distribution when you're dealing with [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LTWVO5cUJ4&t=1080.4s)]
*  something in the physical world. Those are often the hardest things to tackle. And that's where [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LTWVO5cUJ4&t=1084.96s)]
*  friction is really high. And I think for entrepreneurs, probably first and foremost, [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LTWVO5cUJ4&t=1090.88s)]
*  the most pressing thing is having a foundational understanding of how the maritime industry works [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LTWVO5cUJ4&t=1098.0800000000002s)]
*  and how your company fits into that picture. Oftentimes, this means finding an initial [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LTWVO5cUJ4&t=1104.72s)]
*  beachhead market and understanding how you can enter that market and then expand into a larger [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LTWVO5cUJ4&t=1110.0s)]
*  prize. And I think very similar to Amazon, you can't boil the whole ocean at once, you need to [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LTWVO5cUJ4&t=1116.32s)]
*  thread the needle and go from books to the everything store. And some of the best founders [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LTWVO5cUJ4&t=1122.88s)]
*  we've talked to in these categories have been able to articulate a very clear understanding of [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LTWVO5cUJ4&t=1127.6s)]
*  both how the broader ecosystem works and then how their company fits into it. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LTWVO5cUJ4&t=1132.8s)]
*  On the technical side, it's a double-edged sword because a lot of the tech that we are talking [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LTWVO5cUJ4&t=1137.2s)]
*  about that can be ported over from other categories like aerospace can be brought over pretty [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LTWVO5cUJ4&t=1141.8400000000001s)]
*  readily. But at the same time, the reality that it is functioning so well is because it is a quite [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LTWVO5cUJ4&t=1146.48s)]
*  difficult category to build for. And then probably most importantly is once you build it and you [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LTWVO5cUJ4&t=1151.92s)]
*  understand what you want to do, you still have to sell this to customers. And this is a category [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LTWVO5cUJ4&t=1158.4s)]
*  that the people in the industry are quite smart, but it's very difficult to convince them to change [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LTWVO5cUJ4&t=1165.04s)]
*  because most of the stuff that you're trying to sell to them is dealing with mission critical [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LTWVO5cUJ4&t=1170.96s)]
*  applications. They can't have downtime and they're already dealing with huge backlogs and stresses. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LTWVO5cUJ4&t=1176.3999999999999s)]
*  And so they oftentimes need to have proof of work. They need to be able to see that there's some [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LTWVO5cUJ4&t=1182.8s)]
*  sort of verifiable evidence that what you're doing will save them money and time. And so as a result, [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LTWVO5cUJ4&t=1188.3999999999999s)]
*  there's just a huge onus on being able to deliver something rapidly in a cost-efficient manner. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LTWVO5cUJ4&t=1193.92s)]
*  Totally. And by the way, I have to say I love your water analogies you said. You can't boil the ocean [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LTWVO5cUJ4&t=1200.64s)]
*  and also vast blue space. So I guess to close things off, there's a lot of opportunity here. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LTWVO5cUJ4&t=1206.16s)]
*  That's clear. You see a lot of different companies attacking these kinds of problems. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LTWVO5cUJ4&t=1212.48s)]
*  If you were an entrepreneur, and there's probably lots listening, I think this is the kind of idea [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LTWVO5cUJ4&t=1217.1200000000001s)]
*  that gets people up in their seats thinking, oh, wow, I can really build something real with my [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LTWVO5cUJ4&t=1221.76s)]
*  hands. We talk software and hardware coming together. What opportunities are you most excited [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LTWVO5cUJ4&t=1226.08s)]
*  about? And again, if you were an entrepreneur or builder, how would you even think about starting? [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LTWVO5cUJ4&t=1231.52s)]
*  I think to start, understand that there's, again, use these analogies and metaphors, [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LTWVO5cUJ4&t=1236.8s)]
*  there's a vast blue space here. And as a result, you need to be really articulate and intentional [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LTWVO5cUJ4&t=1242.08s)]
*  about what you want to solve. And you're going to be tempted to address plenty of other problems. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LTWVO5cUJ4&t=1248.16s)]
*  And the reality is having focus here is going to be paramount to a successful company. And then from [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LTWVO5cUJ4&t=1253.0400000000002s)]
*  there, you're going to earn the ability to operate and expand and do much more. I think another [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LTWVO5cUJ4&t=1259.76s)]
*  interesting idea that we've seen is that in categories that are really resistant to adopting [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LTWVO5cUJ4&t=1264.5600000000002s)]
*  software, oftentimes hardware is a great Trojan horse where you can sell that the customer base [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LTWVO5cUJ4&t=1269.76s)]
*  is used to purchasing some form of hardware. And then from there, you're able to layer in [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LTWVO5cUJ4&t=1276.16s)]
*  software capabilities and use that as the wedge from which you can kind of expand. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LTWVO5cUJ4&t=1281.8400000000001s)]
*  But I think to carry on the autonomous vessel and vehicle side of things, we're seeing in defense [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LTWVO5cUJ4&t=1286.96s)]
*  and in many categories, there's an asymmetric advantage to having high volume and low cost. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LTWVO5cUJ4&t=1295.52s)]
*  So in this world of defense, but also just observability, you anticipate there's going [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LTWVO5cUJ4&t=1302.1599999999999s)]
*  to be a number of companies that are able to provide swarms of vessels, both on the surface [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LTWVO5cUJ4&t=1307.36s)]
*  and also subsurface that are able to not only protect our shores and our allies, but are able [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LTWVO5cUJ4&t=1313.1999999999998s)]
*  to detect environmental damage issues in our oceans and ultimately able to help us probably [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LTWVO5cUJ4&t=1318.8s)]
*  observe our fisheries and other supply chains much more effectively. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LTWVO5cUJ4&t=1326.56s)]
*  All right. I hope you enjoyed this big idea. We do have a lot more on the way, [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LTWVO5cUJ4&t=1332.0s)]
*  including programmable medicine that's taking a page out of the Reusable Rocket Playbook, [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LTWVO5cUJ4&t=1336.1599999999999s)]
