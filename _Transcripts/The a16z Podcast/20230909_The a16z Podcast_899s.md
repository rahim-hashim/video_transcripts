# Can You Prove The Big Bang Theory?
**The a16z Podcast:** [September 09, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0SDXvM8QGA)
*  What if I told you that our understanding of the Big Bang Theory and the very origins of our universe [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0SDXvM8QGA&t=0.0s)]
*  can be traced back to a map of pink and blue blobs? [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0SDXvM8QGA&t=6.0s)]
*  The same blurry map that Stephen Hawking described as, quote, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0SDXvM8QGA&t=10.0s)]
*  the most important discovery of the century, if not all time. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0SDXvM8QGA&t=14.0s)]
*  Well, today we have the privilege of hearing from astrophysicist and Nobel laureate John Mather, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0SDXvM8QGA&t=19.0s)]
*  one of the great minds behind the Cosmic Background Explorer satellite, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0SDXvM8QGA&t=24.0s)]
*  which produced those very pink and blue blobs, also widely considered to be the first strong evidence for the Big Bang, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0SDXvM8QGA&t=28.0s)]
*  or, in the words of the Nobel committee, the starting point for cosmology as a precision science. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0SDXvM8QGA&t=35.0s)]
*  Our map showed pink and blue blobs across the entire sky. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0SDXvM8QGA&t=41.0s)]
*  It's very blurry, but it was enough to say the early universe was not the same everywhere. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0SDXvM8QGA&t=45.0s)]
*  There were hot and cold spots. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0SDXvM8QGA&t=50.0s)]
*  That matters to us because if the universe had been completely, exactly uniform, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0SDXvM8QGA&t=51.0s)]
*  gravity wouldn't know what to do. It would not have any way to pull material back together again, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0SDXvM8QGA&t=56.0s)]
*  to stop the expansion locally and make galaxies and stars and planets and people. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0SDXvM8QGA&t=60.0s)]
*  This video is also the first of a three-part series exploring the secrets of space, many of which we're still uncovering. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0SDXvM8QGA&t=65.0s)]
*  And it's part of a longer conversation where I had the pleasure of sitting down with John at the Aspen Ideas Festival. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0SDXvM8QGA&t=72.0s)]
*  So, listen in as we hear how John went from a dairy farm to a failed thesis project [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0SDXvM8QGA&t=78.0s)]
*  to being the first NASA scientist to win a Nobel Prize. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0SDXvM8QGA&t=84.0s)]
*  We also covered the ongoing challenge of unifying gravity and quantum mechanics, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0SDXvM8QGA&t=88.0s)]
*  John's time as the lead project scientist for the James Webb Space Telescope, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0SDXvM8QGA&t=92.0s)]
*  which, by the way, I'm sure you recognize imagery from, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0SDXvM8QGA&t=96.0s)]
*  and just how much of our universe we have left to understand. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0SDXvM8QGA&t=99.0s)]
*  As a reminder, the content here is for informational purposes only, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0SDXvM8QGA&t=103.0s)]

*  For more details, please see a16z.com slash disclosures. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0SDXvM8QGA&t=117.0s)]
*  Tell us about when you started getting involved in this. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0SDXvM8QGA&t=131.0s)]
*  I got interested pretty young. I think I was about six years old. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0SDXvM8QGA&t=133.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0SDXvM8QGA&t=138.0s)]
*  I heard from my dad at bedtime story time that living things are made out of cells with chromosomes. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0SDXvM8QGA&t=139.0s)]
*  And this was before we even knew about the double helix. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0SDXvM8QGA&t=145.0s)]
*  That's right. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0SDXvM8QGA&t=149.0s)]
*  That got my attention. My friends and neighbors were farmers. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0SDXvM8QGA&t=150.0s)]
*  My dad was studying dairy cows for his research for Rector's University. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0SDXvM8QGA&t=154.0s)]
*  And so that was where I got started. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0SDXvM8QGA&t=159.0s)]
*  Living out on the farm, thinking about deep things like that, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0SDXvM8QGA&t=163.0s)]
*  the origin of everything. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0SDXvM8QGA&t=167.0s)]
*  If you know about cells and chromosomes, then immediately you understand evolution [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0SDXvM8QGA&t=169.0s)]
*  and the huge changes that can happen through time. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0SDXvM8QGA&t=173.0s)]
*  I think I was about eight. We went to see the Museum of Natural History in New York [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0SDXvM8QGA&t=177.0s)]
*  and the Planetarium show and the giant meteorite sitting there, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0SDXvM8QGA&t=181.0s)]
*  as big as a small apartment, just sitting there. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0SDXvM8QGA&t=185.0s)]
*  You say, where does that come from? [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0SDXvM8QGA&t=188.0s)]
*  Where do we come from? [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0SDXvM8QGA&t=190.0s)]
*  Where do we come from? [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0SDXvM8QGA&t=191.0s)]
*  So you see the bones arranged and showing evolutionary order in the museum. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0SDXvM8QGA&t=192.0s)]
*  Oh my golly, what a fascinating story. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0SDXvM8QGA&t=196.0s)]
*  I want to know everything about this. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0SDXvM8QGA&t=199.0s)]
*  Yes, yes. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0SDXvM8QGA&t=200.0s)]
*  And we didn't know that much about space at that time. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0SDXvM8QGA&t=201.0s)]
*  Maybe I'm getting a little too ahead of myself because I'm sure there's so many years [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0SDXvM8QGA&t=204.0s)]
*  between what you're describing and when you won your Nobel Prize. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0SDXvM8QGA&t=207.0s)]
*  But that did seem like maybe the start of a new era of our understanding of space. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0SDXvM8QGA&t=211.0s)]
*  And so could you speak a little more to the satellite that you had developed [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0SDXvM8QGA&t=217.0s)]
*  with your partner and what that really meant as maybe an inflection point? [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0SDXvM8QGA&t=221.0s)]
*  So back in 1970, I was in graduate school at the University of California, Berkeley, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0SDXvM8QGA&t=225.0s)]
*  looking for a thesis project because I was tired of studying in the library. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0SDXvM8QGA&t=230.0s)]
*  And maybe I better build something. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0SDXvM8QGA&t=234.0s)]
*  So the people had just discovered the cosmic microwave background radiation. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0SDXvM8QGA&t=236.0s)]
*  It is thought to be the remnant of the early universe, the hot big bang. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0SDXvM8QGA&t=241.0s)]
*  It still fills the universe. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0SDXvM8QGA&t=248.0s)]
*  And so can a graduate student do something to go measure it better? [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0SDXvM8QGA&t=250.0s)]
*  So the answer is yes, we'll try something. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0SDXvM8QGA&t=254.0s)]
*  So, okay, well, I worked on a project which was an instrument to measure the spectrum, [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0SDXvM8QGA&t=256.0s)]
*  which is to say how bright is this radiation at each different wavelength. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0SDXvM8QGA&t=262.0s)]
*  And we built it and we sent it up attached to a high-altitude balloon. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0SDXvM8QGA&t=266.0s)]
*  And it went up and it did not work. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0SDXvM8QGA&t=271.0s)]
*  Oh man, what do I do now? [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0SDXvM8QGA&t=273.0s)]
*  So my thesis advisor said, okay, well, you did good work. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0SDXvM8QGA&t=275.0s)]
*  You can write this up and you can make a thesis out of it. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0SDXvM8QGA&t=278.0s)]
*  They've already published some other papers. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0SDXvM8QGA&t=280.0s)]
*  So I said, okay, I'll get a job. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0SDXvM8QGA&t=283.0s)]
*  I got a job for NASA. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0SDXvM8QGA&t=285.0s)]
*  Five years before that, we had just landed on the moon for the first time. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0SDXvM8QGA&t=288.0s)]
*  Wow, okay. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0SDXvM8QGA&t=291.0s)]
*  So, okay, 1974, I'm at NASA Laboratory in New York City. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0SDXvM8QGA&t=293.0s)]
*  And, okay, so NASA puts out this announcement of opportunity, [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0SDXvM8QGA&t=297.0s)]
*  calling for new satellite missions for science because what are we going to do [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0SDXvM8QGA&t=302.0s)]
*  after the moon landings are done? [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0SDXvM8QGA&t=306.0s)]
*  Maybe do something else. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0SDXvM8QGA&t=308.0s)]
*  So, okay, so, okay, boss, my thesis project failed. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0SDXvM8QGA&t=310.0s)]
*  We should try it in outer space. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0SDXvM8QGA&t=313.0s)]
*  So I had no idea how much nerve was required to do this. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0SDXvM8QGA&t=315.0s)]
*  We just did it. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0SDXvM8QGA&t=319.0s)]
*  We wrote a little thin proposal. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0SDXvM8QGA&t=321.0s)]
*  We said we have an idea. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0SDXvM8QGA&t=323.0s)]
*  So after a couple of years, NASA said, well, we think it's a good idea. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0SDXvM8QGA&t=325.0s)]
*  So I went and I got a job at the big NASA laboratory in Greenbelt, Maryland, [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0SDXvM8QGA&t=327.0s)]
*  just outside Washington. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0SDXvM8QGA&t=331.0s)]
*  And they gave us some engineering time to work with people who knew how to build [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0SDXvM8QGA&t=333.0s)]
*  stuff in space. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0SDXvM8QGA&t=337.0s)]
*  And, well, in 1989, it went up. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0SDXvM8QGA&t=339.0s)]
*  And it worked. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0SDXvM8QGA&t=343.0s)]
*  And within weeks, we had measured the spectrum. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0SDXvM8QGA&t=344.0s)]
*  My thesis project that had failed as a polluted payload now worked beautifully [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0SDXvM8QGA&t=348.0s)]
*  in outer space. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0SDXvM8QGA&t=353.0s)]
*  That's incredible. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0SDXvM8QGA&t=354.0s)]
*  So we went up to the astronomy society and we got a standing ovation for a graph. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0SDXvM8QGA&t=355.0s)]
*  And so they knew what it meant. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0SDXvM8QGA&t=359.0s)]
*  They knew basically that not only was the equipment working, but the story of the [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0SDXvM8QGA&t=361.0s)]
*  hot Big Bang was basically right. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0SDXvM8QGA&t=366.0s)]
*  People don't remember now that there used to be alternate theories that said, [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0SDXvM8QGA&t=369.0s)]
*  well, maybe it wasn't so. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0SDXvM8QGA&t=373.0s)]
*  A couple of years after that first announcement, we were able to say we made a [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0SDXvM8QGA&t=375.0s)]
*  map of this cosmic heat. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0SDXvM8QGA&t=378.0s)]
*  And our map showed pink and blue blobs across the entire sky. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0SDXvM8QGA&t=380.0s)]
*  And what they show is if you could see millimeter waves with your eyes, you would [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0SDXvM8QGA&t=384.0s)]
*  see this big fuzzy map. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0SDXvM8QGA&t=388.0s)]
*  It's very blurry. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0SDXvM8QGA&t=390.0s)]
*  But it was enough to say the early universe was not the same everywhere. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0SDXvM8QGA&t=391.0s)]
*  There were hot and cold spots. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0SDXvM8QGA&t=395.0s)]
*  And that matters to us because if the universe had been completely exactly uniform, [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0SDXvM8QGA&t=397.0s)]
*  gravity wouldn't know what to do. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0SDXvM8QGA&t=402.0s)]
*  It would not have any way to pull material back together again. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0SDXvM8QGA&t=405.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0SDXvM8QGA&t=408.0s)]
*  To stop the expansion locally and make galaxies and stars and planets and people. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0SDXvM8QGA&t=409.0s)]
*  So we're here because of those spots. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0SDXvM8QGA&t=413.0s)]
*  And so that's pretty revolutionary. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0SDXvM8QGA&t=415.0s)]
*  It used to be people looked at this amazing universe and thought, it requires divine [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0SDXvM8QGA&t=417.0s)]
*  intervention because it's too damn complicated. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0SDXvM8QGA&t=422.0s)]
*  Nobody could possibly see how it could work. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0SDXvM8QGA&t=424.0s)]
*  We confuse, I don't know how it works, or I don't know how to do it with it can't be [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0SDXvM8QGA&t=426.0s)]
*  done or it's impossible. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0SDXvM8QGA&t=432.0s)]
*  When it comes back to how did we get here, it used to be we couldn't understand how to [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0SDXvM8QGA&t=434.0s)]
*  calculate anything. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0SDXvM8QGA&t=439.0s)]
*  So we figured it must be impossible. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0SDXvM8QGA&t=440.0s)]
*  It must require divine intervention. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0SDXvM8QGA&t=442.0s)]
*  And now I think we have a different picture. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0SDXvM8QGA&t=444.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0SDXvM8QGA&t=446.0s)]
*  Let me divert into that a little bit because how is it that nature spontaneously [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0SDXvM8QGA&t=447.0s)]
*  produces complicated stuff? [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0SDXvM8QGA&t=453.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0SDXvM8QGA&t=455.0s)]
*  So there are reasons, there are fundamental deep reasons why nature produces [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0SDXvM8QGA&t=456.0s)]
*  complicated stuff. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0SDXvM8QGA&t=461.0s)]
*  So when you think of nature as just full of atoms and atoms are just little billiard [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0SDXvM8QGA&t=462.0s)]
*  balls and they have no shapes and no properties, then of course it would be extremely [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0SDXvM8QGA&t=468.0s)]
*  unusual for them to stick together and form what they do. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0SDXvM8QGA&t=472.0s)]
*  But quantum mechanics says, no, atoms are not little billiard balls. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0SDXvM8QGA&t=475.0s)]
*  They have shapes and they're like little covered with Velcro of different flavors. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0SDXvM8QGA&t=479.0s)]
*  So atoms stick together in certain patterns. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0SDXvM8QGA&t=485.0s)]
*  That's how nature is. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0SDXvM8QGA&t=488.0s)]
*  So okay, then also we know about thermodynamics, which tells us which kinds of [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0SDXvM8QGA&t=490.0s)]
*  reactions are favored by nature. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0SDXvM8QGA&t=495.0s)]
*  So if energy is released when two atoms come together, then it's likely to happen. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0SDXvM8QGA&t=498.0s)]
*  So now we say, okay, it's not completely without pattern. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0SDXvM8QGA&t=503.0s)]
*  Nature gives patterns because of quantum mechanics and thermodynamics. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0SDXvM8QGA&t=508.0s)]
*  So it's just built in that complicated things will occur given a chance. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0SDXvM8QGA&t=512.0s)]
*  So okay, then what complicated things have occurred? [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0SDXvM8QGA&t=517.0s)]
*  Well, there's another feature here, which is that the universe spontaneously heats up. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0SDXvM8QGA&t=521.0s)]
*  This is something they don't teach you in school. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0SDXvM8QGA&t=528.0s)]
*  In school, they say, well, nature does not have two objects just sit there at the same [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0SDXvM8QGA&t=531.0s)]
*  temperature and one gets hot and one gets cold. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0SDXvM8QGA&t=536.0s)]
*  That's true in normal life. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0SDXvM8QGA&t=539.0s)]
*  But gravity is an exception to that. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0SDXvM8QGA&t=541.0s)]
*  Gravity is the reason why the universe has heated itself up. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0SDXvM8QGA&t=543.0s)]
*  When gravity can heat up, gravity can stop the expansion of the material of the Big Bang [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0SDXvM8QGA&t=547.0s)]
*  and pull it back in to make stars. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0SDXvM8QGA&t=552.0s)]
*  Then when it does that, the stars can light up and release nuclear energy. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0SDXvM8QGA&t=554.0s)]
*  And now we have a state of the universe where it's hot some places and cold other places. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0SDXvM8QGA&t=559.0s)]
*  So energy flows from place to place. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0SDXvM8QGA&t=564.0s)]
*  And this is then the basis of the complexity that we now have. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0SDXvM8QGA&t=567.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0SDXvM8QGA&t=570.0s)]
*  And that's partially what we got from your saying this image, because if this wasn't the case, [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0SDXvM8QGA&t=571.0s)]
*  if gravity didn't exist and create these local changes, then what would we see? [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0SDXvM8QGA&t=575.0s)]
*  Would we instead have seen just a clean image? [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0SDXvM8QGA&t=580.0s)]
*  Yeah, if gravity could not have acted on those hot and cold spots, those dense and less dense regions, [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0SDXvM8QGA&t=583.0s)]
*  then nothing would have happened. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0SDXvM8QGA&t=589.0s)]
*  It would just have been a completely featureless expanding universe with no stars, no galaxies, [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0SDXvM8QGA&t=591.0s)]
*  no anythings, all the same temperature. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0SDXvM8QGA&t=596.0s)]
*  Completely boring as far as we're concerned. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0SDXvM8QGA&t=599.0s)]
*  We wouldn't be here. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0SDXvM8QGA&t=601.0s)]
*  We wouldn't be here. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0SDXvM8QGA&t=602.0s)]
*  Nature does have gravity. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0SDXvM8QGA&t=603.0s)]
*  Nature does have the other three forces of physics. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0SDXvM8QGA&t=604.0s)]
*  And it does have quantum mechanics and thermodynamics. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0SDXvM8QGA&t=607.0s)]
*  And so it is a universe in which complexity naturally appears. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0SDXvM8QGA&t=611.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0SDXvM8QGA&t=615.0s)]
*  And maybe you could just speak to kind of what a phase change, again, this was in our understanding, [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0SDXvM8QGA&t=616.0s)]
*  because I think even Stephen Hawking said this maybe was one of the most important images to come through science. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0SDXvM8QGA&t=621.0s)]
*  Why was this such an important discovery? [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0SDXvM8QGA&t=626.0s)]
*  Stephen Hawking looked at our map of the pink and blue blobs and he said it was the most important scientific discovery of the century. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0SDXvM8QGA&t=628.0s)]
*  There you go. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0SDXvM8QGA&t=634.0s)]
*  It's not of all time. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0SDXvM8QGA&t=635.0s)]
*  And I first thought, oh, Stephen, you're just exaggerating. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0SDXvM8QGA&t=636.0s)]
*  But it's very nice. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0SDXvM8QGA&t=639.0s)]
*  And then I thought, OK, well, in truth, if we could understand where those spots come from, [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0SDXvM8QGA&t=641.0s)]
*  it would tell us perhaps about the unification of the forces of nature. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0SDXvM8QGA&t=646.0s)]
*  Right now we still have the great mystery of quantum mechanics doesn't seem to describe gravity, [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0SDXvM8QGA&t=651.0s)]
*  but we know it is that it ought to. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0SDXvM8QGA&t=657.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0SDXvM8QGA&t=660.0s)]
*  And if it does, then it means that even space and time are randomly fluctuating and weird. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0SDXvM8QGA&t=661.0s)]
*  And so that was it's like one of the great mysteries of science. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0SDXvM8QGA&t=667.0s)]
*  And we think there ought to be something there. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0SDXvM8QGA&t=672.0s)]
*  Scientists have been working at least 50, maybe 100 years trying to figure out how gravity and quantum mechanics should go together. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0SDXvM8QGA&t=675.0s)]
*  The other thing, of course, is where did we come from? [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0SDXvM8QGA&t=683.0s)]
*  And if those spots weren't there, then we wouldn't be here. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0SDXvM8QGA&t=686.0s)]
*  So that's pretty cool. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0SDXvM8QGA&t=689.0s)]
*  And it even tells us through detailed analysis that there is something called cosmic dark matter, [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0SDXvM8QGA&t=691.0s)]
*  which we can't see and perhaps never will see. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0SDXvM8QGA&t=698.0s)]
*  So we've got all these wonderful mysteries that are all embedded in this map of pink and blue blobs. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0SDXvM8QGA&t=702.0s)]
*  And so it's totally fascinating and draws in thousands and thousands of scientists. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0SDXvM8QGA&t=708.0s)]
*  Since the COBE satellite was flown, two more satellites were built and flown, and they confirmed our original measurements, [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0SDXvM8QGA&t=715.0s)]
*  which is nice because that meant we could get a Nobel Prize for discovering the thing that turned out to be true. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0SDXvM8QGA&t=722.0s)]
*  Congratulations. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0SDXvM8QGA&t=727.0s)]
*  What if it weren't true? [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0SDXvM8QGA&t=728.0s)]
*  Then, of course, you don't get a prize. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0SDXvM8QGA&t=729.0s)]
*  But now we have much, much, much more detail to go on. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0SDXvM8QGA&t=732.0s)]
*  Let's talk about that. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0SDXvM8QGA&t=735.0s)]
*  So you were the senior project scientist on the James Webb Space Telescope. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0SDXvM8QGA&t=737.0s)]
*  And I feel like that was the most recent exposure that the everyday person had to the frontier that we're now approaching. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0SDXvM8QGA&t=741.0s)]
*  After the Hubble telescope was launched, scientists said how wonderful it was. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0SDXvM8QGA&t=752.0s)]
*  And by the way, we still can't tell how the galaxies grew. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0SDXvM8QGA&t=757.0s)]
*  And it was still one of the great mysteries of science because we thought we would understand. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0SDXvM8QGA&t=761.0s)]
*  We thought, oh, now we know about the Big Bang and the hot and cold spots, [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0SDXvM8QGA&t=767.0s)]
*  and we should be able to simulate and calculate how galaxies would grow. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0SDXvM8QGA&t=771.0s)]
*  And then we measured with the Hubble telescope. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0SDXvM8QGA&t=775.0s)]
*  Oh, we get it wrong. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0SDXvM8QGA&t=778.0s)]
*  The predictions had been that galaxies would grow slowly. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0SDXvM8QGA&t=780.0s)]
*  So the Hubble would be able to see the first ones happening. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0SDXvM8QGA&t=784.0s)]
*  And, of course, how do you see that? [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0SDXvM8QGA&t=788.0s)]
*  Well, you see back in time by looking at things that are far away. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0SDXvM8QGA&t=790.0s)]
*  You've got your own time machine in your eyeballs every morning, but you don't feel it. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0SDXvM8QGA&t=793.0s)]
*  So look back in time, see what the universe was like when it was young, and see what were the galaxies doing. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0SDXvM8QGA&t=797.0s)]
*  And they were already pretty grown up as far back in time as the Hubble could see. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0SDXvM8QGA&t=803.0s)]
*  So please build us another telescope to look farther back because we've got a big mystery here. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0SDXvM8QGA&t=809.0s)]
*  So we still have a big mystery because we built the Webb telescope. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0SDXvM8QGA&t=814.0s)]
*  It did what it was supposed to do. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0SDXvM8QGA&t=819.0s)]
*  It produced beautiful pictures, and right away we could see that the galaxies grew even faster than we thought. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0SDXvM8QGA&t=821.0s)]
*  And so even though we had the information from Hubble and all the simulations and calculations and predictions, we were still wrong. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0SDXvM8QGA&t=827.0s)]
*  So we're looking for something really deep and fundamental. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0SDXvM8QGA&t=836.0s)]
*  So don't know what it is. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0SDXvM8QGA&t=840.0s)]
*  So that's why astronomers are thrilled right now that they've got something to work on. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0SDXvM8QGA&t=842.0s)]
*  It's going to take us a good long time. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0SDXvM8QGA&t=847.0s)]
*  Could be decades before we really, really deeply understand what were we wrong about. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0SDXvM8QGA&t=849.0s)]
*  And it's even possible that there's some new force of nature or some thing that happened early on that's just so different than we can't even imagine it yet. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0SDXvM8QGA&t=855.0s)]
*  All right. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0SDXvM8QGA&t=863.0s)]
*  That is all for today's video. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0SDXvM8QGA&t=864.0s)]
*  However, if you liked this video, we have a lot more where that came from. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0SDXvM8QGA&t=866.0s)]
*  In fact, we just released a full length episode with this guest on the A16Z podcast. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0SDXvM8QGA&t=870.0s)]
*  So if you'd like to hear it, go check it out in your favorite podcast app of choice, or we'll link it in the description below. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0SDXvM8QGA&t=876.0s)]
*  Thank you so much for listening and we'll see you next time. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0SDXvM8QGA&t=882.0s)]
