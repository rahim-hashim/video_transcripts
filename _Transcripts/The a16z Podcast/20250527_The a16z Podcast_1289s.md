Video Description: American healthcare is in crisis—but what if we could change the system by preventing disease before it starts?

In this episode of the a16z Podcast, general partner Vijay Pande sits down with Dr. Eric Topol, founder and director of the Scripps Research Translational Institute and one of the most cited researchers in medicine, to explore the cutting edge of preventive healthcare and longevity science.

Drawing from his new book Super Agers: An Evidence-Based Path to Longevity, Topol breaks down why understanding the biology of aging—not reversing it—is the key to preventing the “Big Three” age-related diseases: cancer, cardiovascular disease, and neurodegenerative conditions. The conversation spans AI-powered risk prediction, organ clocks, polygenic risk scores, GLP-1s, and the cultural and economic shifts required to move from a “sick care” system to one rooted in precision prevention and extended health span.

If you’ve ever wondered how data, personalized medicine, and AI can add seven healthy years to your life—and what it will take to bring those benefits to everyone—this episode is for you.

# 7 More Healthy Years: What We Can Learn from Super Agers
**The a16z Podcast:** [May 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI)
*  American health care is in crisis. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=0.0s)]
*  We have a path to prevention. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=2.0s)]
*  It isn't reversing aging. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=4.0s)]
*  It's just preventing the age-related [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=6.0s)]
*  morbidities of the big three. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=8.0s)]
*  It's been a fantasy [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=10.0s)]
*  for millennia. There should be a reboot [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=12.0s)]
*  new standard of care based on [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=14.0s)]
*  intelligent partitioning of risk. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=16.0s)]
*  Seven years more of [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=18.0s)]
*  healthspan free of the major [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=20.0s)]
*  three diseases. Seven years? Who [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=22.0s)]
*  wouldn't take seven years? I hope [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=24.0s)]
*  we'll seize this opportunity because [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=26.0s)]
*  we may never get another one like this for a long time. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=28.0s)]
*  So you've written this really [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=38.0s)]
*  exciting book, Superagers [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=40.0s)]
*  an Evidence-Based Path to Longevity. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=42.0s)]
*  And I think [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=44.0s)]
*  it's a very timely topic. And I was [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=46.0s)]
*  curious for you to maybe set the stage for [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=48.0s)]
*  why you wanted to write it and how [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=50.0s)]
*  you see it in the context of other books that [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=52.0s)]
*  have been coming out recently as well. Yeah, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=54.0s)]
*  there were a few things that came together. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=56.0s)]
*  We had done a big [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=58.0s)]
*  study we called the Welderley [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=60.0s)]
*  where we basically found [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=62.0s)]
*  very little in the genomes of people [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=64.0s)]
*  who had gone to the age [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=66.0s)]
*  of 87 on average [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=68.0s)]
*  with never having had an age-related [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=70.0s)]
*  disease. So that was [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=72.0s)]
*  of course one thing that was part of it. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=74.0s)]
*  The second was I got inspired [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=76.0s)]
*  by a patient I saw recently [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=78.0s)]
*  who was 98 [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=80.0s)]
*  and had never been sick. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=82.0s)]
*  And her name was Lee Risall. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=84.0s)]
*  Her relatives had died in their 50s and 60s. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=86.0s)]
*  That's her parents, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=88.0s)]
*  her uncles and aunts. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=90.0s)]
*  She was the outlier. I'd say why? [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=92.0s)]
*  And then there were the books [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=94.0s)]
*  that came out. I had [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=96.0s)]
*  patients coming to me. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=98.0s)]
*  They wanted me to write a prescription [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=100.0s)]
*  for apomycin or [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=102.0s)]
*  order a total body MRI. I said, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=104.0s)]
*  you know, we've got to get the story [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=106.0s)]
*  straight. So these three things together [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=108.0s)]
*  were the impetus that [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=110.0s)]
*  I was thinking, why don't I really get deep [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=112.0s)]
*  into this, everything [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=114.0s)]
*  we know today, and then kind of [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=116.0s)]
*  see if I could lay out some blueprints [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=118.0s)]
*  for where we can go. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=120.0s)]
*  It's coming into a world where [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=122.0s)]
*  American healthcare is in crisis. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=124.0s)]
*  I was curious to get your take on [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=126.0s)]
*  where we are now in healthcare [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=128.0s)]
*  in the U.S. and where do you think we could get to? [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=130.0s)]
*  Yeah, so there is this bifurcation [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=132.0s)]
*  as I see it. You could call it [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=134.0s)]
*  like the grand slam where you get [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=136.0s)]
*  reversing of aging [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=138.0s)]
*  so you keep people healthier bodywide. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=140.0s)]
*  And that's where we see all [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=142.0s)]
*  this remarkable investments in [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=144.0s)]
*  companies like Altos [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=146.0s)]
*  and with reprogramming [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=148.0s)]
*  Centalytics and a long [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=150.0s)]
*  list. But they're really focused on [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=152.0s)]
*  a monumental task [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=154.0s)]
*  which hasn't been shown [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=156.0s)]
*  in people, but rather [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=158.0s)]
*  in rodents. The other side [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=160.0s)]
*  of this is we've made these big [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=162.0s)]
*  strides in the science of aging [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=164.0s)]
*  with all these layers of data [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=166.0s)]
*  that are using the metrics of aging. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=168.0s)]
*  And why don't we use that [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=170.0s)]
*  to prevent the age-related [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=172.0s)]
*  diseases? Cancer, cardiovascular, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=174.0s)]
*  neurodegenerative. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=176.0s)]
*  We've never done that in medicine to [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=178.0s)]
*  any appreciable extent. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=180.0s)]
*  And this is the opportunity [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=182.0s)]
*  because we have a path [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=184.0s)]
*  to preventing disease. It isn't [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=186.0s)]
*  reversing aging. It's just preventing [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=188.0s)]
*  the age-related morbidities [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=190.0s)]
*  of the big three. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=192.0s)]
*  I think that's something that a lot of people may not realize [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=194.0s)]
*  is that the big three that you [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=196.0s)]
*  mentioned, cancer, heart [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=198.0s)]
*  disease, Alzheimer's, [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=200.0s)]
*  and dementia, [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=202.0s)]
*  that they're greatly [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=204.0s)]
*  exacerbated by age. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=206.0s)]
*  And it's interesting because if you ever [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=208.0s)]
*  sort of wanted to have something that could be [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=210.0s)]
*  a cure for multiple [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=212.0s)]
*  diseases, which would be one of the holy grails [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=214.0s)]
*  of medicine, it would be understanding [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=216.0s)]
*  the biology of aging. Where are we [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=218.0s)]
*  now in terms of things that we can use today? [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=220.0s)]
*  It takes 20 years [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=222.0s)]
*  to get these diseases, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=224.0s)]
*  with rare exception. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=226.0s)]
*  You know, heart disease, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=228.0s)]
*  almost all cancers, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=230.0s)]
*  and neurodegenerative, they are incubating [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=232.0s)]
*  for a very long time. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=234.0s)]
*  They all have a common thread [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=236.0s)]
*  of a [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=238.0s)]
*  defective immune system [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=240.0s)]
*  and inflammation underpinning. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=242.0s)]
*  They [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=244.0s)]
*  are preventable [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=246.0s)]
*  variably. So cardiovascular, [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=248.0s)]
*  80-90% from [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=250.0s)]
*  lifestyle and related factors, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=252.0s)]
*  modifiable factors, like [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=254.0s)]
*  your LDL cholesterol, [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=256.0s)]
*  that kind of thing. And cancer [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=258.0s)]
*  and neurodegenerative, just from what we know [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=260.0s)]
*  today with lifestyle factors, we're about [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=262.0s)]
*  half that can be prevented. So [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=264.0s)]
*  we have some knowledge [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=266.0s)]
*  about averting [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=268.0s)]
*  these diseases. But we [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=270.0s)]
*  have a lot more with [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=272.0s)]
*  all these clocks and new layers of [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=274.0s)]
*  data that are really changing the face of [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=276.0s)]
*  all outgross of understanding [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=278.0s)]
*  the biology of aging. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=280.0s)]
*  So you, in your book, outline [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=282.0s)]
*  the five dimensions of health. I was [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=284.0s)]
*  wondering, maybe you could walk us through them. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=286.0s)]
*  Yeah, sure. So, the [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=288.0s)]
*  first, most important one, [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=290.0s)]
*  is AI. Because [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=292.0s)]
*  you need that to pull [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=294.0s)]
*  all this other data we're going to talk about together. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=296.0s)]
*  This moment that is so exciting [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=298.0s)]
*  is because we have multimodal AI, [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=300.0s)]
*  not only in large language, but [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=302.0s)]
*  large reasoning models. Well, especially, I think, [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=304.0s)]
*  when you're talking about AI, it's all the things [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=306.0s)]
*  people have seen with generative AI and so on, but also [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=308.0s)]
*  just the ability to understand all this data [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=310.0s)]
*  that you're measuring from people. Yes, because [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=312.0s)]
*  the other four are [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=314.0s)]
*  such big domains or [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=316.0s)]
*  dimensions. So the omics, it includes [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=318.0s)]
*  not just gene sequence [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=320.0s)]
*  or arrays, but it [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=322.0s)]
*  has all the proteins, all [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=324.0s)]
*  the proteomic panels that we can [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=326.0s)]
*  get, which we never could get before, inexpensively. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=328.0s)]
*  It includes the [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=330.0s)]
*  gut microbiome, metabolome, [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=332.0s)]
*  and certainly [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=334.0s)]
*  epigenome or epigenetics. So, the [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=336.0s)]
*  omics are rich. We [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=338.0s)]
*  are now seeing, moving towards [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=340.0s)]
*  things like the virtual cell. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=342.0s)]
*  Then there is, of course, [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=344.0s)]
*  cells that have become [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=346.0s)]
*  a live drug, where [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=348.0s)]
*  we can reset the immune system [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=350.0s)]
*  and cure autoimmune diseases like we've never [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=352.0s)]
*  done before. Could you give examples of that? [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=354.0s)]
*  Yeah, so, in the last couple [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=356.0s)]
*  of years, we've seen [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=358.0s)]
*  unprecedented cures. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=360.0s)]
*  We never had anything. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=362.0s)]
*  Lupus, progressive systemic [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=364.0s)]
*  sclerosis, even [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=366.0s)]
*  cases of multiple sclerosis, [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=368.0s)]
*  dermatomyositis. So, [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=370.0s)]
*  basically, it's [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=372.0s)]
*  depletion of all the B cells, [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=374.0s)]
*  and when they come back, [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=376.0s)]
*  they have forgotten what they were attacking. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=378.0s)]
*  It's amazing. It's really [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=380.0s)]
*  amazing. And that leads to the autoimmune reaction. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=382.0s)]
*  But the bigger lesson is [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=384.0s)]
*  we have learned how to control our immune system, [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=386.0s)]
*  like a rheostat, [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=388.0s)]
*  and we're going to keep getting better and better [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=390.0s)]
*  as we measure our immunone. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=392.0s)]
*  But when you can do that, [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=394.0s)]
*  when you can quash an [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=396.0s)]
*  autoimmune disease, or [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=398.0s)]
*  when you're trying to cure a cancer [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=400.0s)]
*  by just whatever it takes [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=402.0s)]
*  to keep bringing up that immune system [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=404.0s)]
*  specific to the tumor, the immune [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=406.0s)]
*  system is fundamental, and that [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=408.0s)]
*  also now is involving cells [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=410.0s)]
*  and vaccines. So, [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=412.0s)]
*  vaccines now are capable [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=414.0s)]
*  of cures, of pancreatic [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=416.0s)]
*  cancer, kidney cancer, with these [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=418.0s)]
*  personalized vaccines [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=420.0s)]
*  using the proteins of [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=422.0s)]
*  the person's tumor. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=424.0s)]
*  These aren't clinical trials right now. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=426.0s)]
*  It's stuff like we've never seen. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=428.0s)]
*  And that's just a front runner [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=430.0s)]
*  of what vaccines, that's [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=432.0s)]
*  to treat cancer. We're going to [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=434.0s)]
*  be using vaccines to prevent cancer. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=436.0s)]
*  Again, as we get older, [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=438.0s)]
*  some of us especially, our [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=440.0s)]
*  immune system is getting senescent [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=442.0s)]
*  and weak, and a vaccine [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=444.0s)]
*  before there's any cancer, before there's [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=446.0s)]
*  anything else, could prop it up. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=448.0s)]
*  We also have drugs to [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=450.0s)]
*  modulate our immune system [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=452.0s)]
*  well beyond checkpoint inhibitors. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=454.0s)]
*  And so, whether it's [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=456.0s)]
*  antibody drug conjugates, [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=458.0s)]
*  tumor infiltrating [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=460.0s)]
*  lymphocytes, and all these different ways, [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=462.0s)]
*  it's hard to imagine [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=464.0s)]
*  that in the future we're going to lose people [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=466.0s)]
*  with cancer because of [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=468.0s)]
*  being able to bring your immune system to the highest [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=470.0s)]
*  level when we need it. But more [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=472.0s)]
*  importantly, preventing the cancer. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=474.0s)]
*  We can do that now. That's what's [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=476.0s)]
*  exciting. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=478.0s)]
*  And so, if we put all this together, what does [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=480.0s)]
*  this mean for the individual? [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=482.0s)]
*  How would their life change? [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=484.0s)]
*  What should people be doing? [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=486.0s)]
*  Yeah, so I call it Lifestyle Plus. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=488.0s)]
*  It's a lot bigger than diet, [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=490.0s)]
*  sleep, and exercise, which [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=492.0s)]
*  we can drill down on, but it's involving [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=494.0s)]
*  all the environmental [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=496.0s)]
*  burdens, air pollution, [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=498.0s)]
*  the plastics, microplastics, nanoplastics, [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=502.0s)]
*  and forever chemicals. And then [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=504.0s)]
*  there's other things like time and nature. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=506.0s)]
*  So if each of us [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=508.0s)]
*  pulled out all the stops [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=510.0s)]
*  for the lifestyle factors, which is [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=512.0s)]
*  a long list, that will help. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=514.0s)]
*  But it's not going to be only lifestyle [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=516.0s)]
*  factors that are the ways to [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=518.0s)]
*  prevent the big three age-related [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=520.0s)]
*  diseases. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=522.0s)]
*  You described a large range of things [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=524.0s)]
*  from the sort of most [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=526.0s)]
*  almost sci-fi-like [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=528.0s)]
*  drugs that are in trials for [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=530.0s)]
*  preventing cancer to lifestyle. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=532.0s)]
*  I could also imagine AI coming [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=534.0s)]
*  into this, because one of the things AI is very good [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=536.0s)]
*  at is to take a set of data, and [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=538.0s)]
*  maybe you can mask out the last bit. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=540.0s)]
*  So you can maybe have someone's [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=542.0s)]
*  health records over 30 years and train on [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=544.0s)]
*  that, except for the last five years, and [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=546.0s)]
*  see if you can predict the last [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=548.0s)]
*  five from the first 25. And [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=550.0s)]
*  once it gets really good at that, you can take [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=552.0s)]
*  my records and say, hey, look, Vijay, [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=554.0s)]
*  you don't do anything. This is where you're going [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=556.0s)]
*  to be. And we have 99% [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=558.0s)]
*  confidence on this. That would be pretty chilling. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=560.0s)]
*  Yeah. Well, you're exactly [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=562.0s)]
*  right, because the pinpointing [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=564.0s)]
*  here about the timing [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=566.0s)]
*  is so extraordinary. For example, [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=568.0s)]
*  with Alzheimer's, you get a p-tau [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=570.0s)]
*  217. It's modifiable [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=572.0s)]
*  by lifestyle. You check [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=574.0s)]
*  it again in six months or a [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=576.0s)]
*  year. Now you have two data points. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=578.0s)]
*  And you can say, [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=580.0s)]
*  with all the other data [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=582.0s)]
*  that's available, when you're going to [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=584.0s)]
*  see 18 years from now, [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=586.0s)]
*  12 years, four years, mild [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=588.0s)]
*  cognitive impairment, unless these [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=590.0s)]
*  steps are taken. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=592.0s)]
*  This was fully dependent on AI, [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=594.0s)]
*  on models that can [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=596.0s)]
*  just take all this data. If we [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=598.0s)]
*  didn't have the science of aging [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=600.0s)]
*  and the AI, [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=602.0s)]
*  we'd be nowhere. We wouldn't be talking [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=604.0s)]
*  about this today. I wouldn't have written a book. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=606.0s)]
*  Well, it's important for people not familiar [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=608.0s)]
*  with the term of healthspan. That's basically [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=610.0s)]
*  not just lifespan, but how long you can be healthy. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=612.0s)]
*  Yeah. I don't think we really want to [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=614.0s)]
*  get to some age and be [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=616.0s)]
*  demented or compromised. What [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=618.0s)]
*  we're talking about is, if you don't have [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=620.0s)]
*  heart disease, cancer, [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=622.0s)]
*  or neurodegenerative, you're [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=624.0s)]
*  pretty darn intact. You may have some [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=626.0s)]
*  achy joints and other matters, [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=628.0s)]
*  but those are the things that really [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=630.0s)]
*  interrupt [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=632.0s)]
*  and our healthspan. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=634.0s)]
*  Maybe let's turn to another [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=636.0s)]
*  aspect of it, which is the chronic disease aspect. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=638.0s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, when we're talking about chronic disease, [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=640.0s)]
*  we're talking typically about diabetes, [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=642.0s)]
*  diabetes, heart disease, [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=644.0s)]
*  cancer. How do we start to make [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=646.0s)]
*  an impact on that? I don't know if you want to pick one, [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=648.0s)]
*  if you want to start with cancer. I think we can [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=650.0s)]
*  make a huge impact on cancer because we have [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=652.0s)]
*  just simple polygenic risk scores [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=654.0s)]
*  for all the common cancers. That's [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=656.0s)]
*  like one layer of data to say you're at higher [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=658.0s)]
*  risk. And we have [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=660.0s)]
*  multi-cancer early detection [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=662.0s)]
*  tests that can pick up [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=664.0s)]
*  microscopic cancer. Why people [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=666.0s)]
*  would get a total body MRI [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=668.0s)]
*  when you could find microscopic cancer, [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=670.0s)]
*  but it's not a mass on an MRI, [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=672.0s)]
*  which may or may not be cancer. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=674.0s)]
*  So we have some tools for cancer, [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=676.0s)]
*  but the one thing that I [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=678.0s)]
*  think is unanticipated [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=680.0s)]
*  is the [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=682.0s)]
*  GLIP-1 drugs. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=684.0s)]
*  The ozempic, [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=686.0s)]
*  you know, Zep-bound world, [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=688.0s)]
*  it's the most [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=690.0s)]
*  momentous drug class in medical history. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=692.0s)]
*  And we've only seen [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=694.0s)]
*  part of the story so far. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=696.0s)]
*  You know, in the book I write about how [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=698.0s)]
*  it took 20 years to figure out that [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=700.0s)]
*  it wasn't just about diabetes, which is amazing. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=702.0s)]
*  What if we had [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=704.0s)]
*  an AI today [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=706.0s)]
*  and said should we test it for obesity? [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=708.0s)]
*  Because the [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=710.0s)]
*  developers, Novo Nordisk and [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=712.0s)]
*  later Lilly of these drugs, [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=714.0s)]
*  they only saw three or four [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=716.0s)]
*  pounds that people with [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=718.0s)]
*  type 2 diabetes would lose with these drugs. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=720.0s)]
*  And this woman [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=722.0s)]
*  in Norway, scientist [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=724.0s)]
*  Lotte Knudsen, she [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=726.0s)]
*  kept pushing, we've got to try it [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=728.0s)]
*  in obesity. And they wouldn't listen [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=730.0s)]
*  to her because, well, she's a diabetic, [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=732.0s)]
*  so we're not losing weight. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=734.0s)]
*  They finally did it and everyone knows [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=736.0s)]
*  the story, 20, 30, 50, 80 [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=738.0s)]
*  pounds of weight loss. Now, when [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=740.0s)]
*  you lose that much weight for people who [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=742.0s)]
*  are obese, [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=744.0s)]
*  you reduce the risk of cancer, [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=746.0s)]
*  you reduce the risk of [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=748.0s)]
*  heart disease and [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=750.0s)]
*  neurodegenerative disease. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=752.0s)]
*  It wouldn't be surprising to me that [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=754.0s)]
*  now with pills that are [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=756.0s)]
*  remarkably effective [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=758.0s)]
*  to substitute for injections [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=760.0s)]
*  that can be much less expensively [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=762.0s)]
*  that a large [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=764.0s)]
*  proportion of the population [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=766.0s)]
*  would be taking one of these drugs [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=768.0s)]
*  or even their successors, [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=770.0s)]
*  that is those that are even more [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=772.0s)]
*  potent and potentially [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=774.0s)]
*  with less side effects. So [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=776.0s)]
*  we have a drug class now [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=778.0s)]
*  added to Lifestyle Factory we didn't have [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=780.0s)]
*  before. As you know, [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=782.0s)]
*  they are in big trials for preventing [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=784.0s)]
*  Alzheimer's in people [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=786.0s)]
*  who are not overweight. Yes. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=788.0s)]
*  We're going to be doing a long COVID trial [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=790.0s)]
*  in people who are not overweight. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=792.0s)]
*  The effects are [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=794.0s)]
*  really quite extraordinary. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=796.0s)]
*  The ability to crack obesity. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=798.0s)]
*  We would have been happy just to do that. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=800.0s)]
*  But all the other things that are coming from [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=802.0s)]
*  it, who would have thought that you could [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=804.0s)]
*  treat, prevent addiction? Yeah, that's [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=806.0s)]
*  remarkable. Yeah. So [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=808.0s)]
*  some of the secrets of the gut-brain [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=810.0s)]
*  axis, which [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=812.0s)]
*  is tied into the immune system [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=814.0s)]
*  and it's tied into the science of [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=816.0s)]
*  aging. This is what's given us [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=818.0s)]
*  this newfound potential to change. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=820.0s)]
*  We don't have to only rely on [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=822.0s)]
*  drugs. But there's [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=824.0s)]
*  this, as we discussed, this kind of interdependence. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=826.0s)]
*  Well, and I think having [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=828.0s)]
*  lifestyle infrastructure with these [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=830.0s)]
*  drugs, that combination is particularly interesting. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=832.0s)]
*  Because you can make sure that you can lose [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=834.0s)]
*  weight while keeping muscle. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=836.0s)]
*  And also, hopefully [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=838.0s)]
*  patients can go off the drugs, [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=840.0s)]
*  at least for some periods of time, [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=842.0s)]
*  and not rebound. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=844.0s)]
*  We don't have encouraging data at the moment [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=846.0s)]
*  because at least half of people [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=848.0s)]
*  gain weight back when they stop. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=850.0s)]
*  And that's not good. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=852.0s)]
*  But I do think that we'll come up with a way [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=854.0s)]
*  to hopefully [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=856.0s)]
*  not rely on such [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=858.0s)]
*  a long-term commitment. The results [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=860.0s)]
*  on [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=862.0s)]
*  muscle mass, [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=864.0s)]
*  we've been very worried about that. And I think [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=866.0s)]
*  when people combine taking the drugs [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=868.0s)]
*  with strength training, [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=870.0s)]
*  and we do know there's muscle [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=872.0s)]
*  mass loss just with weight alone. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=874.0s)]
*  But that looks encouraging, [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=876.0s)]
*  even though the companies have been acquiring [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=878.0s)]
*  muscle-making drugs. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=880.0s)]
*  That may not prove to be [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=882.0s)]
*  particularly necessary. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=884.0s)]
*  And so what else would you put into [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=886.0s)]
*  the chronic bucket? I think one of the things [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=888.0s)]
*  that you've written about is AI [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=890.0s)]
*  plus all the things you can track. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=892.0s)]
*  Yeah, I think the ability [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=894.0s)]
*  to look at [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=896.0s)]
*  the organ clocks, [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=898.0s)]
*  which was initially reported [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=900.0s)]
*  here at Stanford by [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=902.0s)]
*  Tony Wis-Corey and his colleagues, [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=904.0s)]
*  and now validated and replicated [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=906.0s)]
*  by multiple groups. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=908.0s)]
*  The fact that we can do that [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=910.0s)]
*  and have the brain, [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=912.0s)]
*  the heart, the immune system, [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=914.0s)]
*  and other vital organs, and we [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=916.0s)]
*  can say [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=918.0s)]
*  this one organ of yours [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=920.0s)]
*  is five years at a [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=922.0s)]
*  pace with your real age. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=924.0s)]
*  Then we can integrate that with these other [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=926.0s)]
*  layers of data. Oh, if [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=928.0s)]
*  that's the case, what about your [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=930.0s)]
*  polygenic risk score? Is there [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=932.0s)]
*  anything pointing to that [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=934.0s)]
*  disease or organ? We can look [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=936.0s)]
*  at your whole body aging, [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=938.0s)]
*  epigenetic Horvath [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=940.0s)]
*  clock. We can also look [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=942.0s)]
*  at specific proteins, like for example, [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=944.0s)]
*  for the brain, PTAO [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=946.0s)]
*  217. And what's amazing [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=948.0s)]
*  about that protein, [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=950.0s)]
*  which we can get now, and it's not [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=952.0s)]
*  that expensive, but that in itself [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=954.0s)]
*  gives us over a 20 [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=956.0s)]
*  year warning about mild [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=958.0s)]
*  cognitive impairment. It's [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=960.0s)]
*  modifiable by exercise [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=962.0s)]
*  and lifestyle. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=964.0s)]
*  We've seen people in studies [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=966.0s)]
*  that drop more than 50 percent, [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=968.0s)]
*  even up to 80 percent. It's [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=970.0s)]
*  intriguing that it's not binary too, so you [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=972.0s)]
*  can track the gradient. Exactly. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=974.0s)]
*  And that would get particularly scary if it's [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=976.0s)]
*  increasing. So we're talking about people [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=978.0s)]
*  without symptoms but are at high [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=980.0s)]
*  risk having this [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=982.0s)]
*  access. I don't recommend any [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=984.0s)]
*  of these things that we're talking about until [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=986.0s)]
*  you know you have an increased risk. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=988.0s)]
*  But once you do, then you [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=990.0s)]
*  say, hmm, I can do something about [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=992.0s)]
*  it and change [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=994.0s)]
*  the course of what otherwise would be [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=996.0s)]
*  that person's natural history. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=998.0s)]
*  But the molecular clock, [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=1000.0s)]
*  this collection of proteins, [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=1002.0s)]
*  this is something else that's [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=1004.0s)]
*  striking. The O-link [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=1006.0s)]
*  and Somologic, [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=1008.0s)]
*  they're between six and [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=1010.0s)]
*  11,000 plasma proteins. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=1012.0s)]
*  What we've learned from them, [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=1014.0s)]
*  the fact that there's three bursts of aging [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=1016.0s)]
*  during our life is not just a linear [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=1018.0s)]
*  story, and the fact that [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=1020.0s)]
*  we're learning about the underpinnings [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=1022.0s)]
*  of diseases, but most importantly, [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=1024.0s)]
*  we have these organ clocks [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=1026.0s)]
*  that are inexpensive to get. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=1028.0s)]
*  When you start having genes and proteins [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=1030.0s)]
*  and these other layers of data, that's [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=1032.0s)]
*  when you find out what is making [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=1034.0s)]
*  us unique and what we are [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=1036.0s)]
*  at risk for during [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=1038.0s)]
*  our extended time. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=1040.0s)]
*  And therefore what we should do [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=1042.0s)]
*  to change it and improve it. Yeah. There are a lot of [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=1044.0s)]
*  enemies of the future. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=1046.0s)]
*  And maybe [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=1048.0s)]
*  a nicer way to put it is that [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=1050.0s)]
*  people could be skeptical. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=1052.0s)]
*  Yeah. And they're used to [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=1054.0s)]
*  operating a certain way, and [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=1056.0s)]
*  they have a certain belief that this isn't [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=1058.0s)]
*  going to work for whatever reason. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=1060.0s)]
*  What would you tell them, like to your fellow [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=1062.0s)]
*  clinical colleagues, to try to [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=1064.0s)]
*  change their mindset from a sick care [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=1066.0s)]
*  mindset to a preventative mindset? Yeah. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=1068.0s)]
*  To me, it's all about compelling data. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=1070.0s)]
*  So for example, [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=1072.0s)]
*  the Alzheimer's drugs, which don't really [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=1074.0s)]
*  work, and they're very risky, [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=1076.0s)]
*  but the reason they were bought [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=1078.0s)]
*  into by the FDA [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=1080.0s)]
*  ultimately was because [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=1082.0s)]
*  the amyloid came out on the scans. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=1084.0s)]
*  And they were a little bit incognitive [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=1086.0s)]
*  score improvement. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=1088.0s)]
*  But here we have things that are [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=1090.0s)]
*  metrics that are extraordinary [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=1092.0s)]
*  to help us [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=1094.0s)]
*  as a bridge for compelling [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=1096.0s)]
*  evidence. Ultimately, you want to say [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=1098.0s)]
*  we prevented these diseases in [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=1100.0s)]
*  people that had definition [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=1102.0s)]
*  of their risk, and then [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=1104.0s)]
*  active surveillance, [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=1106.0s)]
*  preventive, pull out [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=1108.0s)]
*  all the stops. For example, [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=1110.0s)]
*  speaking about waste, [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=1112.0s)]
*  we do mass screening for [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=1114.0s)]
*  cancer. We treat [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=1116.0s)]
*  everyone as the same [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=1118.0s)]
*  based on their age. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=1120.0s)]
*  And that's the only criterion for [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=1122.0s)]
*  screening, age. We only [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=1124.0s)]
*  pick up 14% of cancers [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=1126.0s)]
*  from that mass screening, which costs [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=1128.0s)]
*  over hundreds of [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=1130.0s)]
*  billions of dollars a year. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=1132.0s)]
*  Now, what about [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=1134.0s)]
*  only 88% of women will [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=1136.0s)]
*  never have breast cancer? [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=1138.0s)]
*  Why do 100% of women [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=1140.0s)]
*  have to go through this? And especially with [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=1142.0s)]
*  Bayes' rule, you could actually use [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=1144.0s)]
*  priors that you could measure. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=1146.0s)]
*  And we don't do it. And that's [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=1148.0s)]
*  a corollary of what we're talking [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=1150.0s)]
*  about. Why don't we take [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=1152.0s)]
*  the risk profile and say, [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=1154.0s)]
*  you know what, to a woman [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=1156.0s)]
*  or for a person having colonoscopy, [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=1158.0s)]
*  you don't really [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=1160.0s)]
*  ever have to have it, or you can have this [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=1162.0s)]
*  once in your lifetime [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=1164.0s)]
*  or twice, whatever. We don't [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=1166.0s)]
*  treat people as human [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=1168.0s)]
*  beings with particular [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=1170.0s)]
*  aspects that we can [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=1172.0s)]
*  define today. We're [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=1174.0s)]
*  drained in stupidity. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=1176.0s)]
*  I mean, maybe [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=1178.0s)]
*  when these mass screening programs [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=1180.0s)]
*  started, that was [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=1182.0s)]
*  the best we could do. But we've [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=1184.0s)]
*  known about polygenic risk scores, and we [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=1186.0s)]
*  learn now about all these other ways [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=1188.0s)]
*  to assess risk, and then with [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=1190.0s)]
*  added on the AI [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=1192.0s)]
*  part of it, [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=1194.0s)]
*  we have to do better. But [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=1196.0s)]
*  just having the [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=1198.0s)]
*  screening part cleaned up would [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=1200.0s)]
*  save a tremendous amount of money. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=1202.0s)]
*  So let's maybe shift gears [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=1204.0s)]
*  and talk about the future. So [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=1206.0s)]
*  what do you think, let's [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=1208.0s)]
*  assume things work out well. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=1210.0s)]
*  That people... [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=1212.0s)]
*  What is the best [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=1214.0s)]
*  case scenario that you think is plausible? [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=1216.0s)]
*  Like, what's the science that's coming [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=1218.0s)]
*  up horizon? Let's say we all decide [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=1220.0s)]
*  to make this shift towards prevention [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=1222.0s)]
*  and chronic. What [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=1224.0s)]
*  do you think we will get for it in [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=1226.0s)]
*  our next five to ten years? Well, [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=1228.0s)]
*  I mean, I think we'll start to see [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=1230.0s)]
*  that people are eventually [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=1232.0s)]
*  getting to much older ages than [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=1234.0s)]
*  we are now without these [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=1236.0s)]
*  three major diseases. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=1238.0s)]
*  I think that's a gradual [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=1240.0s)]
*  thing. It's not like we're going to see a light [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=1242.0s)]
*  switch here, but that's what [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=1244.0s)]
*  will be the trend. And we will see [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MueFKX906aI&t=1246.0s)]
