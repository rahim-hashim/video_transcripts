# The Electrification of Everything: From Sky to Sea
**The a16z Podcast:** [June 12, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA)
*  The first electric cars can be traced back to as early as the 1830s, flash forward to 1900, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=0.0s)]
*  and astonishingly, electric cars make up about a third of the cars on the road. But electric [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=7.6000000000000005s)]
*  vehicles that were once leaders of innovation became a faint echo of the past, overshadowed [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=13.6s)]
*  by their gas guzzling competitors. But what caused this radical shift? What happened between then and [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=19.36s)]
*  today that caused the electric car to lose its charge? How did the electric vehicle go from a [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=24.96s)]
*  third of the market to a fraction of a percent a century later? Luckily, electric vehicles are [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=31.12s)]
*  making a triumphant comeback due to decades of innovation. And as we embark on this resurgence [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=37.04s)]
*  of electrification, we are seeing this investment impact more than just the automotive market. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=42.88s)]
*  We're seeing the electrification of planes, boats, school buses, even cargo ships. Joining [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=48.32s)]
*  us today are Gregory Davis, CEO of Aviation Planes, Mitch Lee, co-founder and CEO of ARC Boats, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=54.0s)]
*  and Duncan McIntyre, founder and CEO of Highland Electric Fleets. So we've got planes, boats, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=60.56s)]
*  and buses, and together we discuss the breakthroughs that have set us on this path, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=66.88s)]
*  but also what can and can't be applied to these new applications, cost curves, and moats. And by [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=71.52s)]
*  the way, if you don't think this will happen quickly enough, I'd like to point you towards two [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=76.96000000000001s)]
*  pictures taken on Fifth Avenue on Easter morning. These pictures were taken 13 years apart, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=81.28s)]
*  the first in 1900, and it looks like a Waldo puzzle where you're actually trying to spot the car [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=87.2s)]
*  amongst the sea of horses. But just 13 years later in 1913, spot the car really turns into spot the [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=92.32000000000001s)]
*  horse, where you see one horse amongst a sea of cars. And I think this is just a testament to [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=99.68s)]
*  just how quickly technology can change things. So buckle up, folks. Welcome to the electrification [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=105.84s)]
*  of everything. As a reminder, the content here is for informational purposes only, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=112.56s)]

*  a16z.com slash disclosures. I am so excited about this conversation because I think many people are [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=139.04s)]
*  familiar with the electrification of passenger vehicles, right? Some of the biggest companies [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=155.35999999999999s)]
*  in the world now are tackling this and have been tackling it for many years. But I guess as a [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=160.56s)]
*  carryover from that industry, we're seeing the electrification of many more things, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=167.84s)]
*  which I think people are maybe a little less familiar with. And so I'd love to hear from each [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=172.48s)]
*  of your perspectives, what got you into this industry? What got you fixated on this idea [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=177.36s)]
*  that you needed to electrify a new industry? And so why don't we just kick things off with you, Greg? [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=183.04s)]
*  Thanks very much for the question. I mean, the idea of electrification in aircraft has been around [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=188.64s)]
*  for quite a while. But my involvement in this actually went back to something I was doing [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=193.27999999999997s)]
*  in about 2017, 2018, looking at ways to see how the new technology, the new engine technology that [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=199.11999999999998s)]
*  was being developed could be used to reduce the carbon input impact of the aircraft. The sustainable [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=205.44s)]
*  aviation industry is still quite young, but it's being born out of the fact that we know we need [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=209.83999999999997s)]
*  to do something about it. So what I mean is that right now, aviation contributes about 3% of all [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=216.24s)]
*  world CO2 emissions. But our own industry projections are that by 2050, that's going to [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=223.04000000000002s)]
*  be anywhere up to 50% of all CO2 emissions everywhere. And it's because that technology [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=228.08s)]
*  evolution hasn't happened in the aerospace industry the way that it has in, say, for instance, [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=233.60000000000002s)]
*  the automotive industry and some of the other great industries that we're going to be discussing [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=238.96s)]
*  today. And I absolutely love aircraft. I think it's so important from an economic and from a [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=243.12s)]
*  social perspective that we can continue to connect communities, but we can't do it while we're harming [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=250.32s)]
*  the environment. And what really attracted me to aviation and this opportunity that's here right [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=255.28s)]
*  now, what we're specifically working on, we have an aircraft that's going to be able to really change [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=260.4s)]
*  the way that we fly. The cost efficiencies of operating on electric power, the noise reduction [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=265.12s)]
*  from having the new engine technology that we've got, again, that elimination of carbon [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=271.76s)]
*  pollution makes it cost effective, convenient, and also carbon free to connect communities. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=276.48s)]
*  I just find that very exciting. I love that because I think maybe one aspect that people [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=285.03999999999996s)]
*  pay attention to for good reason is just is it electric or not. But what you're pointing at is [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=289.84s)]
*  that electrifying an industry or a product also has other ramifications, like you said, noise [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=295.59999999999997s)]
*  pollution could also be the ability to move that energy back into the grid and in other ways. And [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=301.36s)]
*  so Duncan, you're working on school buses, which is a whole other industry. And so tell me a little [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=307.52000000000004s)]
*  bit more about how you decided to venture into this space. Sure. I think Greg hit on one thing [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=312.48s)]
*  that's near and dear to me, which is noise pollution. When I think of electrification, [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=320.64s)]
*  I think of it as an upgrade all around. Maybe a third to half of the folks that we engage with [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=326.24s)]
*  commercially are interested in talking about climate change and CO2. But more than half of them, [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=332.40000000000003s)]
*  if you start the conversation that way, the conversation's over. But if we can frame it [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=339.28000000000003s)]
*  in a different way around being an upgrade, they're cheaper to operate, cheaper to fuel, [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=344.16s)]
*  fewer moving parts, they're cheaper to maintain. They are very quiet. They help attack poor air [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=350.0s)]
*  quality in urban areas. Transportation is local. No matter how you slice it, it's a local dynamic. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=359.84s)]
*  Local politicians are awarded their seats or rejected from their seats based on topics like [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=367.28s)]
*  this. And so you have to get into the local side of it to win. But more than anything, I think, [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=374.96s)]
*  Tesla inspired us all to look at the EV as technology that's here now. And it's not only [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=382.56s)]
*  here, but in many cases, it's better. It's an upgrade. It took the market a little while before [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=391.59999999999997s)]
*  the product was developed to do medium and heavy duty. And we're there now. Companies like Daimler [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=397.91999999999996s)]
*  are producing medium and heavy duty platforms, electrified platforms. And so we started Highland [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=405.12s)]
*  focused on the school bus market because we saw the demand. And we also saw the duty cycle as [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=411.59999999999997s)]
*  being really appropriate for what electrification had to offer. But we're entering the trash hauling [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=417.2s)]
*  space. And we're getting into basically any form of municipal and government operated vehicle [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=425.28s)]
*  that tend to operate in a fleet format. And so for us, it's about making sure that it's reliable [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=432.8s)]
*  and affordable. And our product suite stitches together the capital infrastructure, the services [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=439.84000000000003s)]
*  needed. And I think about it as 12 to 15 small businesses that have to be stitched together and [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=446.08000000000004s)]
*  completely seamless to the customer. And when that's done at scale, it's not only affordable, [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=452.8s)]
*  it's just cheaper for cities to run electrified fleets. So we're really excited about it. And I [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=458.8s)]
*  saw that opportunity to innovate around business models and drive commercial adoption. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=465.44s)]
*  Right. To make it a no brainer. Again, not just the electrification, but to just make it the obvious [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=471.68s)]
*  answer. Mitch, you're tackling boats, which is again, like a totally different line of products, [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=476.8s)]
*  but maybe with some parallels. And so we'd love to hear how you got into that. And as both Greg and [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=483.04s)]
*  Duncan have mentioned, it feels like you can almost piggyback off of the automotive industry [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=488.48s)]
*  or the strides that have been made there. And so tell me about how that has maybe also applied to [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=495.20000000000005s)]
*  boats. Yeah, so I come at this from a very personal level. I grew up on boats. My parents were huge [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=500.0s)]
*  water skiers. And I grew up as somebody that loved being out behind a boat on a kneeboard and water [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=507.6s)]
*  skis and wakeboarding and eventually surfing and inner tubing and just enjoying the water with [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=516.0s)]
*  friends. But gas boats are so much fun to be on and an absolute nightmare to own and awful for [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=520.56s)]
*  the environment, particularly when it comes to not just air pollution, but water and noise [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=528.56s)]
*  pollution. Electric boats are just better boats and they make a ton of sense. I like to think that [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=534.08s)]
*  or say that in the auto industry, gas cars were actually pretty good at what they did. They're [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=540.8s)]
*  quiet. They're reliable. They have relatively good fuel efficiency. Electric cars are still an [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=547.6800000000001s)]
*  upgrade. But when you look at the boating industry, the pain point of boat ownership is so much more [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=553.76s)]
*  visceral. These are boats that are stuck in the 1980s technology. They're basically like oversized [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=560.32s)]
*  gas lawnmowers. They're loud. They're noxious. They are unreliable. They run out of gas on you. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=567.2s)]
*  And when you compare that to what you get in an electric package, it's such a better [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=574.6400000000001s)]
*  experience. Reliability goes way up. You can enjoy conversations on the boat when it's whisper quiet. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=579.76s)]
*  The torque that you get pulling somebody out of the water is better. Even the experience of [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=589.2800000000001s)]
*  refueling gets to be so much better because boats are kind of a point A to point A sort of vehicle. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=594.96s)]
*  So that makes charging a lot more tractable. Electric boats are a very obvious idea [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=602.32s)]
*  and a huge improvement from a customer perspective. The hard part is the execution of this. They're so [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=607.84s)]
*  power hungry. And that's where we have really benefited from hundreds of billions of dollars [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=612.96s)]
*  that have gone into research and development in the auto industry and the supply chains and the [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=618.6400000000001s)]
*  battery technology that's powering the auto industry that has suddenly enabled us to go [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=624.32s)]
*  tackle the marine industry, which might not by itself have been able to support that volume of [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=629.6800000000001s)]
*  research and development. And that's what gets us really excited because [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=634.64s)]
*  what we're doing today was not possible five years ago. But what we're doing today is also [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=638.8000000000001s)]
*  such a better product experience compared to what exists today in the market. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=645.12s)]
*  On this idea of borrowing from the auto industry, I'd love to hear from all three of you what [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=649.76s)]
*  aspects were really easy to port over where you could say, look, this innovation has been worked [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=655.3599999999999s)]
*  on for a long time and I can kind of copy and paste it to my industry. But then also what [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=661.52s)]
*  required you to create something net new because it is a different product line. There are different [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=667.92s)]
*  considerations, whether it's being on the water or having to be in the air or having additional [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=673.76s)]
*  redundancy because you're in the air. And so I'll just kind of leave this open to the group. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=679.52s)]
*  What have you had to consider and reinvent versus what has again been able to be borrowed from the [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=684.7199999999999s)]
*  existing automotive industry? All the technology development around making the electrified power [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=691.5999999999999s)]
*  train super efficient. This is your electric motor connected to your batteries and all the [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=697.68s)]
*  high voltage systems that need to exist in the balance to make it work. And Mitch talked about [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=705.4399999999999s)]
*  reliability. Couldn't agree more. Electric is awesome because it is so reliable. That is an [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=711.1999999999999s)]
*  area that we probably all benefit from. It's just years and years and years of making it a super [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=716.8s)]
*  durable system. I would say for us, we had to create a ton of interoperability systems that we [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=721.68s)]
*  didn't expect we'd have to build. And what I mean by that is not all charging stations work with all [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=728.4799999999999s)]
*  vehicle types. There's firmware, there's other battery management software within your vehicle. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=734.0799999999999s)]
*  And then there's the utility. And if you think about creating a reliable ecosystem, all of us, [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=741.68s)]
*  Mitch said power hungry. They're really power hungry, right? Our depot in Bethesda, Maryland, [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=747.68s)]
*  draws five megawatts of power when we're charging. It's the largest electrified depot in the country [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=754.64s)]
*  running 200 school buses. And five megawatts is like five hospitals coming online overnight. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=759.68s)]
*  And so you need really advanced software that is managed in a way that we've never had to do [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=766.0799999999999s)]
*  in the past here in the States anyways. And that's interoperability between your chargers, [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=773.52s)]
*  your utility, your vehicles. And if you're going to make the experience, the overall experience [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=780.0s)]
*  reliable, the vehicles are reliable when they're out running. But if they're not reliable when [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=786.96s)]
*  they're charging, you have a major problem. And so that's maybe the biggest thing we've had to [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=791.92s)]
*  do far more creation around than I expected. I can maybe piggyback off of that specific [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=796.56s)]
*  power requirements. Boats are power hungry. And to give you some scale, recreational boats [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=803.76s)]
*  use more gallons per mile than a fully loaded semi truck. A fully loaded semi truck might get [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=810.72s)]
*  six to eight miles to the gallon. A boat gets one to two. The amount of energy you need to [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=817.12s)]
*  store on these boats is pretty large. The ARC-1 has two battery packs totaling 220 kilowatt hours [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=823.92s)]
*  of battery capacity, which for reference is well over twice the size of any car that you'd find on [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=831.36s)]
*  the market today, like a Model S or Model X. It's identical to what you put in a full size [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=839.6s)]
*  school bus that hauls 78 children around. Exactly. And so one of the biggest challenges is just [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=843.92s)]
*  packaging that much capacity and building battery packs at that size. And then on the boating side, [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=850.32s)]
*  and I'm curious to hear Greg's take on this, but on the boating side, we have a very high continuous [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=857.6800000000001s)]
*  power draw. So in the auto industry, what you see is your power demands kind of spike as you're [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=864.48s)]
*  accelerating zero to 60. That's where you draw a lot of power. Once you're up to 60 miles an hour, [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=870.96s)]
*  the continuous power draw tends to be much lower. Boats almost have the inverse curve where [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=876.32s)]
*  your power draw is, you don't necessarily have very high peak power because it's actually hard [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=883.12s)]
*  to put a lot of power into the water. You're limited by your propeller. Instead, what you have [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=888.56s)]
*  is very high continuous power because going 40 miles an hour through the water, which is viscous, [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=893.52s)]
*  is much harder to sustain that. And so that generates a lot of unique challenges for the [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=900.7199999999999s)]
*  marine industry or for our application of electric technology to the marine industry, [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=907.2s)]
*  particularly around how do you cool that when you're generating so much power and how do we [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=913.76s)]
*  make our motors tolerant to that amount of power draw? And again, Greg, I'm curious your take on [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=920.88s)]
*  this from the aviation side. Greg needs 20,000 times more power than we do to get a plane in the air. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=926.88s)]
*  The comparisons are really interesting. I think I'm going to start by highlighting a [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=931.76s)]
*  few differences just to lay it out there. Each of our battery systems is actually designed to [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=938.1600000000001s)]
*  different criteria. Where we've benefited from automotive is the advancement of the cells. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=943.6s)]
*  Right? So there's a definite benefit for improving the energy density or what we measure in watt [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=949.84s)]
*  hours per kilogram at the cell level. But the architecture of our systems is each one is going [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=955.76s)]
*  to be unique for each application. So I'll give you some practical examples of why that is. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=960.64s)]
*  When you're building a car or, Duncan, I get your opinion on this. And Mitch, actually, I think it'd [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=966.56s)]
*  be fun to sort of fact check here on air. But when you're building a car or ground-based vehicle, [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=972.72s)]
*  the typical consumer is involved in buying that car. And when they buy an electric car, they don't [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=979.04s)]
*  want to think about things like having to replace the batteries while they own the car. Right? You [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=984.16s)]
*  want the car to last through the entire time that you buy it. I would say my guess is that the [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=988.0s)]
*  marine industry is a little bit more forgiving than that. And the aerospace industry actually [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=992.96s)]
*  expects to have to maintain your aircraft. So when we're designing our batteries, we're actually [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=999.28s)]
*  designing them to a specific life cycle. And so the battery replacement, the quality of the [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=1004.0s)]
*  batteries in an aerospace application is obviously very, very high, but it's also governed by the [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=1011.12s)]
*  certification standards that we're going to have for the aircraft. Part of our advantage at [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=1017.84s)]
*  aviation is that our whole product, the premise is based on the fact that we're able to design [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=1022.5600000000001s)]
*  and certify an airplane using the existing standards. So we actually have a clear path [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=1027.3600000000001s)]
*  to certification. But we design our batteries to be replaced every 3,000 cycles, which given [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=1031.2s)]
*  our utilization is about every 3,000 hours. So that could be two years, three years, four years, [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=1037.6000000000001s)]
*  depending on how you're going to use the airplane. But the great thing is that the battery [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=1042.96s)]
*  technology continues to evolve. And so our architecture is designed so that it can actually [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=1047.44s)]
*  be, I'll say somewhat agnostic to the actual cells that are being used to provide the energy. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=1052.48s)]
*  So we can upgrade our battery every two, three, four years. So when you go in and you do a [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=1059.2s)]
*  mandatory maintenance activity, which is absolutely normal for an airplane, you actually end up [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=1064.3200000000002s)]
*  getting a better plane. I want to chime in there because I think it speaks to how different [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=1068.8s)]
*  the problems are for each of these industries. We have an entirely different scenario, which is [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=1074.0s)]
*  a big boating season is maybe 50, maybe 100 hours. We are the opposite of cycle constraint. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=1080.72s)]
*  You will never reach a point where you have out cycled the useful life of your battery, [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=1088.6399999999999s)]
*  because even with a ton of usage on that boat, it is nowhere near what you would see in an auto [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=1094.6399999999999s)]
*  industry or in the aviation industry. And, you know, I mean, one final thought is what we really [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=1101.68s)]
*  should get to as an industry is, you know, Gregory uses these batteries for two and a half years, [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=1107.1200000000001s)]
*  and they're no longer, you know, suited to the standards that you need. But they're perfectly [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=1114.0s)]
*  fine for me. They roll off and they're in applications that are less mission critical, [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=1120.0800000000002s)]
*  where they're still perfectly safe and they've got perfectly good life. That's ultimately a better [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=1125.68s)]
*  design than, you know, not to the extent that Mitch explained, but in our school bus fleets [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=1130.88s)]
*  are on the road 9% of the hours in a year and the other 91% of the time they're sitting idle. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=1137.1200000000001s)]
*  So they're actually relative relatively underutilized. On that note, I'd love to [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=1144.3200000000002s)]
*  hear from from especially you Duncan and Mitch, because these assets, actually, I guess the plane [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=1149.1200000000001s)]
*  is this is true for as well. But for some period of time, they're not being used, right? And [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=1154.88s)]
*  so that influences when you can charge how much you can charge. But also something that we're [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=1160.88s)]
*  seeing a lot more with even the passenger vehicles is the idea that some of this charge can go in [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=1165.7600000000002s)]
*  the reverse direction, getting more use out of the asset itself. And so we'd love to hear your [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=1170.24s)]
*  thoughts on, again, this idea that the electrification of these products is not just a gas to electric, [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=1176.8000000000002s)]
*  but it opens up this whole range of other potential opportunities. Yeah, look, it's a good [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=1185.1200000000001s)]
*  question. It's quarter our business model at Highland. And about half of our projects today [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=1190.24s)]
*  are backflowing power from our fleet of batteries to the grid when the grid needs the power the most. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=1196.4s)]
*  And we earn very we are in various amounts of money. But you know, in New England, as an example, [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=1202.72s)]
*  we earn about a third of our revenue, just from providing grid services. This is a it's a it's a [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=1208.96s)]
*  battery just like any other stationary battery. And it can be used to absorb high levels of [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=1216.64s)]
*  renewables production and help meet the grid's demand during the grid's peaks. And so it's a [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=1223.5200000000002s)]
*  it's a very interesting opportunity for frankly, all of us, all of our industries are power hungry. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=1232.0800000000002s)]
*  And if we charge at the wrong times, it's going to make operating the grid much, much more expensive. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=1239.2s)]
*  And so I think it's we see it as an issue that is getting solved, but too slowly. You know, [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=1245.36s)]
*  ultimately, the utilities and the wholesale energy markets, we think should develop better products [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=1251.4399999999998s)]
*  and then better better policies to to sort of really require that this activity is done smartly. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=1256.56s)]
*  Because if it's done in the right way, you know, you're going to flatten the load curve and drive [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=1263.1999999999998s)]
*  better efficiency in our distribution system and our generation systems, as opposed to the opposite. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=1268.9599999999998s)]
*  So we we come at this from the more localized customer perspective, you know, Duncan's coming [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=1274.48s)]
*  at it from the grid level, which is very exciting, because when you stack multiple [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=1280.4s)]
*  of these vehicles together, you quickly get into the megawatt hours of capacity. We think about it [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=1284.16s)]
*  from two perspectives. The first is the fact that, you know, a normal boat outing might be [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=1290.4s)]
*  four hours out on the water. What that translates to is 20 hours of downtime that you can then go [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=1297.04s)]
*  recharge before you would feasibly be using that boat again. And so it makes charging a much more [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=1305.2s)]
*  tractable problem where if a boat's at a dock, you have plenty of time for an overnight charge [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=1311.44s)]
*  before you use it again. You don't necessarily need fast charging to exist in order to have a [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=1316.8799999999999s)]
*  compelling electric boating experience. And then the second part is, yeah, that boat is sitting [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=1323.6s)]
*  in the off season when it's winter and it's too cold to go boating or, you know, even midweek when [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=1331.36s)]
*  you're working and not able to get it out. That's an opportunity to provide power back to your house. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=1338.1599999999999s)]
*  So again, not necessarily at the grid level, but that is a tremendous amount of battery capacity [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=1344.32s)]
*  that could power your house for a week without you doing any sort of finagling of electric loads. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=1350.08s)]
*  And that's exciting because it presents a whole bunch of opportunities to optimize your energy [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=1359.52s)]
*  consumption throughout a given week. It's funny, I was just talking to one of my board members, [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=1367.76s)]
*  a guy named John Mescalovitz, this is the exact same thing. And what we've just highlighted [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=1373.6s)]
*  collectively is how well this technology, the battery technology, electric technology, [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=1377.76s)]
*  integrates into the way that we actually use things. The primary and secondary uses of the [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=1382.56s)]
*  aircraft, each of us is looking at the charging network, right? So the infrastructure, but not [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=1386.96s)]
*  just at the infrastructure level, also at the actual vehicle interface level. And, you know, [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=1392.64s)]
*  certainly our discussions about the charging network absolutely include the idea of secondary [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=1398.08s)]
*  storage of energy. Typically speaking, the aircraft's going to fly, you know, morning to [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=1403.28s)]
*  evening. Cargo applications will be able to use it later in the evening, which isn't directly [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=1408.48s)]
*  related to batteries. It's actually related to the fact that the aircraft's so much quieter that [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=1414.48s)]
*  it's not going to be subject to noise restrictions. But when you look at the typical turnaround time [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=1418.8s)]
*  for an airplane, the aircraft, you know, you load passengers onto it, it takes off, it travels for [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=1424.24s)]
*  an hour, it lands. Then you offload the passengers and baggage and then repeat the cycle. That [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=1430.72s)]
*  turnaround time typically takes about half an hour. You can charge your batteries for one hour of [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=1436.8s)]
*  flying time in 30 minutes. And that's actually a fairly gentle charging cycle for a battery. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=1441.3600000000001s)]
*  So you could, I mean, you have the opportunity for using fast charge and megawatt chargers and [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=1447.92s)]
*  all this. And those will be part of our solution for some applications. But compared to some of [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=1451.92s)]
*  the more strenuous applications on batteries, we're actually being relatively gentle to what [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=1457.44s)]
*  we're doing with our batteries, even at the aircraft level. And that's actually, again, [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=1463.2s)]
*  very, very exciting. So, you know, with today's available energy levels, energy densities that [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=1467.8400000000001s)]
*  we can get from batteries with the projected efficiency gains that we're going to have as the [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=1472.24s)]
*  systems develop, you can actually take that technology that's very clearly in front of us [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=1476.3200000000002s)]
*  in the next two, three, four years and design it right into your product. It's a great fit. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=1481.68s)]
*  Yeah, Greg, will you provide charging solutions with the planes? I would imagine your business [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=1488.48s)]
*  model is to sell equipment to operators. Is that right? [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=1493.28s)]
*  But yeah, but you know, thanks for that. There's three parts of our business model. The first is [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=1496.5600000000002s)]
*  selling aircraft. It's again, very traditional for an aircraft manufacturer. The second is the [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=1499.92s)]
*  aftermarket support. So supporting those airplanes, parts services, training. Again, very, [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=1505.44s)]
*  very typical. And the third is actually the charging solution. And there's different [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=1510.88s)]
*  approaches to charging. There's different ways that you can do it. You can work with [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=1516.16s)]
*  directly with the airports, certainly the people who are buying planes from us right now, or [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=1520.0800000000002s)]
*  potentially leasing charging applications from us. And we're looking at charging in, [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=1524.88s)]
*  I'll call it two different ways. The first is, you know, a fixed charging location where you [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=1530.8000000000002s)]
*  tap it directly into the grid at the airport that you're going to be servicing your aircraft from. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=1536.08s)]
*  That works very well for maybe an operator that has their own terminal where you can reliably [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=1542.08s)]
*  park your airplane. But we're also looking at mobile charging. The idea of having a truck that's [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=1547.6799999999998s)]
*  specifically designed for charging Alice, our aircraft that has a battery bank on it, so that [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=1553.12s)]
*  you can, you know, again, quickly charge like, like, we call it an e-Bowser, a fuel Bowser. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=1557.9199999999998s)]
*  Maybe a school bus. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=1563.76s)]
*  You know, I will say the thought cross my mind. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=1565.6000000000001s)]
*  I'll tell you, we're in the middle of the same tech R&D. And that stuff is hard. It's going to [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=1569.5200000000002s)]
*  happen. And we're all going to get there. But we're going to power a concert, I won't say who, [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=1574.64s)]
*  but a big concert you would have grown up with them. Part of the concession, which is this big [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=1580.24s)]
*  part of it, we're going to be powering it with school buses in the fall. And so I'll send you [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=1585.68s)]
*  guys tickets. You'll have to come. Nice. Thank you. Great. I mean, on that note, I'd love to [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=1589.3600000000001s)]
*  hear from all three of you. And Greg, you've already touched on it for aviation. But I think [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=1593.92s)]
*  when people consider electric vehicles, let's just use Tesla as an example, they think, okay, [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=1598.0800000000002s)]
*  most of the revenue comes from the sale of the vehicle to the consumer. But also Tesla makes a [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=1603.92s)]
*  bunch of money through the software, right, that it sells to those consumers as well. And what the [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=1609.3600000000001s)]
*  three of you have pointed towards is that there are other business models here, right? So it could [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=1614.3200000000002s)]
*  be the energy moving back into the grid. But I'd love to hear how each of you are thinking about [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=1618.96s)]
*  the different business models that kind of ladder up to, again, a multimodal system for your company. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=1624.88s)]
*  And also where maybe if you're willing to share, you see the biggest opportunity, like where do you [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=1632.0s)]
*  do you see the largest revenue opportunity for your given space? The way we think about it is [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=1637.04s)]
*  we are delivering better boats. That's our goal. And everything that we are doing at the design [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=1644.0s)]
*  and manufacturing side is optimized around how do we deliver a better product to customers. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=1649.84s)]
*  One of the biggest pain points of boat ownership is the reliability and the maintenance burden. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=1655.76s)]
*  So we are at the design stage and again, through the manufacturing process, designing out a lot of [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=1661.2s)]
*  these maintenance burdens. An example is we have a closed loop cooling system on the ARC-1. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=1667.92s)]
*  It basically uses the hole itself as a heat sink to dissipate heat from the power train. [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=1673.28s)]
*  And that means we're not ingesting raw water and clogging up filters or having pumps break. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=1680.32s)]
*  Software is also a way to make that experience better. Garmin sells off the shelf navigation [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=1687.28s)]
*  maps and that's a billion plus dollar business for them. We want to offer that for free to [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=1695.44s)]
*  customers as a way to incentivize adoption of the boats that we're selling, which is [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=1701.6s)]
*  still our core business. When we talk about providing backup power to your house, [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=1709.6799999999998s)]
*  there is a multi-billion dollar business for backup generators for people's house [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=1716.1599999999999s)]
*  that we want to go tackle by giving you a boat that you can use to back up your house. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=1721.04s)]
*  All of these are still in support of our core product, which is selling better boats to people [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=1727.6s)]
*  at, if customers put on earmuffs at very good margins. That's kind of the core business that [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=1734.08s)]
*  we think about. A lot of the investments we're making go back into driving sales around that [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=1743.84s)]
*  core business. I think I would generally echo some of those themes. I think the [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=1750.32s)]
*  the market has historically operated in a way such that OEMs are really good at making a product, [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=1757.76s)]
*  making a vehicle, whether it's a plane or a boat or a truck, whatever it is. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=1765.52s)]
*  But they tend not to be in the fleet operations business. They tend to sell it to an operator. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=1769.68s)]
*  That could be someone who buys a car who's just driving around town. It could be a waste hauling [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=1775.36s)]
*  business. It could be Delta. They're end users that tend to be fleet operators. The business [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=1782.96s)]
*  model opportunity that we see is to create more performance-based guarantees around these new [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=1789.76s)]
*  vehicle classes. There's a ton of perception out there that it's new tech and so it's not going to [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=1796.72s)]
*  be reliable. There's also a perception that what is this fuel cost? It's electricity. I don't really [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=1802.88s)]
*  understand it. My utility bill is very complicated. It's got all these line items that we don't really [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=1809.92s)]
*  understand. Core to our business model, which we're confident has accelerated adoption in our [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=1815.3600000000001s)]
*  category and driven the Highland business, is this concept of making it very simple and performance [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=1822.0800000000002s)]
*  based. We will often get paid by the mile. We might charge a customer $3.50 per mile and they [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=1828.0s)]
*  get all the equipment. They get all the services. If the charging station breaks and the bus isn't [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=1835.76s)]
*  charged, we just don't get paid. There's very much an alignment of incentives. Then I think [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=1841.84s)]
*  by making it performance based, we tend to own the assets and we can then bring on [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=1848.56s)]
*  downstream services to increase utilization. Elon Musk wrote a great article recently about [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=1856.56s)]
*  how he views autonomous electric vehicles as capable of taking utilization from [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=1863.6799999999998s)]
*  single digits up to 50, 60, 70 percent because all of a sudden you have autonomous vehicles [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=1871.28s)]
*  performing tasks and the utilization changes dramatically. We need fewer vehicles or we get [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=1877.12s)]
*  more done with the vehicles that we have. I believe that's a big opportunity. If you look at [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=1884.7199999999998s)]
*  garbage trucks, school buses, parks and rec vehicles, any vehicle out there that is not [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=1890.48s)]
*  long haul trucking and you have this dynamic where you can start to piece together other ways to make [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=1898.24s)]
*  money or make that asset useful and if you can deliver it as a service and make it easy for the [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=1905.68s)]
*  customer, I think that's where the market's going. That's really exciting. Just to [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=1911.1200000000001s)]
*  maybe tap onto the exact opposite end, I think there's an opportunity for people in the [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=1916.8s)]
*  infrastructure development business to actually go and start selling solutions to bringing [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=1922.8s)]
*  the right electrical services and layouts. It's almost like an urban planning exercise, [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=1927.76s)]
*  but to actually get the power lines, get the infrastructure set up for whether it's the [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=1933.44s)]
*  airport, the marina or the schoolyard or wherever you're going to do your charging. That's something [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=1939.6s)]
*  that I think we all share and right now I know that people come to me to ask where should I put [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=1944.72s)]
*  my charging station at my airport? How much capacity should it have? The fact that people [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=1951.2s)]
*  are coming to me as the aircraft manufacturer means that there's probably no place else for them to [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=1956.96s)]
*  go to get that information right now. I think there's an opportunity for somebody listening to [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=1960.96s)]
*  this who's looking to start a business to actually become an expert in doing that, [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=1965.04s)]
*  focus their attention on it and start delivering those solutions. [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=1969.36s)]
*  On the note of opportunity, it feels like there are still some challenges in the industry that [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=1973.36s)]
*  could be related to regulation. It could be related to the grid infrastructure that exists [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=1978.4799999999998s)]
*  and needs to be upgraded. It could be the battery technology. Mitch, something you mentioned is [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=1983.28s)]
*  potential fear around range anxiety depending on the product and its needed range or at least [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=1988.8s)]
*  what consumers think they need in terms of range. I'll just open it up to the group. [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=1996.24s)]
*  What gaps are there for people to tackle and what would you love to see people tackle? Greg, [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=2001.28s)]
*  I love that you've already mentioned one very clear opportunity but it feels like it's still [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=2006.3999999999999s)]
*  kind of open range in a way where there's a lot of work to do in the next few years. I'd love to [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=2010.7199999999998s)]
*  hear where the three of you are seeing the biggest opportunities perhaps. In terms of aircraft, [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=2016.4799999999998s)]
*  in the United States there are 5,000 airports. About 3,600 of them, you can have paved runways [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=2022.8s)]
*  and have aids. You can fly a small commuter aircraft like Alice from those runways as a [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=2028.6399999999999s)]
*  commercial operation. But we don't use 3,000 something airports that way. We use a couple [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=2034.48s)]
*  hundred airports with regular scheduled service. That's actually something that's changed over the [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=2040.72s)]
*  past 40 years. We used to be able to fly point to point much more often than we can. But the market, [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=2045.84s)]
*  after deregulation, the market went away. But even so, if you look at the breakdown of the [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=2051.28s)]
*  world's air travel, and it's very similar whether you're in North America or Europe, half of all [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=2058.6400000000003s)]
*  flights in the world are under 500 miles and a full 30% are 250 miles or less. Watch planes fly [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=2063.0400000000004s)]
*  by. There's a 30% chance that the plane that you're looking at is flying a flight of less than 250 [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=2073.2000000000003s)]
*  miles. The proposition, I think Mitch was mentioning this, I think we're on the same page on [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=2077.68s)]
*  this one. It's a very different thing. We're A to B, not necessarily A to A. But if you go back to [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=2083.2s)]
*  the whole culture around the automobile, when you get in your car, you want to be able to get in your [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=2089.52s)]
*  car and go wherever you want to go without any concerns. You go, it's an open road, it's freedom, [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=2094.3199999999997s)]
*  it's a great sensation. With an airplane, you want to take off from the airport, you wanted to take [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=2101.44s)]
*  off from, fly for exactly how long you wanted to fly, and then land at the airport that you wanted [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=2106.88s)]
*  to land at exactly when you wanted to get there. It's a very different prospect. There's a [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=2111.84s)]
*  wonderful marriage here between what the technology is available today in terms of what we can achieve [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=2117.52s)]
*  with range and payload for an aircraft and the way that people actually want to fly. [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=2123.04s)]
*  So, our plane today represents potentially 30% of the total market for aircraft if you look at it. [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=2129.68s)]
*  That's pretty outstanding. It's such a great point that there's this [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=2138.72s)]
*  marriage between the technology and how people are using this. I hadn't really thought about [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=2143.92s)]
*  the culture around how you approach plane flights, but that's so true. Before [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=2149.84s)]
*  the trip ever starts, know exactly where you're going, exactly the distance that you're going, [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=2156.8s)]
*  and so you can plan accordingly. If you get out on a gas boat today, it's stuck in the 1980s. [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=2160.4s)]
*  Your fuel gauge goes like this. They're super unreliable. Your speedometers don't work. [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=2167.04s)]
*  There's no odometer on boats. The state of the art in most cases is unscrewing the fuel tank [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=2173.92s)]
*  and looking in and guesstimating how many gallons of gas you have left and then using intuition to [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=2181.28s)]
*  think how far can I go on this many gallons. It is common to run out of gas on a gas boat. [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=2188.2400000000002s)]
*  I've done it personally at least a dozen times in my life. When you think about what you get [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=2196.88s)]
*  with an electric boat, suddenly you have down to the percent level precision on how much capacity [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=2202.88s)]
*  you have left on that. You have intelligent software that can tell you this is how far you [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=2210.72s)]
*  can go with that amount of battery capacity. Oh, by the way, something that's unique to boats is [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=2215.4399999999996s)]
*  if you're out in the middle of Lake Tahoe and you have 5% battery, you can reach any other point on [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=2221.8399999999997s)]
*  that lake as long as you're going five miles an hour. It's not a question of if you get back. It's [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=2227.6s)]
*  a question of how long it takes. That is something that's so novel and such a huge improvement from [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=2232.72s)]
*  a customer perspective over where things are at with the gas industry today. I guess going back [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=2241.6s)]
*  to the opportunities, I think about it in three tiers. There's plenty of these product opportunities. [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=2248.16s)]
*  We happen to be tackling the marine space and delivering much better boats to people that happen [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=2256.48s)]
*  to be electric. You could look across all these industries and find those opportunities where [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=2263.2799999999997s)]
*  the technology that exists today, the electric powertrain delivers a better and more compelling [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=2269.52s)]
*  experience to people. I think the three of us are all doing that. There's also supply chain [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=2276.88s)]
*  opportunities. We want our battery prices to be lower. We want our high voltage electrical [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=2282.4s)]
*  powertrain components to cost us less. That helps us a lot. I think there's a tremendous [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=2291.04s)]
*  number of opportunities at that base supply chain level. Then there's this third category of [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=2296.56s)]
*  what I call second order opportunities. You're going to have an electric future. Imagine what [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=2304.08s)]
*  that looks like while you're going to be towing around a bunch of electric boats in electric [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=2309.68s)]
*  trucks or you're going to be towing around an RV in an electric truck. What does that mean in terms [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=2314.7999999999997s)]
*  of the new charging infrastructure you need to go support that or the new technology you need to go [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=2319.3599999999997s)]
*  make that happen? Maybe it's powered trailers that can actually help the vehicle. There's [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=2325.9199999999996s)]
*  just a ton of opportunities. If you cast your mind forward a few years and think about what [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=2332.9599999999996s)]
*  are the new problems that are going to exist when all these kind of like the marine industry is [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=2339.9199999999996s)]
*  going electric and the aviation industry is going electric and the bus industry is going electric. [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=2345.52s)]
*  I think interoperability and industry standards is a challenge today. We've left it largely to [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=2351.52s)]
*  sort of standards making traditional industry associations to drive standards. [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=2360.0s)]
*  In my opinion, it's been too slow. We've done integrations with 15 to 20 utility companies in [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=2367.36s)]
*  the last 12 months. Every single one of them has been discrete and different. You just have to [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=2375.6s)]
*  put the right team on it to know how to navigate the system and get through to the other end. [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=2383.1200000000003s)]
*  Putting better standards in place would allow for what Mitch is describing. Your boat is charging [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=2388.32s)]
*  your house when the power grid is down or for four hours every afternoon when the grid is strained [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=2394.8s)]
*  and demand charges are kicking in or your trailer is charging your vehicle because it's got extra [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=2402.32s)]
*  power. That's all interoperability that needs standards. I would flag one other challenge. [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=2410.48s)]
*  Mitch mentioned it, but it is one of our greatest pain points, which is supply chains. [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=2415.92s)]
*  It's not just about getting the sell cost down so we can deliver cheaper product. It's being able [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=2420.96s)]
*  to deliver product full stop. The last couple of years have been really tough on supply chains. [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=2427.76s)]
*  It's led to soaring costs, but also just poor reliability. We're one of the largest buyers of [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=2434.0s)]
*  medium and heavy duty truck platforms in an electric format right now. We're talking [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=2443.68s)]
*  hundreds of millions of dollars per year of equipment purchases. We're not billions yet, [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=2449.7599999999998s)]
*  but we will be quite soon. Even as a large buyer, it's tough to get product. [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=2455.44s)]
*  You've got manufacturing sites that have thousands of completed vehicles and they are all short [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=2464.64s)]
*  an air compressor or they're all missing so they can't complete these vehicles and deliver [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=2470.96s)]
*  them to customers. We are buying switch gear 18 months in advance for projects we don't even [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=2476.48s)]
*  have in our contract yet because if we don't have switch gear, we're not getting the infrastructure [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=2485.44s)]
*  completed and we can't get up and running. We don't get paid. We're doing all these things that [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=2491.12s)]
*  we're solving problems that we shouldn't have to solve in my opinion. I think for some entrepreneurs, [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=2497.6s)]
*  there could be big opportunities in streamlining supply chains and creating better standards. [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=2504.48s)]
*  I heard a very creative description of the supply base over the past couple of years [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=2511.44s)]
*  and it was called the surprise chain. That's all you need to say. Perfect. [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=2515.68s)]
*  Okay, here's a timing for what we're doing. You look at the outlook on the aerospace industry [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=2522.2400000000002s)]
*  right now, in particular aircraft manufacturing. A lot of the major aircraft manufacturers have [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=2528.1600000000003s)]
*  already launched their next program. They're entering the service, they're delivering them. [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=2534.96s)]
*  If you take a look around at the large incumbent aircraft manufacturers, there's no new programs [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=2541.6000000000004s)]
*  on the docket right now. The tier one supply base and even the tier two and tier three supply [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=2549.04s)]
*  base, they're all hyper aware of what they're going to be working on. It gives us an opportunity [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=2556.32s)]
*  to show, hey, we've got an aircraft, we've got a market, we've got good orders. The utility of the [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=2562.24s)]
*  product is there. I think what's going to happen is that the new technologies that we're bringing [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=2566.8s)]
*  and our new products are actually going to garner the attention of the forward-looking supply chain. [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=2572.16s)]
*  I think we're going to disproportionately benefit us in the aviation industry, but I think the same [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=2577.52s)]
*  is probably broadly applicable. The new technologies, the new companies are actually going to benefit [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=2582.48s)]
*  from obtaining the focus of the established tier one, tier two supply base. I don't want to say [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=2587.7599999999998s)]
*  the problems are behind us yet, but I think the outlook is actually quite sunshiny. [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=2593.04s)]
*  I'm curious how you two think about this. I know for us, there are incredible advantages for bringing [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=2598.88s)]
*  the battery pack in-house, and that's why we vertically integrated our battery pack. It is [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=2605.76s)]
*  structurally integrated with the boat hull in the same way that electric cars didn't [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=2610.32s)]
*  become that compelling until you built the car around the powertrain under one roof. [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=2617.28s)]
*  I think the opportunity that I see at least is on some of the other atomic components that go into [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=2624.96s)]
*  a high-voltage electrical system. An example might be a DC-DC converter. When we started ARC, [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=2631.36s)]
*  there was one on the market and we did not have much choice. There are now 30 of those, [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=2638.08s)]
*  and that's exciting because you can use those across applications more so than you can just [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=2643.6800000000003s)]
*  drag and drop an entire battery pack. When I think about supply chains, it's actually at [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=2650.4s)]
*  some of those more atomic components. Connectors are a big one for us that have historically been [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=2656.3199999999997s)]
*  a nightmare. Those are examples of things that work across application and are not necessarily [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=2664.0s)]
*  so tailored to your application. I wouldn't necessarily encourage people to go after [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=2671.2799999999997s)]
*  building an entire battery pack and trying to make that battery pack work for both [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=2677.52s)]
*  boats and airplanes because that's going to be really hard. We have very different [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=2682.3199999999997s)]
*  objectives out of what we want from those battery packs, but you might be able to find [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=2686.72s)]
*  components that factor across those. I agree. You want ballast, right? You want the keel [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=2691.12s)]
*  and the ballast to be replaced by battery packs, I'm guessing. Yes. Yeah. We actually don't mind [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=2697.52s)]
*  weight on a boat. It allows you to throw a bigger wake and makes the boat more stable, so we're not [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=2702.72s)]
*  as weight constrained as some other people. Certainly for us, that's a prime example of [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=2708.24s)]
*  the difference in some of the design criteria that we've got in the aircraft side versus [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=2712.96s)]
*  the marine and land-based applications. What we've seen in terms of technology evolution is [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=2718.64s)]
*  talking to people, DC to DC converters is, by the way, the perfect example for a shareable component [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=2725.12s)]
*  that has an important role to play. I'd like to take it one step further, which is why do we need [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=2731.04s)]
*  the DC to DC converter? Why don't we just get the subsystems made to operate at the same 800-volt [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=2736.08s)]
*  system level as the rest of the equipment? We're seeing high-voltage applications of [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=2742.0s)]
*  traditionally lower-voltage electric components coming up. We've got environmental control systems [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=2748.24s)]
*  that operate at 800 volts now. Looking at other actuation and so on that operate at high voltage, [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=2752.4s)]
*  reduce your wire sizes, that's what we're pushing on. Yeah. Great point. I would love to see [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=2758.48s)]
*  some of these low-voltage components actually come up and support high-voltage ranges. That [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=2766.08s)]
*  would be awesome for us. Maybe as a follow-up question there, Mitch, you mentioned whether or [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=2771.04s)]
*  not you design your own battery packs. How do you think about, given that every single one of these [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=2777.44s)]
*  planes, boats, school buses have many components, how do you think about what is inherent to your [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=2782.88s)]
*  business and that you build on your own versus buying or borrowing? Then I guess tacking onto [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=2788.8s)]
*  that, what I really am trying to get to is this idea of what moats might arise in these industries. [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=2794.24s)]
*  I imagine, let me know if you guys disagree, but let's say 10, 20 years from now, we're going to [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=2802.16s)]
*  be seeing a lot of electric boats, a lot of electric school buses, a lot of electric planes. [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=2806.3999999999996s)]
*  Where does the differentiation come from? We're just over two years old and we are delivering [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=2812.0s)]
*  the most advanced electric boat in the world to paying customers. That's exciting. The way that [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=2817.2799999999997s)]
*  we've been able to do that is by leveraging a lot of the research and development that has gone into [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=2822.88s)]
*  the automotive industry over the past decade intelligently and apply it and adapt it to [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=2827.92s)]
*  the unique challenges in the marine industry. We're very careful to integrate the things that [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=2836.88s)]
*  become the platform for all future boats we develop and try to not integrate the things that [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=2844.1600000000003s)]
*  do not give us a unique advantage over time or that are more marginal improvements. [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=2850.88s)]
*  The battery packs are core to that moat and that's hard. It is hard to build your own battery packs. [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=2857.52s)]
*  When we talk about moat, we have an incredibly talented team. We have top talent from SpaceX [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=2863.76s)]
*  and Tesla and Rivian and other EV companies and marine companies and it still took us two years [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=2869.6s)]
*  of working around the clock to integrate those battery packs and get them production ready for [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=2876.16s)]
*  customers. I just was wondering, do you aspire to be in commercial boating applications or is the [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=2883.2s)]
*  business... Does all that IP you're describing, which sounds very cool, doesn't it all apply when [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=2892.48s)]
*  you get into ferries that may have predictable routes? Maybe not long-haul shipping, but I don't [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=2899.76s)]
*  know. Our aspirations are that everything on the water eventually becomes electric and the playbook [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=2905.6s)]
*  that we're taking is to start on the recreational side. What we're doing is building a strong brand. [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=2911.92s)]
*  We're building a technological moat. We are building an extremely talented engineering team [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=2917.36s)]
*  and along the way, we're driving down our cost of capital because boats are a very good business. [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=2925.68s)]
*  The more boats we produce, the more working capital that we have. Those are the ingredients [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=2931.12s)]
*  that ultimately set you up to more efficiently go after larger craft, which I'm not necessarily [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=2935.8399999999997s)]
*  ready to talk about that part. We have our hands full on the recreational side, but certainly there [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=2942.3199999999997s)]
*  are aspirations to go there. I heard yes. Thank you. We found the sweet spot for making an electric [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=2947.12s)]
*  plane. The size of the aircraft, it's a nine passenger aircraft. It's nine passengers on [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=2955.92s)]
*  purpose because in the United States, you can actually fly nine paying passengers with a single [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=2963.28s)]
*  pilot. We have two pilot seats, so you can also use that other pilot seat to train a new pilot, [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=2967.92s)]
*  which will help address the overall pilot shortage that we've got. We didn't do that in isolation. [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=2973.6s)]
*  We've come up with this approach based on interacting with real customers and figuring [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=2980.88s)]
*  out what they need and what the market needs. The other thing is we're building, it's an electric [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=2985.12s)]
*  airplane, but it's just an airplane. It's a part 23 commuter category aircraft. That means that [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=2988.72s)]
*  we're building it to be certified under the existing standards. The pilots who fly it will [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=2994.16s)]
*  be able to fly it with their existing pilot's licenses. They get trained the same way as they [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=2998.4s)]
*  would for any other aircraft that size. Likewise, the mechanics and people who operate the aircraft [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=3001.68s)]
*  on the ground maintain it. It's the same system that we've got today. It flies from existing [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=3006.96s)]
*  airports using the existing airspace. We've got this product that's being fit so that we don't [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=3011.44s)]
*  have to go and change the way that aircraft are certified. It's the other way around. What we're [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=3017.52s)]
*  able to do is say, look, we've developed an electric airplane that meets all of these standards. [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=3022.32s)]
*  Our plane meets the same standards as any other airplane in its category. To the point of mass [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=3027.76s)]
*  adoption, 100%, I firmly believe in the next 10 to 15 years, we will all be flying regularly [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=3033.76s)]
*  on electric airplanes. I have aspirations to get my pilot's license. One of the things that clicked [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=3041.5200000000004s)]
*  for me is the biggest risk to being a pilot and flying a Cessna is reliability of those vehicles. [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=3046.7200000000003s)]
*  The number of check downs that you have to do on an aircraft before it gets into the air, [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=3054.2400000000002s)]
*  in my mind, it makes a ton of sense. Electric aircraft make a ton of sense because you get that [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=3059.3599999999997s)]
*  extra reliability almost free that you're no longer worried about the whole class of problems [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=3064.96s)]
*  you worry about with mechanical engine failure on an aircraft. I am personally excited for that [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=3072.96s)]
*  future. I want to fly an electric plane. I aspire to visit Greg and have him take me for [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=3078.3199999999997s)]
*  a flight in his plane. You guys can all rotate. [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=3085.28s)]
*  I can ski a little bit. Awesome. Great. Steph, your question on differentiation. These guys [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=3095.44s)]
*  obviously have products that have had a ton of IP investment that's truly technical IP behind the [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=3102.2400000000002s)]
*  product. We're a really different business. We buy a finished product for the most part from [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=3111.12s)]
*  leading OEMs. The business model that we're running is really bundling and packaging of services [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=3117.3599999999997s)]
*  and financing. If you look at the big solar operators, companies like Sun Run and other [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=3125.92s)]
*  utility scale businesses, they drove commercial adoption. That's because they very elegantly [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=3135.76s)]
*  bundled and packaged a whole bunch of services with capital and they made it very easy for [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=3142.48s)]
*  customers to adopt. We're very much in that business. It's lots of little things from [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=3148.8s)]
*  training mechanics to training drivers to building a technology backbone that's scalable [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=3156.32s)]
*  so that we can actually operate these fleets relatively efficiently. [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=3164.0s)]
*  I think one of the things that we've identified as a core differentiator for us right now is [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=3168.32s)]
*  simply scale. We're the largest provider in this space. We have more contracts and bigger contracts [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=3175.92s)]
*  than anyone else. When you look at scale, especially in the early days of the market evolving, [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=3183.04s)]
*  we have better access to capital, cheaper capital. We have more miles under our belt to prove to that [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=3190.16s)]
*  capital that we're a reliable operator. We can buy product at scale and get better terms in buying [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=3196.7999999999997s)]
*  everything from charging stations to switch gear to construction services. Then because it's local, [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=3204.72s)]
*  we have operators on the ground that are responsible for actually delivering some of [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=3211.92s)]
*  those services. Some of them are really technology driven, but some of them are people on the ground [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=3217.2s)]
*  who actually have to turn some wrenches. We have scale in places like Maryland, Michigan, New England [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=3221.8399999999997s)]
*  where it's much cheaper for us to operate and add that next customer than it is for our competitors. [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=3229.9199999999996s)]
*  I think those are some of the moats we're building, but very much believe that it's a more challenging [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=3236.3999999999996s)]
*  bundle of services than operating a solar farm. That's going to continue to be difficult for others [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=3245.12s)]
*  to replicate. Absolutely. My synopsis or summary of Duncan's point there is ideas are cheap. [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=3254.96s)]
*  The hard part is execution. I'm sure there are a million people in the US that have thought [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=3263.84s)]
*  somebody should make a Tesla for boats. The hard part is how do you go build a product that can [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=3270.0s)]
*  actually deliver that vision? How do you go package enough battery on a boat to make it compelling in [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=3276.08s)]
*  such a power hungry market? How do you do that without spending incredible amounts of money on [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=3281.6s)]
*  CapEx or R&D? That's the hard part. I think that speaks to the moat here is it is hard to go do this. [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=3288.64s)]
*  That's amazing. I couldn't have said it better. I completely agree with that. I also just want to [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=3297.76s)]
*  pick up on one point that Duncan just made, which is very, very important. It's the order book. [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=3302.88s)]
*  Having a real order book where you've sat down with the customer and they've said, [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=3310.5600000000004s)]
*  yes, we want your product. WeAviation recently passed by the $3.5 billion pre-order mark for the [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=3314.8s)]
*  aircraft. More than 400 airplanes on LOI that we have with our customers now. They're real [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=3322.56s)]
*  customers. These customers that are signed on early are committed to working with us on the [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=3329.2s)]
*  program. They're giving us feedback. They're giving us information about how they're going [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=3334.0s)]
*  to actually operate the planes. Then they're there to work with us to be our launch partners [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=3337.2799999999997s)]
*  when we actually put those planes into service with them in the next few years. I just want to [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=3342.96s)]
*  emphasize that that order book says so much about what your market is saying. Then recently [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=3347.44s)]
*  we just announced a deal with the leasing company. The leasing company doesn't just bet on our [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=3354.48s)]
*  aircraft. The leasing company is betting on the market. It's telling you that there is a market [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=3363.2000000000003s)]
*  for your entire product line when a leasing company buys it. It's very, very important to [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=3368.2400000000002s)]
*  look at that mix. I should share that we chose the three of you to contribute to this conversation [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=3373.04s)]
*  is because we did do our research and checked that all three of you have orders booked. That [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=3378.16s)]
*  was really important in terms of like you're actually on the ground. You have relationships [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=3384.32s)]
*  and to all of your points, it shows that this is not just an ideal where we want to electrify. [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=3388.88s)]
*  Eventually people will buy into this. The market is actually participating in this. They're saying, [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=3395.2s)]
*  okay, the cost combined with the other benefits that we're seeing in this industry [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=3401.52s)]
*  now are actually better to the point that we're ready to put our wallet down. That was really [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=3406.72s)]
*  important in terms of us determining. Again, there are many participants in all three of these spaces [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=3413.84s)]
*  and so that was essential for us. I also want to just quickly note that all three of you spoke to [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=3420.32s)]
*  so many different opportunities for motes. There was technical motes, there was operational motes, [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=3426.96s)]
*  there's even potentially regulatory motes. I think it's fascinating to imagine how this develops [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=3431.68s)]
*  because there's not just one single moat. Each one of you are figuring out where your business [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=3438.16s)]
*  tied with your customer base, whether it's B2B or B2C, what they're really looking for. [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=3443.44s)]
*  That's amazing. I think one great place where we can end this conversation is we've already [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=3449.44s)]
*  spoken to this idea that this is where these industries are moving in five years, 10 years, [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=3455.04s)]
*  20 years. We do expect these set of industries to change and to be electrified. I'd love to hear [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=3461.12s)]
*  the three of you just comment on what that really means, contextualize the impact of, [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=3468.08s)]
*  let's just say, maybe not all aircraft, but most aircraft being electric, most boats being electric. [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=3472.8s)]
*  I know this will take time, but I'd love for the audience to just understand maybe the second, [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=3478.16s)]
*  third order effects or the implications of that shift once it's fully manifested. [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=3482.88s)]
*  I think something that some people don't necessarily think about is the next generation [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=3489.2000000000003s)]
*  of boaters will not be allowed to use gas boats on our lakes and rivers. They are very unpopular [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=3494.2400000000002s)]
*  because they're huge polluters, semi trucks out on the water, except a lot of them don't even have [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=3502.2400000000002s)]
*  catalytic converters on them. You just see these fuel slicks behind boats as they take off and all [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=3508.64s)]
*  the noxious fumes around there, CO2 poisoning warnings on the back of these boats. Fast forward [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=3515.6s)]
*  several years, you're looking at marinas that are quiet, that have clean water around them because [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=3522.3199999999997s)]
*  these boats are not polluting into them. We'll take an ARC-1 out into a marina and we'll pass a [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=3530.24s)]
*  sailboat and the sailboat will be louder than our boat. This ability to suddenly appreciate and [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=3536.72s)]
*  enjoy water so much more than you're able to today with this drum of engine noise drowning [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=3543.04s)]
*  everything out, it's an exciting vision that we're driving towards. When you look at urban areas [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=3550.7999999999997s)]
*  around the country, the EPA, you can go to their website and look up who's in attainment of air [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=3558.3199999999997s)]
*  quality that's fit for being healthy for human life is effectively the way they describe it. [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=3565.68s)]
*  Most of our major cities do not meet the threshold and it's because we have tailpipes from vehicle [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=3570.72s)]
*  traffic. We've essentially moved all of our power plants further outside of urban areas. We don't [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=3580.3999999999996s)]
*  run coal plants in cities anymore. Bad air quality is a function of tailpipes and cancer rates, [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=3585.44s)]
*  rates of pediatric asthma are high in cities where tailpipes and vehicle traffic is high [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=3594.72s)]
*  and areas where the airflow does not wash those fumes out quickly and easily enough. [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=3602.64s)]
*  There are places in California where we're engaged with municipal leaders where [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=3610.64s)]
*  pediatric asthma is over 30%. Our vision is tackling air quality at the local level, [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=3615.68s)]
*  tackling climate change at the same time, creating a very clean, quiet, urban future. [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=3626.0s)]
*  Mitch said quiet. We would say the same thing. Our bus depots are silent and the buses operate [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=3634.72s)]
*  almost entirely silently. Trash pickup could happen earlier in the morning because you don't [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=3641.2s)]
*  have the loud rumbling noises of a diesel engine and the grid is not utilized to the tune of 36% [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=3648.96s)]
*  or 38%. It's utilized to 55, 60, 65, 70% and so we can integrate more renewable energy, not less. [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=3656.72s)]
*  We can reduce demand charges and just charges to rate payers and create an ecosystem where [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=3669.36s)]
*  transportation of all forms, whether it's flight, marine, or road, is really integrated into an [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=3681.28s)]
*  energy ecosystem that's more efficient, cheaper, and better. In the near future, you're going to [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=3689.28s)]
*  be able to take a 10-minute trip to your nearest airport, get on an airplane, and fly for an hour [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=3694.16s)]
*  to do a day trip that previously would have been an overnight trip or a trip to an airport half an [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=3700.48s)]
*  hour, 45 minutes away, and through going through security, you're going to be able to conveniently [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=3705.3599999999997s)]
*  move from point to point to go do the trips that you want to do. They'll be more time effective. [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=3710.0s)]
*  It'll be good for the economy in terms of enabling more trade, but also in a social perspective, [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=3716.3999999999996s)]
*  being able to go and see people that you want to be able to see. We thrive in connectivity. [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=3721.6s)]
*  This type of connectivity will disproportionately benefit small rural communities, communities that [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=3726.6400000000003s)]
*  previously have not had the benefit of having air travel, which is a real economic motivator. [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=3731.52s)]
*  These flights will be much more cost effective than the flights we have today because they [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=3737.92s)]
*  eliminate aviation fuel and replace it with a much cheaper electrically-derived energy from the grid. [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=3743.36s)]
*  As with those other forms of transportation, electric aviation is very quiet, which means that [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=3750.24s)]
*  not only will you be able to increase the frequency of flights or even add previous flights [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=3755.7599999999998s)]
*  that just haven't existed in decades, you'll be able to do it not worrying about polluting [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=3761.3599999999997s)]
*  the environment, but also not worrying about irritating your neighbours because the flights [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=3765.6s)]
*  will be so quiet that nobody will complain. In fact, you will want to have that airplane [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=3769.2s)]
*  next to you so that you can take advantage of it. It's going to change the way that we fly [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=3774.56s)]
*  and this is the future. I'm just picturing this summer day in my head where you wake up, [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=3779.84s)]
*  you go to your nearby airport, you fly to your friend who lives near a lake, you go out on an [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=3787.12s)]
*  electric boat. After that, you go to a concert powered by an electric school bus. This is obviously [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=3792.08s)]
*  an extreme scenario, but you know what? It's the perfect day that is hopefully enabled by [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=3799.36s)]
*  technology in the coming years. We're counting on you guys. Let's make it happen. I think that's a [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=3806.08s)]
*  great place to end off. Thank you so much for sharing the amazing things that all three of [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=3813.2s)]
*  you are building in your respective spaces and I think it was fascinating to just see the overlap [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=3817.7599999999998s)]
*  and also some of the differences that are unique to your industries. Thank you for the excellent [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=3822.72s)]
*  questions. It was really inspiring and thought-provoking and Duncan and Mitch, that was [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=3828.4s)]
*  really enjoyable. Thank you both. Yeah, I would echo. Steph, thanks for getting us together and [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=3833.84s)]
*  Mitch, Greg, love to stay in touch with you guys. Love what you're doing. It'll be a pleasure. [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxm-iAGn1JA&t=3839.2000000000003s)]
