# Safety in Numbers: Keeping AI Open
**The a16z Podcast:** [December 28, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU)
*  Scaling laws. Now these underpin the success of large language models today. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=0.0s)]
*  But the relationship between datasets, compute, and the number of parameters was not always clear. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=5.04s)]
*  In fact, in 2022, a pivotal paper came out that changed the way that many people in the research [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=11.44s)]
*  community thought about this very calculus. And it demonstrated that datasets were actually more [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=16.72s)]
*  important than just the sheer size of the model. One of the key authors of this paper was Arthur [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=22.0s)]
*  who was working at DeepMind at the time. Now earlier this year, Arthur banded together with [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=28.32s)]
*  two other researchers, Guillaume Lampel and Timoth√©e Lacroix, two researchers at Meta who [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=32.96s)]
*  worked on Llama. And together the three of them founded a new company, Mistral. That team has been [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=38.72s)]
*  hard at work releasing Mistral 7b in September, a state-of-the-art open source model. That quickly [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=44.56s)]
*  became the go-to for developers. And they just released, as in the last few days, a new mixture [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=50.72s)]
*  of experts model that naturally they're calling Mistral. So today you'll get to hear directly from [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=56.8s)]
*  Arthur as he sits down with A16Z general partner, Anjane Mida. As the battleground for large language [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=62.48s)]
*  models heats up, to say the least, together they discuss the many misconceptions around open source [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=68.72s)]
*  and the war being waged on the industry. Plus the current performance reality of open versus closed [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=74.32s)]
*  models and whether that gap will realistically close with time. Plus the kind of compute, data, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=79.75999999999999s)]
*  and algorithmic innovations required to keep scaling LLMs efficiently. Now it's really rare [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=85.76s)]
*  to have someone at the frontier of this kind of research be so candid about what they're building [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=91.60000000000001s)]
*  and why. So I hope that you come out of this episode as excited about the future of open [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=96.4s)]
*  source as I did. Enjoy. As a reminder, the content here is for informational purposes only. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=101.52000000000001s)]

*  a16z.com slash disclosures. You've got quite the founding team story. You know, we flashback to a [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=129.28s)]
*  few years ago. Labs are building foundation models and the consensus across the research [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=138.64s)]
*  community was that the size of these models was what mattered most. You know, how many million or [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=143.92s)]
*  billion parameters went into the model seemed to be the primary debate that people were having. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=149.92s)]
*  But it seems like you had a hunch that data sets mattered more. Could you just give us the backstory [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=155.67999999999998s)]
*  on the chinchilla paper you core out? You know, what were the key takeaways in the paper and [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=160.64s)]
*  how was it received? Yeah, so I guess the backstory is that in 2019, 2020, people were relying a lot on [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=164.48s)]
*  the on a paper called Scaling Lows for Large Language Models. That was advocating for basically [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=172.16s)]
*  scaling infinitely the size of models and keeping some number of data points rather fixed. So just [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=178.88s)]
*  saying that if you had like four times the amount of compute, you should be mostly multiplying by 3.5 [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=185.44s)]
*  your model size and then maybe by 1.2. And so a lot of work was actually done on top of that. So [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=191.36s)]
*  in particular, DeepMind, when I joined, I joined a project called Gopher and that's a there was [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=197.84s)]
*  a misconception there. There was also a misconception on GPT-3. And basically in 2021, every paper [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=204.24s)]
*  made this mistake. And at the end of 2021, we started to realize there were some issues. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=211.36s)]
*  And as it turns out, we turned back to the mathematical paper that was actually [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=217.52s)]
*  talking about scaling those and it was a bit hard to understand. And we figured out that actually, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=222.16s)]
*  if you thought about it a bit more in a theoretical perspective, and if we looked at [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=227.44s)]
*  like empirical evidence we had, it didn't really make sense to actually grow the model size faster [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=232.0s)]
*  than the data size. And we did some measurements. And as it turned out, what was actually true was [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=238.88s)]
*  what we expect, which is in common words, if you multiply by four your compute capacity, [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=246.32s)]
*  you should multiply by two the model size and by two the data size. That's approximately what you [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=253.2s)]
*  should be doing, which is good because if you move everything to infinity, everything remains [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=258.08s)]
*  consistent. So you don't have a model which is infinity big or a model which is infinity small [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=262.15999999999997s)]
*  with infinite compression or close to zero compression. So it really makes sense. And as [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=266.24s)]
*  it turns out, it's really what you observe if you do multiple runs. And so that's how we [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=270.88s)]
*  train Chinchilla and that's how we wrote the Chinchilla paper. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=277.44s)]
*  At the time, you were at DeepMind and your co-founders were at Meta. What's the backstory [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=280.71999999999997s)]
*  around how you three end up coming together to form Mistral after the compute optimal scaling [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=286.64s)]
*  laws work that you just described? So we've known each other for a while because Guillaume [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=292.24s)]
*  and I were in school together and Timoth√©e and I were in master together in Paris. Basically, [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=296.48s)]
*  we had very parallel careers. Timoth√©e and I, we actually worked together as well again [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=301.20000000000005s)]
*  when I was doing a postdoc in mathematics. And then I joined DeepMind as Guillaume and Timoth√©e [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=306.48s)]
*  went to become permanent researchers at Meta. And so we continued doing this. I was doing large [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=314.16s)]
*  language models in between 2020 and 2023. Guillaume and Timoth√©e were working on solving [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=321.68s)]
*  mathematical problems with large models. And if I understand correctly, I wasn't there, but [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=328.40000000000003s)]
*  they realized they had to have stronger models and they started to do large language models at [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=335.68s)]
*  this point. So I guess a year after I started. And on my side, I was mostly working in a small team [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=339.68s)]
*  at DeepMind. So we did very interesting work on Retro, which is a paper doing retrieval for [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=347.44s)]
*  large language models. We did Chinchilla. Then I was in the team doing Flamingo, which is actually [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=353.44s)]
*  one of the good ways of doing a model that can see things. I guess when Chaggivity went out, [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=360.8s)]
*  we knew from before that the technology was very much game changing, but it was kind of a signal [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=367.76s)]
*  that there was a strong opportunity for building a small team, focusing on a different way of [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=373.12s)]
*  distributing the technology. So we're doing things in a more open source manner, which was not the [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=379.12s)]
*  direction that Google at least was taking. And so we had this opportunity and we left the company [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=384.4s)]
*  at the beginning of last year and created the team that started to work on the 5th of June. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=391.68s)]
*  And if I recall correctly, right before they left, Tim and Guillaume had started to work on Lama [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=397.68s)]
*  right over at Meta. Could you describe that project and how it was related to the Chinchilla [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=404.64s)]
*  scaling laws work you'd done? So Lama was like a small team, [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=409.52s)]
*  reproduction of Chinchilla, at least in its approach of parameterization and all of these [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=415.04s)]
*  things. It was one of the first papers that established that you could go beyond the Chinchilla [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=419.2s)]
*  scaling laws. So Chinchilla scaling laws tell you what you should be training if you want to have [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=425.2s)]
*  an optimal model for a certain compute cost at training time. But if you take into account the [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=430.56s)]
*  fact that your model should also be efficient at inference time, you probably want to go far [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=436.15999999999997s)]
*  beyond the Chinchilla scaling law. So it means you want to overtrain the model. So train on more [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=441.44s)]
*  tokens than would be optimal for performance. But the reason why you do that is that you actually [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=447.28s)]
*  compress models more. And then when you do inference, you end up having a model which is [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=451.76s)]
*  much more efficient for a certain performance. So by spending more time during training, [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=456.96s)]
*  you spend less time during inference and so you save cost. And I think that was something we, [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=462.0s)]
*  well, I guess we observed that at Google also, but the Lama paper was the first to establish [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=467.84s)]
*  it in the open and it opened a lot of opportunities. Yep. I remember both the impact of the Chinchilla [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=473.44s)]
*  scaling laws work on the labs, on multiple labs, realizing just how unoptimal the compute setups [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=480.64s)]
*  were. And then the impact of Lama being dramatic on the industry and realizing how to be much more [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=488.4s)]
*  efficient about inference time. So I can imagine that those are some of the top insights on your [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=496.08s)]
*  mind and the top concerns on your mind when you guys left to start Mistral. So let's fast forward [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=501.59999999999997s)]
*  to today. It's December, 2023. We'll get to the role of open source in a bit, but let's just level [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=508.96s)]
*  set on what you've built so far. A couple of months ago, you released Mistral 7B, which was [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=514.96s)]
*  a best in class model. And this week you're releasing a new mixture of experts model. So just [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=520.56s)]
*  tell us a little bit more about Mistral, I believe is what you're calling it and how it compares to [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=527.68s)]
*  other models. Yeah. So Mistral is our new model that wasn't released in open source before in [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=532.0799999999999s)]
*  a usable form. It's a technology called sparse mixture of experts, which is quite simple. You [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=538.24s)]
*  take all of the dense layers of your transformer and you duplicate them. You call these layers [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=543.6800000000001s)]
*  expert layers. And then what you do is that for each token that you have in your sequence, [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=548.72s)]
*  you have a router mechanisms, just a very simple network that decides which experts should be [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=555.36s)]
*  looking at which token. And so you send all of the tokens to their experts and then you apply the [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=561.2s)]
*  experts and you get back the output and you combine them and then you go forward in the [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=566.24s)]
*  network. You have eight experts per layer and you execute only two of them. So what it means [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=571.52s)]
*  at the end of the day is that you have a lot of parameters on your model. You have 46 billion [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=577.36s)]
*  parameters, but the thing is that the number of parameters that you execute is much lower than [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=583.12s)]
*  that because you only execute two branches out of eight. And so at the end of the day, you only [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=589.2s)]
*  execute 12 billion parameters per token. And this is what counts for latency and throughput and for [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=593.76s)]
*  performance. So you have a model which has the performance of a 12 billion parameter network [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=599.4399999999999s)]
*  that have performance that are much higher than what you could get even by compressing that a lot [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=606.24s)]
*  on a 12 billion dense transformer. So sparse mixture of experts is a technology that allows [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=611.92s)]
*  to be much more efficient at inference time and also much more efficient at training time. So [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=618.24s)]
*  that's the reason why we choose to develop it very quickly. Just for folks who are listening, [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=622.16s)]
*  who might not be familiar with state of the art architecture and language models, [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=628.16s)]
*  could you just describe the difference between dense models which have been the primary architecture [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=632.3199999999999s)]
*  to date and mixture of experts? Intuitively, what are the biggest differences between these [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=637.6s)]
*  two architectures? So they are very similar except on what we call the dense network. So [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=642.24s)]
*  the dense transformer, you alternate between an attention layer and a dense layer, [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=649.04s)]
*  generally. That's the idea. A sparse mixture of experts, you take the dense layer and you [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=655.68s)]
*  duplicate it several times. And so that's where you actually increase the number of parameters. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=661.1999999999999s)]
*  So you increase the capacity of the model without increasing the cost. So that's a way of decoupling [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=665.52s)]
*  the memorization and what you can remember the capacity of the network to its cost at inference [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=670.64s)]
*  time. If you had to describe the biggest benefits for developers as a result of that [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=675.36s)]
*  inference efficiency? Its cost and latency. So you can have, usually that's what you look at when [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=679.52s)]
*  you're a developer. You want something which is cheap and you want something which is fast. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=686.24s)]
*  Generally speaking, just the trade-off is strictly favorable in using mixed trial compared to using [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=689.2s)]
*  a 12 billion dense model. The other way to think about it is that if you want to use a model which [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=696.08s)]
*  is as good as Lama 270B, you should be using mixed trial because mixed trial is actually on [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=702.24s)]
*  par with Lama 270B while being approximately six times cheaper or six times faster for the same [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=707.6s)]
*  price. Could you talk just a little bit about why it's been so challenging for folks to, [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=712.8s)]
*  for research labs and research teams to really get the mixture of experts model right? It sounds like [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=720.16s)]
*  for a while now, folks have known that the dense model architecture that all of us have been using [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=726.16s)]
*  in sort of the most notable products or the most well-known products are slow, they're expensive, [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=730.8000000000001s)]
*  and they're difficult to scale. And so for a while, people have been looking for [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=738.32s)]
*  an alternative architecture that could be, like you were saying, cheaper, could be faster, could [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=743.6800000000001s)]
*  be more efficient. What were some of the biggest challenges you have to figure out to get the MOE [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=748.64s)]
*  model right? Well, I guess I won't disclose all trade secrets, but there's basically two challenges. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=753.36s)]
*  The first one is you need to figure out how to train it correctly from a mathematical perspective. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=758.64s)]
*  The other challenge is to train efficiently, so how to use actually hardware as efficiently as [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=764.08s)]
*  possible. You have new challenges coming from the fact that you have tokens flying around [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=769.52s)]
*  from one expert to another. That creates some communication constraints and you need to figure [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=774.16s)]
*  it out. You need to make it fast. And then on top of that, you also have new constraints that apply [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=780.88s)]
*  when you deploy the model. You do need to do inferencing efficiently. And that's also the [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=784.88s)]
*  reason why we released an open source package based on VLM so that the community can take also [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=791.52s)]
*  this code and modify it and see how that works. Yeah, obviously, we're excited to see what the [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=796.88s)]
*  community does with the MOE mixed role release you're putting out this week. Let's talk about [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=801.68s)]
*  open source, an approach and a philosophy that's permeated all the work you've been doing so far. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=807.68s)]
*  Why choose to tackle this increasingly competitive space with an open source approach, [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=814.4000000000001s)]
*  which is quite different from the way everybody else is approaching it? [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=819.9200000000001s)]
*  I guess it's a good question. The answer is that it's partly ideological and partly [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=822.72s)]
*  pragmatical. We have grown with the field of AI. From 2012, we were detecting cats and dogs. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=827.44s)]
*  And in 2022, we were actually generating text that looked human-like. So really made a lot of [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=837.6s)]
*  progress. And if you look at the reason why we made all of this progress, well, most of it is [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=842.8000000000001s)]
*  explainable by the free flow of information. So you had academic labs, you had very big [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=848.08s)]
*  industry-backed labs communicating all the time about the results and building on top of each [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=854.8000000000001s)]
*  other results. And that's the way we went from, we increased significantly the architecture and [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=860.8000000000001s)]
*  training techniques. We just made everything work as a community. And all of a sudden in 2020, [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=867.76s)]
*  with GPT-free, this tide kind of reversed and companies started to be more opaque about what [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=876.48s)]
*  they were doing because they realized there was actually a very big market. And all of a sudden, [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=883.12s)]
*  in 2022, on the important aspects of AI and on LLMs, we went beyond Chinchilla, there were [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=888.4s)]
*  basically no communication at all. And that's something that I, as a researcher, and Timoth√©e [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=896.0s)]
*  and Guillaume, and all of the people that joined us as well, deeply regretted because we think that [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=901.0400000000001s)]
*  we're definitely not at the end of the story. We need to invent new things. There's no reason why [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=906.1600000000001s)]
*  to stop now because the technology is effectively good, but not working completely well enough. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=910.48s)]
*  And so we believe that it's still the case that we should be communicating a lot about models. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=916.5600000000001s)]
*  We should be allowing the community to take the models and make it their own. And that's some [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=922.88s)]
*  ideological reason why we went into that. The other reason is that we are talking to developers. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=929.04s)]
*  Developers want to modify things. And having a deep access to a very good model is a good way [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=936.0s)]
*  of engaging with this community. And I guess addressing their needs so that the platform [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=942.56s)]
*  we're building as well is going to be used by them. So that's also a business reason. Obviously, [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=948.4s)]
*  as a business, we do need to have a valid monetization approach at some point. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=955.76s)]
*  But we've seen many businesses build open core approaches and have a very strong open source [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=960.56s)]
*  community and also a very good offer of services. And that's what we want to build. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=966.64s)]
*  That resonates. I remember a very detectable shift. You're right. The early days of [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=971.28s)]
*  deep learning were largely driven by a bunch of open collaboration between researchers from [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=979.04s)]
*  different labs who would often publish all their work and share them at conferences. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=984.24s)]
*  Transformers famously was published and open to the entire research community. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=987.76s)]
*  But that has definitely changed. Yes. So I think there's some level of open sourcing in the eyes. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=993.1999999999999s)]
*  And so we offer the open the weights and we offer the inference code. That's like the end product [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=999.76s)]
*  that is already super usable. So it's already a very big step forward compared to closed APIs [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=1005.28s)]
*  because you can modify it and you can look at what's happening under the hood, [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=1011.76s)]
*  look at activations and all. So you have interpretability and the possibility of [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=1016.24s)]
*  modifying the model to adapt it to some editorial tone, to adapt it to proprietary data, [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=1020.4s)]
*  to adapt it to some specific instructions, which is something that is actually much harder to make [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=1026.56s)]
*  if you only have access to a closed source API. And that's something that also goes with our [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=1030.64s)]
*  approach of the technology, which is to say pre-trained models should be neutral and we [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=1035.8400000000001s)]
*  should empower our customers to take these models and just put their editorial approaches, [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=1040.64s)]
*  their instruction, their constitution, if you want to talk like Antropiq into the model. So [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=1047.2800000000002s)]
*  that's the way we approach the technology. We don't want to pour our own biases into the [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=1052.96s)]
*  the pre-trained model. On the other hand, we want to enable the developers to control exactly how [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=1057.92s)]
*  the model behaves and what kind of biases it has, what kind of biases it doesn't have. So we really [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=1063.44s)]
*  take this modular approach and that goes very well with the fact that we release some very strong [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=1069.68s)]
*  open weight models. Could you just ground us in the reality of where these models are today, [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=1074.8s)]
*  just to give people a sense of where in the timeline we are? Is open source really a [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=1078.88s)]
*  viable competitor to proprietary closed models or is there a performance gap? What are the trade [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=1084.0s)]
*  offs or limitations that people should be aware of with open source? So Mixtral is a similar [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=1088.88s)]
*  performance to GPT 3.5. So that's a good grounding. Internally, we have stronger models that are in [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=1094.4s)]
*  between 3.5 and 4 that are basically the second or third best model in the world. So really we think [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=1100.88s)]
*  that the gap is closing. The gap is approximately six months at that point. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=1108.4s)]
*  And the reason why it's six months is that it actually goes faster if you do open source things [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=1113.0400000000002s)]
*  because you get the community modify the model to just very good ideas that can then be consolidated [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=1116.8000000000002s)]
*  by us, for instance, and we just go faster because of that. So it has always been the case that open [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=1123.2s)]
*  source ends up going faster and that's the reason why the entire internet runs on Linux. I don't see [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=1129.6000000000001s)]
*  why it would be any different for AI. Obviously, there's some constraints that are slightly [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=1137.84s)]
*  different because the infrastructure cost is quite high. To train a model will cost a lot of money, [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=1142.08s)]
*  but I really think that we'll converge to a setting where you have proprietary models and [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=1148.56s)]
*  the open source model are just as good. And I think eventually the field will be much more open [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=1153.6s)]
*  because if you want to go beyond the biggest model today, you do need to find new paradigms. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=1157.52s)]
*  So that means that we also need to do research and that we're very excited by this perspective [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=1162.72s)]
*  because we like a competitive environment and research. Yeah, so let's talk about that a little [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=1167.76s)]
*  bit more. How are you seeing people use and innovate on the open source models? And are there [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=1171.8400000000001s)]
*  any use cases that diverge from proprietary closed models at all? I think we've seen several [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=1177.3600000000001s)]
*  categories of usage. There's a few companies that know how to strongly fine tune models to their [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=1182.48s)]
*  needs. So they took Mistral 7b, had a lot of human annotations, had a lot of proprietary data, [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=1188.64s)]
*  just modified Mistral 7b so that it solved their task just as well as GBT 3.5, but only for a lower [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=1194.8000000000002s)]
*  cost and a higher level of control. We've also seen, I think, very interesting community efforts [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=1200.96s)]
*  in adding capabilities to Mistral 7b. So we saw like a context length extension to 128k, [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=1206.0s)]
*  that worked very well. Again, it was done in the open, so like the recipe was available and this is [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=1212.64s)]
*  something that we were able to consolidate. We've seen image encoders to make it a visual language [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=1217.2s)]
*  model. A very actionable thing that we saw is, I think, the hugging face folks first did the direct [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=1223.04s)]
*  preference optimization on top of Mistral 7b and made a much stronger model than the instructed [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=1230.24s)]
*  model we proposed at the early release. And it turned out it's actually a very good idea to do it. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=1235.8400000000001s)]
*  And so that's something that we've consolidated as well. So generally speaking, [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=1241.6799999999998s)]
*  the community is super eager to just take the model and add new capabilities, put it on a laptop, [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=1247.52s)]
*  put it on an iPhone. I saw Mistral 7b on an iPhone. I saw Mistral 7b on the stuffed parot as well. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=1253.28s)]
*  So fun things, useful things, but generally speaking, it's been super exciting to see [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=1259.6799999999998s)]
*  the research community take a hold of our technology. And with Mixtral, which is a new [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=1265.36s)]
*  architecture, I think we're also going to see much more interesting things because [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=1270.8s)]
*  on the interpretability field, also on the safety field, as it turns out, you have a lot of things [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=1274.48s)]
*  to do when you have deep access to an open model. And so we're really eager to help that [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=1279.36s)]
*  and to engage with the community. Safety is an important, I think, piece to talk about. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=1284.96s)]
*  The immediate reaction of a lot of folks is to deem open source less safe than closed models. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=1290.8799999999999s)]
*  How would you respond to that? So I think we believe that it's actually not the case for the [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=1298.32s)]
*  current generation of models that we are using today are not that much, are not much more than [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=1303.2s)]
*  just a compression of whatever is available on the internet. So it does make access to knowledge [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=1310.08s)]
*  more fluid, but this is the story of humanity making knowledge access more fluid. So it's no [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=1315.68s)]
*  different than inventing the printing machine where we had a similar debate. It wasn't there, [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=1322.08s)]
*  but that was the debate we had. So we are not making the world any time any less safer by [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=1327.12s)]
*  providing more interactive access to knowledge. So that's the first thing. Now, the other thing is [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=1334.1599999999999s)]
*  that you do have immediate risk of misuse of large language models, and you do have them for open [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=1339.1999999999998s)]
*  source models, but also for closed models. And so the way you do address these problems and come up [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=1345.1999999999998s)]
*  with countermeasures is to know about them. So you need to know about breaches basically. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=1352.24s)]
*  That's the same way in which you need to know about breaches on operating systems and on [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=1358.72s)]
*  networks. And so it's no different for AI. Putting models under the highest level of scrutiny is the [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=1363.52s)]
*  way of knowing how they can be misused. And it's a way of coming up with countermeasures. And I think [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=1370.4s)]
*  a good example of that is that it's actually super easy to exploit an API. It's super easy, [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=1375.36s)]
*  especially if you have fine tuning access, to make GPT-4 behave in a very bad way. And since it's [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=1380.4s)]
*  the case, and it's always going to be the case, it's super hard to be adversarial and robust. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=1389.1200000000001s)]
*  It means that we're only trusting the team of large companies to figure out ways of addressing [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=1393.3600000000001s)]
*  these problems. Whereas if you do open sourcing, you trust the community. The community is much [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=1399.2800000000002s)]
*  larger. And so if you look at the history of software in cybersecurity in operating systems, [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=1404.72s)]
*  that's the way we made the system safe. And so if we want to make the current AI system safe, [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=1411.44s)]
*  and then move on to the next generation that potentially will be even stronger, and then we [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=1416.4s)]
*  can have this discussion again, well, you do need to do open sourcing. So today, [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=1422.4s)]
*  we think that open sourcing is a safe way. Yeah, I think this is not understood widely. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=1426.88s)]
*  When you have thousands or hundreds of thousands of people able to read team models, because it's [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=1434.88s)]
*  open source, the likelihood that you'll detect biases and built in breaches and risks are just [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=1441.04s)]
*  dramatically higher. And I think if you were talking to policymakers, how would you help [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=1448.64s)]
*  advise them? How do you think they should be thinking about regulating open source models, [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=1456.16s)]
*  given that the safest way often to battle harden software and tools is to put them out in the open? [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=1460.8000000000002s)]
*  Well, we've been saying that precisely this that the current technology is not dangerous. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=1467.92s)]
*  On the other hand, the fact that we are effectively making them stronger means that [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=1475.68s)]
*  we need to monitor what's happening empirically monitor our performances. The best way of [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=1480.4s)]
*  empirically monitoring software performances is through open source. So that's what we've been [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=1484.88s)]
*  saying. There's been some effort to try to come up with very complex governance structure, where [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=1491.1200000000001s)]
*  you would have like several companies talking together, having some safe space, some safe [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=1498.8000000000002s)]
*  sandbox for red tumor that will be potentially independent. So things that are super complex. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=1502.8000000000002s)]
*  But as it turns out, if you look at the history of software, the only way we did software [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=1510.88s)]
*  collaboratively is through open source. So why change the recipe today, where the technology [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=1514.72s)]
*  we're looking at is actually nothing else than the compression of the internet. So that's what [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=1520.56s)]
*  we've been saying to the regulators. Generally, another thing we've added to the regulator is that [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=1525.52s)]
*  if they want to enforce that AI products that needs to be safe, like if you want to have a [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=1531.3600000000001s)]
*  diagnosis assistant, you want it to be safe. Well, in order to monitor and to evaluate whether [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=1538.48s)]
*  it's actually safe, you need to have some very good tooling. And the tooling requires to have [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=1544.48s)]
*  access to LLMs. And if you access close source APIs, LLMs, where you're a bit in a in a in [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=1549.68s)]
*  troubled water, because it's hard to be independent in that setting. So we think that independent [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=1557.44s)]
*  controller of product safety should have access to very strong open source models and should [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=1562.56s)]
*  own the technology. And if open source LLMs were to fail relative to close source, [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=1567.6s)]
*  models, why would that be? Well, I guess the regulation burden is potentially one thing that [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=1574.64s)]
*  could make it harder to release open source models. It's also generally speaking, it's a very [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=1583.6s)]
*  competitive market. And I think in order for open source models to be widely adopted, they need to [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=1590.16s)]
*  be as strong as open source as a close source model. They have a little advantage because you [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=1595.68s)]
*  do have more control. And so you can do if you're fine tuning and so you can make performance jump [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=1601.76s)]
*  a lot on a specific task because you have deep access. But really, at the end of the day, [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=1607.12s)]
*  developers look at performance and latency. And so that's why we think that as a company, [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=1613.36s)]
*  we need to be very much on the frontier if we want to be relevant. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=1619.36s)]
*  And given the complexity of frontier models and foundation models in these systems, [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=1622.48s)]
*  there are just tons of misconceptions that folks have about these models. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=1628.8s)]
*  And so if you step back, can we look at the battle that's raging between folks pushing [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=1633.1999999999998s)]
*  for closed source systems versus the open source system? What do you think is at stake here? What [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=1640.8799999999999s)]
*  do you think the battle is really for? Well, I think the battle is for the neutrality [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=1646.72s)]
*  of the technology. Like a technology by a sense is something neutral. You can use it for bad [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=1651.12s)]
*  purposes. You can use it for good purposes. If you look at what the LLM does, it's not really [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=1656.24s)]
*  different from a programming language. It's actually used very much as a programming language [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=1661.1200000000001s)]
*  by the application makers. There's a strong confusion made between what we call a model [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=1665.76s)]
*  and what we call an application. And so the model is really the programming language of AI [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=1672.4s)]
*  applications. So if you talk to all of the startups doing amazing products with generative AI, [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=1677.76s)]
*  they're using LLMs just as a function. And on top of that, you have a very big system with filters, [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=1683.28s)]
*  with decision making, with control flow and all of these things. And what you want to regulate, [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=1690.48s)]
*  if you want to regulate something, is the system. The system is the product. So for instance, [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=1695.44s)]
*  a healthcare diagnosis assistant is an application. You want it to be non-biased. You want it to take [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=1701.76s)]
*  good decisions, even under high pressure. So you want its statistical accuracy to be very high. [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=1710.24s)]
*  And so you want to measure that. And it doesn't matter if it uses a large language model [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=1716.16s)]
*  under the hood. What you want to regulate is the application. And the issue we had, [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=1723.2s)]
*  and the issue we're still having now is we hear a lot of people saying we should regulate the tech. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=1728.48s)]
*  So we should regulate the function, the mathematics behind it. But really, you never use a large [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=1734.88s)]
*  language model itself. You only always use it in an application in a way with a user interface. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=1739.92s)]
*  And so that's the one thing you want to regulate. And what it means is that companies like us, [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=1746.24s)]
*  foundational model companies, will obviously make the model as controllable as possible so that the [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=1751.6000000000001s)]
*  applications on top of it can be compliant, can be safe. We'll also build the tools that allow to [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=1756.4s)]
*  measure the compliance and the safety of the application, because that's super useful for the [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=1763.04s)]
*  application makers. It's actually needed. But there's no point in regulating something that is [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=1769.2s)]
*  neutral in itself. That is just a mathematical tool. So I think that's the one thing that we've [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=1775.68s)]
*  been hammering a lot. I think we've been heard, which is good. But there's still a lot of effort [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=1780.64s)]
*  I guess in making this strong distinction, which is super important to understand what's going on. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=1788.0s)]
*  So to regulate apps, not math, seems like the right direction that a lot of folks who understand the [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=1793.2s)]
*  inner workings of these models and how they're actually implemented in reality are advocating [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=1801.68s)]
*  for. What do you think is the best way to clear up this misconception for folks who maybe don't have [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=1806.64s)]
*  technical backgrounds, don't actually understand how foundation models work and how the scaling [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=1815.76s)]
*  models work? So I've been using a lot of metaphors, I guess, to make it understood. [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=1820.72s)]
*  Large language models are like programming languages. And so you don't regulate programming [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=1826.16s)]
*  languages. You regulate malwares. You ban malwares. We've also been actively vocal about the fact that [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=1831.2800000000002s)]
*  pre-market conditions like flops, the number of flops that you do to create a model, is definitely [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=1840.48s)]
*  not the right way of measuring the performance of a model. We're very much in favor of having [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=1846.08s)]
*  very strong evaluations. As I've said, this is something that we want to provide to our customers, [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=1854.0s)]
*  the ability to evaluate our models in their application. And so I think this is a very strong [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=1859.6s)]
*  thing that we've been stressing. We want to provide the tools for application makers to be compliant. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=1865.6799999999998s)]
*  That's something we have been saying. And so we find it a bit unfortunate that we haven't [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=1873.68s)]
*  been heard everywhere and that there's still a big focus on the tech, probably because things are not [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=1880.4s)]
*  completely well understood because it's a very complex field and it's also a very fast-moving [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=1887.2s)]
*  field. But eventually, I think I'm very optimistic that we'll find a way to continue innovating [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=1890.8s)]
*  while having safe products, but also a high level of competition on the foundational model layer. [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=1899.12s)]
*  Well, let's channel your optimism a little bit. There's very few people who have [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=1907.6s)]
*  the ground level understanding of scaling laws like you, Guillaume, and Tim, and your team. [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=1912.24s)]
*  When you step back and you look at the entire space of language modeling, in addition to [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=1918.8799999999999s)]
*  open source, what are the key differentiators that you see in the next wave of cutting edge models? [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=1922.32s)]
*  Things like self-play, you have process reward models, the uses of synthetic data. [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=1928.6399999999999s)]
*  If you had to conjecture, what do you think some of the most exciting or important [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=1936.8799999999999s)]
*  breakthroughs will be in the field going forward? So I guess it's good to start with diagnosis. So [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=1940.8799999999999s)]
*  what is not working that well? So reasoning is not working that well. And it's super inefficient [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=1947.36s)]
*  to train a model. If you compare the training process of a large language model to the brain, [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=1952.6399999999999s)]
*  you have a factor, I think, 100,000. So really, there's some progress to be made on [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=1958.16s)]
*  some of that efficiency. So I think the frontier is increasing data efficiency, [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=1964.64s)]
*  increasing reasoning capabilities. So adaptive compute is one way. And when to increase that [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=1970.3200000000002s)]
*  efficiency, you do need to work on coming up with very high quality data, filtering things, [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=1975.92s)]
*  many new techniques that needs to be invented still. But that's really where the lock is, [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=1982.3200000000002s)]
*  data is the one important thing. And the ability of the model to decide how much compute it wants [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=1987.68s)]
*  to allocate to a certain problem is definitely on the frontier as well. So these are things that [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=1994.1599999999999s)]
*  we're actively looking at. You know, this is a raging debate, right? And we've talked about this [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=2000.32s)]
*  a few times before, which is, can models actually reason today? Do they actually generalize out of [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=2005.52s)]
*  distribution? What's your take on it? And what do you think is required to exhibit? What would [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=2012.08s)]
*  convince you that models are actually capable of multi-step complex reasoning? Yeah, it's very hard [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=2018.96s)]
*  because you train on the entire human knowledge. And so you have a lot of reasoning places. So [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=2024.24s)]
*  it's hard to say whether they reason or not, or whether they do retrieval of reasoning. And it [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=2029.04s)]
*  looks like reasoning. I guess at the end of the day, what matters is whether it works or not. [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=2034.48s)]
*  And on many simple reasoning tasks it does. So we can call it reasoning. And it doesn't really [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=2039.44s)]
*  matter if they reason like we do. We don't even know how we reason. So we are not going to know [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=2044.8s)]
*  about how machines reason anytime soon. So yeah, it's a raging debate. The way you do evaluate that [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=2050.32s)]
*  is try to be as out of distribution as possible. Like working on mathematics is not something I've [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=2059.44s)]
*  ever done, but it's something that Timoth√©e and Guillaume are very sensitive to because they've [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=2067.2s)]
*  been doing it for a while when they were at Meta. That's probably one way of measuring whether you [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=2073.7599999999998s)]
*  have a very good model or not. And actually, if you look at, we're starting to see some very good [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=2078.24s)]
*  mathematicians. I'm thinking of Terence Tao, who are using large language models for some things. [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=2084.0s)]
*  Obviously not the high level reasoning, but for some part of their proofs. And so I think we will [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=2091.68s)]
*  move up into abstraction. And the question is where does that stop? We do need to find new [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=2096.4s)]
*  paradigms to go one step forward and we will be actively looking for them. [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=2102.96s)]
*  We've talked a lot about developers so far. If you had to channel your product view, [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=2108.88s)]
*  and just conjecture on what these advances in scaling laws, in representation learning, [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=2114.32s)]
*  in teaching the models to reason faster, better, cheaper. What will these advances mean for end [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=2120.72s)]
*  users in terms of how they consume, how they program, and they generally work with models? [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=2126.64s)]
*  What we think is that fast forward five years, everybody will be using their specialized models [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=2131.2799999999997s)]
*  within parts of complex applications and systems. Developers will be very looking at latency. So [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=2138.4s)]
*  they will want to have for any specific task of the system, they will want to have the lowest cost [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=2145.2s)]
*  and lowest latency. And the way you make that happen is that you ask for the task, ask for user [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=2152.08s)]
*  preferences, ask for what you want the model to do, and you try to make them as small as possible [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=2158.16s)]
*  and as suitable to the task as possible. And so I think that's the way we'll be evolving [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=2164.16s)]
*  on the developer space. I also think that generally speaking, the fact that we have access to large [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=2168.64s)]
*  language models is going to reform completely the way we interact with machines. And the internet [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=2174.88s)]
*  of five years from now is going to be much different, much more interactive, because I think [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=2180.1600000000003s)]
*  this is already unlocked. I mean, it's just about making very good applications with very fast systems, [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=2185.6s)]
*  with very fast models. So yeah, very exciting times ahead. So what would those interaction [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=2190.88s)]
*  modalities look like? Yeah, so that's very interesting. And I think in games, for instance, [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=2195.92s)]
*  it's going to be fascinating. We've seen some very good applications. You do need to have small [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=2200.72s)]
*  models because you want to have swarms of it and it starts to be a bit costly if it's too big. [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=2205.52s)]
*  But having them interact is just going to make pretty complex systems and interesting systems [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=2210.9599999999996s)]
*  to observe and to use. So we have a few friends making applications in the enterprise space, [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=2216.0s)]
*  with different persona playing different roles, relying on the same language model, [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=2224.72s)]
*  but with different prompts and different fine tuning. And I think that's going to be quite [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=2228.64s)]
*  interesting as well to look at. As I said, complex applications in three years time are just going to [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=2234.16s)]
*  use different parts, different LLMs for different parts. And that's going to be quite exciting. [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=2240.4s)]
*  Well, what's your call to action? To builders, researchers, folks who are excited about the space, [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=2245.8399999999997s)]
*  what would you ask them to do? I would take Mistral models and try to build amazing applications. [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=2251.2799999999997s)]
*  The way many developers had. It's not that hard. The stack is starting to be pretty clear, [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=2258.8s)]
*  pretty efficient. You only need a couple of GPUs. You cannot even do it on your MacBook Pro if you [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=2265.68s)]
*  want. It's going to be a bit hot, but it's good enough to do interesting applications. [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=2271.52s)]
*  Really, the way we do software today is very different from the way we did it from last year. [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=2278.56s)]
*  And so I'm really calling application makers to action because we are going to try to enable them [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=2283.04s)]
*  to build as fast as possible. Thank you so much for listening to the A16C podcast. What we're [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhASk7rZsmU&t=2290.0s)]
