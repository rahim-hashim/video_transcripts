# 2024 Big Ideas: AI-First Games That Never End with Jonathan Lai
**The a16z Podcast:** [December 16, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZzn1buVsgg)
*  Precision delivery of medicine. Entertainment franchise games absolutely exploding. Small [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZzn1buVsgg&t=0.0s)]
*  modular reactors and the nuclear renaissance. Plus, AI moving into very complex workflows. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZzn1buVsgg&t=6.4s)]
*  Now these were just a few of the major tech innovations that partners at A16Z predicted [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZzn1buVsgg&t=13.44s)]
*  last year. And our partners are back. We just dropped our list of over 40 plus big ideas for [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZzn1buVsgg&t=18.88s)]
*  2024. A compilation of critical advancements across all our verticals. From smart energy [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZzn1buVsgg&t=25.439999999999998s)]
*  grids to crime detecting computer vision to democratizing miracle drugs like GLP-1s [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZzn1buVsgg&t=31.04s)]
*  or even AI moving from black box to clear box. You can find the full list of 40 plus [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZzn1buVsgg&t=36.56s)]

*  description below. But on deck today, you will hear directly from one of our partners as we dive [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZzn1buVsgg&t=51.2s)]
*  even more deeply into their big idea. What's the why now? What opportunities and what challenges [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZzn1buVsgg&t=57.52s)]
*  are on the horizon? And how can you get involved? Let's dive in. As a reminder, the content here is [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZzn1buVsgg&t=62.96s)]

*  in the companies discussed in this podcast. For more details, including a link to our investments, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZzn1buVsgg&t=87.28s)]
*  please see a16z.com slash disclosures. Hi everyone. I'm Jonathan Lai. I'm a general [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZzn1buVsgg&t=92.56s)]
*  partner on A16Z games. And my big idea for 2024 is AI first games that never end. So in 2024, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZzn1buVsgg&t=102.48s)]
*  I believe we'll see the first cohort of AI first games from creators that by which large language [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZzn1buVsgg&t=113.68s)]
*  models to enable novel game systems and mechanics. And while much of the early discourse on generative [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZzn1buVsgg&t=119.76s)]
*  AI in games is focused on how AI can make game creators more efficient, I actually believe the [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZzn1buVsgg&t=126.08000000000001s)]
*  largest opportunity long term is leveraging AI to reinvent the nature of the games themselves. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZzn1buVsgg&t=131.52s)]
*  So creating never ending games that engage and retain users for a very, very long time. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZzn1buVsgg&t=139.20000000000002s)]
*  A couple of examples of this. Generative agents powered by large language models [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZzn1buVsgg&t=145.60000000000002s)]
*  can create incredibly lifelike companions and emergent social behavior. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZzn1buVsgg&t=150.48000000000002s)]
*  So in the game world, we have a very unique play theory. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZzn1buVsgg&t=154.4s)]
*  Turbo charging games have heavily utilized non-player characters or NPCs. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZzn1buVsgg&t=158.16000000000003s)]
*  Personalized character builders and narrative systems will enable every player [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZzn1buVsgg&t=164.16000000000003s)]
*  to have a fully unique and personalized play theory of their favorite game. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZzn1buVsgg&t=168.8s)]
*  And in the game worlds themselves can no longer, will no longer be rendered, but actually generated [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZzn1buVsgg&t=173.20000000000002s)]
*  a new player onboarding itself is poised to be reinvented. And then my idea said every game [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZzn1buVsgg&t=179.04s)]
*  is potentially will potentially be redesigned around an AI copilot with the mantra of good alone, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZzn1buVsgg&t=186.4s)]
*  great with AI and best for friends. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZzn1buVsgg&t=192.64s)]
*  Jonathan, you mentioned several opportunities or even you could say fundamental shifts [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZzn1buVsgg&t=195.04s)]
*  in game development from never ending worlds to convincing NPCs to personalized real time rendering. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZzn1buVsgg&t=199.68s)]
*  I don't know which of these upgrades you are already seeing built perhaps, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZzn1buVsgg&t=206.24s)]
*  and also which you're most excited about. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZzn1buVsgg&t=210.24s)]
*  Yes. So we generally think of the AI revolution in games is happening in two waves. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZzn1buVsgg&t=212.96s)]
*  The first wave is building the same game, but faster and higher quality with AI tools and [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZzn1buVsgg&t=218.24s)]
*  infrastructure to empower game developers. And the exciting thing is that this first wave is [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZzn1buVsgg&t=224.0s)]
*  already happening right now. It's not a theory, it's reality. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZzn1buVsgg&t=229.12s)]
*  So we surveyed 230 game studios earlier this year. And it turns out that 87% of them are already [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZzn1buVsgg&t=233.52s)]
*  using generative AI tools. And so some of the products that they named include Chat GPT, [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZzn1buVsgg&t=240.96s)]
*  Mid Journey, 11 Labs, KD, KDEM, Adobe Firefly, GitHub Copilot, et cetera. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZzn1buVsgg&t=246.0s)]
*  And the majority of these students rated, sorry, the majority of these studios rated the impact [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZzn1buVsgg&t=252.24s)]
*  of these tools as transformational, which is pretty incredible. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZzn1buVsgg&t=256.72s)]
*  The second wave, which we consider even more exciting, is building entirely new sets of AI [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZzn1buVsgg&t=259.76s)]
*  native games that are uniquely enabled by AI. And those are the examples I write about in my big [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZzn1buVsgg&t=265.92s)]
*  idea for 2024. And so dynamic worlds that can be generated in real time based upon a player's [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZzn1buVsgg&t=272.4s)]
*  actions, you know, lifelike AI companions, never ending sort of choose your own adventure games, [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZzn1buVsgg&t=278.08s)]
*  we're still very early in seeing what those new AI native game experience tools are doing. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZzn1buVsgg&t=283.92s)]
*  This might be like, and so you've seen a couple of prototypes, some interesting sort of proof of [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZzn1buVsgg&t=289.84s)]
*  concepts. But in general, the playing field is wide open. And that's the exciting thing. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZzn1buVsgg&t=294.15999999999997s)]
*  For the folks that do get it right, like these are these are the ideas that can potentially create [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZzn1buVsgg&t=301.76s)]
*  entirely new genres to captivate, you know, hundreds of millions of people. And that's what [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZzn1buVsgg&t=307.52s)]
*  we're incredibly excited about looking at in 2024. Yeah, I think I think what you're picturing is [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZzn1buVsgg&t=311.76s)]
*  really important, because what you're saying is, is we're not just incrementally optimizing [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZzn1buVsgg&t=317.44s)]
*  existing games, you're really describing a fully new game environment, fully new way of thinking [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZzn1buVsgg&t=324.64s)]
*  about games. And I love this mantra that you included, which is good alone, great with AI, [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZzn1buVsgg&t=330.16s)]
*  and best with friends. Can you elaborate on what that means? And maybe how it shifts or has the [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZzn1buVsgg&t=334.56s)]
*  potential to shift the way that people currently think about both building games and also playing [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZzn1buVsgg&t=340.8s)]
*  games. So many of the biggest schemes in the world today, you think about Fortnite, Call of Duty, [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZzn1buVsgg&t=345.6s)]
*  League of Legends, they utilize AI primarily for onboarding and practice. So before you play against [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZzn1buVsgg&t=351.20000000000005s)]
*  real human opponents, you might play against AI bots, and then enable you to practice, [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZzn1buVsgg&t=358.08000000000004s)]
*  build confidence, learn all the controls, get your hand eye coordination down. And so it's [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZzn1buVsgg&t=362.96000000000004s)]
*  sort of a warm up before you jump into the real game, quote unquote. I think one of the promises [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZzn1buVsgg&t=367.28000000000003s)]
*  of generative agents is in elevating agents like the AI agents from a warm up into the core game [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZzn1buVsgg&t=373.04s)]
*  itself. And so one example of that that I find fascinating, this is concept of an AI companion [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZzn1buVsgg&t=379.28000000000003s)]
*  for every game. So let's say at the beginning of a game, like you're starting Call of Duty, for [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZzn1buVsgg&t=385.6s)]
*  example, you might customize your character. And let's say you also customize an AI companion that [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZzn1buVsgg&t=390.16s)]
*  you can bring with you into the game. And this companion can play the entire game with you, [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZzn1buVsgg&t=396.56s)]
*  like either as on the same team or against you if needed. And it might comment on the experience, [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZzn1buVsgg&t=402.56s)]
*  it understands the world around it, it keeps you company. When your friends aren't there to play [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZzn1buVsgg&t=409.59999999999997s)]
*  with you, it learns from all of your preferences over time and helps you out and generally tries [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZzn1buVsgg&t=414.48s)]
*  its best to make sure that you have a great time. And so such an agent wouldn't replace playing [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZzn1buVsgg&t=419.2s)]
*  with humans, but it would certainly be better than playing by yourself. And so that's what I mean by [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZzn1buVsgg&t=424.8s)]
*  designing games that are good alone, they can be played single player, they can also be played [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZzn1buVsgg&t=430.23999999999995s)]
*  with an AI, and that's great with AI. But of course, it's best if you have human friends to [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZzn1buVsgg&t=434.64s)]
*  play with. And those different modalities can be mixed and matched, right, depending on the game [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZzn1buVsgg&t=439.76s)]
*  and depending on the time. Yes. What gives you the confidence, though, that these are the type of [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZzn1buVsgg&t=444.47999999999996s)]
*  games when we're talking about the inclusion of AI, becoming hyper personalized potentially, [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZzn1buVsgg&t=450.08s)]
*  what gives you the confidence that those are the type of games that people want? And I'm asking that [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZzn1buVsgg&t=455.68s)]
*  as it relates specifically to community and the fact that games really are these communal, [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZzn1buVsgg&t=460.72s)]
*  interactive environments where people have somewhat of a shared reality. And so if everything is [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZzn1buVsgg&t=466.64s)]
*  hyper personalized, I'm curious to know your perspective about how that shifts people's [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZzn1buVsgg&t=472.56s)]
*  ability to build community. And what are you seeing in terms of you mentioned some of this [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZzn1buVsgg&t=477.36s)]
*  is already being implemented? What are you seeing that gives you the indication that [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZzn1buVsgg&t=481.6s)]
*  this hyper personalization or inclusion of AI is something that people really want? [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZzn1buVsgg&t=485.76000000000005s)]
*  So the interesting thing about games is that the games industry has actually embraced AI for decades. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZzn1buVsgg&t=491.52000000000004s)]
*  And so in a way, the technology that the latest expression of the technology, [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZzn1buVsgg&t=498.32000000000005s)]
*  large language models is new, but the consumer behavior, the patterns around it are actually [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZzn1buVsgg&t=501.84000000000003s)]
*  already existed. And so that's what gives me confidence that there's demand for some of these [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZzn1buVsgg&t=508.40000000000003s)]
*  new types of gameplay that we talk about. So take AI companions, for example, it might sound like a [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZzn1buVsgg&t=513.2s)]
*  crazy idea at first blush, but so many iconic games, they already have AI companions that are [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZzn1buVsgg&t=519.6s)]
*  pre-scripted, and they don't use large language models. But players have still developed deep, [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZzn1buVsgg&t=525.44s)]
*  deep attachments with them. A great example is the Halo franchise. There's an AI companion in that [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZzn1buVsgg&t=530.96s)]
*  game called Cortana, and she talks to Master Chief comments and what he's doing basically like is a [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZzn1buVsgg&t=536.16s)]
*  chip that rides in his helmet. And she tells him where to go next when he's lost and is there from [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZzn1buVsgg&t=542.7199999999999s)]
*  the beginning to the end of like almost every Halo game. And there are millions of people all [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZzn1buVsgg&t=547.76s)]
*  over the world that adore Cortana, right? Fan fiction about Cortana and the Halo universe, [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZzn1buVsgg&t=553.28s)]
*  to the point where I believe Microsoft has integrated Cortana into its core Windows search [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZzn1buVsgg&t=560.0799999999999s)]
*  function. And in another game, a favorite of mine, The Last of Us, which is a famous Naughty Dog [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZzn1buVsgg&t=565.2s)]
*  franchise that was recently turned into an HBO show, you play as Joel, but then you have Ellie [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZzn1buVsgg&t=571.36s)]
*  as an AI companion, and she follows you around for basically the entire game. She adapts to [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZzn1buVsgg&t=577.12s)]
*  your behavior. If you're sneaking somewhere, she'll also sneak with you. If you're just in a fire [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZzn1buVsgg&t=582.0s)]
*  fight, she helps you out in combat situations. And she has a fully fleshed out personality that [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZzn1buVsgg&t=586.4000000000001s)]
*  you learn more about over the course of the game. And so from that perspective, AI companions have [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZzn1buVsgg&t=591.28s)]
*  already existed and are very, very popular, right? And so the idea of just turbocharging [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZzn1buVsgg&t=597.52s)]
*  this with large language models to make them more lifelike and enable them to have a wider [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZzn1buVsgg&t=602.9599999999999s)]
*  range of expression and behavior, I think is going to be very well accepted by players. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZzn1buVsgg&t=607.4399999999999s)]
*  On hyper-personalization, which is the question that you were asking around [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZzn1buVsgg&t=613.04s)]
*  on storytelling and how that works with communities, I'm optimistic based on the fact that [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZzn1buVsgg&t=617.04s)]
*  personalization already happens to a large degree in games. And so role-playing games like Baldur's [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZzn1buVsgg&t=625.1999999999999s)]
*  Gate 3 have incredibly detailed character builders where you can customize everything from your skin [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZzn1buVsgg&t=631.4399999999999s)]
*  color to the highlights in your hair, to the tattoos in your face. And people spend hours [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZzn1buVsgg&t=636.8s)]
*  customizing their avatars, right? Like their entire YouTube channels dedicated to how to create [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZzn1buVsgg&t=641.28s)]
*  the most lifelike or the most badass character for each of these games. And let's not forget [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZzn1buVsgg&t=646.16s)]
*  that a huge portion of the revenue in games like Fortnite and League of Legends comes from selling [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZzn1buVsgg&t=652.88s)]
*  skins, which are personalized virtual clothing for how your character might look in game. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZzn1buVsgg&t=658.0s)]
*  One of the oldest RPGs of all time is Dungeons and Dragons, which by definition is a personalized [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZzn1buVsgg&t=664.16s)]
*  adventure that is told by a human narrator, a dungeon master, a game master, who basically [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZzn1buVsgg&t=670.1600000000001s)]
*  crafts an improv adventure with you and your group of friends. And so these are just two examples of [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZzn1buVsgg&t=676.08s)]
*  personalization in games and an AI companion in games. But I'm optimistic the players have [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZzn1buVsgg&t=683.0400000000001s)]
*  already embraced many of the concepts that generative AI is terrible charging. And so from [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZzn1buVsgg&t=688.08s)]
*  that perspective, we're not inventing entirely new consumer behavior. We're just making it easier [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZzn1buVsgg&t=693.2800000000001s)]
*  for players to do what they already want. Yeah, absolutely. And you mentioned a few, [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZzn1buVsgg&t=699.12s)]
*  you could say age old games, Halo, Dungeons and Dragons, they've been around for quite some time. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZzn1buVsgg&t=704.32s)]
*  Do you see this new technology or is that you said a technology that has been ingrained in games for [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZzn1buVsgg&t=709.84s)]
*  also some time? Do you see that really benefiting the incumbents who already have these large player [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZzn1buVsgg&t=715.28s)]
*  bases? Or do you see this kind of fundamental shift where you're going to see completely new [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZzn1buVsgg&t=720.48s)]
*  winners in this completely new era? How do you think about maybe some of the new entrants versus [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZzn1buVsgg&t=726.0s)]
*  the incumbents and who really wins? So I think the incumbents, let's call them sort of the big [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZzn1buVsgg&t=730.4s)]
*  triple A game developers and publishers, they are already going deep into the wave one AI tools and [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZzn1buVsgg&t=736.0s)]
*  infrastructure that I spoke about. And so I think almost all of them are using chat, GPT, Mid Journey, [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZzn1buVsgg&t=743.84s)]
*  Adobe Firefly, a bunch of these software tools earlier. And I think they will benefit hugely [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZzn1buVsgg&t=749.52s)]
*  from them as they will enable them to make higher quality games faster, get more shots and goal and [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZzn1buVsgg&t=755.76s)]
*  so on. I am skeptical, however, that the largest developers will be the ones that create incredibly [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZzn1buVsgg&t=761.04s)]
*  innovative AI native games of the sort that we spoke about as the wave two games. But there are [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZzn1buVsgg&t=766.96s)]
*  many reasons. But one of them is that if you're a large developer, your business revolves around IP. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZzn1buVsgg&t=774.3199999999999s)]
*  So you typically have a few key franchises, you know, Halo, Dungeons and Dragons, World of Warcraft, [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZzn1buVsgg&t=780.88s)]
*  Call of Duty, and your business revolves around launching sequels that are franchises every few [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZzn1buVsgg&t=786.0s)]
*  years. And so you don't actually need to take that much risk and shipping these sequels. But in most [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZzn1buVsgg&t=791.52s)]
*  cases, the players themselves actually aren't looking for something too different. Like the [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZzn1buVsgg&t=798.08s)]
*  next Call of Duty title was like Comfort Feud. You know exactly what you're going to get. And [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZzn1buVsgg&t=802.8s)]
*  that's why you enjoy it. So I think the business model of these large incumbents, I think, doesn't [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZzn1buVsgg&t=807.12s)]
*  support taking too much risk. So I think that's one reason. I think second, I posit that the first [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZzn1buVsgg&t=813.04s)]
*  generation of these AI native games might end up actually looking really silly to traditional game [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZzn1buVsgg&t=821.04s)]
*  developers. And so they might not actually take them seriously at first. And so take mobile games, [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZzn1buVsgg&t=826.72s)]
*  for example, which was the last sort of major paradigm shift in games. The winners in mobile [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZzn1buVsgg&t=831.92s)]
*  games were largely new companies, Supercell, Keen, Zynga, but not the PC console incumbents, [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZzn1buVsgg&t=838.4799999999999s)]
*  right? It wasn't Electronic Arts or Activision or Microsoft. And I bet a large reason for this was [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZzn1buVsgg&t=845.76s)]
*  that if you were an executive producer at Activision and you looked at a game like Candy Brush in the [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZzn1buVsgg&t=851.92s)]
*  beginning, you probably thought, hey, this is like really silly, right? Like graphics are really bad. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZzn1buVsgg&t=856.72s)]
*  Like, you know, there's no multiplayer on this thing, right? Like it's a really, really simple [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZzn1buVsgg&t=861.52s)]
*  puzzle game. And so how can this possibly be good, right? Like how many people will play this thing? [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZzn1buVsgg&t=868.0s)]
*  But what I think they underestimated is that with each new paradigm of games, [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZzn1buVsgg&t=873.6s)]
*  a new set of players also comes into the ecosystem. So the folks that played Candy Crush were, for the [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZzn1buVsgg&t=877.9200000000001s)]
*  most part, older women. And there was an entirely different demographic from the young men that [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZzn1buVsgg&t=883.6s)]
*  played Call of Duty, for example, right? But then that effect was that it expanded the total pie [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZzn1buVsgg&t=888.72s)]
*  for games, like the gaming team increased. And over the course of that, it created several valuable [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZzn1buVsgg&t=894.32s)]
*  companies. A lot of more recent examples, take a product like Character AI, where you have millions [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZzn1buVsgg&t=899.28s)]
*  of people that chat with like their favorite sort of AI characters. I would guess that the majority [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZzn1buVsgg&t=907.6s)]
*  of the users of Character AI don't describe it as a game, but you could squint and say, hey, [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZzn1buVsgg&t=913.76s)]
*  like this is a consumer experience that is just as engaging as playing the game. But it's probably [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZzn1buVsgg&t=920.4s)]
*  not on the radar of any of the traditional game developers, the incumbents that we just talked [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZzn1buVsgg&t=926.32s)]
*  about. Yeah, so I think in that same vein, I think the most innovative AI native experiences [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZzn1buVsgg&t=931.2s)]
*  are more likely to be created by startups and teams that are just getting going and [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZzn1buVsgg&t=940.1600000000001s)]
*  are bringing that fresh perspective as opposed to coming at it with a lot of history and baggage [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZzn1buVsgg&t=943.9200000000001s)]
*  around existing IP that they need to shepherd. Yeah, I mean, I think that's such a good point [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZzn1buVsgg&t=952.72s)]
*  about just the things that are emerging that people just would not even describe as a game. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZzn1buVsgg&t=957.36s)]
*  But if you really think about it, are not so different fundamentally from games. Maybe super [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZzn1buVsgg&t=962.96s)]
*  quickly, can we touch on the business model? Because as these things fundamentally take new [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZzn1buVsgg&t=969.2s)]
*  shapes and forms, so to do the things that people are willing to pay for. But also when we think [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZzn1buVsgg&t=974.64s)]
*  about AI, the cost structure is a little bit different too, right? If you're rendering things [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZzn1buVsgg&t=980.8000000000001s)]
*  in real time that has a real inherent cost to it. And so maybe you could just speak quickly to how [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZzn1buVsgg&t=985.28s)]
*  you might see the business models evolving, just like we saw with mobile. And then also, [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZzn1buVsgg&t=990.4s)]
*  maybe things that developers should keep in mind if they are building these new games and [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZzn1buVsgg&t=996.88s)]
*  are considering completely new business models. Yeah. So one of the challenges is that games as [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZzn1buVsgg&t=1002.48s)]
*  a business model have trended towards two models. So one is free to play with a majority of users [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZzn1buVsgg&t=1007.6s)]
*  actually around 90 to 95% on average play a game for free. And then the minority, 5 to 10% actually [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZzn1buVsgg&t=1014.24s)]
*  monetize. And so the free users entertain the monetizing users and so they pay off their time [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZzn1buVsgg&t=1021.52s)]
*  even if they don't spend money. And so some of the biggest games in the world, like League of Legends, [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZzn1buVsgg&t=1027.52s)]
*  like Fortnite are free to play games. But then the second business model is a premium [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZzn1buVsgg&t=1032.56s)]
*  game. And so a game that is just sold for 20, 30, 40, 50 bucks, you pay for that game upfront, [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZzn1buVsgg&t=1039.2800000000002s)]
*  and then you never spend again basically after that. The challenge is that with an AI game, [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZzn1buVsgg&t=1046.3200000000002s)]
*  if you have a game that's running a large language model in the cloud, the influence costs of serving [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZzn1buVsgg&t=1052.4s)]
*  users dynamically generated worlds or tax would probably make either of these models unprofitable [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZzn1buVsgg&t=1057.1200000000001s)]
*  right off the bat. But because you're monetizing the user right up front for 50 or 60 bucks, [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZzn1buVsgg&t=1063.12s)]
*  and then you're not in a premium game sale, and then you're not getting any more revenue going [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZzn1buVsgg&t=1069.6799999999998s)]
*  forward. Or in a free to play model, like 90% of the users are actually just a cost, [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZzn1buVsgg&t=1073.9199999999998s)]
*  right? Because they're not actually spending any money in the game. My guess is that [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZzn1buVsgg&t=1079.36s)]
*  companies like Mid Journey or Character AI have been able to address this with a subscription model. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZzn1buVsgg&t=1086.4799999999998s)]
*  And so basically, every power user pays for their own sort of like influence costs, so to speak. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZzn1buVsgg&t=1091.92s)]
*  And we could see that subscription model also become the default business model for AI games. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZzn1buVsgg&t=1097.04s)]
*  And I think the gamers would be okay with it as long as they perceive that the value was there. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZzn1buVsgg&t=1102.5600000000002s)]
*  And as an interesting sort of side point, subscriptions have actually become more [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZzn1buVsgg&t=1108.4s)]
*  popular in games over the last sort of like five years, with the rise of services like Xbox Game [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZzn1buVsgg&t=1113.1200000000001s)]
*  Pass, Apple Arcade, and even inside individual games like Fortnite. They now have season [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZzn1buVsgg&t=1118.56s)]
*  subscriptions like the Battle Pass, where you play for a certain period of time and you subscribe [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZzn1buVsgg&t=1124.1599999999999s)]
*  up front and it unlocks to the Pokes over the course of the season. Yeah, so my guess is that [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZzn1buVsgg&t=1129.44s)]
*  subscriptions become more popular for AI games. Yeah, absolutely. One just super quick follow-up [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZzn1buVsgg&t=1135.6799999999998s)]
*  question there is if people are more linked to their game play, as in the time that they're [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZzn1buVsgg&t=1142.56s)]
*  spending in-game as it relates to inference, do you think that creates a negative feedback loop? [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZzn1buVsgg&t=1149.6s)]
*  Whereas right now, you can kind of like you choose to play a game and you can play it for quite some [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZzn1buVsgg&t=1155.36s)]
*  time and really get ingrained in it and you could say obsessed or addicted to it without additional [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZzn1buVsgg&t=1160.32s)]
*  cost. Do you see kind of adverse relationship there where all of a sudden if my inference is [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZzn1buVsgg&t=1167.04s)]
*  linearly tied to cost, that I may not be as likely to get as deeply involved in a game? [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZzn1buVsgg&t=1173.12s)]
*  Yeah, no, I think that's a great point that games will need to design around. I think the good news [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZzn1buVsgg&t=1181.92s)]
*  is that that same trade-off of time versus money also currently exists in free-to-play games. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZzn1buVsgg&t=1188.3999999999999s)]
*  So if you recall the early days of Facebook games, take for example Farmville, like the Zynga games, [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZzn1buVsgg&t=1194.8s)]
*  they actually attempted to gate the amount of time that you spend in the game behind an energy meter [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZzn1buVsgg&t=1203.84s)]
*  and so every day you would get call it 20 energy and every action in the game would cost like two [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZzn1buVsgg&t=1209.12s)]
*  or three energy. I don't know when your energy was gone, you could either take a break and then come [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZzn1buVsgg&t=1215.04s)]
*  back and play again tomorrow, that's how the term appointment gaming came about, or you could monetize [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZzn1buVsgg&t=1220.6399999999999s)]
*  and you could actually spend to refill your energy meter and that means that enables you to keep [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZzn1buVsgg&t=1225.9199999999998s)]
*  going. But you can imagine a similar thing happening with AI games where you have some [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZzn1buVsgg&t=1230.48s)]
*  measure of the influence cost for players and that's approximated by a virtual currency inside the [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZzn1buVsgg&t=1237.04s)]
*  game. I think it's just something that game developers will need to design around but I think [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZzn1buVsgg&t=1242.24s)]
*  that paradigm of like take what's balanced time versus money I think already exists. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZzn1buVsgg&t=1248.72s)]
*  Yeah that's a great point and you're bringing me back because I spent far too much time playing [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZzn1buVsgg&t=1255.68s)]
*  Farmville back in the day. But to close out, clearly there's opportunity on the table and I think it [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZzn1buVsgg&t=1259.52s)]
*  really does feel like there is this new era potentially of games and that's exciting. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZzn1buVsgg&t=1266.24s)]
*  So with that opportunity, where would you start if you're a builder in the ecosystem? What would [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZzn1buVsgg&t=1273.28s)]
*  you be looking at in 2024? Yeah it's very exciting. I would suggest that if you are excited about games, [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZzn1buVsgg&t=1279.52s)]
*  take your favorite game genre, whether it's a sports game like an MMO, even chess or poker [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZzn1buVsgg&t=1288.4s)]
*  or Dungeons and Dragons and try to reimagine on first principles what it could look like if [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZzn1buVsgg&t=1294.88s)]
*  you were to introduce generative AI into the core gameplay loop. And then see if you can hack [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZzn1buVsgg&t=1300.16s)]
*  together a prototype or team up with friends to hack something together and then come on over and [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZzn1buVsgg&t=1305.2s)]
*  show it to us. We love playing crazy games and wild ideas and the reality of the games industry [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZzn1buVsgg&t=1311.52s)]
*  is that some of the best games got started by solo developers or as mods and passion projects [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZzn1buVsgg&t=1318.4s)]
*  that are built by small teams. You know, Dota, PUBG, Counter-Strike, some of the most iconic games [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZzn1buVsgg&t=1325.04s)]
*  were built by very very small teams. And then I think an even more exciting thing is that anytime [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZzn1buVsgg&t=1332.48s)]
*  you have a new paradigm shift like we talked about mobile early on, I think the playing field [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZzn1buVsgg&t=1339.28s)]
*  advantage goes to new teams, the folks that are coming in at the brush perspective. And my guess [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZzn1buVsgg&t=1345.2s)]
*  is that the AI game teams that get it right might actually end up looking very different from the [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZzn1buVsgg&t=1352.56s)]
*  traditional game developers of today. And if you get it right, I think the potential is you can [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZzn1buVsgg&t=1359.2s)]
*  disrupt the $200 billion market and the fastest growing category of media today. So it's very [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZzn1buVsgg&t=1364.3999999999999s)]
*  exciting and we'd love to talk to you. All right, I hope you enjoyed this big idea. We do have a lot [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZzn1buVsgg&t=1370.1599999999999s)]
