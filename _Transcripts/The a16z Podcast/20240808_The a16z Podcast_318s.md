Video Description: Hang Chu, co-founder of Viggle, discusses redefining video creation by providing precise control over character movements and animations. Unlike traditional tools, Viggle simplifies generating lifelike animations using image and motion prompts, making it accessible to professionals and meme creators.

"For it to have real entertaining value, it has to work well. We're pretty serious about being silly," says Hang. He also talks about the critical role of R&D, strategies for achieving virality, personalizing content, and being open to unexpected product applications.

# Viggle: When Memes Become 3D
**The a16z Podcast:** [August 08, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IebslwhPzFo)
*  For it to have anything to have real entertaining value, it has to work. It has to work well [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IebslwhPzFo&t=0.0s)]
*  So we are pretty serious about being silly and it takes a quite a bit of rigorous research to do that [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IebslwhPzFo&t=5.84s)]
*  Hi, I'm Hang and I'm working on Vigo. Vigo is we call this [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IebslwhPzFo&t=22.64s)]
*  Controllable video generation unlike current text to video generators. We want to provide precise control [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IebslwhPzFo&t=27.76s)]
*  We want the users be able to precisely specify the motion and the character we were [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IebslwhPzFo&t=34.32s)]
*  pretty heavy users for existing [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IebslwhPzFo&t=41.2s)]
*  image generators video generators before and one of our our [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IebslwhPzFo&t=44.480000000000004s)]
*  biggest complaint is is it's hard to [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IebslwhPzFo&t=50.24s)]
*  Learn that there's a steep learning curve [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IebslwhPzFo&t=53.2s)]
*  So we wanted to make sure it's it's just simple to use the basic functionality is pretty simple you upload two prompts [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IebslwhPzFo&t=55.12s)]
*  Why is like image prompt the character the other is? [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IebslwhPzFo&t=61.32s)]
*  via a text or a video the motion prompt and then Vigo basically [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IebslwhPzFo&t=66.12s)]
*  synthesizes the same [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IebslwhPzFo&t=72.12s)]
*  Character and in that precise motion. So like in the very beginning we were mainly thinking of [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IebslwhPzFo&t=74.32s)]
*  Movie makers game makers use this might be like quick animation [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IebslwhPzFo&t=80.36s)]
*  Pre-visualization to for them. It is exactly pretty useful for that [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IebslwhPzFo&t=85.39999999999999s)]
*  And we've also seen the early users adopting to that but then we never anticipated [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IebslwhPzFo&t=88.75999999999999s)]
*  That's the meme source there was this template the Joker Lil Yali coming on the stage and there's a Joker character [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IebslwhPzFo&t=94.12s)]
*  that replaced on the video and we've seen [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IebslwhPzFo&t=100.56s)]
*  Millions of different characters just remixing the same moment [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IebslwhPzFo&t=104.4s)]
*  It's so easy to basically you can upload one image and then in just matter of seconds [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IebslwhPzFo&t=108.44s)]
*  You'll have yourself in basically in that same moment. It has this variety [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IebslwhPzFo&t=114.44s)]
*  Aspect of it. So we wanted to basically also adapt the product to those use cases and [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IebslwhPzFo&t=120.32s)]
*  We've also seen kind of accountant creators hoping onto this [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IebslwhPzFo&t=127.24s)]
*  They are [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IebslwhPzFo&t=131.84s)]
*  Actually reaching out to us like say can we can you feature our dance or song on your platform? [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IebslwhPzFo&t=132.96s)]
*  And then can we collaborate on promoting some of those that's been really interesting instead of uploading a video [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IebslwhPzFo&t=138.8s)]
*  I'll actually use some a template [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IebslwhPzFo&t=145.68s)]
*  So as you can see we have a quite a bit of template there a lot of more dancing and sports events [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IebslwhPzFo&t=148.32000000000002s)]
*  So if I may try for example [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IebslwhPzFo&t=154.32000000000002s)]
*  This one can also use accessing character, oh I'll use this one [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IebslwhPzFo&t=157.07999999999998s)]
*  and then generate so [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IebslwhPzFo&t=164.4s)]
*  Even it works for all [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IebslwhPzFo&t=167.92s)]
*  Viewpoints of the human body even if your prompt is only front-facing the model will try best to generate [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IebslwhPzFo&t=170.6s)]
*  full three 360 views of the body the creator community is [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IebslwhPzFo&t=176.51999999999998s)]
*  Where we got the best templates like the variety actually comes from all those creative ideas [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IebslwhPzFo&t=180.8s)]
*  So it's for us is all about empowering those creative community first [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IebslwhPzFo&t=187.92000000000002s)]
*  Making sure they have what they want. They have the best tools. They have early access to newer features. They have almost [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IebslwhPzFo&t=193.20000000000002s)]
*  Private channels, so we are basically aiming to providing the best support for the creator community [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IebslwhPzFo&t=200.24s)]
*  We are really hoping to extend this character model to more the rest of the world like [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IebslwhPzFo&t=206.76000000000002s)]
*  objects and the scenes [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IebslwhPzFo&t=213.36s)]
*  So I think those are two general classes towards modeling the the real world [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IebslwhPzFo&t=215.04000000000002s)]
*  One is more on we would seen this pixel by pixel level approach [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IebslwhPzFo&t=220.68s)]
*  So diffusion models are really good at that [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IebslwhPzFo&t=225.76s)]
*  But it has this drawback of it's really hard to manipulate pixels and the real world is essentially it's really is physical [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IebslwhPzFo&t=228.04000000000002s)]
*  So pixel is not really a efficient at ripstation for it [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IebslwhPzFo&t=236.4s)]
*  But it has the advantage of you can train with any video and generates anything and the hope there is we feel it up [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IebslwhPzFo&t=239.8s)]
*  to a certain extent a controllability will kind of emerge of a we're taking another [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IebslwhPzFo&t=247.4s)]
*  Kind of different paths in that we want to nail down [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IebslwhPzFo&t=253.48000000000002s)]
*  Controllability first making sure it's just as precise as [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IebslwhPzFo&t=257.16s)]
*  Controllable as a graphics engine and then we scale up from there [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IebslwhPzFo&t=261.08s)]
*  So I think this how those two passes involved and how actually they can be combined into like the one [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IebslwhPzFo&t=265.6s)]
*  immersive experience that's be really [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IebslwhPzFo&t=275.08s)]
*  Fighting the Vigo is a new way to consume content before AI [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IebslwhPzFo&t=278.0s)]
*  It was mainly like if I like the moment I will share it [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IebslwhPzFo&t=282.44s)]
*  There is a deeper engagement you can have with that moment [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IebslwhPzFo&t=285.8s)]
*  I can basically I left this moment so much that I want to put my own avatar in it [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IebslwhPzFo&t=289.16s)]
*  It's almost like in the parallel universe. I want to see how this looks like relive that moment myself [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IebslwhPzFo&t=294.8s)]
*  So this is a new kind of content consumption. This will be a new way [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IebslwhPzFo&t=299.76s)]
*  more entertainment and more control but more [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IebslwhPzFo&t=304.96000000000004s)]
*  personalized [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IebslwhPzFo&t=308.52s)]
*  custom experience [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IebslwhPzFo&t=309.56s)]
*  You [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IebslwhPzFo&t=315.68s)]
