# Is It Still Worth Learning to Code? Amjad Masad Weighs In
**The a16z Podcast:** [April 07, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WauuF_KmBvY)
*  I have to ask the question, which is just simply, is it still worth learning to code? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WauuF_KmBvY&t=0.0s)]
*  To me, it feels like it's more worth it today because it's a tide that raises all boats, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WauuF_KmBvY&t=8.9s)]
*  right? [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WauuF_KmBvY&t=15.32s)]
*  Like we said, the 10X becomes a thousand X, but like a 0.1X becomes a 10X, right? [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WauuF_KmBvY&t=16.32s)]
*  So if you're someone who's previously maybe whose impact with coding is going to be very [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WauuF_KmBvY&t=23.12s)]
*  minimal, now it's going to be meaningful because there's this rising tide. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WauuF_KmBvY&t=30.84s)]
*  Previously you learn a bit of coding, you learn how to plug together some frameworks [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WauuF_KmBvY&t=36.96s)]
*  and create some UI. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WauuF_KmBvY&t=41.08s)]
*  Going from that to doing a little bit of parsing, for example, parsing some text on that or [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WauuF_KmBvY&t=43.0s)]
*  not, it's very hard. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WauuF_KmBvY&t=48.400000000000006s)]
*  Now you can just use GPT-3 to do the parsing, right? [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WauuF_KmBvY&t=51.08s)]
*  So you're doing the basic coding and then anytime you find something that's like a little [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WauuF_KmBvY&t=54.6s)]
*  difficult you can plug in GPT-3 in that place. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WauuF_KmBvY&t=59.16s)]
*  And so I actually think that programming becomes more fun and impactful because of that. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WauuF_KmBvY&t=62.56s)]
*  So it's like totally worth doing, even more worth doing than before because you're going [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WauuF_KmBvY&t=68.68s)]
*  to get more done. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WauuF_KmBvY&t=73.96000000000001s)]
*  You're not going to get as stuck. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WauuF_KmBvY&t=74.96000000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WauuF_KmBvY&t=77.56s)]
*  I think to how quickly people can probably learn, I wonder if you have any data on this, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WauuF_KmBvY&t=78.56s)]
*  but when I learned, I don't know why I did this, but I decided to track how many hours [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WauuF_KmBvY&t=82.68s)]
*  I was spending from when I first started to when I actually felt proficient. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WauuF_KmBvY&t=88.0s)]
*  And for me, that number ended up being 300 hours. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WauuF_KmBvY&t=93.12s)]
*  Maybe I was slow, maybe I was fast, I don't know. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WauuF_KmBvY&t=96.84s)]
*  But it kind of shocked me in a way because if you actually distill 300 hours down to [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WauuF_KmBvY&t=99.52000000000001s)]
*  If you were learning full time, which I know not everyone can do, that's less than two [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WauuF_KmBvY&t=106.24s)]
*  months. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WauuF_KmBvY&t=110.16s)]
*  And now I think to the tools we have today and I'm like, gosh, we can probably do it [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WauuF_KmBvY&t=111.16s)]
*  way faster than 300 hours. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WauuF_KmBvY&t=114.6s)]
*  So any thoughts on how quickly someone can actually get to proficiency with the tools [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WauuF_KmBvY&t=116.2s)]
*  that we have? [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WauuF_KmBvY&t=121.24s)]
*  So I know you're fond of Balajee and he was on your podcast. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WauuF_KmBvY&t=122.56s)]
*  He has this beef with media and so he wanted to show that the New York Times is a bunch [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WauuF_KmBvY&t=127.6s)]
*  of bots, right? [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WauuF_KmBvY&t=132.76s)]
*  So he put in a bounty on Replit. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WauuF_KmBvY&t=135.44s)]
*  He was one of our early adopters of bounties and he wrote, it's like, I want someone to [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WauuF_KmBvY&t=138.95999999999998s)]
*  build the GPT Times instead of like New York Times, but just totally based on tweets. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WauuF_KmBvY&t=144.92s)]
*  You give it a tweet and it goes and generate an article written in the style of the New [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WauuF_KmBvY&t=153.72s)]
*  York Times. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WauuF_KmBvY&t=159.39999999999998s)]
*  So actually it should be up now. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WauuF_KmBvY&t=160.56s)]
*  So if you go to the GPT Times.com, so that's basically like the site that was built using [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WauuF_KmBvY&t=163.44s)]
*  the bounties program. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WauuF_KmBvY&t=169.76s)]
*  And the person who built it was on day 80, I think of 100 days of Python. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WauuF_KmBvY&t=172.12s)]
*  So 100 days of Python is one of our programs to learn how to code. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WauuF_KmBvY&t=178.56s)]
*  And we say you can do a day of Python in basically 20 minutes. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WauuF_KmBvY&t=182.96s)]
*  So if you was on day 80, spending 20 minutes, how many hours is that? [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WauuF_KmBvY&t=188.88s)]
*  That's 26 hours. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WauuF_KmBvY&t=193.16s)]
*  So in 26 hours, they were able to build an entire website using AI and earn $1,800 from [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WauuF_KmBvY&t=194.79999999999998s)]
*  biology. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WauuF_KmBvY&t=203.72s)]
*  So that's, I think your answer. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WauuF_KmBvY&t=204.72s)]
*  I mean, maybe that guy was an outlier, but we're seeing it all the time where it's like, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WauuF_KmBvY&t=206.84s)]
*  it's taking weeks for someone to get to a place where they can build things. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WauuF_KmBvY&t=213.35999999999999s)]
*  And I think that's really what matters. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WauuF_KmBvY&t=217.36s)]
*  I think that's incredible because I think one of the best decisions I made was learning [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WauuF_KmBvY&t=219.4s)]
*  to code because you just, to me, it really was like a foundational shift in understanding [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WauuF_KmBvY&t=224.0s)]
*  the world around me. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WauuF_KmBvY&t=228.84s)]
*  Because again, so much of what we do is digital. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WauuF_KmBvY&t=229.84s)]
*  It is online. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WauuF_KmBvY&t=232.76000000000002s)]
*  And so even if you don't want to go and be the developer that's hired to build products, [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WauuF_KmBvY&t=233.76000000000002s)]
*  just having that understanding. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WauuF_KmBvY&t=238.32000000000002s)]
*  And it's kind of crazy when you think about it, if you were to actually position that [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WauuF_KmBvY&t=239.8s)]
*  before and after to people and say, well, now it only takes 30 hours. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WauuF_KmBvY&t=243.64s)]
*  That's like, you could do that in a week. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WauuF_KmBvY&t=248.23999999999998s)]
*  You could take four days off from your job, go through this. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WauuF_KmBvY&t=250.44s)]
*  And I know there's a difference between the 20 minutes a day and a straight shot, but [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WauuF_KmBvY&t=254.83999999999997s)]
*  that's pretty incredible. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WauuF_KmBvY&t=259.24s)]
