# Living Up the Promise of A True Second Brain with Nat Eliason
**The a16z Podcast:** [September 18, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I)
*  Our brain isn't a filing cabinet. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=0.0s)]
*  It's very messy, it's very interconnected. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=2.4s)]
*  Is it us misunderstanding what we really need from these tools in the first place? [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=4.5600000000000005s)]
*  Your previous thoughts and work and effort being processed by this external cognitive entity, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=8.4s)]
*  that's like literally a second brain. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=14.4s)]
*  That would be incredible. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=16.4s)]
*  This new feature set does unlock something that I've been waiting for. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=18.0s)]
*  It's fun to organize your stuff, right? [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=21.92s)]
*  If you organize information, you will make more money, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=24.8s)]
*  you will be happier. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=28.16s)]
*  History has shown us this is not true. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=30.32s)]
*  If you think that you need a good writing app to write your book, you're just wrong. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=32.64s)]
*  Since the rise of the computer, humans have been gripped by the idea of having a second brain. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=39.68s)]
*  But has reality held up to that promise? [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=46.480000000000004s)]
*  How many people spend more time organizing their second brains [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=49.68s)]
*  instead of leveraging the information within them? [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=53.84s)]
*  How many people constantly look for a better to-do app [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=56.4s)]
*  instead of actually checking the to-dos that they're organizing? [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=59.199999999999996s)]
*  And how many people have an endless stream of data [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=62.56s)]
*  that they'd love to one day process, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=65.75999999999999s)]
*  but they just don't have the right tools or time to do so? [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=68.32s)]
*  Due to the structured, directive nature of computers to date, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=72.08s)]
*  computers have been a shell of maybe the second brain that we've long hoped for. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=75.44s)]
*  Still incredibly powerful, but also requiring discreet instruction from the director. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=79.6s)]
*  But within the last year, consumer AI has shown up to the party, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=85.2s)]
*  now capable of processing simple language prompts and interfacing with unstructured data, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=88.8s)]
*  possibly fundamentally changing this game. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=94.4s)]
*  So today we chat with writer, Nat Eliason. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=97.44s)]
*  Nat has tried the full gamut of knowledge management tools, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=100.8s)]
*  but he's also written prolifically for years, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=104.0s)]
*  read 250 plus books, created courses, grown viral social accounts, ran an agency, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=106.96000000000001s)]
*  and even recently inked a book deal. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=112.8s)]
*  And yet, even Nat questions the productivity promise of the current toolkit. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=115.67999999999999s)]
*  So can AI change things and enable our second brains to finally work for us? [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=121.36s)]
*  Let's find out. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=127.52s)]

*  For more details, please see A16Z.com slash disclosures. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=143.28s)]
*  All right, Nat, great to have you on the line. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=156.88s)]
*  Great to be talking about knowledge management. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=159.28s)]
*  At one point, you were writing a lot about productivity, knowledge management, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=162.4s)]
*  and that's one of the reasons that we have you here. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=165.12s)]
*  And tell me about why you got into that space. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=167.44s)]
*  I think at one point, I adopted the belief, as many do, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=170.23999999999998s)]
*  that the more I learned about productivity and the more knowledge I collected, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=174.95999999999998s)]
*  the more financially successful or happy or whatever I would be. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=180.95999999999998s)]
*  And ended up going very hard down that track, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=187.2s)]
*  I think as a lot of people do once they get that idea in their head. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=190.64s)]
*  Something with the tools just clicked very well for me, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=194.08s)]
*  where something about the way I was using it wasn't as immediately intuitive to people. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=198.0s)]
*  And then in particular with Roam, for those who remember, [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=202.32s)]
*  it was really like a mania, I think. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=207.28s)]
*  I just got very lucky that I was super early on it, [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=209.6s)]
*  was using it before a lot of other people. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=214.0s)]
*  And I think I was one of the first people with a small to medium-sized audience [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=216.88s)]
*  who talked about it. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=223.2s)]
*  And then I think that helped people with much larger audiences pick it up. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=224.48s)]
*  Tell me a little bit more about your saying, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=228.23999999999998s)]
*  you seem to have this intuition about how to use them, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=229.76s)]
*  and then you shared that with other folks. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=232.72s)]
*  What was it delivering for you and then subsequently others? [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=234.88s)]
*  That's a good question because I'm not sure that I could honestly say [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=239.2s)]
*  all of the effort has delivered a compensatory amount of value. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=244.16s)]
*  In the sense that I think this is just like a very common mistake [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=250.56s)]
*  or like causation versus correlation thing that people make, [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=255.92s)]
*  including myself, which is that they look at something that somebody does, [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=258.4s)]
*  who they look up to, and they assume that, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=262.32s)]
*  because they do that thing, that's how they're able to do this other thing [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=265.52s)]
*  that I like and respect. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=268.71999999999997s)]
*  Because they wake up at 5 a.m., that's how they could start this business. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=269.76s)]
*  It might just as well be the opposite in the sense that [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=273.76s)]
*  because they're the type of person who can start that business, [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=278.0s)]
*  they also like to wake up at 5 a.m. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=280.32s)]
*  And I feel like I might actually be more in the later camp where [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=283.12s)]
*  even as a kid, I very much enjoyed finding interesting bits of knowledge [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=287.6s)]
*  and then sharing them with people or trying to explain them. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=293.2s)]
*  And so almost like this kind of digital magpie, [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=296.08s)]
*  I enjoyed just collecting shiny bits of information. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=301.04s)]
*  And to the extent that it's helped with writing, most of it hasn't. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=303.84000000000003s)]
*  The only thing that I could say definitely has really helped [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=308.24s)]
*  is a habit that I've had for 12 or 13, 14 years now [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=312.0s)]
*  of taking notes from the books that I'm reading. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=317.36s)]
*  And so I used to do this on Kindle, [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=320.8s)]
*  and now I do it on physical books and use ReadWise to extract the highlights. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=322.40000000000003s)]
*  But the medium that I organize those highlights in doesn't seem to matter [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=326.8s)]
*  because I had them in text files at one point. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=330.48s)]
*  I had them in Evernote. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=333.76s)]
*  I had them in Notion. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=334.88s)]
*  I had them in Rome. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=336.96000000000004s)]
*  I had them in back in Notion. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=338.0s)]
*  I've moved them around. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=340.64000000000004s)]
*  I've lost a lot of the formatting and additional annotations so many times [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=341.6s)]
*  that it almost doesn't matter. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=345.76s)]
*  You're almost saying it could be on a stone tablet, [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=348.08000000000004s)]
*  and as long as you have that there, or is it maybe the searchability? [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=349.92s)]
*  There's only maybe a few functions that you need in order for it to be useful, [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=353.28000000000003s)]
*  not all of the feature set. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=357.84000000000003s)]
*  Well, yes. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=359.76s)]
*  I think it's really the searching, the indexing, and the collecting [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=360.56s)]
*  that are very helpful. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=366.0s)]
*  But pretty much all of the other features are often like get in the way [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=367.52s)]
*  or become distractions or give you this sense of productivity. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=372.08s)]
*  Like, oh, I'm doing all of these. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=375.84s)]
*  I'm organizing my knowledge. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=376.8s)]
*  You probably should be writing or playing with your kids [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=378.64s)]
*  or doing something else. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=381.52s)]
*  But expanding on that, the thing that's really been helpful [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=384.96s)]
*  is the actual reading the books. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=387.36s)]
*  I wish I had spent more time reading more books [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=390.15999999999997s)]
*  instead of continuing to hyper optimize my highlights [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=392.32s)]
*  from the books I had already read. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=396.08s)]
*  Maybe there's something meta here though, where to your point, [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=397.76s)]
*  it's like because you feel like you're being productive [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=400.4s)]
*  with the notes that you take within these knowledge management tools, [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=402.96s)]
*  it makes you want to read more books because you feel like they're more useful. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=405.76s)]
*  But at the same time, it does seem like there is this false understanding [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=408.88s)]
*  of what you're getting from these tools. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=414.88s)]
*  But one thing that I noticed was when you and a few other creators saw Rome, [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=416.48s)]
*  like you said, there really was this almost like mania. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=421.92s)]
*  And maybe something behind that mania, at least it felt to me, [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=424.48s)]
*  was as though there was an unlock, as though the prior knowledge management [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=428.08000000000004s)]
*  tools were lacking something that this now provided. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=432.32s)]
*  So maybe you could speak to that experience. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=436.08000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, it's funny because this all happened at an interesting time [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=438.48s)]
*  where I had gone through Tiago Forte's Building a Second Brain [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=442.96s)]
*  a couple of years before. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=447.35999999999996s)]
*  And when I went through it, I was having these conversations with him [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=449.03999999999996s)]
*  about how much I hated Evernote because it really forced you [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=452.15999999999997s)]
*  into this hierarchical way of organizing your information. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=457.52s)]
*  And so you had a folder for home or whatever, [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=461.52s)]
*  and then you're putting your notes about your house in there, [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=464.88s)]
*  and you have a folder for books, and you're putting all your book notes in there. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=466.88s)]
*  But pretty much every piece of knowledge should live in multiple places. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=470.08s)]
*  And you could also do tags and stuff, but the tags felt clunky. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=474.24s)]
*  And so what was exciting to me about Rome when I saw it [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=477.28s)]
*  was it introduced this more of a knowledge graph, [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=480.96s)]
*  which is really, I think, how we think about things. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=485.28s)]
*  That's more of how our brain works. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=488.71999999999997s)]
*  Our brain isn't a filing cabinet. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=490.08s)]
*  It's very messy. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=493.44s)]
*  It's very interconnected. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=494.32s)]
*  And it felt like it fit that much better for me. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=495.91999999999996s)]
*  And that's what made me so excited about it. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=498.56s)]
*  And I think made so many other people excited about it. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=499.84s)]
*  We kind of take for granted today, if you're getting into knowledge management today, [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=501.52s)]
*  almost every tool has this. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=505.11999999999995s)]
*  Notion very quickly adopted this same interconnected backlink structure [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=507.76s)]
*  that Rome popularized. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=514.3199999999999s)]
*  And I think that's great because I use it in Notion all the time now. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=516.24s)]
*  That's the main tool that I use. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=519.52s)]
*  And that feature in particular was what felt so magical. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=521.04s)]
*  Because to the point that we talked about earlier, [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=524.16s)]
*  very few things in these tools are actually useful for improving the creative output, [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=526.24s)]
*  which is, I think, what you're really optimizing for by using them. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=532.16s)]
*  Search is very useful. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=535.68s)]
*  And the capture is very useful. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=537.1999999999999s)]
*  And I do think that these bi-directional relationships between bits of information [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=538.56s)]
*  are super useful as well so that you can log a few notes on something [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=543.4399999999999s)]
*  or log a few connections on something. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=549.36s)]
*  As long as it's connected to two or three other things [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=551.28s)]
*  in your second brain or whatever you want to call it, [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=554.0s)]
*  it will be very easy to resurface it later. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=556.5600000000001s)]
*  Much easier than if you have to pick an arbitrary folder to put it into, at least for me. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=559.2s)]
*  Ruthie You have to remember the route, right? [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=564.24s)]
*  You're saying with Evernote, you have to remember, [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=566.64s)]
*  oh, there's this thing hidden in four layers of folders, [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=568.16s)]
*  and I have to remember it's there. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=572.5600000000001s)]
*  Versus you're saying the interconnectivity allows you to surface it more easily. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=574.08s)]
*  Almost like stumble upon it, would you say? [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=578.0s)]
*  Or... [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=579.76s)]
*  A little bit more like that. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=580.72s)]
*  And the thing that I liked about it too was that Evernote required, [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=582.1600000000001s)]
*  or I should say any hierarchical file system requires [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=586.64s)]
*  very deliberate placement of each piece of information. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=589.6800000000001s)]
*  You have to think about it a lot, where you put it. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=592.48s)]
*  It might not seem like you do, but you kind of do, [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=594.5600000000001s)]
*  because you're saying, okay, in 10 years, [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=596.48s)]
*  if I don't know I need this piece of information, [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=598.72s)]
*  how do I accidentally refind it? [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=600.8000000000001s)]
*  Whereas with a much more widespread hyperlinked knowledge graph style, [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=603.5200000000001s)]
*  you can kind of just slap 10 different relationships onto it, [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=608.72s)]
*  and you'll probably be able to find it again in the future. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=612.24s)]
*  Ruthie That's so interesting. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=614.4s)]
*  I was filing something away, because I'm still in ancient times, [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=615.6s)]
*  I still use Evernote, but I was filing something away, [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=620.32s)]
*  and I had this thought as I was doing so yesterday of just, [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=623.28s)]
*  I will never see this again. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=626.24s)]
*  Aidan Well, I had a few people reach out to me [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=627.6s)]
*  over the last week or two, and they said, hey, [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=630.24s)]
*  I need to migrate all of my stuff into a new tool. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=631.84s)]
*  What do you recommend? [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=634.0s)]
*  And I said, well, don't migrate anything. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=635.52s)]
*  Just start using a new tool, and then for the next three months, [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=639.3599999999999s)]
*  see which pieces of information you end up needing, [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=644.8s)]
*  and then go migrate them. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=648.88s)]
*  But what you will probably find is that you can delete 95 to 99 percent [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=651.5999999999999s)]
*  of everything you have in Evernote or Notion or whatever, [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=656.8s)]
*  and never feel that pain for the rest of your life. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=659.68s)]
*  Ruthie It's so true. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=662.3199999999999s)]
*  And in a way, it reflects on the fact that so many of us are digital hoarders, [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=663.3599999999999s)]
*  where if we did the same thing with physical items, [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=667.36s)]
*  we'd end up in these homes, just boxes and boxes and boxes. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=669.84s)]
*  And in a way, because it costs so little and it is out of sight, out of mind, [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=673.44s)]
*  we do it digitally. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=678.32s)]
*  But that brings me to this question, Nat. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=680.08s)]
*  Do you think that maybe the way that these knowledge management tools [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=683.12s)]
*  haven't quite lived up to their promise, [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=686.72s)]
*  is that just because we misunderstand the way our own brains work [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=689.12s)]
*  and what we really need and we convince ourselves [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=693.04s)]
*  that we need these knowledge management tools? [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=695.92s)]
*  Or is it a facet of these tools not having the right technology, [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=698.3199999999999s)]
*  maybe the right feature set yet? [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=702.9599999999999s)]
*  And obviously, this will eventually delve into our conversation around AI. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=704.9599999999999s)]
*  But I want to get a sense of like, is it us misunderstanding [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=708.9599999999999s)]
*  what we really need from these tools in the first place? [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=711.52s)]
*  Nat I think it might be more of a false promise issue, [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=713.76s)]
*  because I think if you look at, say, the Notion marketing [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=721.28s)]
*  or the Evernote marketing, they advertise themselves as a wiki, [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=725.44s)]
*  as a digital filing cabinet. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=730.96s)]
*  And they do those things very well, right? [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=735.0400000000001s)]
*  They allow you to collect and organize information. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=737.5200000000001s)]
*  And I think the false promise that many of us believe [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=742.6400000000001s)]
*  or have bought into or whatever is that if you organize information, [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=747.12s)]
*  you will write better articles, [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=751.12s)]
*  you will make more money, you will be happier, [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=754.56s)]
*  you will get all of these benefits from it, right? [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=757.8399999999999s)]
*  And that one I think is probably just not true. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=761.52s)]
*  I make this analogy all the time that 99.9% of the best books ever written [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=767.28s)]
*  were written on a typewriter or by hand. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=771.68s)]
*  If you think that you need a good writing app to write your book, [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=774.3199999999999s)]
*  you're just wrong. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=776.8s)]
*  It's just not true. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=780.16s)]
*  History is as this is not true. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=781.12s)]
*  Nat Exactly. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=782.88s)]
*  I do think that there is this big element of the other thing [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=784.88s)]
*  that delivering is fun, right? [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=789.36s)]
*  And we don't like to admit that the reason we read productivity books [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=791.44s)]
*  or watch motivational YouTube or stuff is because it's fun [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=796.48s)]
*  and makes us feel good, not because it's going to produce [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=799.6800000000001s)]
*  any tangible benefit in our lives. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=802.5600000000001s)]
*  And that's part of what they're delivering too. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=805.36s)]
*  It's fun to organize your stuff, right? [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=807.52s)]
*  If we think about things along the spectrum of actual utility [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=810.24s)]
*  that these tools are indeed bringing, and then this false promise, [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=814.0s)]
*  and maybe everyone and their own experience with knowledge management [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=817.44s)]
*  fits somewhere along that spectrum, tell me a little bit more [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=820.72s)]
*  about how you've maybe moved closer to that utility side of the spectrum. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=824.24s)]
*  I really think the next big utility is going to be a note-taking tool [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=828.96s)]
*  that offers custom GPT or whatever, embeds as a service. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=834.56s)]
*  For your knowledge graph. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=840.0s)]
*  I've seen people do it. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=842.16s)]
*  Dan Schipper has that great project he did where he put all of Andrew [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=843.12s)]
*  Huberman's podcast transcripts into a GPT embed model, [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=847.04s)]
*  and then you can just query it with anything you want to know, [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=851.44s)]
*  and it feeds you back Huberman's answers from podcasts, right? [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=853.6s)]
*  Theoretically, any note-taking app should be able to offer that as a service, [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=858.8s)]
*  or maybe you pay, you know, I'd pay like a thousand dollars or more for this, [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=864.08s)]
*  very happily, where I could just say, okay, here are my notes from, [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=868.0s)]
*  it's got to be like four or five hundred books now, thousands of articles, [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=871.8399999999999s)]
*  every little idea I've written down over the last 10, 15 years, here's all of it. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=875.36s)]
*  I just want you to index it, and then as I start writing, [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=879.76s)]
*  just give me little pop-ups along the side, or when I ask for them, [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=885.28s)]
*  give me little pop-ups that say, oh, you know, you had this idea, [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=888.0s)]
*  or oh, this idea from this book, or this idea from this article, or whatever. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=890.0799999999999s)]
*  These are all relevant to what you're doing right now, [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=893.1999999999999s)]
*  because I'm pretty sure we can actually already do that with the tools that are [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=895.28s)]
*  available on the market. Yeah, nobody's just created a consumer-side version of it, [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=898.9599999999999s)]
*  and that would be the point where you, I mean, that's like literally a second brain, right? [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=904.16s)]
*  That's literally your previous thoughts and work and effort being processed by this external [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=910.8s)]
*  cognitive entity, and then fed back to your like current working mind or whatever to enhance what [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=917.28s)]
*  you're trying to do without you having to go look for it, and that would be incredible. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=924.24s)]
*  Like, that would be so useful. I would use that non-stop every day. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=929.6s)]
*  If you imagine a tool like this where an AI can parse your personalized unstructured data, [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=933.04s)]
*  it can be proactive, and it can surface things as you need them, what do you think this unlocks? [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=938.5600000000001s)]
*  The valuable thing is the ideas, but everybody receives ideas in different ways, [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=944.4s)]
*  and so, you know, for example, like one thing I realized about myself at some point is that I [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=951.28s)]
*  have a very hard time processing auditory information. Like, I don't remember it. It [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=955.84s)]
*  just doesn't really imprint for me, but when I read things, they stick with me really, really well, [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=960.8s)]
*  and so if I read a book, I can remember a ton from it, but if I listen to an audiobook, [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=966.64s)]
*  I don't remember anything. Some people prefer the long-form essay style. Like, some people [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=971.52s)]
*  would prefer a short-form video of the idea, right, and so if you have an idea, [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=976.0s)]
*  and you can turn it into one of those forms, something that's trained on you should be able [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=982.56s)]
*  to help you produce those other forms of your work to help that idea reach the most people [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=988.0799999999999s)]
*  possible, and we're seeing something else in tandem with the potential for that, which is, [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=992.0799999999999s)]
*  like, platforms aren't really letting you use them as funnels anymore. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=998.4s)]
*  Like, you know, early internet marketing with social media 10 years ago or whatever, [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=1003.12s)]
*  like your Facebook and your Twitter and whatever were all to drive traffic back to your site, [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=1008.56s)]
*  right, where you could get email sign-ups or sales or whatnot, and it's way harder to do that now, [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=1014.24s)]
*  so you actually want to create native stuff for each of those platforms for the people who want [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=1019.4399999999999s)]
*  to spend time on those platforms, because that's what's going to get rewarded, but now you're, [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=1024.08s)]
*  like, not creating one article. You're trying to create, like, 10 assets off of each idea, [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=1027.36s)]
*  which is a huge time suck, and so it's interesting to think, too, like, what would it look like if [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=1030.64s)]
*  you had this kind of, like, content assistant who you train not only on all of your writing [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=1035.8400000000001s)]
*  and stuff, but on your preferred format for short and long-form videos and train on your voice so [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=1042.16s)]
*  that you can immediately create, like, a podcast from your articles and all of these things [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=1048.72s)]
*  so that you can be this, like, hyper distributed idea person. That world is not very far away. It's [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=1053.6000000000001s)]
*  probably, like, less than two or three years out. Yeah, it's hard to believe that won't be on the [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=1059.84s)]
*  horizon. All right, Nat, this was fascinating. I love that you were so candid about this idea [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=1063.52s)]
*  of knowledge management and maybe where it falls flat and maybe where it doesn't, especially given [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=1068.8799999999999s)]
*  that you've been so present in this space, and so, yeah, this was really enjoyable, and I'm also [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=1073.44s)]
*  looking forward to seeing where this goes. Yeah, thank you so much for having me on. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAfYILRG3I&t=1077.84s)]
