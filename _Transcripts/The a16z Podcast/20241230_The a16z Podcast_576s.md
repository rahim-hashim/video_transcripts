Video Description: Satellites capture hundreds of terabytes worth of Earth images every single day. In this episode, Millen Anand, Engineering Fellow on a16z’s American Dynamism team, explores how the rapid rise of earth observation satellites is unlocking new opportunities across industries.

Thanks to cheaper launch costs, smaller satellites, and improved communication infrastructure, sending satellites to space has never been easier—or more impactful. Millen’s big idea? Building verticalized earth observation tools that go beyond collecting data to solving real-world problems in agriculture, defense, and energy.

# Bringing Space Data Down to Earth
**The a16z Podcast:** [December 30, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDLL7wKF2t8)
*  The more satellites you have up there, the more pixels that are collected of the Earth's surface [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDLL7wKF2t8&t=0.0s)]
*  every single day, they become more products that you can actually build and more use cases that you can unlock. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDLL7wKF2t8&t=4.32s)]
*  My big idea is really around building verticalized Earth observation tools. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDLL7wKF2t8&t=11.68s)]
*  I think there's been a lot of work over the last decade or so to actually get a lot of [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDLL7wKF2t8&t=16.240000000000002s)]
*  Earth observation sensors and set up the infrastructure to send pixels down to Earth [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDLL7wKF2t8&t=21.44s)]
*  from space, which is really a remarkable task. For 2025, I'm really excited to see entrepreneurs [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDLL7wKF2t8&t=26.08s)]
*  really build verticalized solutions that go into different industries and actually solve customer problems. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDLL7wKF2t8&t=31.279999999999998s)]
*  I think first off is launch costs and really access to space. In decades previously, it was very, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDLL7wKF2t8&t=41.519999999999996s)]
*  very difficult and expensive to send satellites up to orbit. These days, it's honestly getting [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDLL7wKF2t8&t=47.36s)]
*  as easy as sort of like a bus service with things like SpaceX's transporter launch service. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDLL7wKF2t8&t=53.36s)]
*  So the cost per kilogram of satellites getting to orbit has really, really come down. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDLL7wKF2t8&t=58.08s)]
*  Satellites have changed a lot in the last few decades. They're no longer school bus size, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDLL7wKF2t8&t=62.96s)]
*  $100 million per unit satellites. They've come down to the sizes of a loaf of bread. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDLL7wKF2t8&t=67.36s)]
*  With that, you get a lot of proliferated sensors. You get a lot of coverage over the Earth and costs [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDLL7wKF2t8&t=72.64s)]
*  have really remarkably sort of come down. And then I think the last thing I would point to is [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDLL7wKF2t8&t=76.88s)]
*  communications infrastructure. There's been a lot of work to set up ground stations and to actually [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDLL7wKF2t8&t=81.52s)]
*  have satellites communicate with each other in space to have a more efficient way to send pixels [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDLL7wKF2t8&t=87.03999999999999s)]
*  down to the Earth. And so as we think about those economics and if the economics have come down so [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDLL7wKF2t8&t=92.0s)]
*  much on getting the satellite up there, how does that ultimately ladder to the applications that [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDLL7wKF2t8&t=96.16s)]
*  can be built and the economics around that? To me, it's a really exciting and positive flywheel [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDLL7wKF2t8&t=100.88s)]
*  here. The more satellites you have up there, the more pixels that are collected of the Earth's [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDLL7wKF2t8&t=104.64s)]
*  surface every single day, they become more products that you can actually build and more [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDLL7wKF2t8&t=108.88s)]
*  use cases that you can unlock. Prices sort of come down and that allows and unlocks entrepreneurs to [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDLL7wKF2t8&t=112.64s)]
*  really cheaply solve problems for the entire Earth at once. Since we're talking about economics, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDLL7wKF2t8&t=117.92s)]
*  maybe you can give listeners a sense of what those are. Like how much does it cost for us to [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDLL7wKF2t8&t=123.36s)]
*  get this data, process it, or for real end applications to be made? [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDLL7wKF2t8&t=128.07999999999998s)]
*  So the unfortunate answer is that it depends a little bit. Broadly, there's actually a huge [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDLL7wKF2t8&t=132.4s)]
*  amount of freely open data. So NASA's Landsat program provides free open data for the entire [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDLL7wKF2t8&t=136.48s)]
*  Earth. The European Space Agency has Sentinel, which also provides free data. And then there's [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDLL7wKF2t8&t=142.16s)]
*  a lot of commercial companies as well who provide medium resolution. The prices range in the sort of [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDLL7wKF2t8&t=147.2s)]
*  dollar to five dollars per kilometer squared. And so that's really not too expensive. And then it [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDLL7wKF2t8&t=152.56s)]
*  tends to be more expensive as you go up into the high resolution, 30 and 10 centimeters per pixel. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDLL7wKF2t8&t=158.48s)]
*  But those are typically for more specialized use cases. It's not very well known that it could be [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDLL7wKF2t8&t=165.20000000000002s)]
*  this cheap. And there's a whole suite of archive data that goes back years and years from these [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDLL7wKF2t8&t=170.32s)]
*  companies who have collected data from orbit every single day for years and years. That's kind of a [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDLL7wKF2t8&t=175.04000000000002s)]
*  goldmine waiting to be really leveraged. Yeah. And we've seen different private entities, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDLL7wKF2t8&t=179.84s)]
*  public entities, governments, universities really pour in resources to get a lot of this data. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDLL7wKF2t8&t=184.72s)]
*  But speaking of the applications that in some cases do already exist, what are some of those? [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDLL7wKF2t8&t=190.07999999999998s)]
*  There have been some really, really exciting applications so far. I think agriculture is [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDLL7wKF2t8&t=195.44s)]
*  most talked about. Farmers across the world are really using Earth observation data to monitor [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDLL7wKF2t8&t=200.07999999999998s)]
*  their crops, predict crop yields, understand ways in which that they need to irrigate or fertilize [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDLL7wKF2t8&t=205.28s)]
*  their crops to really produce better outputs here. Other applications include defense. Governments [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDLL7wKF2t8&t=210.4s)]
*  across the world use it to monitor things like troop movements, ships and ports, fleets of their [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDLL7wKF2t8&t=214.88s)]
*  equipment across the world, energy use as well. There's a lot of interesting work that can be [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDLL7wKF2t8&t=221.12s)]
*  done in forecasting clouds and large scale grids and looking at how much solar production will [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDLL7wKF2t8&t=224.88s)]
*  happen on any given day, planning of utility sale, solar farms, looking at land and where you can [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDLL7wKF2t8&t=230.32s)]
*  actually place utility solar farms. As we think about where we are in that arc, obviously this is [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDLL7wKF2t8&t=236.72s)]
*  your big idea for 2025. Why do you think this maybe has been underexplored to date? [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDLL7wKF2t8&t=241.84s)]
*  I think it's really, really difficult. And I think that companies are making it a lot easier [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDLL7wKF2t8&t=247.20000000000002s)]
*  these days. It's a new thing that you can even go on to a website and buy an image [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDLL7wKF2t8&t=251.28s)]
*  through a portal. You used to only be able to talk to a salesperson to be able to do that. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDLL7wKF2t8&t=256.88s)]
*  There's a lot of open source work. There's a lot of companies chewing off different parts of the [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDLL7wKF2t8&t=261.84000000000003s)]
*  puzzle. The main thing in my eyes that I'm looking forward in the next year to two years [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDLL7wKF2t8&t=266.16s)]
*  is entrepreneurs actually going into specific industries and really taking solutions vertically. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDLL7wKF2t8&t=271.68s)]
*  So in one sense, if you take something like SpaceX and they have Starlink and they're the ones who [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDLL7wKF2t8&t=276.96000000000004s)]
*  create the satellite, put it up there and then also sell the data that people can use. Are you [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDLL7wKF2t8&t=282.32000000000005s)]
*  basically saying that you expect to see more of that specific solutions for, let's say, like you [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDLL7wKF2t8&t=287.6s)]
*  said, agriculture or energy instead of one company putting the satellite up there and then [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDLL7wKF2t8&t=292.0s)]
*  other companies in the middle distributing that data, processing it, et cetera? [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDLL7wKF2t8&t=296.72s)]
*  It has traditionally been hard for incumbents and actual satellite manufacturers to go into [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDLL7wKF2t8&t=300.96s)]
*  industries like agriculture and really get granular in terms of solving problems. Just an example of [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDLL7wKF2t8&t=306.56s)]
*  that would be like automating any sort of farming equipment. It's hard for an existing Earth [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDLL7wKF2t8&t=311.76s)]
*  observation player to go really, really vertical all the way straight from orbit to the farm. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDLL7wKF2t8&t=317.12s)]
*  Right now that's traditionally stopped somewhere around providing analytics or insights, [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDLL7wKF2t8&t=324.88s)]
*  but I'm looking for in the future to actually provide automation. Maybe we can drive a lot of [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDLL7wKF2t8&t=330.4s)]
*  that farm equipment, for instance, or actually irrigate fields directly through a closed loop [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDLL7wKF2t8&t=335.2s)]
*  Earth observation. Maybe a follow-up there is we've obviously seen a bunch of machine learning and [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDLL7wKF2t8&t=341.76s)]
*  AI tools come up in this last few years. Does that change the game in terms of being able to [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDLL7wKF2t8&t=347.28s)]
*  parse data, process it, make sense of it for these verticalized players, for example, or how does that [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDLL7wKF2t8&t=352.4s)]
*  really reshape the ecosystem? Certainly, yeah. I mean, terabytes and terabytes come down from [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDLL7wKF2t8&t=357.92s)]
*  orbit every single day, soon to be probably petabytes. We don't have enough humans on the [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDLL7wKF2t8&t=364.64s)]
*  Earth to actually look at all those images. We really need advanced techniques here. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDLL7wKF2t8&t=369.12s)]
*  A really famous example a couple of years ago where a company actually found the Chinese spy [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDLL7wKF2t8&t=373.2s)]
*  balloon through training their model with AI prediction of exactly what the balloon might [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDLL7wKF2t8&t=377.84000000000003s)]
*  look like. They were able to sort through pictures of the entire US, take in over days and days, [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDLL7wKF2t8&t=383.52s)]
*  and actually track down the source for the first time. We really can't do that with humans. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDLL7wKF2t8&t=389.04s)]
*  And I think new use cases like this will be unlocked every year. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDLL7wKF2t8&t=394.8s)]
*  And as we think about maybe the roadblocks or the challenges that may be on the road to us, [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDLL7wKF2t8&t=399.44s)]
*  really like this Earth observation economy, you could say, proliferating, what are those? [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDLL7wKF2t8&t=403.52s)]
*  One of the most pressing is how difficult it is to work with the data. I think right now, [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDLL7wKF2t8&t=408.71999999999997s)]
*  typically it still requires specialized knowledge of orbits and different types of sensors and how [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDLL7wKF2t8&t=413.03999999999996s)]
*  they are calibrated and correlated. And I think it's not so easy to apply techniques from one [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDLL7wKF2t8&t=418.8s)]
*  Earth observation constellation to another right now. We almost might need some middleware here [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDLL7wKF2t8&t=425.36s)]
*  where we can abstract away the nuances of each Earth observation constellation and make [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDLL7wKF2t8&t=430.32s)]
*  data sets that are really sensor agnostic and more and more frictionless for non-space engineers [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDLL7wKF2t8&t=437.6s)]
*  to use. Changing this from a very specialized climate scientist, GIS scientist, to any sort of [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDLL7wKF2t8&t=443.36s)]
*  ML engineer can start to use these techniques. What about regulation? I mean, I think about [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDLL7wKF2t8&t=448.40000000000003s)]
*  maybe regulation mostly impacting the satellites that go up there, but maybe you could give us a [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDLL7wKF2t8&t=454.0s)]
*  more wider perspective of like, is regulation hindering us at all, whether it is to get the [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDLL7wKF2t8&t=458.24s)]
*  satellites up there or utilize the data, proliferate it, et cetera. Yeah, there's been a lot of exciting [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDLL7wKF2t8&t=463.2s)]
*  regulation changes recently. I think most famously, NOAA agency lowered the restriction [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDLL7wKF2t8&t=468.4s)]
*  for the maximum commercial resolution from 30 centimeters per pixel to 10 centimeters per pixel [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDLL7wKF2t8&t=473.67999999999995s)]
*  very recently. So this kind of unlocks like a lot more higher resolution products. And there's a [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDLL7wKF2t8&t=478.88s)]
*  whole suite of applications that you can start to target. On the imagery sort of side, I think that [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDLL7wKF2t8&t=483.12s)]
*  there's been a lot of conversation about licensing and different data sort of rights. Right now, [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDLL7wKF2t8&t=488.23999999999995s)]
*  there's a lot of complex contracts where customers will buy exclusivity and there'll be 24 [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDLL7wKF2t8&t=495.2s)]
*  hours where nobody else can access an image. Yeah. And it really kind of hinders folks that [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDLL7wKF2t8&t=502.0s)]
*  are trying to build products with daily applications or daily monitoring. So I think licensing and kind [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDLL7wKF2t8&t=508.24s)]
*  of like opening up archive data and making it sort of easier and less restrictive to sort of use could [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDLL7wKF2t8&t=514.4s)]
*  be a good sort of regulation change as well. Where are you looking next year and what applications [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDLL7wKF2t8&t=519.68s)]
*  in particular do you find really exciting as we look toward the future? I'm really excited, [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDLL7wKF2t8&t=526.4799999999999s)]
*  honestly, about the energy sector. We already touched on sort of like predictive analytics [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDLL7wKF2t8&t=530.7199999999999s)]
*  for solar farms. There's a lot of work with like renewable wind sort of sources as well. So I think [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDLL7wKF2t8&t=535.28s)]
*  like I'm just looking for entrepreneurs to take earth observation and really solve our most pressing [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDLL7wKF2t8&t=541.68s)]
*  sort of challenges with these new data sets and things that are coming online right now. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDLL7wKF2t8&t=546.32s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDLL7wKF2t8&t=576.32s)]
