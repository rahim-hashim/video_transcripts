# When Two Giants Intersect: Healthcare Meets Fintech
**The a16z Podcast:** [May 09, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk)
*  Until recently, it was nearly impossible to figure out what something cost. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=0.0s)]
*  What words come to mind when you think of buying something with the click of a button? [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=4.72s)]
*  How about just tapping your card to pay? Or your credit card being paid off automatically? [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=8.96s)]
*  Or even your credit card company automatically detecting fraud? [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=14.08s)]
*  Well, when I think of those things, the words that come to mind are things like seamless, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=18.64s)]
*  clean, easy. And these are affordances that the world of fintech have granted us. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=22.64s)]
*  Now let's do another exercise. What happens when you think of the health care industry [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=30.08s)]
*  in America? I assume that seamless is not the word popping into your head. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=35.12s)]
*  And you're actually not alone if your contra-gap terms like confusing, clunky, or even broken. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=40.96s)]
*  But what you may not know is it's not just the consumer that's hurting. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=47.6s)]
*  Every year medical debt is increasing. Billions are lost in unpaid claims. Hospitals are in the [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=52.24s)]
*  red. Service prices can range up to 30x. There must be a better way. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=58.48s)]
*  Well, in this episode, we talk to A6&Z general partners Julie Yu and David Haber, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=65.36s)]
*  who highlight the emerging intersection of health care and fintech, and how changes in regulation [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=71.6s)]
*  and technology may actually enable founders to pave a better future. They talk about exactly [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=77.6s)]
*  where health care breaks down and how the three-party system of payers, providers, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=84.56s)]
*  and consumers can actually be re-examined through the lens of fintech. And if you'd like to learn [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=90.16s)]
*  a lot more about the fascinating intersection of health care and fintech, our team just came out [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=96.24000000000001s)]
*  with a microsite, which you can find at asixeenz.com slash health care dash meets dash fintech. And of [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=101.6s)]

*  please see asixeenz.com slash disclosures. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=136.32s)]
*  So today we are talking about the fascinating and emerging intersection of health care and [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=148.56s)]
*  fintech. And we have two people here who know a lot about both of those spaces. And so Julie and [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=153.76s)]
*  David, I'd love if we could just start there, if you could introduce yourselves and talk about why [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=160.24s)]
*  you're interested in this space in particular, and how maybe your backgrounds, both as investors, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=165.92s)]
*  but also builders in your respective spaces, has led you here. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=170.64s)]
*  Well, it's great to be here. I'm Julie Yoo, a general partner on our health care team. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=173.83999999999997s)]
*  We focus on all things technology as applied to health care, broadly speaking. Health care fintech, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=177.51999999999998s)]
*  as we'll talk about, is obviously a huge part of that. We believe there's massive market opportunity, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=182.32s)]
*  which is obviously one of the reasons that I'm excited about it. But I would say that the primary [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=186.32s)]
*  source of my inspiration of passion for health care fintech comes from my entrepreneurial career [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=191.6s)]
*  prior to this. So I was a co-founder of a company called Kyris. We built a scheduling-oriented [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=196.56s)]
*  product, a software product, that was sold to large provider organizations. Whereas scheduling is [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=202.4s)]
*  obviously a very sexy area of health care. We always sat right adjacent to what's called the [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=207.35999999999999s)]
*  revenue cycle in health care. So sort of how the payments are processed, how claims are submitted. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=212.56s)]
*  I was always sort of peeking next to me at the revenue cycle space thinking, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=219.12s)]
*  gosh, that's where the action is at. That's where the transactions are. That's where the payments [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=222.72s)]
*  flow. That's really where the rubber hits the road in terms of all of the weird incentive structures [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=226.48s)]
*  that drive the seemingly irrational behaviors of health care. I always aspired to expand my product [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=231.6s)]
*  into that zone. We never quite got there. But when I came into this seat, I was very, very motivated [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=236.8s)]
*  to explore that opportunity set from an investment lens. Thanks so much, Steph, for having us on. I'm [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=242.0s)]
*  David Haber, a general partner here at Andreessen. I joined the firm a little over a year and a half [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=246.8s)]
*  ago as a GP on the fintech team, but had spent the prior decade both as an investor and entrepreneur, [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=250.8s)]
*  had started a fintech company called Bond Street, which was in the small business lending space. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=256.48s)]
*  We financed a number of practices at the time and then ended up selling the business to [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=261.04s)]
*  Goldman Sachs in 2017 and had sort of a variety of strategy roles there before joining the firm. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=264.8s)]
*  One of my sort of core beliefs, I think both in life but specifically in investing, is that [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=270.16s)]
*  opportunities live between fields of expertise. And I find myself really enjoying kind of spending [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=274.8s)]
*  time at those intersections. It's one of the reasons I've always loved fintech because I've [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=279.84000000000003s)]
*  always viewed it candidly more as more horizontal than as a vertical. It's just been an amazing kind [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=283.2s)]
*  of collaboration, spending time with Julie and the rest of the Biome and Health Organization, [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=287.76s)]
*  you know, kind of going deep on this intersection and I think bringing, again, the depths of both [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=291.28000000000003s)]
*  of our experiences and the operating platforms behind us to kind of look at this problem space [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=295.52s)]
*  through both lenses. I think having both perspectives of deeply understanding kind of the [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=299.92s)]
*  healthcare side and understanding kind of the fintech ecosystem and the infrastructure and how [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=303.68s)]
*  that sort of enables new business models, I think is really opening up kind of a ton of opportunities [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=307.92s)]
*  in the space and why we're so excited to kind of spend more time in this category. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=312.40000000000003s)]
*  Absolutely. And I think with healthcare in particular, many people would agree, you know, [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=316.56s)]
*  Julie, you used the word irrational, but I think other people may apply terms like clunky, [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=321.52s)]
*  maybe even broken. But to your point, David, they may not know the depth of that particular [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=326.48s)]
*  industry and they may not understand why it might be broken. And so maybe we can kick things off [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=332.24s)]
*  there. Julie, where do you think the healthcare system breaks down the most? Yeah, you're [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=336.56s)]
*  absolutely right that it's pretty much all broken. Or, I mean, the other way that people oftentimes [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=340.88s)]
*  talk about it is that it's actually working as designed. And a lot of that, you know, it's been [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=345.04s)]
*  back to the way that payments are designed and processed exacerbates, I think, a lot of the [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=349.52s)]
*  challenges that we experience as consumers. I often take the system view to the space. I'm very [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=354.96000000000004s)]
*  enterprise focused and the companies that I primarily spend time with. And when you look at [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=359.84s)]
*  it from the system lens, you know, the core trifecta of stakeholders in our healthcare domain, [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=364.0s)]
*  very simply put, would be the following. So one is you have obviously the providers, the actual [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=369.35999999999996s)]
*  doctors and nurses and all of your care providers and services companies that actually deliver care. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=374.47999999999996s)]
*  They are obviously key stakeholder. You've got your payers, which are largely other insurance [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=379.35999999999996s)]
*  companies, private insurance companies, government funded insurance, and then, you know, arguably, [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=384.32s)]
*  even consumers to some degree are payers themselves for the out of pocket component of what we pay [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=388.32s)]
*  for healthcare. And then of course, the third party being the patient themselves. And so the [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=392.48s)]
*  point there being that the people delivering the service and receiving the service are not the [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=396.48s)]
*  people paying or, you know, sort of privy to the payments flow of those services. And that very [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=402.15999999999997s)]
*  bifurcation is what causes so much of the incentive misalignment that we experience in our healthcare [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=407.68s)]
*  system today when a provider delivers a service. And I think like probably rightfully so, like they [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=414.16s)]
*  don't necessarily care about the cost of things as long as it's the right thing for the patient. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=419.44s)]
*  But that's where you start to land in the territory of these surprise bills, you know, [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=423.52000000000004s)]
*  these prices that end up much higher than you had anticipated. And, you know, when price is not [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=427.84000000000003s)]
*  a factor in the initial decision as to where to send the patient, obviously there can be a ton of, [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=432.32000000000005s)]
*  you know, lack of transparency and just surprise, you know, down the road when those bills actually [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=436.96000000000004s)]
*  come to roost. And then similarly on the consumer side, you know, a lot of us, you know, think about [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=442.32s)]
*  how do we shop for care? How do we make sure that we're getting agency in the process of determining [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=446.32s)]
*  where we should get a certain service? And yet until recently, it was nearly impossible to figure [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=450.64s)]
*  out what something cost. And it was both the price of that service, as well as the mix of services [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=455.84s)]
*  that would actually be required as part of a certain encounter. So there is a little bit of [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=462.64s)]
*  legitimacy there where, you know, based on your diagnosis, you might not actually even know the [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=466.08s)]
*  full breadth of services that you need. But all of those factors contribute to the overall [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=470.16s)]
*  obfuscation of, you know, what things actually truly cost, what ultimately gets built for. And then, [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=474.8s)]
*  you know, lastly, how they get paid for. And that's, you know, the payer side of the equation, [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=480.0s)]
*  these equal parts sort of obscure and obtuse in terms of the rules that each individual [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=483.44000000000005s)]
*  planned product, you know, within the carrier universe operates under in terms of determining [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=489.76000000000005s)]
*  what something should be reimbursed for under what circumstances. So it's not the case that if you [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=494.72s)]
*  get the same exact service from different providers in different locations, that you're [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=499.68s)]
*  necessarily going to get the same price, which is kind of crazy. That payer angle is, I think, [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=504.96s)]
*  the kind of the overlaying dimension that creates all this uncertainty and again, results in this [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=509.12s)]
*  poor user experience for all parties involved. Yeah, I mean, it feels like there's a bunch of [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=514.5600000000001s)]
*  actors, a bunch of incentives that all go into this funnel. And then the output of that is what [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=518.96s)]
*  everyone experiences. And maybe actually, what would be helpful to set the tone, it feels like [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=523.6800000000001s)]
*  listeners maybe don't need this reminder. But if we started with a couple statistics of where we [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=528.48s)]
*  are now, like almost as if the output of that funnel of those actors of those incentives, [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=533.04s)]
*  are there any facts or statistics that either of you have run into that again, kind of just [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=538.48s)]
*  set the foundation or almost like the reality that we're in within health care? Yeah, I mean, [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=542.8000000000001s)]
*  I'll just start with like the headline number of health care costs and health care spending in our [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=548.4s)]
*  country, $4.3 trillion every year, which is roughly about 20% of GDP is spent on health care. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=553.12s)]
*  And I think the key thing there is not necessarily how much we're spending, because, you know, if we [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=559.44s)]
*  were spending that much and getting amazing service and amazing outcomes, then we would all want to [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=563.6s)]
*  pay more for it because we were getting value. But I think the challenge in our country is that [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=568.24s)]
*  our health care outcomes are actually getting worse. I don't know if you guys saw the stats [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=573.12s)]
*  recently on life expectancy decreasing over the course of the last couple of years, obviously, [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=577.52s)]
*  largely driven by the pandemic, but the yield of any of a given health care dollar spent in the US [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=582.0s)]
*  is far, far lower than all other developed nations in the world, which is a sad state of affairs. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=588.4s)]
*  So I think that's probably like the headline stat, you know, that we should start from. And then, [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=594.24s)]
*  you know, related to what I said earlier, I'll probably call out additional stat, which is, [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=597.84s)]
*  you know, just the administrative waste and bloat in our system due to the fact that we have this [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=601.92s)]
*  complex trifecta of payer, provider, patient results in a tremendous amount of spend that [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=606.96s)]
*  is completely unnecessary and gorgeous pure administrative overhead. So, you know, the stats [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=611.84s)]
*  that we see are roughly about a third of every dollar of revenue collected by a hospital is [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=616.24s)]
*  spent on administrative tasks required to collect it, you know, meaning really, you're only seeing [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=622.24s)]
*  roughly about a 70% yield on every dollar that you're actually supposed to get paid for your [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=627.6s)]
*  services purely based on the work necessary to file the claims to get a claim status to [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=631.36s)]
*  negotiate those claims and then, you know, ultimately get paid that in of itself sort of, [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=637.2800000000001s)]
*  you know, illustrates the amount of just embedded overhead in the health care system that results in, [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=641.5200000000001s)]
*  you know, these sort of constructions that are unsustainable over time. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=647.2800000000001s)]
*  I think the other big trend that we've seen certainly over the last decade is just, [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=650.6400000000001s)]
*  you know, dollar shifting towards the patient and their responsibility for sort of paying for [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=653.6s)]
*  health care. And I think the status that it's grown to something about 50% of all health care [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=657.6800000000001s)]
*  costs, you know, something like $370 something billion a year, and a patient led responsibility, [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=661.84s)]
*  half of Americans, you know, carry medical debt today, 20% of them don't believe they'll ever be [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=668.64s)]
*  able to pay it off. So this is a huge cause for bankruptcy, a huge cause for stress, and other, [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=673.12s)]
*  you know, issues beyond just the physical health, the financial health impact that this is having on, [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=678.08s)]
*  you know, everyday Americans is pretty significant. And so look, it's one of the biggest [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=683.0400000000001s)]
*  industries in the country. It's also one of the biggest problems. And so it's one of the reasons [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=686.8000000000001s)]
*  why we're so excited for, you know, entrepreneurs excited to tackle these big challenges. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=691.04s)]
*  Yeah, and I'm so excited to talk about those solutions. But I guess something that is still [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=696.24s)]
*  sitting with me is it doesn't seem like the system is really working for any of those three parties [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=701.92s)]
*  that you mentioned, Julie, I mean, hospitals are inefficient, medical debt is increasing, [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=706.0s)]
*  that's impacting the consumer who has to sometimes pay that debt, billions are lost in unpaid claims [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=710.24s)]
*  every year. And so again, it's not like, of the three parties, someone is winning, right? It's [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=715.12s)]
*  a mess all around. And so maybe just to really reiterate this question, like, what is going on [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=720.72s)]
*  here? Is it the rails of the payments that we're using? Is it just the incentive structure that is [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=726.0s)]
*  misaligned between three parties that all have different goals? What really is underpinning [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=730.88s)]
*  this reality that we're in today? Yeah, yeah, I think each individual party [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=737.36s)]
*  will certainly not take the blame themselves. But I think there's been a lot of pressure on [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=740.88s)]
*  the sort of the payer provider access of that trifecta that I described earlier, [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=746.0s)]
*  that I would say is really driving sort of a lot of that breaking point. So, you know, to be honest, [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=750.08s)]
*  when you look back at the last couple of years, it was a super tough couple of years for all [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=755.28s)]
*  industries, let alone, you know, healthcare, but in particular provider organizations, really, [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=758.88s)]
*  really suffered during that period of time. And, you know, remember, like we shut down the world [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=764.48s)]
*  right in 2020, meaning like no one could go in for any kind of service, you know, the majority [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=769.6s)]
*  of healthcare spend prior to the pandemic was physical in person visits where you were physically [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=774.88s)]
*  going to a hospital going to a clinic getting those in person services. And obviously, all of [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=780.08s)]
*  that was shut down, except for, you know, COVID related things. And so literally, you know, [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=784.0s)]
*  revenue lines went to zero for a lot of service lines for these major hospital systems and clinics [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=788.72s)]
*  hospitals, you know, arguably were much more on their heels. Whereas if you think about the way [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=793.92s)]
*  that insurance works, right, that during those same years, we were all paying the same levels [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=798.64s)]
*  of premium dollars to our health plan, but our utilization went way down, right. So health plans [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=803.04s)]
*  were actually sitting on a tremendous amount of cash. And obviously, there's regulation around [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=807.5999999999999s)]
*  the level of profits that health insurance companies can make on the core business. But, [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=811.28s)]
*  you know, in essence, you know, those companies were in a much, much different and much more [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=815.5999999999999s)]
*  positive financial position than the provider side of the market. So I think there is a ground swell [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=819.92s)]
*  of pointing the fingers at the entity that, you know, is sitting on a lot of capital that did, [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=825.8399999999999s)]
*  you know, sort of benefit from the underutilization that we experienced over that [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=830.24s)]
*  course of time. Meanwhile, you know, last year, I think it was literally 50% of hospitals were in [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=834.08s)]
*  the red. I think there's a lot more focus these days on the pain of the provider, you know, [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=839.92s)]
*  versus necessarily the pain of the payer. Whereas, you know, I think there's many, many ways in which [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=843.76s)]
*  both sides certainly suffered through all this. But I think that's where, you know, you saw like, [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=848.08s)]
*  I just read a headline recently about how the payer provider contracting dynamic, it can be very [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=851.52s)]
*  hostile. And, you know, when these contracts come up for renegotiation every couple of years, [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=857.04s)]
*  it's always this sort of game. We've actually talked about this on a podcast where it's kind [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=862.56s)]
*  of this dark art of, you know, contract negotiation, where, you know, the provider sort [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=866.0s)]
*  of assumes that whatever rate they contract will get negotiated down by the payer. And so they [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=870.64s)]
*  inflate the price that they present in those contract negotiations, and it just spirals [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=875.76s)]
*  upwards. And that's actually what a large portion of the driver of the increase in price year over [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=879.92s)]
*  year in health care has been is simply just that contracting motion. So no basis in reality of actual [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=885.04s)]
*  cost structure of the providers or, you know, arguably, some of that might have been wage [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=890.88s)]
*  inflation related in the last couple of years. But really, there are other existential factors [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=895.12s)]
*  that kind of contribute to that. So that dynamic, that sort of hostile relationship has been probably, [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=899.36s)]
*  you know, one of the primary drivers of some of the nefarious behaviors that, you know, result in [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=905.04s)]
*  this continuous bloat on the on the system side. And obviously, that probably contributes to longer [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=909.28s)]
*  systemic costs. But in many cases, the consumer also gets stuck in the middle because they're [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=913.76s)]
*  still paying a decent percentage out of pocket. And that number is increasing over time, too. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=917.84s)]
*  Yeah, it feels like one of the maybe main complaints from the consumer is not just [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=921.6s)]
*  that they're paying more, but they don't have that transparency into what's happening between [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=926.64s)]
*  these other two parties that are part of the system. But a lot of the dynamics that we've [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=930.64s)]
*  talked about so far aren't necessarily new. The health care industry has been slow moving for [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=934.8s)]
*  quite some time. It's been, if we use that term again, broken for quite some time. But it does [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=939.6s)]
*  feel like maybe certain things have changed more recently, or at least there may be certain unlocks [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=944.64s)]
*  that allow founders to maybe step in and build within this intersection of health care and fintech. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=949.84s)]
*  And so what gets you excited today about perhaps new openings within this arena and what may have [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=955.76s)]
*  changed over the last few years? It's rare that people talk excitedly about regulation, but health [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=961.9200000000001s)]
*  care is one of those domains where I think regulation can be a tailwind for innovation [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=966.8s)]
*  and category creation. There's lots of historical examples of this. I think the most traditional [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=970.9599999999999s)]
*  example that a lot of people point to is electronic health records did not really exist in adoption, [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=975.52s)]
*  major adoption, until the meaningful use law came into play, where the government literally paid [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=980.24s)]
*  financial incentives to doctors to adopt digitized technologies for medical record storage. So that [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=987.04s)]
*  was really the sea change that drove so much of the digitization of our infrastructure layer of [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=992.64s)]
*  health care. Similarly, right now we have a number of regulatory tailwinds that are driving payment [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=997.28s)]
*  reform, payment related reform, I should say. And so we have things like a price transparency law [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=1002.8s)]
*  that went into effect over the last couple of years that forced hospitals and insurance companies [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=1008.64s)]
*  to publish their contracted rates. It was hugely controversial. There's still lawsuits in play. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=1014.8s)]
*  People are still pushing back, but the fact of the matter is we now have thousands of hospitals [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=1020.32s)]
*  and hundreds of payers who have published all this data. Obviously, they're publishing it in [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=1025.6000000000001s)]
*  forms that make it very, very difficult to parse. And so entire companies exist to actually process [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=1029.2s)]
*  that data. We're investors in Turquoise Health. That's one of those players and actually make it [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=1035.1200000000001s)]
*  actionable in the context of their contract negotiations and the way that they engage with [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=1039.52s)]
*  both providers and patients. But that's obviously a huge driver of change in terms of how we think [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=1043.8400000000001s)]
*  about what used to be assumed to be opaque, now just being out there and people not having a place [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=1048.56s)]
*  to hide when it comes to comparing prices between two different providers who again are providing [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=1055.76s)]
*  the same service but at widely different prices. So that's been a massive change that is only just [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=1059.76s)]
*  starting to play out, I would say. So I think we have still years for it to really seep through [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=1065.44s)]
*  the system and address a lot of the challenges that we described earlier. You mentioned lawsuits [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=1069.44s)]
*  and some pushback. Just because I feel like listeners might be curious, what is on the other [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=1073.52s)]
*  side of that? It seems like maybe an obvious reform that we should be able to see how much [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=1077.84s)]
*  something costs if we're paying for it or someone is paying for it for us. So what was on the other [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=1082.9599999999998s)]
*  side of that? Yeah, I think there's, again, I have some degree of sympathy for these businesses. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=1087.6799999999998s)]
*  Effectively, what we're doing is taking proprietary contracts and publishing them on the web. So [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=1092.1599999999999s)]
*  there's been a lot of pushback from the parties to those contracts, which are the payers and the [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=1099.36s)]
*  providers, who say it's proprietary data and we should not be forced to publish such data in a [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=1103.12s)]
*  public forum because that's our competitive advantage in our market is that we're able to [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=1109.6799999999998s)]
*  negotiate special rates with our counterparties and we lose all of that competitive edge if we're [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=1114.32s)]
*  to put it out there. So that's the crux of most of the pushback from the incumbent lens is really [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=1120.8s)]
*  that sort of propriety. The counter argument is that there had been previous laws that required [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=1126.7199999999998s)]
*  things like upfront estimates for consumers. If you called your hospital, you were sort of mandated [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=1132.8s)]
*  to be able to present an estimate prior to coming in for a certain procedure or a certain set of [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=1138.56s)]
*  services. And from a consumer lens, those never really got implemented or enforced in a way that [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=1142.56s)]
*  was reasonable, in my opinion. I remember in my past life, when that law went into effect in the [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=1149.68s)]
*  state of Massachusetts, we actually did a bunch of secret shopper calls to hospitals to see what that [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=1155.28s)]
*  user experience was like. And you basically got told, oh, you'll get a call back in an [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=1160.0s)]
*  undetermined amount of time. It was generally one monolithic number and there was no explanation as [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=1165.12s)]
*  to what the range of assumptions that went into that number were. And again, you get the call back [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=1170.56s)]
*  a week later when you might have had the procedure two days after that call. So the whole [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=1175.04s)]
*  implementation was really poorly executed. So I think the argument on the consumer side is, [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=1179.2s)]
*  listen, you guys promised this to us years ago. The form of that just didn't address any of our [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=1183.04s)]
*  concerns about limiting the amount of financial exposure that we might have related to health care [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=1187.28s)]
*  services. So those are kind of the siren calls on both sides of the argument. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=1191.6s)]
*  And so it sounds like we now have more transparency, but it also sounds like there were a couple other [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=1195.76s)]
*  regulation changes that happened alongside that. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=1200.8s)]
*  Yeah, just maybe one more call out, which we've talked about before, is just all of the movement [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=1203.76s)]
*  towards value-based payment models. So this notion that a lot of the reason that health care business [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=1208.32s)]
*  models were not resilient during the pandemic was that they were entirely fee-for-service oriented, [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=1214.72s)]
*  meaning you only got paid for the specific services that you delivered. And therefore, again, [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=1219.3600000000001s)]
*  if the service was not delivered, you didn't get anything. Value-oriented models tend to be much [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=1223.52s)]
*  more bundled in nature. So either getting a set upfront rate or price for a set of services [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=1227.2s)]
*  related to an encounter. So a value-based orientation around a need for placement surgery [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=1234.72s)]
*  would be rather than charge for every individual doctor who's involved in the procedure, the [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=1239.52s)]
*  anesthesiology, all the pre-visit, post-visit stuff. You'd actually just get charged one bundle [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=1244.0s)]
*  for the entire journey. And then the provider's at risk, right? So if they go above that budget, [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=1248.56s)]
*  they are paying out of pocket effectively to cover the remaining cost. But if they stay under that [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=1255.2s)]
*  budget and keep you out of the hospital and avoid errors and all that kind of stuff, then they get [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=1259.84s)]
*  to pocket the difference. And so it aligns incentives for the provider and the patient in [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=1264.08s)]
*  terms of staying within certain bounds, but also creates a lot more resiliency around the payment [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=1268.56s)]
*  flows into the provider practice because they're not just relying on individual services getting [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=1274.32s)]
*  billed and paid for. So there's been a whole set of regulation around driving adoption of those [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=1278.48s)]
*  payment models. Medicare Advantage, I think, has been the most prominent form of that. It's very [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=1283.92s)]
*  early days in terms of adoption across our industry, but it is a very, very promising means to [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=1288.56s)]
*  align incentives in a fundamentally different way that results in much more transparent behaviors. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=1295.8400000000001s)]
*  LESLIE KENDRICK Absolutely. And maybe before we jump into the fintech side, [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=1300.16s)]
*  just wanted to clarify the No Surprises Act and the Cures Act. It feels like those also [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=1303.6000000000001s)]
*  were pretty fundamental to maybe changing this incentive structure that you've talked about so [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=1308.0800000000002s)]
*  far. KESHIA POLLtalk about so far. Yeah, the No Surprises Act is very closely tied to the [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=1312.32s)]
*  Transparency Act, which basically limits the ability to do surprise out-of-network billing [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=1315.04s)]
*  for patients. And you've probably read in lots of news articles these incidents where you go get a [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=1320.4s)]
*  surgery in an in-network hospital, the actual surgeon is in-network, but lo and behold, the [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=1326.3200000000002s)]
*  anesthesiologist is out-of-network, and all of a sudden you're getting a bill for just that slice [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=1332.16s)]
*  of the service at a rate that's outsized relative to what you would have had to pay had it been an [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=1337.2s)]
*  in-network doctor as part of that procedure. This act limits the liability on the side of the patient [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=1342.64s)]
*  and the provider in those situations. And then the Cures Act, it's a little bit orthogonal to [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=1347.68s)]
*  fintech, but certainly related in that it has a provision around, or the main provision that people [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=1351.92s)]
*  care about is patient data access, enabling patients to readily access their full medical [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=1357.44s)]
*  record data and then sort of limit the cost of access. So it used to be the case that you'd have [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=1362.96s)]
*  to potentially pay a couple hundred dollars, somebody to get access to your own medical records [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=1369.44s)]
*  on paper, or even like a CD-ROM. Now there's a whole, this is a great example of an act that [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=1374.08s)]
*  actually incentivized a whole bunch of startups to come out of the woodwork and create apps that [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=1380.56s)]
*  allow you as a patient to basically collect all your medical records from multiple providers in [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=1386.16s)]
*  a single swoop and really sort of have agency over them. I think the way that it relates to the [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=1390.0s)]
*  fintech universe is that a lot of insurance adjudication acts require access to patient data [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=1394.16s)]
*  to approve certain reimbursements. This act allows much more data liquidity to support those [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=1400.72s)]
*  decisions versus the traditional way of doing it, which is faxing literally medical records back [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=1406.16s)]
*  and forth and having nurses look at them in a manual fashion. It does have sort of an indirect [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=1412.0s)]
*  impact in the fintech world. Absolutely. And I think it's kind of crazy to even reflect on the [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=1415.84s)]
*  fact that some of this system is still running on faxes on CD-ROMs. That's surprising, but at the same [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=1421.44s)]
*  time, I guess it aligns with the broken nature, the clunky nature that people see on the other [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=1428.4s)]
*  side. You talked about these regulations as tailwinds, but another tailwind for founders [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=1434.24s)]
*  can be new technology. And so David, maybe you can take this on. How has maybe the fintech [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=1438.5600000000002s)]
*  infrastructure or technology that has been built up over the last couple of years or decades [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=1443.44s)]
*  maybe fundamentally changed and can be introduced into this new world? [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=1448.16s)]
*  Very happy to jump into that. The other thing I would just add is I think it's important to kind [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=1452.24s)]
*  of emphasize that obviously we just lived through a global pandemic, right? And that's [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=1455.44s)]
*  throughout the entire kind of healthcare ecosystem. And so I think a lot of the questions that [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=1459.8400000000001s)]
*  entrepreneurs ask themselves when they're embarking on building businesses, will I be able to sell [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=1463.1200000000001s)]
*  into historically slow moving incumbents? Right. And I think the pandemic created a sense of [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=1467.76s)]
*  urgency because everybody went remote, because both the provider and payer systems were challenged [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=1473.3600000000001s)]
*  in different ways. The willingness and sort of urgency again to adopt new technologies, I think, [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=1479.1200000000001s)]
*  is an interesting kind of tailwind and opportunity for new entrepreneurs. And I think a really [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=1483.92s)]
*  unique compound right now, obviously an unfortunate one, but the reality. Certainly one of our core [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=1488.3200000000002s)]
*  theses at A16Z has been that every company is going to become a fintech company. And Julie and [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=1493.8400000000001s)]
*  I have been reflecting that either every healthcare company is already a fintech company or is [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=1499.2s)]
*  certainly going to become a fintech company. And I think in large part, as you mentioned, that's been [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=1503.1200000000001s)]
*  enabled by new fintech infrastructure. So our partner, Alex Rampello, has written quite a bit [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=1507.92s)]
*  about fintech really becoming kind of a third leg of a business model stool. Right. If you think [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=1513.44s)]
*  about historically most technology companies, the core kind of monetization mechanisms were either [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=1518.48s)]
*  then you would sell advertising to generate revenue or it was sort of transactional in nature. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=1524.3200000000002s)]
*  Maybe you're paying a subscription or buying a product. I think increasingly fintech is becoming [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=1528.56s)]
*  kind of that third stool, which can become embedded within kind of all different types of technology [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=1534.3200000000002s)]
*  companies as a way to drive engagement or retention or certainly monetization. There are [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=1539.52s)]
*  companies delivering kind of banking as a service, sort of enabling you to offer new car products or [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=1544.96s)]
*  embed lending or embed payments. All of these are basically primitives that can kind of be plugged [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=1550.08s)]
*  into transactional points of intent. Right. You know, anytime a consumer is going to transact, [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=1555.44s)]
*  then there's an opportunity to embed a financial product to finance that transaction or, you know, [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=1560.56s)]
*  for a small business owner, accelerate the working capital. Right. We'll probably get into this, [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=1566.4s)]
*  but a lot of the providers in the country are small businesses at the end of the day and [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=1570.88s)]
*  they're delivering services and then ultimately waiting, you know, up to 90 days or longer to get [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=1575.92s)]
*  reimbursed by these big insurance companies. They've already delivered the service, right, [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=1580.48s)]
*  to the patient. And that can create a lot of strain, you know, just in their own working capital [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=1584.16s)]
*  and ability to pay employees. And one of the biggest reasons small businesses died, and [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=1588.8000000000002s)]
*  saw this intimately through Bond Street, was just working capital. And so one, you know, [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=1593.68s)]
*  just tangible example for how I think a really interesting kind of opportunity at the intersection [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=1597.8400000000001s)]
*  of fintech and healthcare that we've invested in is a company called Juniper. They built effectively [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=1602.48s)]
*  billing software for highly recurring healthcare. And so their insight was that areas like the [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=1607.3600000000001s)]
*  Hebrew Health, today they serve some of the largest autism clinics in the country. These [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=1613.2s)]
*  are practices where patients are visiting their provider over a hundred times a year, right. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=1617.52s)]
*  The recurring nature of that experience creates the opportunity to automate a lot of the back-end [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=1622.64s)]
*  workloads, you know, more significantly, they would argue, than a one-off kind of leg-in procedure. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=1628.3200000000002s)]
*  And so again, they built technology to essentially submit, you know, health insurance claims [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=1633.8400000000001s)]
*  programmatically to the insurance companies, to the payers. They take on kind of the revenue [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=1638.96s)]
*  cycle management and deal with, again, all of the denials and adjudication that comes with [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=1644.48s)]
*  submitting those claims and really empowering the provider to get reversed by the payer, [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=1649.84s)]
*  get paid by the payer. And what's really unique about that, again, having built a small business [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=1654.56s)]
*  lending company, is that because of the position they sit, they really understand the entire kind [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=1659.6799999999998s)]
*  of working capital or cashflow life cycle of that practice, right. They're effectively processing [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=1665.1999999999998s)]
*  a hundred percent of their revenue, right, through their system. Every patient that walks through the [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=1670.56s)]
*  door, they're submitting the invoice to the payer and they're seeing statistically when and how much [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=1674.4s)]
*  and at what rate, you know, those services are being reimbursed by the insurance companies. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=1680.48s)]
*  By the way, they get paid three to five percent just for that, right, for delivering that technology [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=1685.44s)]
*  and improving efficiency. Historically has been a very manual, you know, process for a lot of these [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=1689.8400000000001s)]
*  providers with, you know, a couple of folks in the back office. But again, from a fintech perspective, [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=1695.1200000000001s)]
*  if you understand statistically the probability of repayment and the timing of that cashflow, [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=1699.44s)]
*  you can extend credit, right. So you can advance working capital to the small business owner, [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=1705.6000000000001s)]
*  to the provider and let them get paid tomorrow, right, or the same day for delivering that same [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=1710.72s)]
*  service because you know, based on all of their historical data and all of the practices in your [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=1715.8400000000001s)]
*  network, the statistical probability of getting repaid. And that's a really important and I think [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=1720.88s)]
*  a great model for a lending business because importantly, again, you're not getting, you know, [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=1725.84s)]
*  negatively selected, right. They're not cherry picking a specific invoice that you're trying [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=1731.76s)]
*  to essentially, what's called factor that they believe they may never actually get reimbursed. [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=1736.8799999999999s)]
*  And ultimately you as the lender are taking, you know, that back credit risk. You're seeing [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=1741.1999999999998s)]
*  a hundred percent of their revenue and a hundred percent of the data and statistical probability [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=1746.3999999999999s)]
*  of repayment. So you can extend, you can choose yourself to kind of push credit or factor it [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=1751.2s)]
*  entirely, right. And just deliver that as a value proposition to the provider that look, you know, [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=1756.72s)]
*  if you work with Juniper, you don't have to wait 90 days to get reimbursed. You can continue scaling [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=1761.8400000000001s)]
*  your business, serving your patients, which is really why you started this, you know, practice [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=1766.56s)]
*  in the first place. That was the other key insight from again, small, you know, Bond Street was that [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=1771.04s)]
*  most of these entrepreneurs started their businesses because they were passionate [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=1776.0s)]
*  about their product or their service or their craft, not because they wanted to be the CFO, [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=1779.52s)]
*  you know, of their business. And so I think the ability to sort of abstract away [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=1784.56s)]
*  a lot of that financial complexity and drive efficiency for these small business owners is [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=1788.96s)]
*  just, it was funny. I was an angel investor in the business before joining a grease. And [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=1792.72s)]
*  in my first conversation with the founders, I was like, it's awesome that you guys are a fintech [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=1796.3999999999999s)]
*  company. They're like, no, no, no, what are you talking about? We're a healthcare company. It's [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=1799.92s)]
*  like, you know, you're in the payments flow. You're seeing the working capital life cycle. And [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=1803.76s)]
*  it's been amazing to watch them kind of come up to speed on the fintech side. And, you know, [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=1808.48s)]
*  six months later, Chris stopped and see, I was like, dude, you're totally right. We're a [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=1811.84s)]
*  healthcare company and a fintech company. Exactly. And I mean, this is the intersection that both of [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=1816.48s)]
*  you have been working on exploring. And I think you mentioned this earlier, David, but there is [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=1821.52s)]
*  this like unique perspective when you have the expertise from both sides. So you understand what [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=1826.16s)]
*  these providers need and want. And I love that you pointed out that most of them, they want to [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=1831.68s)]
*  provide, they want to operate. They don't want to be in these deep, complex payment workflows and [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=1836.08s)]
*  to be dealing with invoicing. And so, I mean, I think that's one very clear area where you've [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=1841.52s)]
*  identified a problem that these providers have. And we talked about, you know, there's the provider, [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=1846.08s)]
*  there's the payer, there's the consumer. And so within that ecosystem, maybe it'd be great to [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=1851.1999999999998s)]
*  hear from both of you what other gaps you see where healthcare and fintech can intersect and [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=1856.8799999999999s)]
*  solve a problem for one of those three parties. Yeah, I'll actually key off of a couple of themes [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=1862.24s)]
*  that Dave mentioned that I think are super relevant to a lot of healthcare fintech companies that we [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=1866.72s)]
*  see. One is the notion of how do you get into the full data flow of finances running through the [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=1870.4s)]
*  system for a given party, such that you can effectively you can underwrite risk in a different [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=1876.24s)]
*  way than any single player who's sort of in the end time value chain of healthcare payments. And [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=1880.96s)]
*  then the second piece being, you know, how do you take product that exists in other places and then [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=1885.68s)]
*  make it understand healthcare. So one example that sort of covers those two themes in a completely [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=1890.48s)]
*  different space than Juniper, but with a lot of the same sort of rationale is a company called [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=1894.56s)]
*  Thatch that's actually doing this in the employer sponsored healthcare space. So if you think about [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=1898.56s)]
*  like what David was saying about like SMB, like, you know, business owners and no one going into [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=1902.8s)]
*  this business to want to be a CFO, same thing with a company, right? Like what's the number two line [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=1907.44s)]
*  item in their P&L outside of payroll? It's typically healthcare expense, right? Because you [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=1911.92s)]
*  have to cover your health insurance benefits for your employee base by law. But again, none of these [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=1915.92s)]
*  like we didn't get into, you know, we weren't founders because we wanted to like pay healthcare [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=1921.28s)]
*  expenses for our employees. And yet, like as a founder, you're basically faced with having to [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=1924.72s)]
*  choose like you have to pick your poison basically of like what health plan do you provide for your [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=1929.8400000000001s)]
*  employee base? Or do you provide an Iqra product that you know, just give them cash to go shop on [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=1934.0800000000002s)]
*  their own? You know, those are pretty non-trivial decisions to make and have like real everything [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=1938.3200000000002s)]
*  from like tax to administrative implications. And so what that's just doing is basically creating [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=1942.56s)]
*  a card that has all the characteristics that you would expect of a card. But it also understands [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=1947.12s)]
*  healthcare in the sense that they've coded it in such a way that it can pull from your healthcare [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=1951.04s)]
*  savings account, your HSA account, the payments are tax advantaged or the spend this tax advantage. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=1955.6799999999998s)]
*  There's a whole like layer of logic that needs to be codified into the card, such that it understands [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=1960.3999999999999s)]
*  what it can be used for under what circumstances and sort of, you know, treat those payments one way [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=1965.04s)]
*  versus, you know, other payments that you might be making outside of those rails. And then, you know, [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=1969.6s)]
*  because that is then in the flow of all of the healthcare expenses that the employees or the [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=1973.36s)]
*  consumers are taking on, they can then again, have just a better sort of underwriting chassis to then [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=1978.32s)]
*  suggest better healthcare benefit products to the employer, such that every year they can optimize [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=1984.56s)]
*  their spend, they can optimize the categories that they're covering, you know, deprioritize things [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=1990.0s)]
*  that people are not utilizing, you know, this notion of sort of the last mile utilization data [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=1994.0s)]
*  around healthcare benefits is kind of a holy grail problem where, you know, we all sort of get [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=1998.56s)]
*  coverage for our healthcare expenses, but it's very, very difficult to track exactly what benefits [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=2003.04s)]
*  are being used over time. I think that's another sort of spin on some of the same themes. [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=2007.6799999999998s)]
*  Absolutely. It feels like in both cases, there's an element of data transparency that we alluded [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=2011.84s)]
*  to earlier, which you're giving, in this case, the company access to that information so that [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=2016.56s)]
*  they can utilize it more effectively. Are there any other themes that you call out here in terms [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=2021.28s)]
*  of how founders can look at this industry and say, huh, there's this data opacity, let me solve that, [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=2026.0s)]
*  or any other gaps that you see that are maybe also just waiting to be addressed? [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=2032.8s)]
*  So many. So we wrote a piece a few months ago called pay viders unbundled. And so what we did [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=2037.76s)]
*  was we looked at the biggest companies in the healthcare space and even in like markets in [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=2044.64s)]
*  general, most of them are large insurance companies that also have a provider can put into their [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=2049.44s)]
*  business. So they're called pay viders because they're sort of vertically integrated across [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=2054.64s)]
*  insurance and care delivery services. And we sort of did a breakdown of what are the drivers of their [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=2058.0s)]
*  of their business models? What are the kind of key components of them? What are opportunities to [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=2062.8799999999997s)]
*  basically do what they're already doing 10x better as a startup and directly compete, but then also [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=2066.56s)]
*  articulated a number of underserved areas that those incumbents are not really paying attention to [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=2070.96s)]
*  where there's sort of white space opportunity for startups. And so a couple of examples there, [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=2076.24s)]
*  core insurance products are, you know, obviously a place where there's a lot left to be desired in [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=2080.96s)]
*  terms of everything from user experience to the cost, a set of services that you get as part of [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=2085.84s)]
*  an insurance plan. But we also recognize, especially from, you know, seeing insure tech play out outside [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=2090.88s)]
*  of healthcare, you know, it's a really hard business to build and a really hard business [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=2096.2400000000002s)]
*  model to get right. And so that said, you know, we think there's a huge opportunity for sort of [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=2099.6s)]
*  neo-carriers, so to speak, right? So upstart health insurance products to be built in a tech [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=2104.8s)]
*  native fashion that number one does focus on user experience. Number two does use data in novel ways, [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=2111.36s)]
*  whether it be on the underwriting side, whether it be on the consumer engagement side, whether it be [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=2117.76s)]
*  in terms of how insurance carriers interface with their providers and maybe be helpful versus being [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=2122.32s)]
*  belligerent as they traditionally might have been. That we believe is a hard and very non-trivial [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=2128.6400000000003s)]
*  type of business to build, but certainly one that's ripe for opportunity. And we have a few [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=2133.92s)]
*  in our portfolio like Devoted and Firefly that are pursuing business models like that. And so [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=2137.52s)]
*  that's an example of where, again, you'd be sort of competing with incumbents, but, you know, trying [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=2141.6800000000003s)]
*  to emphasize user experience, cost structure, efficiency using technology. Another article we [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=2146.2400000000002s)]
*  wrote, which had the title, Healthcare FinTech's Biggest Prize, was the financial operating system [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=2151.84s)]
*  for healthcare. And I think the core kind of ethos was you have a lot of patient data, right? [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=2156.32s)]
*  Living in practice management systems or in an EHR that are often unbundled or kind of separate from, [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=2162.24s)]
*  you know, the cash flow life cycle of these providers. So both understanding kind of cash [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=2169.3599999999997s)]
*  in and cash out in terms of expenses. And I think there's a huge opportunity to kind of reconcile [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=2173.52s)]
*  or kind of synthesize both sides of that equation. And again, the example would you refer is just sort [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=2178.56s)]
*  of, we talked about a piece of it, right? Both in enabling a provider to kind of more efficiently [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=2184.72s)]
*  process claims, understanding the kind of full cash flow life cycle of a practice. But the [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=2190.08s)]
*  implications and sort of wedge for starting there, I think are pretty significant because you could, [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=2195.36s)]
*  you know, both extend into the consumer facing experience, you know, get on to scheduling and, [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=2200.72s)]
*  you know, estimating sort of, you know, healthcare expenses, getting to payroll and other expenses [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=2206.08s)]
*  for the provider, enable again, the small business owner to, you know, to forecast their cash flow [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=2211.36s)]
*  and provide sort of business analytics for them, again, to kind of run their practices more [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=2216.4s)]
*  efficiently. And I think this analogy, again, doesn't just exist kind of at the small business [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=2221.28s)]
*  level, but at some of the largest kind of health systems level. And it was a great graphic nature [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=2226.1600000000003s)]
*  you can talk about, which was like the pilots are flying blind, you know, not understanding [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=2230.96s)]
*  kind of their own, you know, cash flow life cycle, even for some of the biggest provider networks in [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=2236.08s)]
*  the country. Yeah, we were astounded in the market work that we did on that one. We sort of assumed [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=2240.64s)]
*  that like the large enterprises have their act together. And it's really kind of the SMBs that, [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=2245.04s)]
*  you know, need some of these tools. But, you know, it turns out it's a relatively universal problem, [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=2249.12s)]
*  this notion of kind of a system of record, a source of truth for the finances of healthcare [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=2253.52s)]
*  providers. And, you know, that and that has such, you know, significant implications on, like broad [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=2258.32s)]
*  swaths of workforce, right, as David mentioned earlier, just like, you know, a lot of these [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=2263.92s)]
*  CFOs were saying, like, there are months where we don't know if we can make payroll. And, you know, [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=2268.64s)]
*  these places that manage staff of hundreds of providers sort of flying that blind is quite [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=2272.56s)]
*  incredible. So certainly believe that there's a massive opportunity there. And I think those [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=2277.6s)]
*  are also great examples where you can take software oriented products that, you know, sort of manage [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=2281.52s)]
*  financial insight, but add on financial services products to, you know, contribute to the financial [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=2286.64s)]
*  health of the practices that are using them, so that you have that sort of bifurcated software [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=2292.48s)]
*  plus fintech revenue stream dimension that you see outside of healthcare as well. You know, [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=2297.04s)]
*  something that's coming up as you guys are highlighting the vast amount of opportunity here [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=2301.6s)]
*  is that a founder or potential founder might say, you know what, maybe I do have background in [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=2305.92s)]
*  fintech, but not healthcare, or vice versa. And that might sound intimidating to not really [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=2310.96s)]
*  understand, let's say, if you are coming from fintech to understand the, like, complexity, [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=2315.68s)]
*  the deep complexity that exists in this world. And so how would you think about that? How would [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=2320.08s)]
*  you think about what problem is worth solving, depending on a founder's background, or how they [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=2324.96s)]
*  can further get immersed in this really interesting intersection? Simply put, if you're from [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=2329.68s)]
*  healthcare, go find your David Haber. And if you're in the whole pack, go find your Julie Yu. But in [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=2334.7999999999997s)]
*  all seriousness, I think, like, first of all, we should acknowledge, like, it is a very, like, each [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=2339.2799999999997s)]
*  individual space is super hard, let alone, like, the intersection, you know, there's just a lot of [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=2343.12s)]
*  esoteria that makes it really challenging to know just off the cuff. As, you know, David mentioned, [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=2347.6s)]
*  we truly do believe in this kind of intersection thesis. And we think that the only way to get it [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=2352.8799999999997s)]
*  right is really to have hybrid DNA on the founding teams of these companies, such that you truly have [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=2357.6s)]
*  expertise on both sides of the aisle, so to speak. I think both healthcare and fintech entrepreneurs [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=2363.44s)]
*  are often kindred spirits, right? I think a lot of, like, on each side, you know, both got in because [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=2368.72s)]
*  there was some overarching, often overarching mission, right, behind kind of the business and [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=2374.64s)]
*  problem they were trying to solve. Both healthcare and financial services are fairly complicated, [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=2378.48s)]
*  highly regulated industries. And so it's not that you're coming from, you know, building a [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=2383.52s)]
*  DTC, you know, e-commerce business, you know, into healthcare necessarily, you're coming from, [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=2388.88s)]
*  on the fintech side, from a place of understanding capital efficiency and, you know, and regulation, [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=2393.1200000000003s)]
*  and now applying some of those insights to the healthcare space. And fintech has a tendency to [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=2398.48s)]
*  sort of intersect across a lot of different categories, and it's becoming, you know, very [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=2403.36s)]
*  much of a business model. I think you've seen that play out over the past, you know, five plus years [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=2407.2000000000003s)]
*  in areas like vertical software, where, again, you know, companies have started by solving kind [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=2412.08s)]
*  of a software workflow in lots of different categories, and then it becomes kind of layering [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=2416.56s)]
*  in financial products as a business model. I think people are now recognizing that that same playbook [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=2421.2799999999997s)]
*  and opportunity, you know, exists in the healthcare side. Partnering up, as Julie mentioned, with [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=2426.7999999999997s)]
*  somebody who kind of understands those lit problems, whether it is from the provider, [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=2431.2s)]
*  whether it is from the payer, whether it is from the consumer, and taking, again, a lot of the same [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=2434.72s)]
*  playbooks that exist in fintech, which we're very happy to help with, and begin to apply those in [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=2438.72s)]
*  healthcare, I think is a huge, huge opportunity. Yeah, one more thing I'd add to that in terms of [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=2442.48s)]
*  the investor lens, which is going to sound self-serving, but it's really a serious thing [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=2446.7999999999997s)]
*  that, you know, that I would think about if I were a founder in this space is the capital [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=2450.3999999999996s)]
*  requirements of these companies tend to be pretty unique. If you're building an insured tech business [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=2453.8399999999997s)]
*  in healthcare, there are regulatory requirements around cash reserves and, you know, what kind of [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=2458.24s)]
*  financial profile you need to have as a business to be able to stand up and at state by state as well. [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=2463.52s)]
*  And so it's pretty complex landscape that you have to have investors who understand that and [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=2468.24s)]
*  properly fund you so that you have enough runway to meet the same set of milestones that, you know, [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=2473.3599999999997s)]
*  you might otherwise take less capital, frankly, with other types of business models. I think there [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=2478.24s)]
*  is a, you know, both a unique playbook for the founders, but also even for us a unique way that [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=2482.24s)]
*  we look at investment opportunities that sort of have these characteristics. Yeah, I feel like if [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=2486.7999999999997s)]
*  I was a listener to this conversation, I would have taken a few things away. One, the healthcare [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=2491.52s)]
*  system is broken. I don't think anyone needed a reminder of that. But two, there is somewhat of [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=2496.7999999999997s)]
*  a why now. Things are changing. Regulation has changed. The technology has changed. FinTech [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=2501.6s)]
*  infrastructure has changed. And so there is an opening potentially or several openings and gaps [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=2507.3599999999997s)]
*  for founders to tackle. But also, Julie, I think what you pointed out is really interesting that [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=2512.56s)]
*  this is like a tough intersection to address as a founder. There may be specific capital requirements. [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=2516.3999999999996s)]
*  And so given that A16Z is focusing on this intersection, we're funding companies in this [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=2522.16s)]
*  space, you too have studied this space. Just wanted to give you the opportunity, if there are [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=2527.92s)]
*  any gaps that you still see and you, you know, if a founder is listening and wants to raise their [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=2532.64s)]
*  hand and step up and say, hey, I want to fix this problem, anything that you'd like to highlight [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=2538.3999999999996s)]
*  there in terms of what you're looking for could be this specific problem that you'd like to see [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=2542.8799999999997s)]
*  solved or the type of founder that you'd like to see get involved. Yeah, I'll put out one that I [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=2547.8399999999997s)]
*  consider sort of a grand challenge of healthcare from an insurance perspective. And I think it's, [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=2552.08s)]
*  there's some specific examples right now in the market that are unsolved that I think need to be [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=2556.7999999999997s)]
*  solved just on the basis of trend. So the biggest class of insurance coverage in our country is [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=2562.16s)]
*  employer sponsored, right? So we, you know, us three, we all get insurance through our employer. [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=2567.68s)]
*  Most people have some sort of health benefit through their employer. The sort of fact of the [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=2572.4s)]
*  matter is, is that churn, right? The turnover in a given employee base tends to be a few years, [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=2576.16s)]
*  right? Like every few years, people change jobs. And therefore, the period of time that you are on [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=2581.44s)]
*  a given health plan is relatively finite, it's relatively short. But there could be, there's a [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=2586.7200000000003s)]
*  lot of expenses, a lot of examples of expenses in healthcare, where you might have a very high [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=2591.6s)]
*  upfront cost that doesn't play out from an ROI perspective for a very long period of time. [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=2596.32s)]
*  And so if I'm your insurance carrier, and I'm going to eat that cost, I'm actually not going [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=2602.0s)]
*  to want to eat that cost unless I'm going to have you on my plan long enough for me to see the ROI, [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=2606.08s)]
*  and that's what results in a lot of these seemingly not understandable like sort of [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=2610.24s)]
*  blockers on the insurance side as to why they're not covering S, Y or Z. And so a couple of examples [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=2614.96s)]
*  that are prevalent right now, Ozembic and these sort of miracle drugs that result in weight loss, [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=2619.52s)]
*  they're expensive, right? Thousands of dollars a month. Employers are really struggling with [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=2624.48s)]
*  how to think about supporting these drugs in terms of coverage, right? There's been a widespread [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=2628.48s)]
*  adoption amongst folks who are willing to pay out of pocket, but obviously that's not affordable [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=2632.88s)]
*  for the vast majority of Americans. If I'm an employer and I'm going to be willing to sort of [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=2637.04s)]
*  foot the bill for thousands of dollars per year for this drug, but when it comes to weight loss, [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=2641.52s)]
*  obesity, metabolic health, oftentimes the potential heart attack that I avoided down the road, [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=2646.16s)]
*  I'm not going to see that benefit for many, many years beyond the time horizon that you're going [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=2651.84s)]
*  to be an employee for me. That's one example. Another really interesting example that we [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=2655.6s)]
*  encounter given that we invest in biotech companies on the other side of the house of my fund is these [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=2659.6s)]
*  one and done therapies, right? We've heard about these sort of miracle gene therapy drugs where [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=2665.6s)]
*  with one procedure, one injection, you cure a disease that otherwise might've been fatal. [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=2671.12s)]
*  These drugs can cost upwards of a million dollars, right? So very nontraditional expense, [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=2677.76s)]
*  but very obviously significant impact to life expectancy and life quality. But again, [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=2682.7200000000003s)]
*  an individual carrier who pays that fee upfront, again, might not see the benefit or the ROI might [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=2687.68s)]
*  not be there for the period of time that the employee is on their plan. So I think there's [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=2693.12s)]
*  this huge problem around how do you properly underwrite these kinds of products as people [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=2697.6s)]
*  sort of switch between multiple health plans? Is there some vessel or chassis that you could [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=2702.56s)]
*  use to follow people as they move from health plan to health plan that distributes the load [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=2708.48s)]
*  of that financial burden across multiple carriers so that no single one has to bear the full burden? [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=2713.44s)]
*  It's a very nontrivial problem, but it's increasing in prevalence in terms of those kinds of products [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=2719.12s)]
*  that have that characteristic to them. We've spent a lot of time with incumbent insurance carriers. [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=2724.16s)]
*  They have not figured this out yet. I do think that there needs to be a consumer-centric [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=2729.7599999999998s)]
*  type solution that solves for this, that the consumer is aware that they are carrying certain [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=2734.56s)]
*  benefits across multiple years and multiple health plans. And so I would love to see that [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=2738.56s)]
*  problem solved in some way, shape or form, probably in partnership, frankly, with startups and [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=2743.6s)]
*  incumbents, but probably requiring a different type of data model and just fundamentally a different [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=2747.28s)]
*  approach from the consumer lens. That is so fascinating. And Julie, just as a clarifier, [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=2752.8s)]
*  is that also why most insurance companies won't cover preventative medicine because of that same [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=2757.76s)]
*  dynamic? Yeah, it's a great point. Yep, exactly right. And that's where I think Medicare Advantage [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=2764.0s)]
*  has shown the promise of doing it in a value-oriented way with regards to preventative [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=2769.84s)]
*  care because Medicare, seniors tend to be on the same Medicare plan for much longer, obviously, [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=2774.32s)]
*  because they're not changing employers. It's really just their own individual plans. You have much [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=2779.76s)]
*  more incentive to invest in preventative care that, again, will accrue benefits over multiple years [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=2784.88s)]
*  because those people tend to be stickier on their health plans. Well, I mean, I think that's clearly [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=2790.4s)]
*  such a big and important problem to be solved. David, what about you? Does anything jump out there [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=2794.6400000000003s)]
*  as, again, this grand challenge that you think, if solved, could really fundamentally change [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=2799.68s)]
*  this ecosystem? Yeah, I mean, we've talked a lot about provider issues and obviously challenges [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=2805.44s)]
*  that patients have. I think we've talked less about the payers. And one of the big initiatives [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=2811.44s)]
*  that we have focused on, certainly on the fintech side that Julie and I have been beginning to work [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=2816.7200000000003s)]
*  on this intersection, is just building deeper connectivity to all the incumbent institutions. [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=2821.6s)]
*  In fintech for too long, the technology fintech ecosystem and the large incumbent traditional [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=2827.04s)]
*  financial services ecosystem were parallel universes. And I think that was really a mistake [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=2832.7200000000003s)]
*  because I certainly saw this inside of Goldman. The culture of these institutions are changing [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=2838.2400000000002s)]
*  very quickly. Their recognition that they're not going to build everything in-house or that they [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=2843.52s)]
*  can't and their willingness to adopt third-party technologies is just accelerating. And yet, [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=2847.84s)]
*  so much of the workflows of these institutions, even in a place like Goldman, which is probably [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=2853.2799999999997s)]
*  one of the more progressive kind of tech-forward large financial institutions in the world, [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=2857.6s)]
*  are still like human-driven processes. I mean, thousands and thousands of folks [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=2862.72s)]
*  sitting in Salt Lake City or Dallas or Bangalore processing trades. And you can imagine that the [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=2867.12s)]
*  healthcare system is in a similar place or likely even further behind. And one of the [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=2873.4399999999996s)]
*  opportunities that we see here at Adresin is just being a bridge between the entrepreneur and that [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=2879.36s)]
*  starting ecosystem into these large incumbent institutions. And then just helping both us and [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=2885.76s)]
*  the entrepreneur build authentic non-transactional relationships with key decision-makers, folks who [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=2891.2000000000003s)]
*  are running these really important divisions and business units. And that can obviously radically [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=2896.8s)]
*  accelerate the go-to-market or relationship building for these smaller companies who often find, [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=2901.76s)]
*  and I found this very difficult to navigate, these large organizations, even people within [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=2906.8s)]
*  an institution like Goldman didn't understand kind of a broader surface area, the pockets [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=2912.8s)]
*  of the different business units and how they fit together. [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=2916.6400000000003s)]
*  Yeah. Maybe just for the audience, it'd be helpful to know how big these companies are. [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=2918.6400000000003s)]
*  How many people work at Goldman? And then, Julie, how many people work at United Health Group? How [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=2922.88s)]
*  many employees are we even talking about? I mean, Goldman was, I think, now something like [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=2927.28s)]
*  45,000 employees. The last was over 40 billion in revenue. Maybe United Healthcare is [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=2931.1200000000003s)]
*  significantly bigger than that. Yeah. United Healthcare is literally the biggest [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=2936.24s)]
*  publicly traded healthcare company. I think it's like half a trillion dollars at this point, [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=2940.3999999999996s)]
*  market cap. It looks like the latest numbers I have are 380,000 employees. I remember a lot [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=2944.4799999999996s)]
*  of those are, there's like the administrative side of UHG, but there's also a lot of doctors [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=2949.3599999999997s)]
*  and clinicians. This is not a UHG stat, but we were speaking with another large national health plan [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=2953.6s)]
*  payer and talking specifically about their call center operations. Because a lot of, [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=2960.4799999999996s)]
*  to David's point, a lot of these fintech operations manifest in the form of call center [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=2964.72s)]
*  agents. This place had 30,000 call center workers across their enterprise. So, I mean, just imagine, [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=2969.6s)]
*  and this gets to the point that we're making here is that these organizations now recognize [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=2976.56s)]
*  that they need to engage with innovators to be able to fundamentally transform their businesses [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=2981.12s)]
*  and both reduce the cost structure through technology, but also just better engage consumers. [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=2985.3599999999997s)]
*  Right? Because at the end of the day, their business is heavily reliant on member engagement. [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=2989.6s)]
*  That being the means for them to manage the costs of healthcare delivery by doing the proactive [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=2994.24s)]
*  things, as you were saying, Steph, and just getting ahead of potentially high acuity, [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=2999.8399999999997s)]
*  high cost encounters. I think there's this sort of special window of time where the stars are aligning [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=3004.64s)]
*  in terms of what the innovators are working on, what they're great at, and what they're much better [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=3009.68s)]
*  at, frankly, than the incumbent players and also what the incumbent players are recognizing that [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=3013.12s)]
*  they need as superpower to move forward. Yeah. I mean, I'd say for any fintech entrepreneur who [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=3017.7599999999998s)]
*  are healthcare curious or healthcare entrepreneurs or fintech curious, you know, come hang out. I [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=3022.88s)]
*  mean, Julie and I are often hosting dinners again at this intersection in New York and San [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=3026.56s)]
*  Francisco and other parts of the country. So we'd love to spend time with you. Yeah, we're really [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=3031.36s)]
*  excited about the space of you if you couldn't tell. And we think there's some massive businesses [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=3036.08s)]
*  to be built. So we're excited to hear from you. Amazing. And both of you have written extensively, [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=3040.1600000000003s)]
*  you and your teams on these topics and more. So we'll share a bunch of those links in the [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=3046.0s)]
*  show notes as well, so that people can go and dig a little deeper if they are interested to. [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=3050.72s)]
*  Awesome. Thanks so much. Amazing. Thank you. This is great. [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeIanjPSsQk&t=3056.08s)]
