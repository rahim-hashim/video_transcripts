# Embedded AI: The Questions Every CEO is Asking
**The a16z Podcast:** [June 02, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs)
*  2022 was a breakout year for AI. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=0.0s)]
*  In fact, many have even claimed that ChatGBT is the fastest growing app of all time. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=4.48s)]
*  So with so much opportunity on the table, AI is the topic of conversation in every boardroom, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=10.88s)]
*  as CEOs figure out how to best integrate this new superpower. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=16.240000000000002s)]
*  But they're also asking really important questions around data privacy, competition, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=19.52s)]
*  cost, accuracy, and also doing this all really quickly. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=23.6s)]
*  Because just like your customers really don't care if your product is built with Angular or [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=28.32s)]
*  React or runs on AWS or Heroku, there will be a whole host of ways that companies differentiate [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=32.4s)]
*  as they look to cleverly embed AI. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=38.480000000000004s)]
*  As a reminder, the content here is for informational purposes only, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=40.96s)]
*  should not be taken as legal business tax or investment advice, or be used to evaluate any [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=44.56s)]
*  investment or security, and is not directed at any investors or potential investors in any [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=49.2s)]
*  A16Z fund. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=53.84s)]
*  For more details, please see [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=55.28s)]
*  Now before we get into the weeds of how each company is implementing AI, we wanted to start [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=69.36s)]
*  our conversation with Zed Enum, co-founder and CEO of Cresta. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=74.16s)]
*  Cresta is bringing real-time intelligence and AI to the contact center. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=79.12s)]
*  And here, Zed reminds us of the upside of AI and what it can truly unlock. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=83.04s)]
*  So I read that 30 to 45 percent. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=87.92s)]
*  Well, contact centers have 30 to 45 percent attrition in the first year with agents. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=91.2s)]
*  And in some cases, that can even be as high as 80 percent. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=96.08000000000001s)]
*  So what is going on in these contact centers? [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=99.28s)]
*  Why is attrition so high? [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=101.60000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, that's a great question. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=103.52000000000001s)]
*  The employee net promoter score for contact centers is often less than zero. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=104.96000000000001s)]
*  So generally, it's not a role that folks sort of end up sticking with for a long time. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=109.36s)]
*  For a few different factors, you have sort of seasonal demand for increased contact center [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=113.68s)]
*  volume, you have relatively low wages, and that sort of high inflation environment. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=118.32000000000001s)]
*  And then you have overall sort of a pretty high-stress job. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=123.12s)]
*  It's like taking phone calls, frustrating customers and customers in that kind of [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=126.0s)]
*  environment. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=129.52s)]
*  Sort of pretty stressful demanding job for relatively low wage. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=130.24s)]
*  And so because of that, like all those things add up and lead to like sort of a relatively [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=133.12s)]
*  higher turnover environment. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=136.88s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=139.04000000000002s)]
*  I feel like most people don't need a reminder of how brutal that job can get because they've [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=139.6s)]
*  been on the other side. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=143.68s)]
*  Now, many people jump to thinking that AI should replace the contact center and customer [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=145.12s)]
*  service agents. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=149.36s)]
*  But Cresta instead has its eye on transforming a historically low-NPS job into one of mastery [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=150.48000000000002s)]
*  and creativity. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=157.12s)]
*  When you look at artificial intelligence, I think there's really two ways to look at it. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=158.64000000000001s)]
*  There's one way to look at it, which is lazy artificial intelligence. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=162.32s)]
*  And that's basically, I have an existing process that my business does right now. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=165.68s)]
*  I'm going to take that process end to end and I'm going to automate it. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=170.07999999999998s)]
*  And AI is really good at that. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=173.2s)]
*  You can take an existing process, automate it end to end. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=174.24s)]
*  There's another way to leverage AI, which is more like a creative approach, which is [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=176.32s)]
*  understanding how does AI, how can AI be used as a building block? [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=180.16s)]
*  So like AI is now a fundamentally new capability. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=183.44s)]
*  It's unlocked new things. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=186.24s)]
*  And I can reimagine my business or my processes or how I do things, my products based on this [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=187.84s)]
*  new capability and how do I combine humans, products, AI together to result in something [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=192.64s)]
*  that wasn't possible before. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=197.11999999999998s)]
*  And so when you look at the sort of difference between lazy versus creative AI, the lazy [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=198.72s)]
*  approach is to basically go say, hey, this is an existing process. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=202.32s)]
*  Let me just go automate it end to end. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=205.35999999999999s)]
*  But then the creative way to look at it is that, hey, my job or my role as a business [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=207.2s)]
*  is to deliver the best possible customer experience or the best possible product experience. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=211.11999999999998s)]
*  And so like the information and the knowledge that's in my conversations with my customers [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=215.51999999999998s)]
*  is one, like just really great ways to build strong relationships with my customers. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=220.56s)]
*  But two is just like a goldmine of data information about my product, my market, my competitors, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=224.16s)]
*  what's happening, how the world is changing. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=228.48s)]
*  So can you give a couple of examples of that? [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=230.64s)]
*  What can we do with this technology that a human alone could not? [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=232.32s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, so like a great example of it is like when you have like thousands and hundreds [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=236.56s)]
*  of thousands of conversations with customers, the nuggets of information about product feedback [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=241.12s)]
*  that you can use to sort of improve your product or improve your sort of how you position your [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=246.72s)]
*  products in the market or how competition is changing. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=251.04s)]
*  We work with companies that are large telecommunications companies that sort of [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=253.92s)]
*  are constantly looking at evaluating how are they pricing and packaging their various phone [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=257.6s)]
*  bundles or various cable bundles and power bundles. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=261.28s)]
*  And there's just a lot of nuance and data understanding, okay, how does my customer [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=264.4s)]
*  perceive when I make this offer? [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=269.04s)]
*  Like what is the context that they're coming in with? [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=270.32s)]
*  And that really informs their like their market strategy in terms of what's the new [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=272.4s)]
*  product that they should launch, what's the new package or pricing that they should bring to [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=275.76s)]
*  market. Like that's a way that a company can accelerate its development based on just like [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=278.56s)]
*  having a very, very close like ear to the ground and like a real strong pulse of like what the [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=282.71999999999997s)]
*  customer is saying. And that's ultimately the best way to build companies. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=286.64s)]
*  And artificial intelligence is amazing at that because like what's possible now with [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=290.71999999999997s)]
*  large language models, what's possible now with like sort of very advanced deep learning is that [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=294.48s)]
*  you can summarize, you can sort of synthesize, you can pull together information and context [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=298.48s)]
*  in ways that are like really there they can take huge amounts of data, make it super simple [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=302.56s)]
*  to understand and get to insight and get to understanding really quickly in ways that the [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=307.92s)]
*  conversations were unstructured, not possible. Like they were sort of on legacy, on premise, [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=312.32s)]
*  like audio files that you'd have to like listen to one by one, listen for 20 hours to figure out [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=317.2s)]
*  what that's going on. And now you have like this super advanced like human level speech transcription [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=322.08s)]
*  to like human level summarization, human level sort of question answering that sort of helps [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=326.88s)]
*  these companies get to just the next level of iteration as a business. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=330.96s)]
*  What you're saying is actually really fascinating. So when I thought of customer service, [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=334.0s)]
*  I thought, okay, this AI will actually be able to help converse with the customer. But what it sounds [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=338.56s)]
*  like you're saying is it also provides the business with an additional layer of understanding because [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=343.03999999999996s)]
*  it can basically go through all of this unstructured data and gain insights from it. Like you said, [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=347.35999999999996s)]
*  if someone or some cohort of customers is on one plan and they notice something about the [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=351.91999999999996s)]
*  conversations that they can now parse through, again, this large bucket of unstructured data and [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=357.04s)]
*  go and basically back to the company and say, hey, maybe you should start a plan of this nature. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=363.12s)]
*  Maybe you should offer this cohort of customers this deal. Maybe you should talk to them in this [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=367.52000000000004s)]
*  way. Is that basically what you're saying? Yeah. Yeah. And that's like the missing piece of all [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=372.0s)]
*  this is that it's a bidirectional thing, right? It's like you're serving the customer, but you're [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=375.92s)]
*  also serving the business and a lot of information in all of this. And there's a really like, for me, [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=379.6s)]
*  most inspiring example of this is actually Andy Grove. Intel was originally a memory business for [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=385.68s)]
*  a very long time. And it started as a memory business. And then there was like what Andy calls [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=390.72s)]
*  strategic inflection point, where there was a 10X difference in the cost of memory production. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=394.56s)]
*  And so all these Japanese manufacturers were sort of able to produce memory in like this 10X [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=398.96000000000004s)]
*  difference. And it sort of completely changed the dynamics of that market. It's funny like the way [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=403.44s)]
*  he phrased it, but the salespeople at Intel came back to headquarters and they would, the [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=407.28000000000003s)]
*  Japanese salespeople, and they would say, the customers are no longer respectful, as respectful [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=412.24s)]
*  as they were. Like that was like the first signal that he got that something is different in the [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=416.96000000000004s)]
*  market. And it's just interesting, it's just raising like the customers are no longer as [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=421.6s)]
*  respectful as they used to be. That was an input to him that ultimately led to him [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=424.88s)]
*  dramatically pivoting and changing the strategy of the company to become a microprocessor company, [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=430.0s)]
*  because they realized that the market is completely changing. Customers are changing. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=434.64s)]
*  Customer reception to their products is changing and to their salespeople. And that they need to [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=437.68s)]
*  hard pivot the company into becoming a microprocessor company. It's a hard decision to make. But when [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=442.08s)]
*  you have the data, like when you understand what's going on with your customers, like you then have [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=446.24s)]
*  the data, you're informed to make the right product, company strategy decisions that ultimately save [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=450.56s)]
*  the company. So it turns out that these AIs won't just support your customers, but they can actually [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=454.8s)]
*  be an ear or a thousand ears to the ground, feeding data back to your company, informing how you can [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=459.44s)]
*  better serve them. Now we'll come back to the contact center of the future, but now let's [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=465.2s)]
*  introduce Barry McCardell, co-founder and CEO of Hex. Hex is like a sculptor's tool for data, [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=469.36s)]
*  molding, shaping, refining data into valuable insights and visualizations in various formats, [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=475.44s)]
*  or in various words. This is a platform for collaborative data science and analytics. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=480.88s)]
*  Let's hear a little bit more about what the Hex team is building into their product. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=485.6s)]
*  Earlier this year, we launched the closed beta of what we call Hex Magic. Magic is basically a set [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=489.28000000000003s)]
*  of AI tools built right into the Hex UI that our users already know and love. So it lets you [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=494.16s)]
*  generate an edit code. For example, this morning I asked it, you know, what's our account of paying [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=499.04s)]
*  customers broken down by pricing tier with summer revenue? And it wrote me a SQL query that did that. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=502.56s)]
*  Or you can say refactor this Python code to be a function and it will do that for you. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=508.40000000000003s)]
*  It also has features to document your codes, which is really useful if you're staying at like a super [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=512.64s)]
*  complex query or something that someone else wrote. It's like, what's going on with this? You can ask [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=516.72s)]
*  it, I'll tell you. Sounds pretty magical if you ask me, but it's one thing to dream up these new [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=520.72s)]
*  AI features and another to successfully roll them out. And as companies like Hex, Cresta, [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=525.28s)]
*  and soon you'll hear from Sourcegraph do exactly that, they're inevitably running into challenges. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=530.64s)]
*  One issue we've probably all experienced at some point is when technology just does not have the [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=536.3199999999999s)]
*  right contextual understanding. Like being caught in a customer chatbot loop that just is not [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=541.36s)]
*  addressing your query, something that Cresta knows all too well. We've all been there when we're [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=546.0799999999999s)]
*  interfacing with a virtual agent and it's asking you the same question over and over. And you're [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=551.2s)]
*  like, that is not my problem. And clearly my problem has not been coded into the potential set [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=556.8000000000001s)]
*  of solutions. And I find myself in those cases just writing agent, agent, agent, because I need [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=562.6400000000001s)]
*  someone with more of that broad context or the ability to interface in a more dynamic way. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=567.2800000000001s)]
*  But I could also see how that could introduce maybe some unexpected responses. I actually saw [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=572.1600000000001s)]
*  someone on LinkedIn today post that he was talking to a virtual service agent and they called him [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=578.4s)]
*  Beautiful Soul. And he's like, who would do that? What human would do that? Soon we'll hear from [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=585.1999999999999s)]
*  Barry and also our third guest, Beyoung, about how we can actually improve the outputs of these models. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=591.4399999999999s)]
*  But first, here's Zed commenting on how the utilization of these models, if implemented [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=596.56s)]
*  incorrectly, could really impact your brand. What are you seeing in terms of in the field how [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=601.12s)]
*  different companies are gut checking what's coming out of these LLMs and interfacing with [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=607.12s)]
*  their customers? And I'll also tack on a question. What are people doing in terms of ascertaining [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=611.92s)]
*  whether they should actually disclose whether it's a bot or not? Because as we are getting closer to [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=618.8s)]
*  that idea of human level parity, should we be telling people it's still a bot or is it [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=624.16s)]
*  actually good enough where we don't have to anymore? Yeah, that's a good question. I think at the end [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=630.96s)]
*  of the day, if you are a brand, you are fundamentally building trust with your subscriber [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=635.84s)]
*  or customer base. And your brand value is like, hey, I can call up this company and they'll take [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=642.72s)]
*  care of me or I can trust them. And so in that case, I do think leaning toward transparency is [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=650.1600000000001s)]
*  the best thing there because long-term you want to be known as a company that doesn't mess around. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=655.44s)]
*  It's like you're direct, you tell the customers as it is. And it becomes an interesting topic [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=661.36s)]
*  as well on the topic of accent masking. Because that's another use case of the technology that's [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=666.7199999999999s)]
*  coming to market where folks can use this technology to mask accents or change accents [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=671.92s)]
*  or these kinds of things. If you're not upfront about it and there's some edge case that comes [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=676.16s)]
*  up and it becomes clear, it's like, do you want to take that risk to your brand reputation or not? [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=680.88s)]
*  So in addition to the right disclosures, we can actually improve the performance of these models [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=686.4s)]
*  relative to competitors, even if we're using the same underlying models. How do we do that? [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=690.96s)]
*  Through fetching the right data. Because it turns out that if AI doesn't have access to the right [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=696.88s)]
*  data, it'll just make something up. Garbage in, garbage out. Value in, value out. Now here is [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=701.52s)]
*  Biang Liu, co-founder and CTO of Sourcegraph, a code search and navigation tool for deaf teams. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=708.48s)]
*  It's this kind of like general purpose source code understanding engine. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=714.8s)]
*  Our first kind of major push, I would say, is this editor extension called Codi. Actually, [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=718.32s)]
*  we had an earlier effort that was called code search AI. And that was more of like a prototype, [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=723.6s)]
*  just demonstrating some of the underlying capabilities. But where we're focusing right [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=727.5200000000001s)]
*  now is Codi, which is an editor extension. It's available today for VS code. And essentially, [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=730.96s)]
*  what it does is it's a chat-based interface, but also allows you to search for stuff in context [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=736.88s)]
*  in the code. It's going to do auto-complete fairly soon. And the idea is that we wanted something in [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=742.4000000000001s)]
*  our editors that took full advantage of the power of language models, but also kind of addressed a [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=747.92s)]
*  lot of the challenge that people have encountered with large language models. Namely, the tendency [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=753.28s)]
*  to hallucinate facts when they don't really know the answer. And so that's a place where we thought [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=758.24s)]
*  we could be uniquely positioned to help because Sourcegraph, with all the pieces of context that [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=763.52s)]
*  we have around searching for code and finding references and verifying things actually exist, [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=768.56s)]
*  we are kind of like the perfect fact checker, if you will, for the language model and perfect [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=775.92s)]
*  relevant context provider to the language model. And so we're really focusing on this kind of like [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=780.7199999999999s)]
*  in your editor experience right now and pulling in all the context that we can provide, combining [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=785.36s)]
*  that with the power of the language model and just solving all those questions and challenges [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=789.04s)]
*  and sources of tedium and toil that developers encounter daily, hourly, minutely when they're [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=794.9599999999999s)]
*  trying to build software. Yeah. I mean, I think one of the key questions that's coming up right now [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=800.9599999999999s)]
*  is if everyone's trying to implement AI, then how are you going to differentiate relative to [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=806.48s)]
*  your competitors? And it sounds like something you're pointing to is that your focus for so [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=811.6800000000001s)]
*  many years at Sourcegraph on focusing on really good code search is actually somewhat of a [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=816.32s)]
*  differentiator because what you put into the model matters a lot in terms of what you actually get [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=821.6s)]
*  out of a model, even if everyone is using the same model. And so maybe you could just speak a little [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=826.96s)]
*  more to that about the importance of having code search be integral to your product and how that [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=831.52s)]
*  maybe is a moat relative to competitors. Totally. So internally, we've started saying this phrase [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=837.52s)]
*  essentially like context is king. So the context that you provide to a language model really [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=844.0s)]
*  dictates the quality of the output of the model, especially if you're asking about things that are [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=848.8s)]
*  kind of outside the training corpus of that model. So a lot of the big language models that we know [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=853.28s)]
*  about today, you know, chat, GPT, Claude, you know, Bard, they were trained on very large, [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=858.24s)]
*  you know, public data sets and probably some amount of private data, but, you know, they stopped at, [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=864.88s)]
*  you know, 2021 or they're not going to include the private code inside your organization. So they [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=868.88s)]
*  work very well when you're trying to do something kind of generic, like, hey, build me this app with [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=874.08s)]
*  some standard react components or something. They do generally well in those cases. There's still a [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=879.12s)]
*  bit of hallucination because the language model's memory is kind of like human memory where it's [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=882.8s)]
*  not precise like we expect computer memory to be. It's just sort of like a little bit fuzzy. And [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=887.76s)]
*  then it kind of fills in the gaps and hallucinates some. But if you ask it about something that's [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=892.96s)]
*  entirely outside of its training set, it just doesn't know. And worse than that, it's not going [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=897.68s)]
*  to tell you it doesn't know. It's going to pretend it does know and hallucinate something that looks [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=903.12s)]
*  right, but is completely off. And think like everyone who's tried to actually play around [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=907.6s)]
*  with these models in their day-to-day workflow has hit this issue. That's the place where [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=913.44s)]
*  source crap can come in and essentially provide like the missing knowledge gap. So that instead [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=917.92s)]
*  of like talking to this language model, which is kind of like talking to like a reasonably smart [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=922.5600000000001s)]
*  person on the street, asking them a question and them just trying to like invent an answer from [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=927.28s)]
*  what they remember in their minds. Now you arm them with like, you know, Google search or, [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=932.4s)]
*  you know, whatnot. And they can go and like, not only just like use their memory to answer your [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=938.16s)]
*  question, but like go look up stuff on the internet or in our case, like in the wide, [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=942.48s)]
*  wide world of open source code, the recent changes that have happened there, as well as like all the [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=947.2s)]
*  private code inside your organization. And that makes the answer is much more precise. Like when [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=950.88s)]
*  we think about the issues that Cody still has today, and it's, you know, obviously not perfect, [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=956.08s)]
*  almost all the quality issues come down to, oh, we didn't fetch the right context into the context [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=961.84s)]
*  window. Interesting. And I mean, let's double click on that because there are other tools [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=966.64s)]
*  that help you build code using these language models. We'll just throw out a couple, like a [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=972.0s)]
*  lot of people are familiar with GitHub Copilot. A lot of people are familiar with what Replet [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=976.88s)]
*  is doing with Ghostwriter, but maybe you could actually speak to this idea of fetching the right [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=981.36s)]
*  information. Like how would something like a Copilot do that? And how would something like a [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=986.64s)]
*  Cody actually differentiate in its ability to fetch the right information? I think the way we [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=991.36s)]
*  think about it, like as far as I know, Cody is the only AI enabled editor assistant or coding tool [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=996.0s)]
*  today that fetches context as broadly as we do. So when you ask, you can ask Cody a question like, [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=1000.88s)]
*  hey, you know, where is the SAML auth provider defined my code base? Or where's the GraphQL [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=1007.84s)]
*  search API defined? And Cody will actually go and convert that to a couple of search queries [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=1014.16s)]
*  to source graph and surface these relevant snippets of both code and documentation, [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=1020.48s)]
*  use that as like concrete references to answer the user's question. And that's in contrast to [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=1025.12s)]
*  the way that Copilot works today, where most of the context they're looking at, number one, [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=1030.64s)]
*  they don't do a Q&A yet. I think that's on the way with Copilot X, but currently they don't do Q&A. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=1035.2800000000002s)]
*  It's purely kind of like autocomplete driven. And the context that they fetch to do that [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=1041.3600000000001s)]
*  autocompletion is kind of like recent files that you've opened in your editor. So it's kind of [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=1045.68s)]
*  like this very local context, which works amazingly well. I mean, like huge credit to that team, [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=1050.16s)]
*  they've built an awesome user experience. We think that the next evolution of that is, [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=1054.16s)]
*  is providing more relevant context and essentially emulating like what a human kind of does when [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=1058.08s)]
*  you're trying to write code, right? Like you, as a human, you might go back through some recent [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=1063.12s)]
*  history in your editor and to see like, okay, how does that code work? How did that code work? And [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=1067.2s)]
*  use that as like a pattern matching reference point for the thing that you're currently writing. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=1070.08s)]
*  But more often than not, I think you're doing stuff like, you know, go to definition, [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=1073.84s)]
*  find references, you know, let me see a couple of examples of how to use this particular API that [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=1077.04s)]
*  just I just imported. And that's source graphs bread and butter, right? Like that's the code [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=1081.92s)]
*  graph that we spent the past 10 years building. And we can do that essentially in any language, [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=1085.04s)]
*  any code base at compiler level accuracy. And so we can do that automatically. So like the, [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=1089.12s)]
*  the language model Cody will essentially do the kind of like, toilsome task of like, you know, [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=1095.36s)]
*  fetching context and then click, click, click, clicking through the code graph to acquire the [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=1100.8s)]
*  necessary context and then take your user prompt and synthesize an answer from like the actual [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=1104.48s)]
*  code snippets that it thinks are relevant. And I think that that's going to lead to much better [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=1110.56s)]
*  results. I think it's also going to lead to much more kind of introspectable results. So getting [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=1115.9199999999998s)]
*  beyond this like, Oh, elements are magic. How do they work? Is it AGI? You know, whatnot. It's like, [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=1121.2s)]
*  Cody will actually tell you like, Hey, I read these files and these are the files I'm using [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=1125.28s)]
*  to generate an answer. And if it completely, you know, returns a lie or is wrong, you can usually [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=1129.28s)]
*  tell by looking at the context that it read like, Oh, like that, why are you reading that file, [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=1135.44s)]
*  Cody? That's dumb. And you can like thumbs down that and we'll take that as like a reference point [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=1139.84s)]
*  to improve the product later. Another key question that founders are asking is how they'll [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=1144.8s)]
*  differentiate. And Sourcegraph thinks that open source is part of that answer. The other major [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=1149.1999999999998s)]
*  distinction I would draw from a lot of other offerings on the market is we are trying to build [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=1155.52s)]
*  this as much in the open as possible. So like Cody, the editor extension we've released as open source [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=1159.76s)]
*  under the Apache two license. And we think that's kind of like the right mentality to build, you [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=1165.84s)]
*  know, the standard AI editor assistant that every dev should use. We think that there's kind of like [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=1170.4s)]
*  a natural inclination among developers. I'm a developer myself. I prefer to use open tools. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=1175.28s)]
*  And I think it'll make it possible for us to build like a much more like pluggable ecosystem. Like [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=1180.16s)]
*  when you think about like, like the wide, wide world of like context that you would might want [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=1187.2s)]
*  to pull in to answer a question in your mind as a developer, you know, it's not just the source code [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=1191.76s)]
*  or the markdown documentation. Like maybe you're searching through your issue tracker. Maybe you're [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=1196.56s)]
*  searching through like chat messages. Maybe you're searching through like Google docs or Notion for [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=1200.56s)]
*  like the latest products back. And by virtue of being open source, we make it a much better and [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=1205.92s)]
*  friendly kind of ecosystem into which we can plug in like other developer tools and other pieces of [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=1212.96s)]
*  context that aren't necessarily tied to a proprietary compute platform. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=1217.92s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, something that's jumping out to me is if people aren't developers, like even think [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=1222.5600000000002s)]
*  about writing an article, right? Imagine writing that article based on just like your last five [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=1226.48s)]
*  tabs that you had open. That's gonna be very different to being able to actually channel [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=1231.44s)]
*  your goal and search the web yourself, search your own notes that are specifically likely relevant [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=1236.24s)]
*  to the task at hand. And so I think this is like a really interesting perspective as to [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=1242.72s)]
*  we know what goes into the model matters in terms of what you get out of the model. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=1247.92s)]
*  And basically what you're establishing is two different approaches, both the open source [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=1252.5600000000002s)]
*  approach, which allows more people to help you extend it, but then also this approach of [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=1257.5200000000002s)]
*  really finding the most relevant information that's going to help the model give you the [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=1262.64s)]
*  best answer. All right. So we learned from beyond that what you feed models really matters. And that [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=1268.24s)]
*  may be an opening for differentiation relative to competitors. But part of that equation is just the [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=1273.04s)]
*  data that you have access to. Here's Zed commenting on the value of creating proprietary data sets. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=1278.08s)]
*  The opportunity that we see or the opportunity I think that exists in the market is that you can [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=1284.08s)]
*  do that exact same thing. If you can collect proprietary data sets that sort of are unique [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=1287.52s)]
*  and at that same scale, and you can actually sort of in some ways sort of actually sort of [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=1291.92s)]
*  train foundation models that are sort of able to do even more. So the internet or the web pages [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=1296.16s)]
*  are fairly sort of like static sort of language modeling task where you're doing a task and you're [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=1301.0400000000002s)]
*  trying to complete the next token or the next word. The kind of things we interact with in the [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=1306.5600000000002s)]
*  contact center, which is like dialogue and action on sort of you're interacting with someone and then [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=1309.92s)]
*  you're sort of working with enterprise software and systems of record to fill out basic things. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=1314.48s)]
*  It's both sort of this intersection of two sets of data sets that don't really exist together, [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=1319.1200000000001s)]
*  but we sort of are able to collect through all our work with a lot of different companies and [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=1323.44s)]
*  customers like a really really big data set of like this kind of just the type of work. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=1327.76s)]
*  And then that sort of enables us to then train over time these large foundation models that sort [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=1331.8400000000001s)]
*  of use that intersection of that two data set to sort of do things that aren't possible just with [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=1336.0800000000002s)]
*  web pages. Another wedge may be customization. How can you actually use the information from [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=1341.3600000000001s)]
*  past user behavior to support the user in creating better prompts? Here's Barry's take. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=1346.8s)]
*  Under the hood, we are doing a ton in terms of constructing the right prompts and parsing [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=1352.72s)]
*  responses back from the model APIs we're using. And so we again, we have thousands of people [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=1358.0s)]
*  already writing SQL and writing Python and doing data work in hex every day. So we have a ton of [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=1363.76s)]
*  information we've got. We're connected to their database schemas. So we see the structure of their [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=1368.8000000000002s)]
*  data. We see past queries and past code they've written. So we know which tables and columns are [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=1372.5600000000002s)]
*  most frequently referenced. We have information about the project they're building. So we know [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=1376.8000000000002s)]
*  this project is already referencing this part of the schema. And that's probably the relevant data [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=1381.1200000000001s)]
*  for this. We could even look at things like this is the typical way this organization is formatting [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=1385.3600000000001s)]
*  their charts and infer how they might want their visualizations to look. And so there's a ton of [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=1390.8s)]
*  context we get because we're incorporating this in an existing set of workflows that can help us [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=1396.88s)]
*  create the right context and create the right prompt to pass to the model. And I think with all [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=1401.44s)]
*  of this right now, again, our focus really is on augmenting the data professionals. This is not [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=1406.8s)]
*  like trying to build some black box thing. It's actually like we have a rule as we're building [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=1412.1599999999999s)]
*  these features. It's like we don't run the code for you. We will generate the code. We will show [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=1417.68s)]
*  it to you. But we want to keep the human in the loop. AI sure can feel like a black box. So designing [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=1421.44s)]
*  a UI that actually guides the user is also becoming a differentiator, at least for the time being, [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=1426.8799999999999s)]
*  where you're effectively nudging users to want to interface with these new tools, [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=1432.64s)]
*  but also come back. Any learnings in terms of what is increasing completion rates? What is getting [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=1436.5600000000002s)]
*  people to actually interface with this new, in some ways, superpower within the app? Because there [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=1442.96s)]
*  is the flip side where, as you said, if it's hallucinating, or if it's not helping them, [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=1449.0400000000002s)]
*  or in some cases, it may even be hindering their workflow, they're not going to return to it. So [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=1453.2800000000002s)]
*  how are you thinking about designing that? There's some UI things we've done, as an example, [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=1458.32s)]
*  in Hex, we have these code cells that you use. And so we put a lot of thought into what's the [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=1463.4399999999998s)]
*  right way to interact with that. It's like a comment completion. We have this cool thing that [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=1469.04s)]
*  seems to have been inspirational to other people now. A little drawer that pops out of the top and [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=1474.24s)]
*  allows you to edit what's been low, and it tucks itself away when you're done with it. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=1479.28s)]
*  You can keep using it. I think giving people feedback on what's happening. Some of these [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=1483.28s)]
*  models, the latency is still really high. So even something small, just being really thoughtful on [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=1488.0800000000002s)]
*  how you're exposing to the user what's going on and why they're waiting. One of the things that [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=1492.56s)]
*  we've observed is more on the backend in terms of increasing completion rates is when you're [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=1496.48s)]
*  building prompts, I think we were tempted early on to try to shove as much context as we could in. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=1502.0s)]
*  You figure the more I can tell this model, the better. And you realize you can pretty easily [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=1507.44s)]
*  confuse a model in terms of the amount of context you're passing. And so we've been really thoughtful [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=1512.16s)]
*  on iterating through and finding what's the right level of context to pass through between what else [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=1517.68s)]
*  is going on in the project or the underlying data schemas or past work they've done that's going to [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=1522.8000000000002s)]
*  best encourage. And there's a lot of techniques you can start to like sort of ladder up and use [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=1527.6000000000001s)]
*  in terms of working with chains through link chain, through starting to apply embeddings [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=1532.0s)]
*  to better allow you to sort of craft the right context to be able to pass to that model. And I [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=1536.5600000000002s)]
*  think that is really actually the hard work in many ways of incorporating AI into your product. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=1540.96s)]
*  Right. Like it feels really simple. Like you can go get an API. Anyone listening to this today could [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=1546.08s)]
*  go to the OpenAI website and get an API key. It's everything you're doing before you're sending [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=1550.56s)]
*  requests to that API of like building the right context, understanding how you're iterating on [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=1555.76s)]
*  how different models are going to respond to different types of prompts and different [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=1560.08s)]
*  amounts of context, how you're potentially even chaining together different types of models or [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=1562.96s)]
*  different modalities of models together in one sequence in UX and how you're giving that feedback [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=1567.44s)]
*  to the user. I think again, it feels like a really exciting time because it's very early days in [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=1572.96s)]
*  figuring all of this out. Yeah. I mean, I spoke to someone yesterday and what you're saying really [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=1578.3200000000002s)]
*  resonates with what they said. They started off by creating like a lens like product, but at the end [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=1582.8s)]
*  of the day, there wasn't really a moat there because anyone could kind of hook up to Dream [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=1588.16s)]
*  Booth and create the same thing. Yeah, right. But today I asked him like, wow, he's thinking about [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=1591.52s)]
*  differentiating. And at least in his scenario, he was saying, you know, I now link 15 different [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=1596.4s)]
*  models. And so that maybe that isn't much of a moat either, but the point is it's not as simple [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=1601.1200000000001s)]
*  as just hooking into one API. So we've touched on different aspects of differentiation from [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=1606.64s)]
*  customization to context fetching, but is any of that truly a moat? Where does value really accrue [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=1610.96s)]
*  when your competitors can copy your UI or your latest feature? Let's attack the question head on. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=1617.76s)]
*  Where is the competitive advantage? Where is the moat? Is it in the UI? It feels like that can be [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=1623.76s)]
*  replicated very easily. Is it in the cleaning of the data, the linking of the data? Is it something [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=1628.5600000000002s)]
*  else? Like, how are you thinking about the fact that basically you can kind of depend on all your [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=1634.4s)]
*  competitors to replicate what you do if it's working? Yeah, we've already seen that. Yeah. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=1639.2s)]
*  Down to some UI elements that look very familiar. Yeah, you have to take that as a given. I think [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=1646.72s)]
*  the models themselves and being able to send a request to one of them is already a commodity. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=1652.64s)]
*  I think there's a few layers that we think about this at. One is we do have a pretty great data [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=1657.2800000000002s)]
*  advantage. You know, already having hundreds of customers, thousands of users writing [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=1662.24s)]
*  millions of lines worth of SQL on Python. We can use that sort of rich information. We're not using [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=1666.48s)]
*  it to train models. I should be very clear. Like, that's one thing we've been very upfront with our [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=1673.6000000000001s)]
*  customers about. Like, we're not training models where they would expect to ever have some code [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=1677.0400000000002s)]
*  be a completion for someone else, which is a problem in other places. But it's more like [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=1682.24s)]
*  using that actually to personalize for that person and their team. You know, again, like, [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=1686.4s)]
*  which schemas you're using, what is their code style been like in the past? Like, having all of [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=1690.4s)]
*  that information and people who are already doing that work in Hex gives us a big advantage. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=1695.04s)]
*  Thing two is, and I talk about this with the team all the time, like, it's kind of what we've already [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=1699.6s)]
*  been doing, which is building really thoughtful, well-constructed user experiences and UIs. Like, [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=1703.28s)]
*  you could say that there's very little moat for a lot of things we or a lot of other SaaS companies [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=1708.16s)]
*  do inherently for in their products. It's really how do you put these pieces together and how do [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=1712.48s)]
*  you build a really great user experience, both from, you know, the pixels on the screen to [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=1718.24s)]
*  thinking about performance behind the scenes to things like docs. Like, that all sort of combines [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=1724.4s)]
*  to being a really superior product experience and it's stuff that we're, you know, three and a half [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=1729.92s)]
*  years into taking super seriously. And so that is a sort of advantage and almost like infrastructure [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=1734.64s)]
*  we can already stand on in terms of how we start incorporating these things. And I do think that [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=1739.76s)]
*  long-term generative AI, large language models, they will change a lot of like fundamental [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=1745.2800000000002s)]
*  assumptions. And I think that there will be an advantage to the companies that can be the first [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=1749.76s)]
*  ones to figure out what those things are. Just like social apps benefit from network effects, [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=1754.0s)]
*  it's actually not crazy to imagine that even if certain products are built on the same models, [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=1759.3600000000001s)]
*  first movers that incorporate customization may maintain an advantage. Because if you spend months [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=1764.4s)]
*  or even years personalizing a model to your specific needs, would you want to do that again? [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=1770.4s)]
*  But as these platforms collect more information about your preferences and potentially even train [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=1775.68s)]
*  models on your data, certain companies may build a data moat. But that's also where privacy comes [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=1780.24s)]
*  into play. The future of privacy and security in AI is a complex and evolving issue, especially [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=1786.0s)]
*  since your competitors may be on the other side of that API call. Companies are rightfully asking [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=1791.6s)]
*  questions about data collection and data storage. A lot of these companies that are integrating AI [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=1796.48s)]
*  are building off of just a few models, right? A lot of people are familiar with OpenAI's API [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=1802.3999999999999s)]
*  that came out recently. But there's also that very interesting dynamic that a lot of the same [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=1807.04s)]
*  companies that may even consider themselves competitors are using similar models. And so [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=1813.28s)]
*  how did you think about that? And also there's this layered question as it relates to security [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=1818.8s)]
*  and privacy, because depending on the company that you are, your code is actually potentially [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=1823.52s)]
*  somewhat all the way to extremely proprietary, right? If you're talking about a self-driving [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=1829.44s)]
*  car company. And so how did you think about that given that, again, this code for the customers [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=1834.1599999999999s)]
*  that work with you is extremely important? Yeah, that's an excellent question. And it's [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=1840.3999999999999s)]
*  especially pertinent to us because we have a lot of enterprise customers that are very security and [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=1845.28s)]
*  privacy sensitive to the point where, you know, Sourcegraph is one of the reasons we made it [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=1850.24s)]
*  self-hostable is because we wanted to enable companies that didn't want to put their code [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=1854.96s)]
*  bases in the cloud to still have awesome code understanding and code search tools. I think for [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=1860.3999999999999s)]
*  us, the way we think about it, we love OpenAI, we love Anthropic, Cohira is also great. I'm looking [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=1866.56s)]
*  forward to what Google releases in this arena too. And there's just amazing developments [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=1872.96s)]
*  happening in open source as well. There's a team at Salesforce that produced a really good cogen [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=1878.88s)]
*  model called Cogen. And it's kind of competitive from what I can tell with the codex-based model [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=1885.6000000000001s)]
*  that other tools use at the moment for autocomplete. And so the space is kind of fast evolving. And our [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=1892.56s)]
*  mentality is like, look, we have a wide range of customers from very conservative large enterprises [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=1899.44s)]
*  to fast moving startups that have different risk and security profiles. The language model in our [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=1905.44s)]
*  overall architecture is just one component. It's one component of the bigger Cody picture, the other [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=1912.56s)]
*  components being the Sourcegraph code graph and the various other developer tools that we want to [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=1917.92s)]
*  integrate in kind of an open way. And so we want to make it possible to kind of bring your own [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=1923.1200000000001s)]
*  language model to the table. Some of our customers have negotiated separate deals with model providers. [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=1928.64s)]
*  They want to use that model. Some have in-house models that they've built that they want to use. [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=1933.8400000000001s)]
*  And some are like, hey, can you give us something that we can self-host? And while we don't have [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=1938.72s)]
*  one that's completely self-hostable yet, I think with all the interesting things happening around [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=1942.8000000000002s)]
*  Llama, Alpaca, and that sort of thing, I think within six months we'll have a viable language [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=1947.1200000000001s)]
*  model that can do really good Q&A-based interactions. And so our mentality has just been like, look, [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=1952.0800000000002s)]
*  we want to work with all the model providers. They're all innovating at just a crazy [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=1958.6399999999999s)]
*  breakneck pace. And our desire as a business is to do what's best for our customers and users. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=1963.76s)]
*  And right now that just means like, whatever is the latest and greatest on the market, [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=1968.3999999999999s)]
*  let's try to plug it in and see how it does. So you're basically saying that you give them [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=1972.6399999999999s)]
*  the selection or the option. Am I understanding that correctly? Or are you still building off of [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=1977.84s)]
*  one model? When someone uses Cody, is that integrated with one? Or are you basically saying, [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=1982.24s)]
*  again, you're going to give them the option to select how they want to integrate? [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=1986.56s)]
*  We'll give you the option. So right now you can use Claude, which is Anthropix kind of flagship [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=1991.76s)]
*  model. You can use ChatGBT, which is kind of the open AI model. And we're looking to integrate [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=1997.9199999999998s)]
*  additional models too. And there's also kind of like different models that we plug in in different [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=2003.84s)]
*  pieces of Cody, right? So there's kind of like the chat-based models, which are often like the [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=2007.84s)]
*  largest ones. But there's also things like the embeddings model. That's what we use to [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=2011.52s)]
*  generate the kind of embeddings vector. The embeddings vector is that we use to do really [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=2016.24s)]
*  good kind of like fuzzy semantic level code search. And we have an open source model that we [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=2022.0s)]
*  fine-tuned. And that's actually like the best embeddings model that we have. Now, if you want [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=2027.2s)]
*  to use like one of the proprietary embeddings offerings too, we can definitely do that. But I [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=2031.76s)]
*  think our mentality is just like the language model aspect of this. We want to make as kind of [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=2036.16s)]
*  pluggable as possible. That's amazing because something that that also relates to is cost, [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=2040.4s)]
*  right? Like each of these different models has a different cost. I think a couple of weeks ago, [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=2045.2s)]
*  Bing, like 5X their pricing overnight, right? You have a dependency as well, both source graph, [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=2049.92s)]
*  but also like that ends up filtering down to your customers. And so every one of these models, [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=2056.24s)]
*  I mean, I think we're still in the early innings and there's going to be so many more developed. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=2061.52s)]
*  And each one will, to your point, it'll have a different security posture. It'll have different [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=2065.04s)]
*  pricing scheme. It'll probably, there'll be a range in terms of its efficacy or specialty [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=2068.88s)]
*  in certain areas. And so that's actually, it never dawned on me that actually, you could offer [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=2074.32s)]
*  the access across the board to all these models, but also kind of relay the transparent pros and [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=2080.96s)]
*  cons to the customer base. Is that how you're kind of thinking about it? That's exactly how [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=2087.36s)]
*  we're thinking about it. And I think for us, it's kind of like, there's so much innovation happening [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=2091.76s)]
*  in that space and we don't want to be kind of tied to any one provider. And also I think a lot [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=2096.24s)]
*  of the value that we can provide in terms of Cody and in terms of like integrating AI deeper in a [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=2102.4799999999996s)]
*  source graph is really about combining the language model with the pieces of context and the structured [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=2107.2s)]
*  understanding of code that we have. And so it's really the combination of those two, I think that [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=2112.3999999999996s)]
*  makes something truly valuable. And it's funny that you mentioned the kind of Bing price hike. [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=2117.2799999999997s)]
*  I thought that was like a big proof point and people notice because like when, when, [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=2121.7599999999998s)]
*  when chat GPT first came out, I think a lot of people said like, Hey, you know, this kind of [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=2125.9199999999996s)]
*  replaces search engines, right? Like I could just chat with this thing and it was telling me the [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=2129.9199999999996s)]
*  answer instead of me having to go and like click through a bunch of different results and figure [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=2134.16s)]
*  out the answer myself. But then as people started to use language models a bit more, they started [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=2138.7999999999997s)]
*  running into more hallucinations. And I think it was like the release of Bing where people finally [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=2143.68s)]
*  realized like, like being released, they integrated chat GPT or GPT-4, you know, one of those like [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=2148.96s)]
*  awesome like open AI models in, but they combined it with the fundamental Bing search. They just [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=2155.84s)]
*  didn't, they didn't just like ship a white label chat GPT. They combined that with Bing search on [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=2162.16s)]
*  the backend. And a lot of the other AI enabled search engines were actually using the Bing backend [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=2166.88s)]
*  as well, because that was, as far as I know, like Google doesn't have like a search API that, that [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=2172.16s)]
*  you can use. So everyone was using Bing and that just spoke to the necessity, I think of combining [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=2176.4s)]
*  kind of the language model as sort of like the, the reasoning engine, but you still need kind of [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=2183.44s)]
*  like an informational retrieval engine to make that truly powerful. And the unison that, that really [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=2187.6800000000003s)]
*  is valuable. And that's maybe I'm speculating here, but like that maybe had something to do with [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=2192.8s)]
*  the Bing price hike. Like it is not true that language models make search engines unnecessary. [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=2198.0s)]
*  If anything, they make the search engines more valuable because now all that data that you can [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=2204.72s)]
*  search becomes like 10X more powerful because you can use that to, you know, get to, get to your [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=2208.3199999999997s)]
*  answer with like, you know, one 10th the effort or in one 10th of time. Yeah. I mean that, that's such [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=2214.16s)]
*  a great point that the search engine itself is still, it still has utility to find all the [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=2218.7999999999997s)]
*  information that at the end of the day feeds into the language model. Byung brings up a really [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=2224.16s)]
*  important point around price. These models are not free and we're still in the early innings of [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=2229.68s)]
*  figuring out the right business models for LLMs. How much did they cost? What value add would allow [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=2234.72s)]
*  certain providers to charge way more? And is it worth integrating into multiple models to reduce [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=2240.08s)]
*  price or platform risk? But something else that feeds this equation is the cost to maintain data, [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=2245.9199999999996s)]
*  which is also not free. Here is Barry reflecting on the deep relationship between dollars and data. [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=2251.44s)]
*  One interesting facet of all this is that there's kind of this, as we just discussed, [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=2258.4s)]
*  this realization of the value of data. And I think we're going to see a lot more companies [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=2262.64s)]
*  retain their data for longer, collect more data from their products or from their users. And so [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=2268.4s)]
*  there's this, again, this privacy security posture of like, okay, we want to have this data, we're [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=2274.2400000000002s)]
*  probably going to keep it for longer. How do we keep it safe? But then there's also a cost element, [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=2278.96s)]
*  right? It's not necessarily free to retain data. It's also not free to run these models. [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=2284.08s)]
*  It's also not zero risk. A lot of companies intentionally delete their data. People will [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=2288.7999999999997s)]
*  have retention policies on emails or Slack. But by doing that, you're eliminating knowledge. And [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=2293.84s)]
*  that knowledge could be useful in the first instance. I want to go back and search. That's [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=2300.72s)]
*  the thing I think a lot of big companies deal with as they start to have record retention things. [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=2305.68s)]
*  But there's also like second order value to that in terms of, could that inform a model or a, [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=2310.32s)]
*  you know, potential different applications for how you can learn from what your organization [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=2317.1200000000003s)]
*  has done historically? So I don't know where we're going to wind up on that. I do think you're right [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=2320.6400000000003s)]
*  that a lot of companies are realizing the value of their data and their IP and thinking about [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=2324.88s)]
*  that in a deeper way. Already operating in the data space, both at Hex and previously, [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=2329.04s)]
*  we already have this like appreciation for people being really paranoid about their data, [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=2333.84s)]
*  people really caring about where their data goes. And so in some ways, there's nothing [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=2337.6s)]
*  new for us here. I think there's all sorts of really exciting opportunities on how you could [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=2341.68s)]
*  use data that customers are trusting you with, making sure you're continuing to earn that trust. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=2346.08s)]
*  With all these considerations, it's really easy to get stuck in the weeds. So let's take a step [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=2350.4s)]
*  back and imagine a future where companies have successfully deployed this technology. Not as a [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=2355.2799999999997s)]
*  gimmick, but in a way that successfully gets their customers closer to their goals. What [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=2360.64s)]
*  differentiates software is like, can you build the workflows that get to the business outcomes? [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=2366.0s)]
*  And as we close out, let's return back to where we started, the contact center. Let's say, you know, [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=2369.92s)]
*  we're in 2023. Let's jump to 2028, five years from now. Given the technology that we have today, [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=2375.6s)]
*  also the change in the cost curve that you mentioned, which sounds really fundamental. [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=2381.68s)]
*  What does the contact center look like in 2028? What I think it looks like is this concept of [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=2385.76s)]
*  like, like, I remember, like, when we started the company, Tim and I, we got this video from our [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=2390.64s)]
*  first customer that like, we had both, we both had not dropped out of the PhD yet, but like we were [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=2395.52s)]
*  with our first customer sort of like getting our first sort of thing. And they showed us a video [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=2401.36s)]
*  what their vision for the contact center of the future looked like, like, this is five years ago. [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=2405.52s)]
*  And when we saw that, we're like, holy shit, like, okay, everyone has the same, it's like, [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=2409.7599999999998s)]
*  we're going to drop out tomorrow and we're going to go to this company. But the vision was basically [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=2413.7599999999998s)]
*  this idea of like a touchless close where it was one of our first customers who basically had this [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=2418.16s)]
*  idea that they had a contact center of like people that would, that didn't sit on computers [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=2423.52s)]
*  anymore. They just like would walk around and have like a dialogue, sort of just a piece that [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=2428.08s)]
*  they were using to talk to customers. And all they were focusing on was the interaction with [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=2433.52s)]
*  the customer and the relationship building aspect. And the back end, like the system is like doing [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=2437.36s)]
*  the, it's like doing the sort of automatically data entry, the filling of the form, all these things. [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=2441.52s)]
*  It's like taking care of all the stuff on the back end and like the agent's not typing anything. [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=2448.24s)]
*  They're not doing any data entry. They're not doing any summarization. They're not looking [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=2452.08s)]
*  at the customer record. Like all that stuff is like handled by the machine and it's handled in a way [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=2455.2799999999997s)]
*  that the human can just like focus on how do I build a good relationship and resolve this [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=2460.08s)]
*  customer's problem or like help find them the right product for their solution. And like that's [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=2464.24s)]
*  naturally what humans are great at, which is that sort of empathy and connection and sort of [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=2468.88s)]
*  relationship building. And I think that's what's going to be, we'll have a much less regimented [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=2472.7999999999997s)]
*  contact center, like much less sort of structured and like these are your times. We have to do after [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=2476.24s)]
*  call work. This is your average handle time goal. These are the things it'll be just much more [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=2480.64s)]
*  focused on, Hey, how do we use this center as a proactive way to strategically build relationships [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=2484.3199999999997s)]
*  with key customers? And how do we build those relationships with our folks and like take away [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=2489.3599999999997s)]
*  all the mundane busy work from it. And then for the stuff that people want, like frictionless [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=2494.0s)]
*  experiences, like there will be things that they don't want to interact with the human about at [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=2497.92s)]
*  all. And like those are like, we can provide those in a fully digital sort of frictionless [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=2501.2s)]
*  manner that they can deal with if they want to deal with a bot for those like strategic things [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=2505.2s)]
*  that they want to interact and want to trust someone and have an interaction with someone [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=2508.48s)]
*  for like a critical decision and like feel like that they can trust something. That's when we have [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=2511.6s)]
*  humans available. And like, we want to have those humans tied up in busy work and mundane work, [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=2515.36s)]
*  we'll have those humans tied up and how they actually can help the customer. And then they're [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=2519.28s)]
*  not measuring their average handle time and they're not measuring like, like, I have to get to the [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=2522.48s)]
*  next call. I have to fill out those notes for this call. It's they're able to focus really on the [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=2526.16s)]
*  customer interaction. That's a very nice picture that's painted. And in that world, it's almost [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=2529.2s)]
*  as if the customer service agent is actually like a strategic role, right? It's not just like the [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=2533.84s)]
*  day to day, let me plug in, plug out, let me solve this customer's request. It's almost like, [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=2539.52s)]
*  like an account manager or something like that. Yeah. And I think that's where it's headed. [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=2543.76s)]
*  Because once you have systems that handle the repetitive, like reactive things, and you move [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=2547.44s)]
*  to like sort of becoming strategic and proactive, it's like, how do I proactively build businesses? [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=2553.44s)]
*  Like when I build relationships, I'm proactively reaching out to build relationships with large [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=2558.1600000000003s)]
*  enterprise customers, right? And that's like a very strategic use of my time to like go spend [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=2561.84s)]
*  time with them and like sort of build those relationships. I think the same concept applies [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=2566.1600000000003s)]
*  to like, even if you, whether you have like 100 enterprise customers or thousand enterprise [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=2570.0s)]
*  customers or like 100 million consumer customers, it's like those folks are people at the end of [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=2574.2400000000002s)]
*  the day and like building relationships with them is just as like strategic as it is with your [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=2578.6400000000003s)]
*  large number of enterprise customers. And so now technology can enable you to build those kinds of [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=2584.4s)]
*  relationships in a very human way and scale. Yeah. And on the customer side, I could see how [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=2589.04s)]
*  it could actually be, you know, you could even say fun or entertaining with the integration of [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=2593.44s)]
*  technology. Imagine that, you know, you're talking to a bot and not only does it serve your problem, [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=2597.68s)]
*  but it's also in the voice of like your favorite cartoon character. And it's telling you answers [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=2602.56s)]
*  in a way that you're actually like following a story or something like that. And actually, [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=2607.68s)]
*  oh, because they've done all this backend research based on these customer conversations, [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=2611.52s)]
*  that actually you leave the conversation with a better deal than you had before. And you didn't [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=2615.68s)]
*  have to spend three hours on the phone to get there. Like I actually, as we're talking about this, [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=2619.8399999999997s)]
*  I'm like, well, you know, you go from, as you said, a negative NPS industry, you could actually [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=2624.24s)]
*  imagine that these things could be fun and frictionless. Yep. Negative to positive. [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=2630.0s)]
*  Negative to positive. What a great place to end off. AI's rapid evolution is constantly [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=2635.6s)]
*  challenging companies to stay ahead and navigating the implementation of AI is bringing [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=2641.04s)]
*  up issues of personalization, design, cost, and privacy to center stage. A big thanks to Hex, [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZR3Pn8NNLs&t=2645.84s)]
