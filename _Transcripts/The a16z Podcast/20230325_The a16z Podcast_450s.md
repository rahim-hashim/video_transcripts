# Olivia Moore Shares Trending Apps in 2023
**The a16z Podcast:** [March 25, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAsG8RXEnd4)
*  What kind of apps do you think are going to thrive in this new year? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAsG8RXEnd4&t=0.0s)]
*  So there's already an early, I don't want to say winner, but maybe an early leader for [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAsG8RXEnd4&t=6.72s)]
*  2023, which is Temu, which is a new commerce app developed by a large Chinese company called [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAsG8RXEnd4&t=11.44s)]
*  Pin Duoduo. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAsG8RXEnd4&t=17.84s)]
*  And in China, the version of this app is a full group buying experience. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAsG8RXEnd4&t=18.84s)]
*  Say you're going to purchase a bag of apples or something and the price on the app is $2. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAsG8RXEnd4&t=23.64s)]
*  The more friends you invite to add a bag of apples to the order, the price can go all [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAsG8RXEnd4&t=28.86s)]
*  the way down to like 10 cents, five cents. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAsG8RXEnd4&t=33.019999999999996s)]
*  So it kind of gamifies commerce. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAsG8RXEnd4&t=36.58s)]
*  The US version of it is a little bit less sophisticated so far, but it is basically [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAsG8RXEnd4&t=38.86s)]
*  deep discounts on these products that are largely kind of shipping from overseas. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAsG8RXEnd4&t=45.019999999999996s)]
*  There is quite a bit of gamification around inviting your friends to get extra points [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAsG8RXEnd4&t=50.7s)]
*  Then you can win free items shipped directly from you or even withdraw cash from the app [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAsG8RXEnd4&t=55.62s)]
*  by inviting other friends to download it. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAsG8RXEnd4&t=60.779999999999994s)]
*  So unsurprisingly, that has resulted in a ton of downloads. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAsG8RXEnd4&t=63.22s)]
*  Yeah, free money. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAsG8RXEnd4&t=66.89999999999999s)]
*  Yes. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAsG8RXEnd4&t=68.38s)]
*  From my most recent check, I think of the 25 days so far this year, Temu has been at [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAsG8RXEnd4&t=69.38s)]
*  the top for like 22 of them. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAsG8RXEnd4&t=75.82s)]
*  They were not number one on New Year's Day because some like habit tracker app or New [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAsG8RXEnd4&t=78.1s)]
*  Year's resolution app hit it, but otherwise they've held the top spot. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAsG8RXEnd4&t=82.46000000000001s)]
*  And that number of days would be good enough to break into the top five last year. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAsG8RXEnd4&t=86.62s)]
*  So I'm going to make an early call that we'll see Temu at least in the top five, if not [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAsG8RXEnd4&t=91.34s)]
*  higher. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAsG8RXEnd4&t=95.78s)]
*  Temu is an interesting example of another kind of trend I expect to see in 2023, which [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAsG8RXEnd4&t=96.78s)]
*  is AI, almost invisible AI products where we've seen these AI first products, all the [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAsG8RXEnd4&t=102.38s)]
*  avatar and art apps. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAsG8RXEnd4&t=108.7s)]
*  But TikTok was actually one of the first and still best examples of invisible AI, where [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAsG8RXEnd4&t=110.54s)]
*  the reason the product is so addictive is because they have this algorithm that becomes [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAsG8RXEnd4&t=115.54s)]
*  catered to you. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAsG8RXEnd4&t=119.9s)]
*  Temu does this really well. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAsG8RXEnd4&t=121.22s)]
*  Also, they have this marketplace in the back end of inventory from thousands of suppliers. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAsG8RXEnd4&t=122.74000000000001s)]
*  But as soon as you browse the app for five or ten minutes, they can tell pretty quickly [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAsG8RXEnd4&t=128.38s)]
*  what is she clicking on, what is she interested in, and then they'll serve you deals and [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAsG8RXEnd4&t=133.34s)]
*  products that are really catered to your interests. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAsG8RXEnd4&t=137.82s)]
*  So I expect to see more companies kind of utilizing that almost AI infrastructure. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAsG8RXEnd4&t=140.72s)]
*  You know, that's a great point, because we've seen the rise of TikTok as people shift from [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAsG8RXEnd4&t=146.82s)]
*  what people might say is more connection based or contact based interaction on social to [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAsG8RXEnd4&t=151.56s)]
*  interest based, where it doesn't matter if you know the person, but TikTok, because it's [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAsG8RXEnd4&t=157.26s)]
*  got such a strong AI back end, is servicing the things that it knows you're going to like, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAsG8RXEnd4&t=161.01999999999998s)]
*  and it gets better and better over time. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAsG8RXEnd4&t=166.78s)]
*  And I think this actually fits into what we discussed before about how it's really hard [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAsG8RXEnd4&t=168.82000000000002s)]
*  to create stickiness with these apps over a period of time. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAsG8RXEnd4&t=173.02s)]
*  And again, I think it's because, you know, on one hand, it's really nice to be able to [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAsG8RXEnd4&t=176.78s)]
*  leverage word of mouth as people tell you something. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAsG8RXEnd4&t=181.54000000000002s)]
*  But on the other hand, that word of mouth changes very quickly. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAsG8RXEnd4&t=184.18s)]
*  But if you have a strong back end where you can evolve that and you can kind of follow [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAsG8RXEnd4&t=187.14000000000001s)]
*  the user through their journey of liking something and then liking something else later, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAsG8RXEnd4&t=191.62s)]
*  I think that's why TikTok has been so sticky, because, you know, I've heard people who [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAsG8RXEnd4&t=196.74s)]
*  start on TikTok and they listen to dancing videos, but then all of a sudden TikTok picks [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAsG8RXEnd4&t=200.58s)]
*  up that they like power washing videos or like keto recipes or and it follows them [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAsG8RXEnd4&t=204.34s)]
*  through that journey. And so there's no need for them to go look for something else. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAsG8RXEnd4&t=209.86s)]
*  And so I like that you mentioned these two applications that have AI in the back end. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAsG8RXEnd4&t=213.38s)]
*  But I also think there's a nature to that that is much more sticky than AI that's in [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAsG8RXEnd4&t=218.54000000000002s)]
*  your face, as you said, like a lens, for example. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAsG8RXEnd4&t=222.58s)]
*  Yeah, this is also a fascinating point because it brings up another trend that I think we [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAsG8RXEnd4&t=225.38000000000002s)]
*  expect to see in 2023 that's very counterintuitive and I think kind of reverses a wave that we saw [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAsG8RXEnd4&t=230.42000000000002s)]
*  in 2021 and 2022, which is that the AI algorithm of TikTok is so good that it will get you [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAsG8RXEnd4&t=236.74s)]
*  enormous reach for your product very, very quickly. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAsG8RXEnd4&t=244.42000000000002s)]
*  And so we've seen this trend with a lot of early stage consumer companies where a video will hit [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAsG8RXEnd4&t=248.10000000000002s)]
*  and go viral and suddenly have a million, five million, ten million views. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAsG8RXEnd4&t=253.38s)]
*  And they'll get a flood of users that the product is not actually ready for and that [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAsG8RXEnd4&t=258.26s)]
*  the product isn't kind of equipped to retain. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAsG8RXEnd4&t=263.06s)]
*  And so we've seen actually a few startups I talked to recently have started limiting [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAsG8RXEnd4&t=266.1s)]
*  their own virality, which sounds impossible because virality is theoretically organic. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAsG8RXEnd4&t=270.98s)]
*  But what they'll do is if a video starts performing too well on TikTok, it gets too [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAsG8RXEnd4&t=277.38s)]
*  many views. They will actually temporarily shut off the video or archive the video because [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAsG8RXEnd4&t=282.66s)]
*  it's driving too many downloads and they feel like they're not necessarily converting those [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAsG8RXEnd4&t=288.66s)]
*  downloads into engaged users quite well enough yet. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAsG8RXEnd4&t=293.14000000000004s)]
*  So I think we'll see maybe the strategy around how founders utilize TikTok, hopefully to their [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAsG8RXEnd4&t=297.86s)]
*  advantage, also evolve quite a bit in this coming year. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAsG8RXEnd4&t=303.70000000000005s)]
*  Yeah, it also reminds me of something you've mentioned before, which is that [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAsG8RXEnd4&t=307.86s)]
*  TikTok is so good that even users as well are kind of limiting themselves from the app. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAsG8RXEnd4&t=312.98s)]
*  I do this. I don't go on TikTok because I am very well aware that TikTok's algorithm is better than [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAsG8RXEnd4&t=320.18s)]
*  my self-control. And so I need to just shut it down and not go on the application because I know [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAsG8RXEnd4&t=327.46000000000004s)]
*  I will inevitably find myself two hours later looking up and asking what happened. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAsG8RXEnd4&t=333.94000000000005s)]
*  So are there examples of apps that you've seen that kind of leverage this pushback on [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAsG8RXEnd4&t=338.98s)]
*  how good some of these apps are at capturing our attention? [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAsG8RXEnd4&t=346.26s)]
*  First of all, I think the trend is very real and probably underestimated right now. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAsG8RXEnd4&t=349.22s)]
*  This is to me comparable to the moment for millennials where Selena Gomez was like, [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAsG8RXEnd4&t=354.66s)]
*  I can't go on Instagram anymore. Like the biggest, most followed star. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAsG8RXEnd4&t=359.14000000000004s)]
*  We're seeing like Emma Chamberlain, Jenna Ortega, all of these Gen Z stars saying, [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAsG8RXEnd4&t=363.14000000000004s)]
*  I'm not going to do TikTok anymore because it's too addictive. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAsG8RXEnd4&t=368.1s)]
*  A couple things have come out of that. I think Instagram Reels and YouTube Shorts [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAsG8RXEnd4&t=371.06s)]
*  benefit from that. It's funny. I have a younger brother. He's 22. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAsG8RXEnd4&t=375.22s)]
*  And he told me like, I had to delete TikTok because it's too good. It's too addictive. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAsG8RXEnd4&t=379.14000000000004s)]
*  I'm just going to watch Instagram Reels. And then I was telling him, [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAsG8RXEnd4&t=383.54s)]
*  but you're giving dated Instagram Reels that allows them to make that algorithm better. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAsG8RXEnd4&t=386.66s)]
*  And soon enough, there'll be no escape from these like hyper curated short form video algorithms. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAsG8RXEnd4&t=391.22s)]
*  I do think like on a higher level, maybe this ties back to what we were talking about with new [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAsG8RXEnd4&t=397.62s)]
*  consumer social things like Be Real to me are like a direct example of that kind of pushback. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAsG8RXEnd4&t=402.9s)]
*  On Be Real, you go in, you take a picture, you have to take it in a two minute frame. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAsG8RXEnd4&t=408.98s)]
*  Maybe you scroll through and leave an emoji on some of your friends' pictures, [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAsG8RXEnd4&t=413.86s)]
*  but you're not in the app for usually more than a few minutes a day. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAsG8RXEnd4&t=417.78s)]
*  And so I think users find that to be kind of a more fulfilling or healthy way to engage [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAsG8RXEnd4&t=421.38s)]
*  with social media than ending up on a scrolling feed for hours at a time. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAsG8RXEnd4&t=426.58s)]
