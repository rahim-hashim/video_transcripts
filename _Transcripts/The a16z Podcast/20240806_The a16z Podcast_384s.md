# Krea: Building the UI for AI Art
**The a16z Podcast:** [August 06, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=35IRPHXb7EQ)
*  What are the interactions like? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=35IRPHXb7EQ&t=0.0s)]
*  What are the knobs that we need to expose [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=35IRPHXb7EQ&t=1.54s)]
*  for people to be able to use this technology creatively? [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=35IRPHXb7EQ&t=3.8000000000000003s)]
*  How can we build these interfaces? [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=35IRPHXb7EQ&t=7.2s)]
*  How do you talk with an AI to create an image? [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=35IRPHXb7EQ&t=8.66s)]
*  Hello, my name is Victor and I'm co-founder and CEO at CREA. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=35IRPHXb7EQ&t=12.1s)]
*  Hi, my name is Diego. I'm co-founder and CTO at CREA. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=35IRPHXb7EQ&t=14.1s)]
*  We create tools for people to use these technologies. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=35IRPHXb7EQ&t=17.3s)]
*  Hello, my name is Victor and I'm co-founder and CEO at CREA. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=35IRPHXb7EQ&t=20.8s)]
*  Hi, my name is Diego. I'm co-founder and CTO at CREA. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=35IRPHXb7EQ&t=25.1s)]
*  We create tools for creative people that want to use AI [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=35IRPHXb7EQ&t=28.200000000000003s)]
*  to generate from images to videos [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=35IRPHXb7EQ&t=32.6s)]
*  and also some other things like enhancing images or videos, for example. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=35IRPHXb7EQ&t=35.300000000000004s)]
*  I realized that artists are not the best at coding, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=35IRPHXb7EQ&t=39.7s)]
*  but they are the ones who have the best ideas. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=35IRPHXb7EQ&t=42.7s)]
*  And it was a shame that they didn't have access to this technology [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=35IRPHXb7EQ&t=44.7s)]
*  to be able to do cool stuff. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=35IRPHXb7EQ&t=47.7s)]
*  And at that moment, I kind of switched from doing a lot of deep research [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=35IRPHXb7EQ&t=49.7s)]
*  and really coding myself all of these things [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=35IRPHXb7EQ&t=53.900000000000006s)]
*  to try to explore more what are the interactions like? [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=35IRPHXb7EQ&t=57.3s)]
*  What are the knobs that we need to expose [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=35IRPHXb7EQ&t=60.5s)]
*  for people to be able to use this technology creatively? [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=35IRPHXb7EQ&t=62.8s)]
*  How can we build these interfaces? [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=35IRPHXb7EQ&t=66.2s)]
*  How do you talk with an AI to create an image? [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=35IRPHXb7EQ&t=67.7s)]
*  What you can do with this tool is to generate images in real time [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=35IRPHXb7EQ&t=71.1s)]
*  through two things. First of all, an input image [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=35IRPHXb7EQ&t=76.0s)]
*  and then also a prompt. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=35IRPHXb7EQ&t=78.5s)]
*  In this case, a prompt is an orange koi fish [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=35IRPHXb7EQ&t=80.0s)]
*  with organic shapes made out of glitter. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=35IRPHXb7EQ&t=82.8s)]
*  With the screen on the left side, I can control the composition. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=35IRPHXb7EQ&t=85.8s)]
*  So essentially, I can control where the fish is [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=35IRPHXb7EQ&t=89.2s)]
*  and how the fish looks. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=35IRPHXb7EQ&t=92.8s)]
*  In this case, I have the orange color [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=35IRPHXb7EQ&t=94.8s)]
*  and I can also make it have a tail. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=35IRPHXb7EQ&t=97.0s)]
*  So, you know, like with very simple shapes, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=35IRPHXb7EQ&t=99.39999999999999s)]
*  I can have like a lot of control of the composition of the image. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=35IRPHXb7EQ&t=101.2s)]
*  I'm going to draw two white circles in here [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=35IRPHXb7EQ&t=106.3s)]
*  and I'm going to say koi fish with white eyes. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=35IRPHXb7EQ&t=112.1s)]
*  And as you can see, it's kind of getting the composition [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=35IRPHXb7EQ&t=119.39999999999999s)]
*  from the original, from the shapes. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=35IRPHXb7EQ&t=125.39999999999999s)]
*  And with this slider, I can also let the AI know [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=35IRPHXb7EQ&t=128.4s)]
*  how creative it can be. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=35IRPHXb7EQ&t=131.7s)]
*  If I turn it all up, it's going to be super creative [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=35IRPHXb7EQ&t=134.2s)]
*  and it's going to kind of dismiss, for example, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=35IRPHXb7EQ&t=137.29999999999998s)]
*  the exact position where I want the eyes to be. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=35IRPHXb7EQ&t=140.79999999999998s)]
*  In this case, it's still got it. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=35IRPHXb7EQ&t=144.2s)]
*  But if you turn it down, it takes way more into account [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=35IRPHXb7EQ&t=146.2s)]
*  this original drawing. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=35IRPHXb7EQ&t=150.5s)]
*  AI in the end is like a new creative medium. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=35IRPHXb7EQ&t=153.2s)]
*  A lot of people are using it for the first time [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=35IRPHXb7EQ&t=155.5s)]
*  and we want them to have like an experience [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=35IRPHXb7EQ&t=157.5s)]
*  where the AI does what you expect to do [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=35IRPHXb7EQ&t=160.2s)]
*  and you don't need to learn about like crazy prompt engineering [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=35IRPHXb7EQ&t=163.0s)]
*  and like all these tweaks that people have to do [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=35IRPHXb7EQ&t=166.0s)]
*  in order to get good results out of it. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=35IRPHXb7EQ&t=168.9s)]
*  And on the other side is controllability [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=35IRPHXb7EQ&t=171.70000000000002s)]
*  because we are dealing with creatives. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=35IRPHXb7EQ&t=173.20000000000002s)]
*  We are dealing with folks who are not just okay [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=35IRPHXb7EQ&t=174.8s)]
*  with having a beautiful image. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=35IRPHXb7EQ&t=178.20000000000002s)]
*  They want that beautiful image. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=35IRPHXb7EQ&t=179.8s)]
*  So in this case, I have an orange koi fish [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=35IRPHXb7EQ&t=181.6s)]
*  with organic shapes made out of glitter. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=35IRPHXb7EQ&t=184.20000000000002s)]
*  In this case, I don't see too many organic shapes. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=35IRPHXb7EQ&t=187.0s)]
*  So for that, I generated previously another image [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=35IRPHXb7EQ&t=189.20000000000002s)]
*  that it has like all these shapes that I was expecting [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=35IRPHXb7EQ&t=195.5s)]
*  for the fish to have. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=35IRPHXb7EQ&t=198.39999999999998s)]
*  So through this image, I can just like add it in here [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=35IRPHXb7EQ&t=200.5s)]
*  and I can put the strength up [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=35IRPHXb7EQ&t=203.6s)]
*  so you can see how the fish is getting a lot of that image. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=35IRPHXb7EQ&t=206.5s)]
*  And if I turn it all the way up, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=35IRPHXb7EQ&t=210.79999999999998s)]
*  it even like forgets that I wanted a fish [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=35IRPHXb7EQ&t=212.79999999999998s)]
*  and it kind of turns the fish into a flower. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=35IRPHXb7EQ&t=215.5s)]
*  But if I find the right spot, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=35IRPHXb7EQ&t=218.89999999999998s)]
*  I can get a lot of these super interesting shapes [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=35IRPHXb7EQ&t=221.39999999999998s)]
*  that I was having in mind beforehand. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=35IRPHXb7EQ&t=224.1s)]
*  Then we have like the first kind of virality moment [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=35IRPHXb7EQ&t=227.7s)]
*  that we were seeing like all of these images on Twitter [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=35IRPHXb7EQ&t=231.1s)]
*  with the spirals, right? [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=35IRPHXb7EQ&t=233.7s)]
*  And we were like, what's going on with these spirals? [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=35IRPHXb7EQ&t=235.1s)]
*  Like we can do it. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=35IRPHXb7EQ&t=237.79999999999998s)]
*  Like this is like one day of work. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=35IRPHXb7EQ&t=238.7s)]
*  I remember at that point, Diego was like, [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=35IRPHXb7EQ&t=240.9s)]
*  we should do something with this. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=35IRPHXb7EQ&t=242.79999999999998s)]
*  We should do something with this. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=35IRPHXb7EQ&t=243.9s)]
*  And we did it like in one or two days. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=35IRPHXb7EQ&t=245.1s)]
*  We just built an interface and we shipped it on Twitter [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=35IRPHXb7EQ&t=246.9s)]
*  and it got viral. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=35IRPHXb7EQ&t=249.9s)]
*  It was actually hard in the sense of as a founder, [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=35IRPHXb7EQ&t=251.5s)]
*  you're like a put multi amounts of years into like many things. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=35IRPHXb7EQ&t=255.1s)]
*  And then the thing that we literally are like, [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=35IRPHXb7EQ&t=260.4s)]
*  it's not important. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=35IRPHXb7EQ&t=262.9s)]
*  Gives you all the success. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=35IRPHXb7EQ&t=264.6s)]
*  There's a lot of value on simplifying super niche [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=35IRPHXb7EQ&t=266.0s)]
*  and simple use cases. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=35IRPHXb7EQ&t=270.5s)]
*  And I think that at that moment, [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=35IRPHXb7EQ&t=272.4s)]
*  we already started to position Crea in a way that [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=35IRPHXb7EQ&t=273.5s)]
*  we are able to ship simple products [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=35IRPHXb7EQ&t=276.7s)]
*  with a great interface extremely fast [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=35IRPHXb7EQ&t=279.9s)]
*  for all the new technologies that are available for us to use. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=35IRPHXb7EQ&t=282.40000000000003s)]
*  You need to build an MVP or you need to do something [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=35IRPHXb7EQ&t=286.40000000000003s)]
*  like even if it's a demo to validate this thing [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=35IRPHXb7EQ&t=290.0s)]
*  with the community and that's where you find truth. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=35IRPHXb7EQ&t=293.0s)]
*  What we're doing is building community [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=35IRPHXb7EQ&t=296.1s)]
*  and bringing to the community what they want now. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=35IRPHXb7EQ&t=298.5s)]
*  And like just like focusing on what can we do now [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=35IRPHXb7EQ&t=301.3s)]
*  with the technology that is out there. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=35IRPHXb7EQ&t=304.40000000000003s)]
*  So the way how we work is almost like a video game company [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=35IRPHXb7EQ&t=306.0s)]
*  where instead of video games, [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=35IRPHXb7EQ&t=308.40000000000003s)]
*  we are building tools and every six months or so [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=35IRPHXb7EQ&t=310.0s)]
*  there's a new tool because the space just happened to evolve [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=35IRPHXb7EQ&t=313.3s)]
*  in a way that every six months there's a new technology [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=35IRPHXb7EQ&t=317.0s)]
*  that or a new add-on to a certain existing technology [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=35IRPHXb7EQ&t=319.7s)]
*  that you can use in order to make a new tool. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=35IRPHXb7EQ&t=323.8s)]
*  I'm really optimistic. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=35IRPHXb7EQ&t=326.5s)]
*  What I think is happening is that we're just giving [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=35IRPHXb7EQ&t=329.0s)]
*  so much power to creatives [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=35IRPHXb7EQ&t=333.2s)]
*  that things that were like a job in a way [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=35IRPHXb7EQ&t=337.7s)]
*  like now you don't even think about them [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=35IRPHXb7EQ&t=342.8s)]
*  that they're not even the important thing anymore. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=35IRPHXb7EQ&t=344.8s)]
*  Like you will save so much time like of your life [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=35IRPHXb7EQ&t=346.5s)]
*  because of not having to do that. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=35IRPHXb7EQ&t=351.5s)]
*  You can focus on having even better and crazier ideas. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=35IRPHXb7EQ&t=352.8s)]
*  So I'm really, really, really excited to see [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=35IRPHXb7EQ&t=357.0s)]
*  what the creatives are going to be able to do. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=35IRPHXb7EQ&t=359.7s)]
*  And I just want for Korea to be at least a part of it. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=35IRPHXb7EQ&t=363.7s)]
*  If wishing is free, then ideally like a combination [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=35IRPHXb7EQ&t=369.2s)]
*  of Adobe Autodesk and Apple, like the three of them together [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=35IRPHXb7EQ&t=371.59999999999997s)]
*  with a little bit of Pixar sprinkled on. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=35IRPHXb7EQ&t=374.9s)]
