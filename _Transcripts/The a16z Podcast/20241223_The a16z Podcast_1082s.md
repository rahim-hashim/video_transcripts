# AI-Powered Acquisitions: A New Playbook
**The a16z Podcast:** [December 23, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8prkuwQVQU)
*  Traditionally, private equity isn't focused on fundamentally shifting the way that the business [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8prkuwQVQU&t=0.0s)]
*  works. What I'm talking about is actually building like a technology business and like a technology [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8prkuwQVQU&t=4.24s)]
*  core. My big idea is romanticizing inorganic growth. And really what that means is I see like [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8prkuwQVQU&t=8.72s)]
*  the next evolution of private equity being possible where small businesses can leverage [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8prkuwQVQU&t=17.6s)]
*  technology to basically like automate parts of their services organization and then go and use [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8prkuwQVQU&t=23.44s)]
*  a better business model to acquire other small businesses. Obviously, LLMs or AI is kind of the [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8prkuwQVQU&t=27.84s)]
*  talk of the town penetrating every industry. But tell me what you're seeing on the ground in terms [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8prkuwQVQU&t=32.8s)]
*  of how these LLMs are reshaping industries. Yeah, you know, it's just amazing to see how fast [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8prkuwQVQU&t=37.28s)]
*  adoption has been across whether it's horizontal applications or vertical applications. And just [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8prkuwQVQU&t=42.08s)]
*  for this conversation, maybe we'll focus on the vertical. Yeah, obviously, recently announced our [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8prkuwQVQU&t=46.879999999999995s)]
*  investment at 11x, which is automating like the sales function. And I don't think I've ever really [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8prkuwQVQU&t=50.96s)]
*  seen demand like what we're seeing for basically automating the role of an SDR. And so you're kind [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8prkuwQVQU&t=55.6s)]
*  of already seeing it within the sales organization. If you think even on a more vertical specific [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8prkuwQVQU&t=60.4s)]
*  basis, I see it in like freight with companies like happy robot, basically automating the call [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8prkuwQVQU&t=64.64s)]
*  center operations around what a freight broker does, whether it's like calling and, you know, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8prkuwQVQU&t=69.52s)]
*  booking a load or dealing with a new carrier that a freight broker has to deal with. We see it in [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8prkuwQVQU&t=74.24000000000001s)]
*  healthcare with another one of portfolio companies, Tenor, which is automating the back office [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8prkuwQVQU&t=79.04s)]
*  processes associated with a small health care practice. And so I think we're seeing a bunch of [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8prkuwQVQU&t=82.8s)]
*  these applications pop up and frankly have growth rates unlike anything I've ever seen again. Yeah, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8prkuwQVQU&t=86.64s)]
*  and I love those examples because you're touching so many different industries. And maybe if we zoom [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8prkuwQVQU&t=91.44s)]
*  out just a little bit and think about maybe like a framework for disruption, how do you think about [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8prkuwQVQU&t=95.2s)]
*  where maybe this could be applied? The way to kind of just zoom out and think about this opportunity [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8prkuwQVQU&t=99.75999999999999s)]
*  is like where are there a bunch of humans that are basically dealing with whether it's voice or paper [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8prkuwQVQU&t=103.84s)]
*  processes where there's a bunch of unstructured data that they need to basically synthesize [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8prkuwQVQU&t=109.44s)]
*  and then make sense of and then generate some sort of output. Like obviously that's what LLMs are [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8prkuwQVQU&t=114.16s)]
*  super good at. And so like the very common way of thinking about that might be like, hey, there's a [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8prkuwQVQU&t=118.0s)]
*  call center somewhere, right? That's like the healthcare or the insurance example or the sales [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8prkuwQVQU&t=121.44s)]
*  example. Or maybe you have some sort of, you know, we call it the messy inbox problem here where [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8prkuwQVQU&t=125.6s)]
*  there's a bunch of different pieces of paper that are coming in and you need to synthesize them and [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8prkuwQVQU&t=130.32s)]
*  put them into some database. But oftentimes that's like an internal team. But then also you could look [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8prkuwQVQU&t=133.52s)]
*  for wherever there might be BPO spend, like business process outsourcing spend, where maybe [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8prkuwQVQU&t=139.04s)]
*  a consulting firm is doing this for you. So those are kind of the hot buttons, a bit's not Adam's [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8prkuwQVQU&t=144.0s)]
*  industry. Like you're dealing with paper, not physical world things and something that is [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8prkuwQVQU&t=148.39999999999998s)]
*  conducive to be automated by LLMs. I have to admit when I was reading your big idea, I thought, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8prkuwQVQU&t=153.51999999999998s)]
*  isn't this just kind of like private equity? So convince me otherwise, how is this different [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8prkuwQVQU&t=158.64s)]
*  from traditional private equity? First, like what is private equity? Like I think that's important [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8prkuwQVQU&t=162.56s)]
*  to like just talk about. To oversimplify, like private equity is a buyer purchases a company [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8prkuwQVQU&t=166.56s)]
*  using some combination of equity and debt, traditionally like a good deal of debt. And [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8prkuwQVQU&t=172.08s)]
*  then basically tries to improve earnings in the relatively short term, right? Normally private [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8prkuwQVQU&t=177.6s)]
*  equity has like a three to five year hold period and then sell it to the next buyer. Private equity [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8prkuwQVQU&t=182.16s)]
*  firms typically are optimizing for IRR, internal return. And they're less focused on like ultimately [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8prkuwQVQU&t=187.44s)]
*  like a multiple on money, basically saying like they're not focused on the biggest possible [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8prkuwQVQU&t=194.16s)]
*  version of the company that they can build. Rather they're focused on making incremental [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8prkuwQVQU&t=199.04s)]
*  improvements in this time period. Cause that's like how they think about liquidity and looks how [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8prkuwQVQU&t=202.64s)]
*  the model works. The problem with that is it creates like a little bit of a perverse incentive [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8prkuwQVQU&t=206.96s)]
*  structure where typically they're focused on like one of two ways of making money. First is like the [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8prkuwQVQU&t=210.48s)]
*  most obvious, like when people hear like private equity, it's like, oh no, people are going to get [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8prkuwQVQU&t=215.44s)]
*  fired. But obviously what they're trying to say is, Hey, this hasn't been run in the most lean and [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8prkuwQVQU&t=218.64s)]
*  efficient way. Maybe I possibly could have. And so, you know, Hey, the accounting department doesn't [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8prkuwQVQU&t=223.28s)]
*  need to be this big, or maybe we can consolidate these two different teams or whatever it might be. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8prkuwQVQU&t=227.44s)]
*  That's the first bucket. The second bucket normally is saying, Hey, we're going to acquire other small [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8prkuwQVQU&t=231.92000000000002s)]
*  businesses or large businesses. Doesn't matter. We're going to acquire other companies. We're [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8prkuwQVQU&t=237.12s)]
*  going to use more equity and debt. And we're going to basically buy the next incremental company for [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8prkuwQVQU&t=240.4s)]
*  a lower multiple, roll it into our company and have multiple expansion. So these are the two very [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8prkuwQVQU&t=245.68s)]
*  common ways that private equity firms make money. So I think what's interesting about this model is [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8prkuwQVQU&t=250.88s)]
*  that it's actually addressing like a third leg of the stool, in my opinion, where, you know, [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8prkuwQVQU&t=255.28s)]
*  traditionally private equity isn't focused on like fundamentally shifting the way that the business [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8prkuwQVQU&t=259.44s)]
*  works. What I'm talking about is actually building like a technology business and like a technology [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8prkuwQVQU&t=264.0s)]
*  core to a traditional services company. Right? So in the past, like a private equity firm would say, [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8prkuwQVQU&t=268.4s)]
*  Hey, like we don't need that many people in accounting. I'm talking about automating like a [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8prkuwQVQU&t=273.44s)]
*  large swath of the company. And to do so, you need to have a very different view on returns. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8prkuwQVQU&t=277.04s)]
*  And you need to have a very different view on short-term earnings. Because what will end up [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8prkuwQVQU&t=282.48s)]
*  happening is like, turns out engineers pretty expensive, right? And it requires like significant [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8prkuwQVQU&t=286.88s)]
*  investment to get this business to, you know, a more automated state. And so you have to not think [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8prkuwQVQU&t=292.32000000000005s)]
*  about like IRR over the next two or three years. And instead you need to be thinking about like, [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8prkuwQVQU&t=298.0s)]
*  what's the largest long-term valuable business that I can build? And how do I invest in that [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8prkuwQVQU&t=301.76s)]
*  future? So that's like the very different, you know, way of building businesses. There's a couple [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8prkuwQVQU&t=307.44s)]
*  examples on the public markets that are a little bit more hold co traditional software versions of [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8prkuwQVQU&t=311.59999999999997s)]
*  this, but one is a very well known company called Danahur. There's another one called Tyler [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8prkuwQVQU&t=316.8s)]
*  technologies based out of Texas. These are like probably the best examples of these businesses [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8prkuwQVQU&t=322.08s)]
*  historically. But again, they're not AI native, right? And they're basically focused on the first [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8prkuwQVQU&t=327.04s)]
*  two buckets of this, which is like financial engineering and or like operational efficiency, [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8prkuwQVQU&t=332.56s)]
*  not building AI to their businesses. No, that's super interesting. And I think just for the [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8prkuwQVQU&t=338.40000000000003s)]
*  listeners, let's try to be really concrete here and paint a picture of what this could look like, [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8prkuwQVQU&t=343.28000000000003s)]
*  this idea or opportunity of quote, AI powered vertical specific service startups. Yeah. So [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8prkuwQVQU&t=347.20000000000005s)]
*  tell me, I was going to say it's a lot of S's, but what would that look like? Like, [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8prkuwQVQU&t=352.72s)]
*  let's try to really paint a picture here. Okay. So let's imagine that, you know, [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8prkuwQVQU&t=356.8s)]
*  Steph has an insurance agency in Columbia, Missouri. Okay. So you let's call it's a small [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8prkuwQVQU&t=360.08s)]
*  insurance agency. You do three or $4 million in gross written premium. That generally will mean [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8prkuwQVQU&t=365.2s)]
*  you do a few hundred thousand call a half a million dollars in revenue, that revenue. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8prkuwQVQU&t=370.48s)]
*  Let's say you have single digit margins on that revenue. So like you're living a nice life in [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8prkuwQVQU&t=374.64s)]
*  Columbia, Missouri, but like, this is a small business. There are thousands, tens of thousands [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8prkuwQVQU&t=378.16s)]
*  of these businesses across America. You're selling, you know, imagine home auto life insurance and [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8prkuwQVQU&t=382.56s)]
*  a little bit commercial insurance at your Steph's insurance agency. Maybe you have one or two or [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8prkuwQVQU&t=387.04s)]
*  three people in the back office. You know, maybe there's a CSM that's dealing with like net new [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8prkuwQVQU&t=392.24s)]
*  business that you're writing. There's someone in the back office that's dealing with all the paperwork, [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8prkuwQVQU&t=396.48s)]
*  right? Cause when you write an insurance policy, it's like, Hey, I got to get a bunch of information [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8prkuwQVQU&t=400.32s)]
*  from the customer. I got to go get the quote from my legacy system. And I got to write all this stuff [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8prkuwQVQU&t=403.36s)]
*  down and I got to deal with all these back office processes. It's painful. Basically, [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8prkuwQVQU&t=408.48s)]
*  that's the reason your margin is so low. And you've tried to fix this, right? You've tried [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8prkuwQVQU&t=412.64000000000004s)]
*  to buy software, but the only software in this industry is really legacy, right? Like there's [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8prkuwQVQU&t=417.68s)]
*  these two big businesses in insurance. You don't really have a great system here. I come to you [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8prkuwQVQU&t=422.24s)]
*  and I say, Hey Steph, like, wouldn't it be great if I could give you like basically automation [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8prkuwQVQU&t=427.20000000000005s)]
*  that could take all of that paperwork that you've been paying, you know, five, 10, 15 plus percent [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8prkuwQVQU&t=431.92s)]
*  of your net margin for, right? And we can automate it. And what does that require? Right? It will [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8prkuwQVQU&t=438.32s)]
*  require you going and getting deeply integrated from the technology side, deeply integrated into [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8prkuwQVQU&t=443.28s)]
*  the core systems of record, leveraging AI agents to basically have some of those conversations with [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8prkuwQVQU&t=447.12s)]
*  the customer, whether it's on new business, on renewal or on client servicing, and then actually [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8prkuwQVQU&t=452.64s)]
*  resolving these claims in real time or like resolving these service issues in real time. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8prkuwQVQU&t=458.48s)]
*  Now Steph's insurance agency doesn't need four people. It might need two people. It might need [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8prkuwQVQU&t=462.56s)]
*  one person. And you go from having 5% net margins to 30% net margins. And, you know, [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8prkuwQVQU&t=466.4s)]
*  you go and you put a pool in or whatever it might be. Or frankly, what I think is really exciting [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8prkuwQVQU&t=472.32s)]
*  is you use that extra cash and you buy John's insurance agency down the street. And now you [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8prkuwQVQU&t=478.08s)]
*  see what the opportunity is to run this playbook. Yeah, because basically what you're saying is that [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8prkuwQVQU&t=482.4s)]
*  what you put into the technology can be replicated for other business here. Tell me a little bit more [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8prkuwQVQU&t=486.96s)]
*  about why you need to buy the company though. Could I not create a tool that just sells into [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8prkuwQVQU&t=494.48s)]
*  John's insurance company, Steph's insurance company? You actually made a really good point at the end [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8prkuwQVQU&t=499.12s)]
*  of what you just said, which is like, hey, this can be applied to the next business. And if you [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8prkuwQVQU&t=503.04s)]
*  build this software, I think in the right way, in the right industry vertical, once you've built [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8prkuwQVQU&t=507.20000000000005s)]
*  those core integrations in the example that we were just doing, it's into the applied epic system [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8prkuwQVQU&t=512.08s)]
*  or whatever core system of records exists across the small business you're thinking about. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8prkuwQVQU&t=516.96s)]
*  Yeah. Those systems are in many cases in these legacy industry are pretty ubiquitous. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8prkuwQVQU&t=521.36s)]
*  And so you can kind of repurpose this technology across each one of these small businesses. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8prkuwQVQU&t=526.8000000000001s)]
*  I'm not saying it's going to be simple or easy. It's all require implementation, [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8prkuwQVQU&t=530.88s)]
*  but that's the opportunity here is to stay vertical specific and build this deep [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8prkuwQVQU&t=533.6s)]
*  kind of understanding of the systems. But it's a great question on why not just sell software [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8prkuwQVQU&t=537.92s)]
*  to these companies? They just aren't accustomed to running their companies this way. I've gone [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8prkuwQVQU&t=544.5600000000001s)]
*  and I've tried to sell software to a mom and pop insurance agency in Columbia, Missouri. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8prkuwQVQU&t=548.4s)]
*  Trying to drive adoption is super tricky. And so in buying the business, instead of trying to do [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8prkuwQVQU&t=553.28s)]
*  business development exercises and convince someone that, hey, the pot of gold at the end [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8prkuwQVQU&t=559.1999999999999s)]
*  of the rainbow is worth it for you. Instead, we can now say, actually, hey, this is what we're [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8prkuwQVQU&t=564.88s)]
*  going to run the business. Operationally, this is our new cadence and our new workflow. And here's [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8prkuwQVQU&t=570.16s)]
*  how we're going to get to the next stage. Got it. So you're saying basically in [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8prkuwQVQU&t=574.8s)]
*  purchasing the business, it gives you the leeway to actually shift things fundamentally, [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8prkuwQVQU&t=578.0s)]
*  which is really what this is articulating. Maybe another question is just, you seem to think this [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8prkuwQVQU&t=582.0s)]
*  is a really big opportunity. PE itself is a huge industry. So why do you think this is actually [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8prkuwQVQU&t=587.12s)]
*  maybe a bigger opportunity than traditional private equity? So I think that this all comes [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8prkuwQVQU&t=592.08s)]
*  down to capital efficiency. And so for example, buying one of these small companies that I just [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8prkuwQVQU&t=596.24s)]
*  described isn't actually that expensive of an endeavor. And if you can do what I'm talking [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8prkuwQVQU&t=601.36s)]
*  about, you impact earnings. And all of a sudden, the first one, two, or three, maybe you don't [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8prkuwQVQU&t=606.16s)]
*  immediately pay back using cash. But after the first few of these transactions, you start to [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8prkuwQVQU&t=610.24s)]
*  throw off cash. And that cash can then be used to acquire more and more of these small businesses. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8prkuwQVQU&t=616.0s)]
*  And so there becomes this beautiful flywheel effect to the acquisitions that you can make. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8prkuwQVQU&t=621.36s)]
*  And then that new business is the equal acquire. And so unlike traditional private equity, where [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8prkuwQVQU&t=626.56s)]
*  you're constantly raising debt, maybe you need more equity. And again, it's much more financial [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8prkuwQVQU&t=630.88s)]
*  engineering. Instead, you can actually just compound over a long period of time and build [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8prkuwQVQU&t=635.6s)]
*  value that way. Yeah. And I guess what you're getting at is the margin change is so significant [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8prkuwQVQU&t=640.24s)]
*  where you can do that. But instead, if you're doing some of the financial engineering that traditional [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8prkuwQVQU&t=645.12s)]
*  PE relies on, you're often not changing the margins from 5% to 30% or to 50% even in some cases. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8prkuwQVQU&t=648.72s)]
*  Yeah. And I think there's a nuance point here where, again, if you do this right in the right [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8prkuwQVQU&t=656.72s)]
*  vertical, and the businesses that you end up acquiring are worth more to you than to any other [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8prkuwQVQU&t=661.52s)]
*  buyer, that's when you can start to do really interesting things. So let's say I'm doing [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8prkuwQVQU&t=666.8s)]
*  something and Mark is doing something in the same space for those insurance businesses. We're both [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8prkuwQVQU&t=671.68s)]
*  rolling, running the same playbook. He's a private equity firm. I'm running a technology business. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8prkuwQVQU&t=676.56s)]
*  And I go to you and I say, hey, I have this wonderful technology platform. Wouldn't you like [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8prkuwQVQU&t=681.1999999999999s)]
*  to come and grow with me? And I can take your earnings from 5% to 20% versus Mark says, hey, [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8prkuwQVQU&t=684.88s)]
*  I'll just pay you a bunch of money and you're going to stay at 5% and maybe I'm going to fire [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8prkuwQVQU&t=690.8s)]
*  Susan who runs your accounting. Right? Whose value prop sounds better. And so in this way, [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8prkuwQVQU&t=695.36s)]
*  you can one, your business is actually worth more to me. Right? Because I can impact earnings in the [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8prkuwQVQU&t=700.4s)]
*  short term based on my technology. And two, you want to work with me because you see, hey, [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8prkuwQVQU&t=705.68s)]
*  I'm not going to have to go in and fundamentally do a bunch of these things that are really cut [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8prkuwQVQU&t=710.48s)]
*  throat. And it's a growth story. And speaking of that growth story, it sounds like a lot of the [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8prkuwQVQU&t=714.3199999999999s)]
*  growth is inorganic in this case, at least that's what this story is about. So tell me more about [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8prkuwQVQU&t=717.84s)]
*  that. Why the inorganic growth strategy versus maybe a more organic approach. Yeah. So it's a [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8prkuwQVQU&t=722.32s)]
*  great question. So I think that the way to think about these kind of more traditional services [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8prkuwQVQU&t=728.08s)]
*  businesses, oftentimes they're local enterprises. Right? So again, in Columbia, Missouri, you have [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8prkuwQVQU&t=733.12s)]
*  a reputation as being a trusted source of insurance services. And so people want to come and work with [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8prkuwQVQU&t=738.48s)]
*  staff for that reason. And it's actually traditionally pretty hard. It's not just [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8prkuwQVQU&t=743.92s)]
*  insurance, but like, think about real estate law, they're traditionally local. And so it's pretty [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8prkuwQVQU&t=747.28s)]
*  hard to go, go add new customers and grow organically. If you're doing that, like it's, [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8prkuwQVQU&t=753.04s)]
*  it's pretty special. In my opinion, the best version of this inorganic, you know, growth strategy, [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8prkuwQVQU&t=757.52s)]
*  it's like you're acquiring a very sticky, very local, you know, geo specific customer base, [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8prkuwQVQU&t=761.68s)]
*  and then you're improving the business that's serving them and freeing up that person who [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8prkuwQVQU&t=767.36s)]
*  already has like all of these wonderful connections and whatever, you know, whatever [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8prkuwQVQU&t=771.04s)]
*  space they are to go do more of that. Right? So now you're not focused on like, hey, shoot, [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8prkuwQVQU&t=774.9599999999999s)]
*  I've got to deal with all of this stuff in the back office. I can go to, I can go to the, you know, [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8prkuwQVQU&t=780.16s)]
*  little league field or the wherever the heck you go to like sell insurance. And basically get to [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8prkuwQVQU&t=784.3199999999999s)]
*  know people and do business development. And so now not only are we impacting like earnings, [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8prkuwQVQU&t=789.68s)]
*  we're actually impacting the net new organic growth rate, which is pretty clever. The way [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8prkuwQVQU&t=794.16s)]
*  to think about this in my mind, or the way that I think about it is, hey, if you were running an [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8prkuwQVQU&t=798.56s)]
*  enterprise software company, right, and you were like on the pub in the public markets, and you're [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8prkuwQVQU&t=802.2399999999999s)]
*  saying like, Hey, I could have, you know, 18, 20, 24 month paybacks on like a great enterprise [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8prkuwQVQU&t=806.4799999999999s)]
*  customer logo. That's the way to think about like these small businesses, like, can you find a way [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8prkuwQVQU&t=811.1199999999999s)]
*  to have like strong paybacks on these new business acquisitions and treat them much more as just like [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8prkuwQVQU&t=816.16s)]
*  an enterprise software sales motion, rather than a traditional private equity firm acquiring some [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8prkuwQVQU&t=822.7199999999999s)]
*  small business and, and doing a bunch of, you know, financial engineering on it. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8prkuwQVQU&t=827.6s)]
*  But obviously, this is not easy. No, this is not operationally easy. So tell me more about that. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8prkuwQVQU&t=831.52s)]
*  Like as I sit here in my venture capital ivory tower, all these small businesses are simple [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8prkuwQVQU&t=835.44s)]
*  to automate. Yeah, I can't wait for my tweets at me. Well, tell me more about that. So as you [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8prkuwQVQU&t=839.9200000000001s)]
*  think through the challenges, like what is most stark? What's most clear as the thing that someone [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8prkuwQVQU&t=844.32s)]
*  pursuing this would need to solve? Yeah, I think the biggest one is just understanding that like, [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8prkuwQVQU&t=850.08s)]
*  there's going to be a bunch of human problems when it comes to this. And so you have to be like, [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8prkuwQVQU&t=853.36s)]
*  eyes wide open, you have to be a great operator, you have to deal with like scaling a human, [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8prkuwQVQU&t=856.32s)]
*  you know, human driven business. So I think that's the first one. And like all the implementation [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8prkuwQVQU&t=860.32s)]
*  problems around that. Right. So there's going to be a bunch of hairy legacy systems, you're [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8prkuwQVQU&t=864.32s)]
*  going to need to navigate like all the process mining and figuring out like, what do I need to [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8prkuwQVQU&t=869.12s)]
*  build here to actually drive incremental incremental value. So that's the second piece. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8prkuwQVQU&t=872.5600000000001s)]
*  It's like human human level issues. Once you get through those, then you can start to do the process [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8prkuwQVQU&t=877.2s)]
*  mapping, which is, which is also exciting. And then the third piece is actually like, [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8prkuwQVQU&t=881.2800000000001s)]
*  it's kind of, I've talked about this a little bit before, but a lot of these legacy services [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8prkuwQVQU&t=886.08s)]
*  businesses, while they may be bits oriented, like at some point, there's like an atom involved, [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8prkuwQVQU&t=889.6s)]
*  someone has to like, go do the business development. Like, it's not like you can [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8prkuwQVQU&t=895.36s)]
*  just fully automate these companies. But it could be even more complicated. Like imagine you bought, [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8prkuwQVQU&t=898.24s)]
*  like, you know, saying in the insurance example, maybe you bought a third party administrator, [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8prkuwQVQU&t=902.8000000000001s)]
*  which is someone who deals with like insurance claims. So you could deal with all the back office [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8prkuwQVQU&t=906.32s)]
*  stuff that around handling insurance claim, accepting all the documents, figuring out like, [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8prkuwQVQU&t=910.96s)]
*  you know, what, what's what, but like, AI is not going to drive the truck to the crash, [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8prkuwQVQU&t=915.2800000000001s)]
*  right? Like where is the right combination of bits and atoms, primarily, hopefully bits. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8prkuwQVQU&t=920.08s)]
*  And then trying to figure out how to navigate some of these human problems and implementation [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8prkuwQVQU&t=925.2800000000001s)]
*  problems, but it's definitely going to be hairy. And again, I think if you don't do this right, [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8prkuwQVQU&t=928.88s)]
*  and you don't figure out like a very repeatable motion for these like, again, smaller acquisitions, [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8prkuwQVQU&t=933.2s)]
*  I think it's going to be really challenging to build a big company. So that's the opportunity [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8prkuwQVQU&t=937.84s)]
*  here. What are you looking out for in particular? Is it a certain type of founder? Is it a certain [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8prkuwQVQU&t=940.64s)]
*  motion that you see someone doing that you think is really intriguing? And you think, okay, they're [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8prkuwQVQU&t=945.36s)]
*  on the right track here. What are you really looking for? First things first, I'm looking [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8prkuwQVQU&t=948.96s)]
*  for an entrepreneur or entrepreneurs that like have like bottoms up understanding rather than [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8prkuwQVQU&t=952.8s)]
*  the tops down understanding. And it's like, what does that mean? It's like, I want to find [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8prkuwQVQU&t=957.28s)]
*  entrepreneurs that have like earned secrets in these men markets, right? So somebody who has [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8prkuwQVQU&t=960.48s)]
*  maybe sold to the the staffs insurance agency or someone who has run staffs insurance agency or [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8prkuwQVQU&t=964.8s)]
*  whatever the corollary is for each one of these markets. It's very hard to come in and like know [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8prkuwQVQU&t=970.72s)]
*  the shorthand. Like you have to trust me that I'm going to come in and help you bring your business [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8prkuwQVQU&t=974.88s)]
*  and take your business to the next level if I'm going to be that acquirer. And so I think you need [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8prkuwQVQU&t=979.6800000000001s)]
*  to be like a very special person on that on that front. The second piece is like an understanding [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8prkuwQVQU&t=984.0s)]
*  of like, Hey, can this industry like be like automated? Right? Is it sufficiently bits oriented [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8prkuwQVQU&t=988.32s)]
*  to the point where like AI can actually have an impact on that? What percentage? Right, exactly. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8prkuwQVQU&t=995.28s)]
*  And like, is it the type? Is it the right kind of work that is conducive to being automated by AI? [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8prkuwQVQU&t=998.88s)]
*  That's that's another piece. And then I think the third piece is like, hopefully, there's a [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8prkuwQVQU&t=1003.28s)]
*  very large, you know, fragmented market of acquisition targets, such that like you're not, [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8prkuwQVQU&t=1008.56s)]
*  you know, basically going in and having to compete with the larger, you know, mid to large size, [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8prkuwQVQU&t=1014.4s)]
*  traditional private equity deals. And so if you can find one of these end markets where there's like, [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8prkuwQVQU&t=1019.6s)]
*  you know, a significant number of mom and pop businesses, where you can go and run that like [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8prkuwQVQU&t=1024.08s)]
*  cack minded playbook of like that acquiring and implementing and building a repeatable motion [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8prkuwQVQU&t=1028.64s)]
*  around that. I think there's just like insane room to run. And like massive businesses to be built. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8prkuwQVQU&t=1033.0400000000002s)]
*  And so those are like the combination of factors that I'm looking for. The way that I would run it [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8prkuwQVQU&t=1040.3200000000002s)]
*  is I would go find design customer, start building software and then show yourself and and frankly, [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8prkuwQVQU&t=1044.64s)]
*  everyone else that you can actually start to move the needle on earnings. And then that's when I [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8prkuwQVQU&t=1050.0800000000002s)]
*  think, you know, you've got the tiger by the tail and it's time to go and run fast. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8prkuwQVQU&t=1053.68s)]
