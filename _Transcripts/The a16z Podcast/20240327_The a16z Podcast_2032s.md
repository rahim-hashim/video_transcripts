# The Electric Grid, Explained
**The a16z Podcast:** [March 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g)
*  Brace yourselves for more blackouts. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=0.0s)]
*  There's been a major transformer leak. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=2.64s)]
*  PG&E tells us someone may have fired some shots into that transformer. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=4.96s)]
*  As Texas gets hit with record heat, the state's power grid can't keep up. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=9.84s)]
*  They are working very hard to restore full power, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=14.96s)]
*  but at this point there is no definitive timetable. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=17.52s)]
*  Some getting flashbacks to the deadly cold wave in 2021 [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=19.76s)]
*  that collapsed the electric grid and resulted in at least 246 deaths. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=24.080000000000002s)]
*  I bet you've heard that our grid needs an upgrade, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=29.76s)]
*  but I equally bet that the majority of people, myself included, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=33.04s)]
*  don't have the faintest idea of how the grid actually works. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=37.44s)]
*  We just assume when we're cold and we turn on the heat, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=42.08s)]
*  that our furnace kicks in and we just get a bill at the end of the month. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=44.96s)]
*  But as technologies like AI heat up, so too does their demand for power. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=48.64s)]
*  And this trend happens to coincide with several others, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=53.120000000000005s)]
*  including the rise of intermittent renewable sources, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=56.4s)]
*  the increasing bloat in the approval process for new grid infrastructure, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=59.36s)]
*  supply chain delays exceeding 12 months, and a whole lot more. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=63.36s)]
*  All of these things make for the fact that our grid relying on outdated technology, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=68.08s)]
*  in some cases from over a century ago, something of a national emergency. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=72.24s)]
*  And that's why we brought in A16Z American dynamism partner, Ryan McIntosh, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=78.16s)]
*  to break down how all this actually works. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=83.36s)]
*  So in this explainer, we'll dive into the grid's increasing complexity, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=86.0s)]
*  what's broken and how we got here, how technologies like solar, batteries, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=90.32s)]
*  natural gas, and nuclear might play a role in this future, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=94.4s)]
*  and why solving these problems is essential in allowing our economy, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=97.76s)]
*  but also our country's technological dominance, to thrive. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=101.68s)]

*  All right, let's kick things off. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=136.48000000000002s)]
*  Maybe an obvious question for some listeners, but why does our grid even need a refresh? [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=138.4s)]
*  And why do some people believe that this might actually be [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=143.44s)]
*  one of the most important issues for our country to address? [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=146.48s)]
*  The grid supports all really energy transfer or industrial capacity in our country. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=150.32s)]
*  There's this assumption that when you turn on the light switch, the light switch is going to turn on. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=157.2s)]
*  But behind that, there's a lot of industrial processes, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=161.2s)]
*  both in the power generation and moving that power around. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=163.52s)]
*  And for the last couple of decades, we really haven't seen a growth in energy demand. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=166.07999999999998s)]
*  So the grid has sort of not really changed that much. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=171.6s)]
*  But increasingly over the last 20 years, and especially with the increase in data center AI, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=174.48000000000002s)]
*  we're seeing the grid change a lot. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=180.16s)]
*  Increasingly, people are seeing the effects of that. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=181.84s)]
*  We have an increase in outages, a lot of this weather related. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=184.32s)]
*  The price of electricity is now a lot more volatile. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=187.92000000000002s)]
*  And I think people are becoming more aware of not only the climate-related effects of energy, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=191.36s)]
*  but how it affects their daily lives. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=196.32s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=198.08s)]
*  And you mentioned some of these new technologies. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=198.96s)]
*  We're talking electric vehicles, we're talking about AI and data centers. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=200.96s)]
*  But what is that gap really? [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=205.12s)]
*  If we look ahead, are we super far behind the energy requirement that we'll need, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=206.96s)]
*  or are we actually pretty close? [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=212.4s)]
*  All the projections seem to indicate a huge gap. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=214.16000000000003s)]
*  A lot of the current world is powered by things like fossil fuels, like your car, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=217.12s)]
*  you fill up with gasoline. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=221.76000000000002s)]
*  That's likely going to increasingly shift as more people adopt electric vehicles. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=223.28s)]
*  A lot of the things in our home, you look at thermostats heating with some of these heat pumps. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=227.28s)]
*  You look at new induction stoves. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=233.12s)]
*  Every single device now has a battery connected to the internet. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=235.6s)]
*  So we were seeing huge demand there. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=239.52s)]
*  And then also on the industrial side, we're seeing a lot of processes that were previously [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=241.2s)]
*  using fossil fuels as inputs, now increasingly using electricity. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=245.6s)]
*  Another good example is data centers, as you noted. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=250.24s)]
*  These regions where a lot of these data centers are located are expecting huge growth and energy [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=253.04s)]
*  demand to the point now that some large hyperscalers are looking at things like nuclear [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=256.64s)]
*  to support and make sure that the data centers stay online in periods of lower reliability [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=261.68s)]
*  or price volatility. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=267.52s)]
*  This is a huge concern a lot of people are paying attention to. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=268.88s)]
*  To your point earlier, we just assume when we flick the light switch on, [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=271.84s)]
*  that the lights turn on and that we get this electricity, not just sometimes, but all the time. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=275.59999999999997s)]
*  And so let's just quickly discuss how the grid actually works. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=280.32s)]
*  What is it composed of? [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=284.8s)]
*  And how do each of those components contribute to electricity actually being generated, [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=286.40000000000003s)]
*  but then also transmitted and distributed to all of our homes? [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=291.36s)]
*  Sure. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=295.6s)]
*  So I think the most important idea is that the electric grid is not some sort of monolithic [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=296.16s)]
*  entity that is the same across the United States. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=301.36s)]
*  It's actually made up of three major interconnections. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=304.72s)]
*  The grid is made up of AC or alternating current. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=308.08000000000004s)]
*  But between these interconnections, there are a different phase, [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=310.48s)]
*  which means that you can't directly connect these interconnections. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=313.12s)]
*  And they're split up basically as East, Texas, and West. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=316.4s)]
*  And a lot of that would just for historic reasons. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=320.08s)]
*  Also, as I said, technical reasons with the phase, but also regulatory reasons. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=322.56s)]
*  Texas is for many reasons wants to have independent grid, [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=326.64s)]
*  whereas the West and the East Coast are completely fine having sort of these interstate networks. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=329.68s)]
*  And then beneath these interconnections are things called RTOs and ISOs. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=334.88s)]
*  The difference is really mainly that RTOs oversee multiple states. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=339.04s)]
*  So these are regional transmission entities, [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=343.36s)]
*  whereas ISOs are really just focused on a state level, [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=346.16s)]
*  which allows that more direct regulatory oversight and funding. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=348.8s)]
*  Quick note, ISO stands for independent system operators, [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=353.52000000000004s)]
*  while RTOs are regional transmission organizations. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=357.28000000000003s)]
*  To put it simply, these entities help ensure the grid is reliable. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=360.72s)]
*  And practically, that means balancing the grid, [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=365.12s)]
*  enabling efficient markets, coordinating infrastructure, and more. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=367.92s)]
*  A good example is California. California's CalISO is just specifically looking at California, [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=372.08000000000004s)]
*  whereas some other RTOs are looking at the entire Northwest region. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=378.08000000000004s)]
*  These balancing authorities, as they're called, essentially operate these wholesale markets. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=381.52000000000004s)]
*  They also operate a lot of the feasibility studies and planning [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=386.16s)]
*  and oversight of the entities involved in those local grids. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=389.28000000000003s)]
*  Got it. And so when we think about it, there's the interconnections, [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=393.44s)]
*  there's different entities that actually generate the power as well. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=396.4s)]
*  And then there's market and there's regulation. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=400.0s)]
*  Maybe you could speak to some of those other buckets and how they fit into the broader mix. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=401.76s)]
*  There's deregulated markets and there's regulated markets. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=405.84s)]
*  So in regulated utilities, essentially, it's top down controlled by the government. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=409.52s)]
*  Tennessee Valley Authority is a really famous example. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=413.59999999999997s)]
*  There's a lot of these sort of regulated entities in the Southern United States, [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=416.15999999999997s)]
*  like Southern Power Company, where like a lot of these nuclear facilities were built. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=419.76s)]
*  And a lot of this in sort of the Western United States, Spare, California. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=422.8s)]
*  In this case, the power generations, like the actual power plant, [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=426.96000000000004s)]
*  the transmission and distribution lines, and actually interfacing with the end [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=430.16s)]
*  sort of rate payer customer. All of that is controlled by the government with sort of [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=434.08s)]
*  guaranteed profit margins and things like that. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=438.40000000000003s)]
*  The other type are deregulated markets, which started really becoming a thing over the last [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=441.36s)]
*  20 or so years, largely pushed forward originally by Enron and pushing these policies of [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=445.92s)]
*  these free markets where energy was going to be traded in these wholesale markets. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=451.68s)]
*  In these areas, the dominant markets would be California, Texas, the East Coast. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=456.08s)]
*  There's power generators, people who own the plants. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=461.68s)]
*  And then oftentimes, different companies will own the power lines and be in charge of maintenance [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=464.64s)]
*  and operating the congestion and making sure that the power moves and is delivered. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=469.36s)]
*  And then there's separate companies that actually interface with the customers. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=474.08s)]
*  These interfacing providing like a retail experience and rate payer. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=477.68s)]
*  So oftentimes, these are completely separate different companies. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=481.68s)]
*  Sometimes they're the same. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=484.15999999999997s)]
*  Sometimes these look like a little bit of a hybrid structure. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=485.59999999999997s)]
*  It all gets very confusing, but it's part of the complexity of the grid that there's [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=488.0s)]
*  very, very different structures depending on where you are. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=491.68s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, it certainly sounds complex. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=494.08s)]
*  And I think there's probably a bunch of misconceptions. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=496.47999999999996s)]
*  I mean, even just the idea that the grid is a monolith is clearly not true. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=499.28s)]
*  Does anything else jump out there in terms of this idea of public misconception around [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=503.6s)]
*  the grid and how it works and ultimately who runs it, who's getting paid, [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=508.64000000000004s)]
*  and how people ultimately get their electricity? [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=512.32s)]
*  Yeah, I think the high to high level, there's like a technical idea of people just, [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=515.28s)]
*  people think that you plug something into the grid and it's magic. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=521.44s)]
*  But electricity is not like a commodity. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=524.5600000000001s)]
*  It's certainly not magic. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=526.88s)]
*  Electricity is generated basically at the moment it's being used. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=528.24s)]
*  People say the grid needs to remain balanced. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=532.7199999999999s)]
*  It's measured in terms of frequency. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=535.1199999999999s)]
*  In the United States, it's 60 hertz. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=537.04s)]
*  In Europe, it's like 50, I believe. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=539.1999999999999s)]
*  And I think in Japan, it's 50 as well. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=540.88s)]
*  But basically, you need to make sure that the demand for electricity, [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=543.04s)]
*  basically people sucking electricity out of the grid and then other power generators [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=547.3599999999999s)]
*  pushing electricity in is always the same to maintain that perfect hertz level. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=551.3599999999999s)]
*  And if that ever falters, when people say like the grid is unbalanced, [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=556.0s)]
*  that means it shifts away from that point, in which case a lot of the electrical equipment [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=559.76s)]
*  hooked up to the grid that is calibrated to a specific frequency is damaged. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=564.08s)]
*  And if things happen too quick, you have to shed load, meaning you have to pull things off. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=569.2s)]
*  And if you can't do that, then you have blackouts, [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=574.16s)]
*  where essentially equipment's fried and you have to like completely replace it, [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=576.3199999999999s)]
*  which could take weeks or months. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=579.36s)]
*  It can be very dangerous very quickly as the winter storms in Texas over the last couple [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=581.12s)]
*  years in the East Coast make really very clear. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=585.6s)]
*  And then also the other big point is about sort of this reliability. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=589.84s)]
*  It's very hard to predict the demand for electricity [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=593.52s)]
*  on the supply of electricity that's going to come in the far future. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=599.36s)]
*  Most of the time, it's really just looking at weather. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=602.96s)]
*  And increasingly so as solar and wind become larger portions of our grid. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=605.2s)]
*  You can assume the sun is going to shine every day, but not always. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=609.36s)]
*  Sometimes it can be cloudy, it can decrease the percent. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=613.2s)]
*  People often say the wind is always blowing somewhere. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=616.4000000000001s)]
*  But that only matters if you have the transmission lines to move wind from one place to another. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=620.24s)]
*  So a nightmare scenario could be you set up a grid with a large portion of wind, [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=624.88s)]
*  and it's winter, so everyone has their heaters on. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=629.5200000000001s)]
*  But the wind for some reason is not blowing right as a cold spell hits. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=632.24s)]
*  So that's when you have this issue of huge spike in demand, but not enough supply for it. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=636.32s)]
*  And so there's a bunch of scenario studies that these grid operators will do, [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=642.08s)]
*  trying to figure out like, can we ever guarantee the wind will be blowing in a certain time? [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=647.12s)]
*  And it's really, really hard to do that. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=651.36s)]
*  So that's why it's so important that it's not going to be all nuclear, [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=653.84s)]
*  all solar, all wind, or all natural gas, because there are situations where pipes freeze. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=657.36s)]
*  And so it becomes very, very complex. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=662.5600000000001s)]
*  And it's not as simple as just connect as much solar as possible. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=665.84s)]
*  Reliability is a huge issue in a modern country with our modern luxuries. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=670.08s)]
*  We can't afford for the grid to go down at all. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=674.4s)]
*  That's such a good point, because it really does feel pretty much binary, right? [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=676.5600000000001s)]
*  It's not like we want uptime of 95%. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=679.92s)]
*  It's like we want uptime of 99.9999% or 100%, right? [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=682.64s)]
*  Just basically people, we cannot afford for the grid to go down. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=687.12s)]
*  And so it does feel like people automatically assume like, let's add more supply. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=691.04s)]
*  And there are many reasons, it seems like, why that is not such a simple solution. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=696.0s)]
*  We'll get into the energy mix in a second. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=700.16s)]
*  But maybe you could just speak to this broad dynamic that you mentioned in your article. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=703.04s)]
*  That is that the price to generate electricity has come down over the years with new technology. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=707.1999999999999s)]
*  Yet the price to actually distribute it or deliver it has gone up. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=713.1999999999999s)]
*  Sounds kind of counterintuitive. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=718.0799999999999s)]
*  Where are things really breaking down there? [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=720.0s)]
*  Yeah. So I think the most important point to understand here is that when you pay your [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=722.0s)]
*  power bill, for me, Pete, Jeannie, and Northern California, you're paying a combination of prices. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=727.12s)]
*  You're paying, on one hand, the price of the energy itself, which in deregulated markets [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=732.24s)]
*  is known as the wholesale price. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=737.12s)]
*  So this is the price of the power out the door cost that the power plant is selling the power to [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=739.04s)]
*  these other entities in these power markets. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=744.48s)]
*  That's one portion of it. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=747.4399999999999s)]
*  And then there's also the cost of the infrastructure and operational costs of these utilities, [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=748.8s)]
*  like PG&E, who own the lines and might interface with the customers to deliver that power to you. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=753.8399999999999s)]
*  And so if you look at your electricity bill, typically they'll separate out these fees. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=759.04s)]
*  And you can see, many times, and increasingly so in California, the cost to deliver is over 50% [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=762.3199999999999s)]
*  of the bill. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=768.0799999999999s)]
*  It's becoming increasingly high. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=768.9599999999999s)]
*  And the big reason for that is that the infrastructure to build new power lines, to build new power [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=770.56s)]
*  plants, is incredibly, incredibly expensive. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=775.92s)]
*  The interconnection queue is something people might have heard about before. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=779.4399999999999s)]
*  But basically, there's over like two, I want to say it's like two terawatts in the queue right [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=782.7199999999999s)]
*  now, which means that there's like two terawatts of power generating capacity, a nameplate, at least, [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=787.1999999999999s)]
*  like what it could max out at, waiting to be connected to the grid. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=792.4s)]
*  Could you just super quickly ground us on how that compares to how much electricity is on the grid? [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=796.16s)]
*  I believe our grid today is about 1.2 terawatts. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=801.12s)]
*  So this is almost effectively double what our current national generating capacity is. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=805.12s)]
*  So what this shows to me is that it appears like there's a lot of demand for electricity. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=811.68s)]
*  Now, when you sort of unpack what's going on, there's some interesting, I would say, disincentives [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=816.0s)]
*  of how this queue works, where because of what I mentioned earlier, like the frequency and [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=822.16s)]
*  understanding, grid balancing, there's a lot of feasibility studies that go into, can I put [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=826.72s)]
*  a gigawatt of power generating capacity here? And then how does that affect the ability of this [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=832.56s)]
*  localized region as well as the broader grid? And these things take a lot of time. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=837.12s)]
*  And especially when people are sort of, I want to say, spamming projects, where there is a company [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=842.88s)]
*  who puts in like 10 proposals of different power plants, waiting to see which ones are going to [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=848.56s)]
*  have the cheapest interconnection fee. And then they'll pull back all the ones that are too [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=854.0s)]
*  expensive and just end up trying to build the one that's the cheapest. But the problem with that [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=858.08s)]
*  is that all these feasibility studies have to run with the idea that all these plants are legitimate. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=862.32s)]
*  And so this has created this massive queue of maybe, I think it's like 10 to 20% of projects [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=867.6s)]
*  are actually built. That's wild. It's crazy. There's a lot of really interesting new policy [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=872.5600000000001s)]
*  coming from the federal level about how to manage these queues. Texas famously has a way that they [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=877.5200000000001s)]
*  handle it. They call it, I believe, connect and manage. If anyone has been paying attention to [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=883.0400000000001s)]
*  electric recently, they'll know Texas has been able to connect a lot of assets. But instead of [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=886.88s)]
*  running these feasibility studies, they'll basically levy that risk of connection to the [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=891.6s)]
*  developer and say, you can connect your solar wind anywhere, but if it at all risks our grid, [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=898.08s)]
*  we're going to cut you off. Whereas in California or other places, they're like, we want to make [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=903.12s)]
*  sure it's always going to be delivering power and it's not going to destabilize our connection. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=908.24s)]
*  So there's a lot of ways to handle this, but that makes it any sort of new construction, [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=913.44s)]
*  very, very difficult. But the success of Texas and how much wind and solar and batteries they've [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=918.64s)]
*  been able to connect and why a lot of companies are flooding there is because of this policy that [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=923.6s)]
*  makes it very, very easy to connect new assets. Now, if you didn't catch that, basically what Ryan [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=927.76s)]
*  is saying is that ERCOT, the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, is flipping the incentive. So [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=932.8000000000001s)]
*  instead of the onus being on them to prove that a project can work, it's on the developer to make [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=938.24s)]
*  that a reality. And of course, if they don't, there are consequences. But there are other [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=942.96s)]
*  approaches being explored in TANF. There are also interesting ways through FERC, [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=948.08s)]
*  which is a national body overseeing this, of trying to bundle up different projects, [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=952.32s)]
*  providing sort of fees. So instead of being able to sort of just YOLO projects in, you are now [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=957.2800000000001s)]
*  sort of taking on some sort of financial risk by putting in fake projects. So trying to disincentivize [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=964.64s)]
*  doing that. But even if you can get these projects approved, things like Transformers [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=972.88s)]
*  are, you know, have crazy lead times, like over a year or more, not to mention that it's increased [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=979.12s)]
*  in price dramatically. If you're trying to build out like a new sort of housing project or something [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=983.92s)]
*  like that, and you have to build like sort of a substation, you know, securing these things is [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=990.16s)]
*  also a huge problem, which are just additional things to worry about, both cybersecurity [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=993.92s)]
*  and physical security. I think over the last couple of years, people have been [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=999.68s)]
*  shooting substations, and it takes down like a local grid. There's very little you can do [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=1002.88s)]
*  there besides just paying somebody to just be on site and securing that. Perhaps lastly, [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=1007.5999999999999s)]
*  like just the existing power lines, the PG&E fires that people might have seen in Northern [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=1012.16s)]
*  California, I believe Camp Fire was one of them. But some of these lines were built in the early [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=1017.1999999999999s)]
*  1900s. I was up hiking at Muir Woods the other week. And if you're up at the top of the hill, [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=1021.1999999999999s)]
*  you can see these transmission lines that are going through and there's trucks that will go [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=1026.48s)]
*  and manually check a lot of them. If one of these lines falls over dry grass, like it's likely going [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=1030.64s)]
*  to start a fire. And that's what we continue to see, especially if they're that old. And when [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=1035.6s)]
*  something like that happens, they don't know where the line actually fell. They know like on what [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=1039.6s)]
*  type of power line it fell, but not specifically the spot. It actually often takes trucks driving [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=1044.4s)]
*  through to see where these damages occur. So there are a lot of interesting like potential upgrades [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=1049.92s)]
*  that need to be done. And all of this just ends up being sort of pushed onto the consumer. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=1055.6s)]
*  That's so interesting. I did not realize they can't actually tell where things are breaking [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=1061.52s)]
*  down at the local level. So I've heard a few things. You mentioned that the actual Q [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=1066.32s)]
*  is increasing in terms of adding more power. I'm also hearing things maybe around supply chain, [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=1073.36s)]
*  security. Is there anything else you'd mentioned in terms of just the overall set of challenges [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=1078.0s)]
*  that exist as we're trying to improve this grid? Yeah, I mean, I think this rise of intermittent [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=1083.28s)]
*  power, it just introduces a lot of complexity and not just intermittent power, but where the [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=1089.6s)]
*  power is generated. And I think one of the big pieces we have is that there's going to be a [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=1095.44s)]
*  decentralization of the grid. Now, it's not like we're going to start taking offline all of our [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=1100.24s)]
*  large power plants. But as the demand for energy is increasing, it's going to become easier for [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=1105.84s)]
*  people to generate power on site. Solar is going to be the big reason for that. But also battery [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=1111.36s)]
*  storage. And as I mentioned earlier, people are going to have electric vehicles that can store [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=1117.4399999999998s)]
*  energy and connect to their house. Your stove is going to have a battery likely. Your heating might [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=1120.8799999999999s)]
*  actually have some energy storage capabilities as well. That power is going to be flowing in many [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=1126.1599999999999s)]
*  different directions, which is very different from a world where power is generated at a big plant and [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=1130.6399999999999s)]
*  just going in one direction. So people need to rethink how grid of structure works and functions. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=1135.12s)]
*  It's not as simple as just pressing the button and the power going backwards. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=1141.04s)]
*  Totally. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=1144.72s)]
*  That's something that the grid operators are thinking about as well. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=1145.04s)]
*  Yeah, that sounds really important. And maybe at the crux of us needing to distribute more of the [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=1147.92s)]
*  grid is this idea that a lot of our new sources, as you're saying, are more of that intermittent [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=1153.28s)]
*  type. So we're talking a lot of renewables. So maybe we can just start there and address the [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=1159.2s)]
*  question, which is why are renewables alone not enough, especially as we increase the capacity of [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=1163.6s)]
*  solar and wind? You spoke a little bit to this, but maybe you could just break that down explicitly. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=1170.88s)]
*  Renewables, I want to be clear, renewables are fantastic. They are cheaper. Even without [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=1176.16s)]
*  subsidies, LCOE is often a metric thrown around, which is the levelized cost of energy. Solar and [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=1180.3200000000002s)]
*  wind are really, really good. The problem is that you cannot guarantee that they're going to be [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=1185.7600000000002s)]
*  available when you need it. I mean, it's often the case that, for example, if you look at the demand [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=1190.16s)]
*  profile for energy in any sort of modernized economy, it's typically in the early mornings, [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=1194.0800000000002s)]
*  everyone's waking up and energy use is high. Then there's a trough in the middle of the day, [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=1200.56s)]
*  which is right when it's sunny, when the solar panels are generating the most electricity. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=1205.12s)]
*  And then there's a huge spike in the evening when everyone comes home, turns on their TV, [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=1209.28s)]
*  starts cooking dinner, and there's a drop as well later into the middle of the night. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=1213.04s)]
*  So the problem with this, obviously, and this is a phenomenon known also as the duck curve, [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=1217.28s)]
*  and people are familiar with that. But basically, the middle of the day, when energy is essentially [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=1221.6799999999998s)]
*  when solar, the sun is blaring and energy is really, really cheap, but the demand is at its [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=1226.32s)]
*  lowest point. So you need to find a way to capture that energy in the middle of the day, [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=1231.84s)]
*  and have it available in the evenings when the sun is not shining or when it's dust. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=1237.12s)]
*  And then similarly, it's something like wind, you cannot guarantee that wind is going to be blowing. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=1241.6799999999998s)]
*  You can generally, you can look at trends to have this idea of wind's going to be blowing, [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=1247.6799999999998s)]
*  and generally at night, it's windier. But this is really, really hard for operators to rely on. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=1252.24s)]
*  So this is why energy storage is so critical. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=1257.76s)]
*  Doing intermittent sources, you need some way to sort of level it out. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=1261.68s)]
*  So operators know that we're going to have enough energy when we need it. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=1265.92s)]
*  And this is coming from a world where we used to have natural gas plants that could [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=1271.44s)]
*  chug along 24-7, say, but nuclear, which is, these are things that are baseload. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=1275.3600000000001s)]
*  Geothermal is another one. Previously in our country, almost all of our energy storage, [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=1282.0s)]
*  I think it's like 90 plus percent today is through hydro, through dams. So when there's a shortfall [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=1286.72s)]
*  at all, we would just sort of open the floodgates a little bit on the dams, and that water would [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=1292.24s)]
*  trickle through and we'd be able to make up smaller changes in energy fluctuation or major ones. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=1296.0s)]
*  And so if we're going to increase the amounts of solar and wind on the grid, we also need to [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=1301.04s)]
*  proportionally increase the amount of storage. And this is going to be a very significant challenge. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=1307.52s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, to your point, it sounds like we need some balancing mechanism. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=1312.16s)]
*  We'll talk about natural gas and nuclear in a second, but let's speak directly to batteries. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=1316.56s)]
*  Something that I found really fascinating from your article is the point you just made about hydro. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=1322.48s)]
*  When I think about storage and many people think about storage, they automatically think of batteries. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=1327.3600000000001s)]
*  And this table says that only 2% of our US storage in 2022 actually came from lithium [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=1332.72s)]
*  ion batteries, which was surprising to me, and 94% from pumped hydro. That's totally, [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=1340.64s)]
*  talk about misconceptions from earlier. I did not know that in any capacity. And so [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=1346.88s)]
*  can you just speak to where we are today and the storage demand, whether that comes from battery or [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=1352.0s)]
*  otherwise, how do we get to where we need to be? Is it just a matter of creating a bunch more [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=1357.1200000000001s)]
*  batteries or hydro capacity? Is this all really feasible to do in the next few years? [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=1362.64s)]
*  Yeah. So it's difficult to make projections here because a lot of this comes down to the cost of [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=1368.4s)]
*  batteries. If batteries are $10, $30 a kilowatt hour, then a lot of this stuff becomes meaningless. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=1373.92s)]
*  Obviously, there's critical mineral concerns about where we access this stuff. This newer [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=1381.68s)]
*  generation of batteries that are less energy dense, like sodium ion, becomes less of a concern. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=1385.8400000000001s)]
*  Regardless, that's going to be the key thing to pay attention to. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=1390.8s)]
*  What I will say is in the near term, batteries have already dominated this very, very short [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=1393.9199999999998s)]
*  timeframe markets. I mentioned these wholesale markets earlier, but they're structured in [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=1399.2s)]
*  different time durations. So depending on how quick you need to supply energy. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=1404.6399999999999s)]
*  I mentioned the fact that you need to maintain a certain frequency. There's a market that's called [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=1410.48s)]
*  broadly ancillary services, which is really just focusing on power quality. So if it moves from 60 [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=1415.04s)]
*  Hertz a little bit, the grid will sort of seek more energy or less energy to balance it out. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=1420.72s)]
*  Batteries already dominate that because they're very, very good at moving very, very fast, [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=1428.24s)]
*  but it's a very, very small amount of energy. Increasingly as batteries enter the grid, [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=1432.1599999999999s)]
*  which as you've noted from the chart, it's not that significant penetration yet. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=1437.28s)]
*  They will start to be able to cycle over sort of a daily time frame. So as I mentioned earlier, [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=1441.84s)]
*  taking energy from the middle of the day and allowing its use in the evenings when people [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=1447.36s)]
*  actually need it. If you didn't catch that, batteries currently only cycle from minutes to [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=1451.9199999999998s)]
*  hours. But the hope is that their storage duration will become hours to days, just like hydro, [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=1457.28s)]
*  which composes the lion's share of US current storage capacity. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=1463.04s)]
*  Now, the problem with batteries is they can't solve these sort of longer duration spells. So I [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=1467.68s)]
*  mentioned this case where if your grid is a huge wind component, it might be not windy for weeks. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=1475.12s)]
*  Unlikely, but it's possible. Batteries are not very good at storing energy for long periods of [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=1482.1599999999999s)]
*  time. When I say long, days or weeks, you'll need alternative methods of storing that energy. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=1487.2s)]
*  There are a lot of things proposed. A lot of companies trying novel solutions like synthetic [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=1493.6s)]
*  natural gas or hydrogen. There's gravity batteries, there's iron air batteries, a bunch of different [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=1498.32s)]
*  ways to do this. But these are essentially trying to do almost weeks to months to seasonal storage. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=1503.1999999999998s)]
*  And that's also going to be a component as well that I'm excited to see continue to build out. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=1511.52s)]
*  Batteries in the energy sense, but not the same batteries you'd see in cars. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=1515.52s)]
*  And then let's jump to natural gas and nuclear, which are two other, you could say, [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=1519.6s)]
*  balancing mechanisms that have been used in different capacities in different places. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=1523.6799999999998s)]
*  They have their pros and cons. Just tell me a little bit more about where natural gas and [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=1528.56s)]
*  nuclear currently play a role and then also the potential for them to play a different role. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=1533.6s)]
*  Natural gas is dominant on our grid. United States is a major natural gas producer. Fracking was [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=1538.9599999999998s)]
*  huge for this country in terms of energy independence. Today, there are two different [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=1544.88s)]
*  types of natural gas plants. There's some that are running 24-7. There's some plants called [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=1550.0800000000002s)]
*  peaker plants that essentially, if there's a shortfall or if there's no other generating [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=1554.96s)]
*  capacity, peaker plants will bid to fill that gap. And it's more expensive. Let's say you're [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=1560.48s)]
*  building a natural gas plant. You can amortize it 24-7 and it's going to be cheaper to run that [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=1567.2800000000002s)]
*  power plant as opposed to some of these peaker plants might run at a 1% capacity factor. It was [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=1572.32s)]
*  actually a 1% of the time that they'd be running. And those are going to be way more expensive to [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=1578.32s)]
*  generate that power, but it'd probably be cheaper than using solar and storing it in batteries today. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=1583.52s)]
*  Now, natural gas is also good because you don't really rely on the weather, so you can always [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=1589.04s)]
*  turn it on and you can typically ramp it up pretty quickly. There's a lot of benefits there as well. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=1593.4399999999998s)]
*  Also, I would note that the sort of relationship between natural gas and nuclear [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=1600.0s)]
*  are sort of a historic one. Natural gas was sort of, I don't want to say the reason that nuclear [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=1604.4799999999998s)]
*  found a lot of competition, but from a price point, as we sort of looked at nuclear in the late 20th [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=1610.8799999999999s)]
*  century, was the same time that natural gas became very big. Interesting. Natural gas quickly became [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=1616.1599999999999s)]
*  very, very cheap and nuclear became very expensive. So natural gas became a very big piece of our grid [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=1620.9599999999998s)]
*  and will likely continue to be a major piece of our grid as long as our domestic production continues [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=1627.4399999999998s)]
*  and there's no sort of radical change in energy source. Now, if we can make nuclear fission [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=1633.36s)]
*  incredibly cheap, we can have nuclear fusion become incredibly cheap, then a lot of this [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=1638.6399999999999s)]
*  need for dispatchable or ready-to-go energy sources will change. But until then, natural gas will [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=1643.4399999999998s)]
*  probably remain a significant piece of our grid because it is reliable. We've been working on [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=1650.3999999999999s)]
*  nuclear for decades, right? And it would be surprising. I know there's a long charted history [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=1654.8s)]
*  of what's happened in those decades, but it does seem like even just purely from the technological [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=1660.6399999999999s)]
*  perspective, we have new reactor designs coming online or at least being developed and maybe in [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=1666.3999999999999s)]
*  a new renaissance of public discourse around it. Yeah, absolutely. I think the main thing to [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=1671.84s)]
*  understand for nuclear, particularly the historic nuclear, was these gigawatt-scale power plants, [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=1676.6399999999999s)]
*  the newest of which the designs with AP1000. This is Vogel. This is a Southern power company [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=1683.2s)]
*  that is a regulated utility that saw a lot of government support to build this. In fact, [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=1688.8000000000002s)]
*  the local companies, a lot of times people are building nuclear power plants. The utilities will [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=1694.0s)]
*  go out of business. Government needs to sort of step in to help them. It's been a really, really [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=1698.16s)]
*  difficult journey for utilities to buy large nuclear power plants. So I think that's the [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=1703.5200000000002s)]
*  primary reason you haven't seen it done. And those who have tried like Vogel, you see these [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=1709.6s)]
*  sort of horrible cost increases and a lot of problems. And I think I go into that in detail [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=1713.52s)]
*  in my essay of what those causes are. It is sort of rational. Why would a utility risk bankruptcy? [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=1718.48s)]
*  Or even more so, I don't know when the power plant is going to be up. Is it going to be 10 years? [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=1725.04s)]
*  It can be 20 years. You don't really know. And so it's really hard to make that $10 billion bet. [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=1729.52s)]
*  That's why it's very, very hard for especially deregulated utilities. It really takes a government, [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=1735.1999999999998s)]
*  which is why nationally, you know, like Japan and France, and even like I said, our regulated [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=1739.76s)]
*  utilities in the United States, a lot of our nuclear power plants are government supported. [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=1745.04s)]
*  It's very, very hard to take on that risk as a private entity. Now, the future of nuclear, [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=1749.9199999999998s)]
*  I think what we're seeing is the rise of SMRs in smaller reactors. I think that the reliability [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=1755.6799999999998s)]
*  of power, I think is going to become increasingly relevant for a lot of people. You can see, you [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=1762.96s)]
*  know, in the news, you've seen Microsoft, some of the other hyperscalers talk about, we want to do [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=1769.44s)]
*  nuclear power data centers, we want to have access to clean energy that is available 24-7. Now, you [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=1773.68s)]
*  know, you could achieve this with a large solar farm and batteries. You can do it with geothermal, [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=1779.68s)]
*  which, you know, some of these hyperscalers are also looking at. But nuclear is one of the most [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=1786.32s)]
*  compelling. If you're one of these data centers, you want to ensure reliability. You want something [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=1790.64s)]
*  that you plug it in, it's going to last 15, 20 years. Nuclear sort of uniquely provides that. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=1795.2800000000002s)]
*  In terms of this decentralization trend, you know, solar and batteries are going to be a piece of it [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=1802.0800000000002s)]
*  residentially and perhaps like these local communities. But it's likely that, you know, [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=1807.6000000000001s)]
*  these off the grid or incredibly, you know, this focus on reliability over sort of cost, [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=1812.24s)]
*  nuclear is going to be a very compelling option. Now, all that's to say that we solve some of the, [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=1817.6799999999998s)]
*  you know, the issues on the regulatory side and some of these new designs get approved and built. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=1822.0s)]
*  Since we're on the topic of policy, does anything jump out at you in terms of where policy can help [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=1826.56s)]
*  kind of usher this new grid forward or to kind of help solve some of the gaps that we just talked [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=1832.4799999999998s)]
*  about in terms of like the interconnection queue or the different energy mix that we're discussing? [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=1838.3999999999999s)]
*  FERC is sort of like the federal body that oversees a lot of the transmission and distribution [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=1843.76s)]
*  and grid infrastructure. The stuff I've read, at least, seems very positive. People are aware of [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=1848.8799999999999s)]
*  a lot of these issues. And there's a separate group called the NERC, which is a semi sort of [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=1854.08s)]
*  government associated. But they run these sort of these risk reports. And they have highlighted [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=1859.68s)]
*  that one of the key risks for the grid over the next decade is actually policy. So a lot of people [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=1865.04s)]
*  will say things like, we need to go completely renewable. We need to be completely solar and wind [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=1870.32s)]
*  expeditiously. The problem with that is, as I said, like the reliability concerns, [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=1877.04s)]
*  it's going to create a lot of issues. But I think when we think about, you know, what are our climate [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=1881.6s)]
*  goals? Like these are human goals. Like we want to live in a better world. That better world near [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=1887.52s)]
*  term is not a world with increased blackouts. There are a lot of countries that were once had [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=1892.6399999999999s)]
*  great grids. South Africa, great example. They have nuclear power, but much of the day in South [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=1897.36s)]
*  Africa, the grid is actually completely down. Really? So dysfunction from a policy perspective, [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=1902.4799999999998s)]
*  there are worlds where it can revert. And the liability that a country once had disappears. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=1908.08s)]
*  And I don't think it will get that bad in the United States. But there are a lot of interesting [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=1914.32s)]
*  warning signs and people in utilities, and people who have been in the power industry for a long time [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=1918.08s)]
*  are beginning to speak up. The last thing I'll mention is the IRA. So the Inflation Reduction [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=1923.92s)]
*  Act put a lot of policies first for energy. So a lot of companies, for example, batteries, [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=1929.44s)]
*  manufacturing credits, various incentives to both sort of bring onshore a lot of this production, [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=1935.8400000000001s)]
*  also make available a lot of funding for grid enhancement, both locally and sort of regionally. [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=1944.0800000000002s)]
*  So there's a lot of funding available for this, which is very exciting. [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=1951.3600000000001s)]
*  And so a lot of the things that need to be done, it seems like are beginning to happen. So I'm [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=1955.6000000000001s)]
*  optimistic. All right, that is your call to build. Clearly, the grid is no monolith, and solutions [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=1959.44s)]
*  can't stand alone. They need to be thoughtfully interwoven into a matrix of an already complex [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=1965.44s)]
*  energy mix, data infrastructure, changing regulation, and more. But another area that is [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=1971.1200000000001s)]
*  prime for opportunity is applying technology to the grid. Despite a multi-decade wave of [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=1976.48s)]
*  software eating the world, it seems like the grid hasn't quite held pace. And if you'd like to [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=1981.52s)]
*  hear Ryan's take on the possibility of a smart and decentralized grid, we have the extended version [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgf2FD62j3g&t=1986.96s)]
