Video Description: When people think about startups working with the government, the phrase “black box” often comes up. But what if that box is finally being pried open?

In this episode—recorded live at the American Dynamism Summit in DC—we talk with two Chief Technology Officers at the heart of American defense: Alex Miller, CTO for the Chief of Staff of the Army, and Justin Fanelli, CTO at the Department of the Navy. Along with a16z partner Leila Hay, they break down how the Department of Defense is shifting from decades-old processes to software-speed execution, why the real bottlenecks are cultural, not technical, and how startups can actually navigate and scale within this massive system.

From replacing outdated procurement with faster pathways, to getting tech into the hands of warfighters faster, this is a rare look inside the government’s most ambitious efforts to modernize—and what it means for builders on the outside.

Is it time to rip up the system and start fresh? Or are the seeds of change already in the ground?

# Can the Military Move at Startup Speed? How the Army and Navy Are Rebuilding
**The a16z Podcast:** [April 02, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0)
*  Only superior military technology can credibly deter war. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=0.0s)]
*  The DOD is a black box. We're trying to fix it. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=3.2s)]
*  We have more companies than we've ever seen before who want to work on national security. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=6.4s)]
*  This is the best alignment that we'll have in our lifetimes. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=10.8s)]
*  Only the soldiers will actually be able to tell you, yes, this works at a time of crisis. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=14.200000000000001s)]
*  This is a period about scaling what actually works. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=19.2s)]
*  It is shocking to me how much stuff we buy for soldiers [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=22.2s)]
*  that no one would accept if I handed it to you in your everyday life. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=25.2s)]
*  This is not a technology problem. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=28.0s)]
*  This is a culture and a process problem that we can apply technology to. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=30.8s)]
*  We want to overwhelm the system with how much better it can be. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=35.2s)]
*  You both are CTOs of two very important public institutions. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=47.8s)]
*  Can we start off with telling us who you are and what you do? [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=51.6s)]
*  I'm Alex Miller. I'm the CTO for the Chief of Staff of the Army. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=54.6s)]
*  That is a big title because the Army is a big place. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=58.599999999999994s)]
*  In my day job, it's a lot of education. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=61.599999999999994s)]
*  I would say probably 60-40 talking to people about what technology can do for a mission. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=65.2s)]
*  Then 40% actually hands on, like putting my engineering cap back on [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=70.6s)]
*  and actually doing things that move the ball forward. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=74.4s)]
*  I would say very similarly to a company, what I do as the CTO for the Chief is [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=76.8s)]
*  think about what the North Star should be for the Army in terms of how we leverage technology, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=82.6s)]
*  how we employ it, and then what our missions are that can leverage it. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=87.4s)]
*  Then actually going forward and helping people get there. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=90.60000000000001s)]
*  While companies have boards of directors and presidents and all these different things, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=94.0s)]
*  we also have a board of directors that is Congress. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=97.4s)]
*  We also have stakeholders that are the American people. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=99.60000000000001s)]
*  However, most companies don't have 60 years of policy and rules that were written [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=103.0s)]
*  generally by enthusiasts and visionaries but implemented by minimalists. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=111.0s)]
*  What I mean by that is risk minimalists. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=116.0s)]
*  Most of our day job is just actually going through and educating, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=117.6s)]
*  having a unique understanding of what our job is, what the mission is, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=121.4s)]
*  and having done it to make that connection happen. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=124.4s)]
*  What did you do before you were the CTO? [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=127.4s)]
*  Before I was the CTO, I was the science and technology advisor for the Army G2. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=129.2s)]
*  That is the deputy chief of staff that runs intelligence. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=135.0s)]
*  I was the guy doing all the technology for Army military intelligence. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=138.0s)]
*  I got to do some pretty cool stuff, work with some really interesting people, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=142.0s)]
*  and that was where all my downrange time was as an intelligence professional. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=145.2s)]
*  Justin, how about you? [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=149.79999999999998s)]
*  Justin Finnelli, Department of Navy, so Navy and Marine Corps, Chief Technology Officer. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=151.0s)]
*  Just like Alex said, Navy is a big place. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=156.39999999999998s)]
*  Oceans are two-thirds of the world. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=159.0s)]
*  We want to cover as much ground as possible. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=161.2s)]
*  The CTO position within government came 30 years after it did private sector, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=164.39999999999998s)]
*  and even later than that after defense. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=168.39999999999998s)]
*  This is really a late acknowledgement or a nod [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=170.39999999999998s)]
*  that commercial technology can be a disruptive force positively for the government [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=173.6s)]
*  and that we can go much faster, but we need digital to do that. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=178.4s)]
*  And so to Alex's point, finding innovations from non-traditional partners and at the edge [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=182.20000000000002s)]
*  and scaling those much quicker and tying it to some sort of divestment [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=189.6s)]
*  because that money is locked in that three-year period where we're spending on existing tech. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=193.8s)]
*  We're out there scouting, very similar to how private sector would do. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=199.0s)]
*  We're working with hundreds of internal organizations, in some cases with different kind of suboptimized [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=202.2s)]
*  or very specific goals. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=208.6s)]
*  How do we make that a reconciled space where we can just bring the biggest outcomes to the hardest problems? [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=210.39999999999998s)]
*  And so that alignment piece to bring ultimately outcomes over match is our goal. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=218.6s)]
*  So you both mentioned industry. You both mentioned startups. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=225.2s)]
*  My colleague Ryan and I actually just wrote a blog post about selling into the DoD [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=228.2s)]
*  because there are these paths that startups can pursue. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=233.0s)]
*  We all know about SBIR, STTR. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=236.2s)]
*  There are great organizations like DIU and AFWorx that are out there looking to help pave these paths. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=239.0s)]
*  But for a lot of startups, working with the Army or the Navy still feels like a black box. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=245.0s)]
*  Can you walk us through what kind of pathways are evolving [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=250.79999999999998s)]
*  and new opportunities for industry to engage with your organizations? [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=254.2s)]
*  So startups generally focus on the R&D side. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=258.4s)]
*  So they're taking a concept up through some type of development into that golden, minimally viable product phase. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=260.8s)]
*  And the P is really important because it's not minimally viable prototype, which I think a lot of DoD thinks about in terms of, [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=268.0s)]
*  hey, that sort of looks like it's useful. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=273.4s)]
*  But what startups are thinking about is, hey, what's that first product that I can productize and get to market? [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=275.59999999999997s)]
*  For that phase, the DIUs, the works, whether it's AFWorx or SoftWorx or EagleWorx, [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=280.2s)]
*  like all of these different organizations, that's exactly where we want them to be. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=286.2s)]
*  The reason I say that is because the DoD is a black box. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=289.0s)]
*  And I say that meaningfully because we're trying to fix it. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=292.59999999999997s)]
*  That black box was set up on purpose because in the 60s and 70s coming out of the Cold War [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=295.8s)]
*  and all the way up to the 90s, we had all these different things. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=302.4s)]
*  The Packard Commission for how you think about buying things. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=304.8s)]
*  The Klinger-Cohen for how you do information technology. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=308.0s)]
*  Goldwater-Nickels on how you connect mission with buying things. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=311.0s)]
*  And all of that is still the rules that we live under and everything since then has been duct tape and bubble gum. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=316.0s)]
*  What we are trying to do is instead of MacGyvering our way through that, which all of us have spent a lot of time doing, [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=321.4s)]
*  we are trying to sort of domiclees cut through all of it, get rid of all of this extra bureaucracy, [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=327.2s)]
*  work with the Hill so that it's not a black box. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=332.8s)]
*  And it's sort of like the 12-step program. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=335.6s)]
*  If you can't admit there's a problem, you can't actually solve the problem. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=337.8s)]
*  So that's sort of the left side of the equation. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=341.0s)]
*  The right side is what the Army is doing is just bringing industry in and saying, [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=343.40000000000003s)]
*  hey, we know we have a problem we want to help, [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=347.8s)]
*  whether it's helping us write requirements better so that we know what's available. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=349.6s)]
*  So we're not trying to divide that from nothing into, hey, how do we bring consortiums together? [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=354.40000000000003s)]
*  I love the new software strategy from the SecDev because it tells us use other transaction authorities. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=359.40000000000003s)]
*  Like use the things that Congress has given you and do it aggressively. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=364.6s)]
*  So putting consortiums of teams together with industry to say, I'm not going to pretend like I know everything. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=368.8s)]
*  We've done that for 50 years, no more. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=375.0s)]
*  You tell us what's available and we'll tell you the mission and how we can apply to that. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=377.6s)]
*  We want more game changers in this space. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=382.20000000000005s)]
*  And so when we have barriers, it stops outcomes. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=385.0s)]
*  So in general, we have more companies than we've ever seen before who want to work on national security. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=389.0s)]
*  There's a general recognition that this world can be a dangerous place. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=394.6s)]
*  And the more secure we are, the better we are at this, the more overmatched there is, [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=399.6s)]
*  the more that we can have peace through strength. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=405.0s)]
*  And this is, in my opinion, probably the best alignment that we'll have in our lifetimes. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=409.0s)]
*  This is potentially a century anomaly for actually being able to divest. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=415.6s)]
*  It's very hard to turn things off and then bring new players in and bring new waves of ultimately positive disruption through and through. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=423.6s)]
*  And so like that translation piece has been very expensive. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=433.20000000000005s)]
*  And so product market fit is slow. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=437.20000000000005s)]
*  And at times we turn away people who or companies that would have brought in breakthroughs. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=439.4s)]
*  But only superior military technology can credibly deter war. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=445.4s)]
*  And the fact that we have more people interested in supporting that mission, what does the go to market strategy look like? [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=449.79999999999995s)]
*  And so Alex talked on, hey, we have some of these front doors. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=455.79999999999995s)]
*  We don't want 100 front doors. That's confusing. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=459.0s)]
*  So how does streamlining that look like? [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=461.59999999999997s)]
*  Well, if you're a Horizon 3, if you're going to completely break through and change the game and you're selling something that we don't buy right now, [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=463.5s)]
*  you're swimming upstream. And so Andrel has has made it through and fought that fight. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=472.1s)]
*  SpaceX has, Palantir has. But number one, we want that to be more straightforward. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=477.7s)]
*  In that particular case, the PEOs are not your first customer. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=483.7s)]
*  Maybe we can just quickly talk about what a DOD program office is, because I think that's another black box challenge for startups. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=487.3s)]
*  I think a lot of companies know that you generally want to be on that journey. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=494.90000000000003s)]
*  You get some R&D dollars. You work with DIU. You get an OTA. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=499.1s)]
*  But ultimately, startups want to get to a program of record. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=502.5s)]
*  Yeah. Can you talk about exactly what that is and what that 100 percent? [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=505.90000000000003s)]
*  So people have heard of program of record if they've worked with the DOD, the Defense Department at all. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=509.0s)]
*  And so we have 75 program executive offices. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=515.1s)]
*  They buy at scale. These PEOs are made up of program management offices. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=520.1s)]
*  And so then you have hundreds of those. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=526.2s)]
*  Navigating that to figure out where to sell is a scale game. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=530.0s)]
*  And it's been too hard. So one thing that we've started to do within Department of Navy, [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=535.6s)]
*  we have 18 of those 75, is we've said, wouldn't it be easier if we made data driven decisions and started treating these buys not as the sacred program of record, [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=541.0s)]
*  but let's buy capability per dollar? [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=553.5s)]
*  And so our move towards military moneyball has been to open up the aperture through converting programs of record and program offices to portfolios. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=556.6s)]
*  And so we've shifted PEO digital. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=566.5s)]
*  And I believe that we'll shift even more of those program executive offices across DOD to that. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=570.2s)]
*  Now, that's for a Horizon One capability. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=576.8s)]
*  So if something improves the way that we're doing business, if we already have it budgeted, then you can go directly to them. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=579.8s)]
*  And there's actually an index online that shows, I think Steve Blank put it out, that says, here's what each PEO does. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=586.9s)]
*  Here's where they are. Here's who you can talk to within them. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=593.5s)]
*  The goal there, because they have fixed budgets, is finding something again to turn off because no one has runway to do three years of piloting until you transition something. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=596.8s)]
*  If you are doing a Horizon Two capability, we're working on a breakthrough, but it's existing technology or there is a budget line. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=609.1s)]
*  We have now more value of death funds than we used to. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=617.2s)]
*  We have small business innovative research, but that's more of a door prize. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=620.9s)]
*  You need to get to that operations and maintenance long tail funding. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=624.1999999999999s)]
*  We have something called AppFit. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=627.8s)]
*  Accelerating procurement for innovative technology. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=630.1999999999999s)]
*  There you go. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=632.3s)]
*  It allows some. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=632.9s)]
*  Accra new win. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=634.5s)]
*  Some breakthroughs to get pulled all the way through. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=635.8s)]
*  There's just not enough of those, right? [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=639.3s)]
*  There's just not enough funding and not enough awards. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=641.3s)]
*  The point is, if you can shrink the valley of death, you're doing this in the Horizon Two and Horizon One space. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=643.7s)]
*  For three, you probably have to do still some guerrilla marketing and advertising. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=650.9s)]
*  Pull in DIU, pull in the Hill, pull in the requirements writers to make sure that you're not doing all the translation yourself. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=656.5s)]
*  So what if we didn't do all that? [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=663.2s)]
*  So the cool thing is everything that Justin just said is a workaround. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=666.6s)]
*  It is a workaround to a system that is fundamentally broken. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=669.9s)]
*  The cool thing is, PEOs are not actually in statute anywhere. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=673.0s)]
*  They don't exist in law. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=676.2s)]
*  We made them up because the rule is that the SECDEF gets to determine what that looks like. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=678.3s)]
*  So as we think through what the future is, I don't want to have to know like that acronym soup. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=682.8s)]
*  Why would we put that on anybody willingly? [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=687.7s)]
*  The only reason it exists is because the process doesn't work. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=690.4s)]
*  So I want to just a short story on how this works for us. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=693.3s)]
*  So Justin talked about we build these requirements and forever they've been super gold plated. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=697.4s)]
*  They're this thick. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=701.6s)]
*  They're every word known to man because people are afraid that if you don't get into the requirement, you can't move to this program. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=703.1s)]
*  Thousands of pages. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=707.5s)]
*  What if we just stopped doing that because it is not actually what we have to do? [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=709.6s)]
*  And I'll give you an example of that for countering unmanned systems. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=714.9s)]
*  And there's lots of startups in this. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=717.8000000000001s)]
*  And I know that a lot of your founders are not in the threat headspace that I'm in right now. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=719.8000000000001s)]
*  So think about it. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=723.4s)]
*  You're at an NFL stadium or a soccer stadium and you see a quadcopter. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=724.7s)]
*  Like in my world, that's a horrifying prospect because that means that it's intruded into your airspace. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=729.6s)]
*  You can't do anything about it. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=734.3000000000001s)]
*  It's really hard to bring them down. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=735.5s)]
*  I think about thousands of those and that is the real threat that we're under. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=737.1s)]
*  Well, all of our requirements writers, they're not operations. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=740.6s)]
*  They're not the guys getting shot at. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=743.6s)]
*  They're just trying to do the right thing. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=745.0s)]
*  And you write these sort of black box requirements. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=746.7s)]
*  I found one the other day as I was going through them that was coming up through the process because it wanted to go to a program where if you took the combination of statistics that they put in there, [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=749.1s)]
*  like your operational availability, your operational accuracy and your operational reliability, [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=758.3s)]
*  which you ended up with with a system that only had to work 51 percent of the time. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=764.8s)]
*  What person at what company is going to go? [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=768.4s)]
*  Yeah, I'm OK with my engineers building something that only works 51 percent of the time. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=771.0s)]
*  Or if you flip it, I'm OK with wasting 49 percent of my resources. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=775.1999999999999s)]
*  So as we think about what the process should be and it's real, this is a with our shield or on it type of moment for the Department of Defense. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=779.1999999999999s)]
*  I just want to blow up all of that. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=785.6999999999999s)]
*  Anything that's below law, we should be able to reshape because there are no startups should ever have to go. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=787.4s)]
*  I want to be a programmer record because what that really turns into is a 30 year long set where Microsoft might have been thinking office is going to be around forever. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=794.5s)]
*  But inside of them, they still let product managers and program managers who were making sure that Excel was really good. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=804.6s)]
*  Please don't stop making Excel good. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=810.0s)]
*  The entire world runs on Excel. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=811.4s)]
*  But but like they're not thinking, oh, if I just get it here, I can slow down. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=813.6s)]
*  I can take my foot off the pedal, which is what happens in programs or record as soon as you make it. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=817.5s)]
*  As soon as you've got that long term budget, there's a perverse incentive to just to maintain and create inertia. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=821.8s)]
*  So so my my I guess theory of the case is. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=827.8s)]
*  I'm going to try to blow up all of that. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=832.8s)]
*  The question is, like, how do we increase yield? [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=834.4s)]
*  Right. And so like we have examples where like every good idea. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=836.7s)]
*  The government has piloted. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=843.1s)]
*  D.O.D. has piloted at some point. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=844.1s)]
*  Right. And so in this particular case on requirements, I worked with a 4000 page requirements document. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=845.5s)]
*  I'm fairly certain no one read it. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=852.0s)]
*  No one read all of it cover to cover. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=854.8000000000001s)]
*  You look at reference it like the dictionary, but it's a little bit longer. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=857.3000000000001s)]
*  In this particular case, we said, hey, we're going to use capability needs statements because this isn't going to get what we want anyway. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=861.0s)]
*  And so we fast tracked an 18 month process in three months with a couple pages between CNS's capability needs statements and top level requirements. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=866.9s)]
*  The software acquisition pathway allows us to do that. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=876.6999999999999s)]
*  And so we already have examples where the right thing is working way better than the old thing. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=879.4s)]
*  It's a K curve. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=885.6999999999999s)]
*  This is a matter of scaling what's working better. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=886.9s)]
*  And the only way we do that because there is some risk aversion is emphasize that the outcomes and the tradeoffs are for our warfighter. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=889.7s)]
*  And so when we have the best software developers in the world where we have the best capability coming in, let's not cut it down with a thousand paper cuts, ten thousand paper cuts. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=899.3000000000001s)]
*  Let's make decisions based on the impact that they're making. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=910.5s)]
*  We're doing more of that, but it's pockets of excellence. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=913.7s)]
*  So that's huge. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=916.0s)]
*  So there is sort of this acknowledgement about the black box and then a solution to managing the black box. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=916.9s)]
*  Sounds like there's also major changes happening when it comes to capabilities and being able to say we need to experiment because the pace of technology is so fast. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=922.6999999999999s)]
*  We can't write a requirement for a capability that's going to be developed three years from now because of the pace of software development, AI, all of these things. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=932.1999999999999s)]
*  It's moving so fast that you need to be more agile, especially with horizontal capabilities. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=941.9s)]
*  Like artificial intelligence, like how would we pull in artificial intelligence across 75 PEOs? [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=946.0s)]
*  We need to name enterprise services. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=953.2s)]
*  And so Defense Innovation Unit is actually has a digital on-ramp where they're trying to streamline that so that we can make buys based on impact. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=955.7s)]
*  The chances that a bunch of horizontal organizations were going to do the same thing was always high. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=964.4s)]
*  Quick example is we had edge compute ashore. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=970.2s)]
*  We had a hyperconverged infrastructure, small box that was doing incredible kind of like we could divest a billion dollar purchase and just move to this in every way more capable solution. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=974.6s)]
*  And we said, what about that for a float? [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=987.9s)]
*  And one of the captains of a ship said, let's put it on mine. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=990.5s)]
*  Let's figure out how this works. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=996.3000000000001s)]
*  We put it there. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=997.8000000000001s)]
*  He deployed to the Red Sea. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=999.1s)]
*  It's on other ships right now. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=1001.0s)]
*  This is enterprise moving to edge, specifically a float in a case that we didn't need to go down two different procurement paths. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=1002.8s)]
*  There was another example actually recently where we had an electronic warfare solution and we heard that the Army was going to go out and do a request for proposal on something that was really similar with the same long requirements document that we had. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=1011.6999999999999s)]
*  We said, can you just paint this brown and throw it on a Humvee? [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=1026.6s)]
*  And that's exactly what they did. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=1029.8999999999999s)]
*  They did it in three months for 300 K and then that went to scaled fielding. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=1031.5s)]
*  And so these things are happening. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=1035.8000000000002s)]
*  It's just a matter of like, can you make the best thing the normal thing? [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=1037.7s)]
*  And Justin said it's treating treating the value as the actual goal. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=1041.1000000000001s)]
*  So everyone everyone has heard this PM's love off of this this concept of cost cost schedule and performance, right? [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=1045.4s)]
*  They want to make sure they hit their timelines at the cost that they were given and performance to me is like, hey, it meets my war fighting needs. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=1053.1000000000001s)]
*  But performance is actually what's written in this requirements document, which they might not have actually had any hand in doing or a soldier might not have had any actual hand in informing. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=1060.3s)]
*  What we are trying to do is flip that and say, no, your value is your value and time to delivery is your actual need. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=1069.6s)]
*  Now everyone has permission to do the right thing. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=1075.2s)]
*  So as you think about venture funding all the way up through series X, Y, or Z, where a lot of the companies that work with actually still live in those spaces, they need to have a front door. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=1077.6s)]
*  But what we're doing in the Army is is going, hey, if you're ready, let's go to the field right now. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=1088.3s)]
*  And I say this a little bit pro-heely. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=1093.8s)]
*  The Army is the service that can do that because you can move around the edges of some of your ships. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=1096.8999999999999s)]
*  The Air Force can move around the edges of some of the aircraft. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=1102.3s)]
*  The capital assets. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=1104.5s)]
*  Those are are are fixed. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=1105.5s)]
*  What I have the luxury in the Army is like we can modify our organizations. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=1107.3999999999999s)]
*  We can modify our kit. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=1110.6s)]
*  We can tailor it to mission. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=1112.1s)]
*  So that's what we've been doing with some of our brigades that have been in Europe and in the Pacific and frankly going in and out of the Middle East still. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=1113.5s)]
*  And this is an open invite for all of the founders and all of the companies. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=1119.7s)]
*  If you have things that work, we have a front door. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=1123.4s)]
*  We want to try to get you in here. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=1126.0s)]
*  We want you to be able to engage with Army Futures Command. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=1127.3000000000002s)]
*  We want you to be able to engage with our units directly because only the trigger, only the soldiers will actually be able to tell you, yes, this works at a time of crisis. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=1129.7s)]
*  So it's it's I'm super excited because I remember during the global war and terror we had quick reaction capabilities and as a customer I could go I need this right now and somebody would go cool. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=1138.3999999999999s)]
*  I will get you that and in 30 days I had kit in Afghanistan that was working for me which told me it was legal. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=1150.3s)]
*  It was moral ethical. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=1157.0s)]
*  We could do it, but we never actually went back and fixed the system under. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=1158.5s)]
*  We just sort of moved off to a side chain and like everything was a side quest like nothing. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=1162.8999999999999s)]
*  And then now we're saying hey, we got to fix to main storyline and everybody's like, oh, we don't know how to do that. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=1166.8s)]
*  This is a period about scaling what actually works. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=1172.1s)]
*  And so I'm excited about what Alex is doing that transforming in contact in execution is a big deal because it's tech informed. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=1175.2s)]
*  If you read origins of victory, they say it's not about who necessarily just has the best tech. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=1183.2s)]
*  It's how they're adapting to that tech and using that as advantage. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=1187.7s)]
*  And so the way that we're measuring outcomes is we're now using outcome driven metrics to figure out do you move the needle? [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=1191.7s)]
*  Not is this the best tech or how does this fit into our current operating model? [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=1198.7s)]
*  How does this transform us? [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=1204.8s)]
*  And so we are more open and listening to and working with and pulling through more of those horizon three capabilities than we were. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=1206.2s)]
*  But we need outcomes overmatch. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=1213.5s)]
*  We need it to kick the ass of whatever's there right now so we can show that difference. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=1215.9s)]
*  It's defensible and we can move off of the old and onto the new. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=1221.0s)]
*  You've mentioned overmatch a couple of times. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=1224.7s)]
*  Can you double click into that and share what exactly that means? [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=1226.2s)]
*  It's very hard to make a change for a 15 percent improvement unless it's something that you're doing a lot. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=1229.5s)]
*  We want to make the case that there are orders of magnitude leaps, right, like power law leaps. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=1235.1s)]
*  And so we have a thousand different identity management solutions. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=1241.3s)]
*  So we've said naval identity service is the enterprise system. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=1245.2s)]
*  That service is what's moving forward. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=1251.0s)]
*  That opens the door to repurposing some of that money, repurposing some of that attention to harder problems. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=1252.9s)]
*  And so to this point, like we are looking for A-B testing that shows that A is no longer a viable option and there's much more value from B. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=1259.6000000000001s)]
*  So I like Serana comes in and they said, head, we have tests. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=1272.2s)]
*  We use rescale. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=1275.9s)]
*  We use the cloud and we show that based on running this for a hundred thousand reps that would have taken ten years, we did it in high level compute. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=1276.9s)]
*  We can fast forward this and that is proven. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=1286.3s)]
*  It was proven on paper. We didn't have to put that into an exercise. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=1289.5s)]
*  We can now with a lot less risk reduction. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=1292.6000000000001s)]
*  But that is an easier A-B decision because they've translated it into our language, which is outcomes. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=1295.1000000000001s)]
*  I guess I'll give an army example. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=1301.6s)]
*  So we have this concept of mission command. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=1303.8999999999999s)]
*  I don't want to go into like army terms because it gives us this false sense of security like we're doing something unique. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=1305.5s)]
*  We had 17 programs a record in this this mission command enterprise and each one did sort of similar things in the fact that each one of them had a map. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=1312.1s)]
*  Humans like pixels were really good at seeing pixels. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=1321.1s)]
*  They make us happy. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=1323.6s)]
*  So we looked at maps where each one of those came with its own mapping server and its own way to do tiles. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=1324.6s)]
*  And it's a way to deliver the maps and it's a way to store the maps. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=1331.0s)]
*  And about 2015 16 everybody went hey this Google Earth thing is pretty legit. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=1334.6s)]
*  We should probably just try to use that. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=1340.5s)]
*  And it took five years for people to go. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=1343.0s)]
*  Oh we can just start sharing KMLs and KMZs with each other and start sharing it. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=1345.5s)]
*  Well by then you had really really good software companies that had said cool. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=1349.7s)]
*  We're going to give you these enterprise services. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=1355.7s)]
*  I don't care what map you use. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=1357.5s)]
*  I don't care who provides it. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=1358.9s)]
*  You just tell it you point us to it and we'll serve it to you. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=1360.1999999999998s)]
*  And all of us kind of went. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=1363.6s)]
*  Yeah I want that but we couldn't because we had 17 programs a record own with their own vestigial architecture and we had to do a bunch of architecture archaeology and we had a bunch of people who were protecting their rice bowls in terms of those programs. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=1366.3s)]
*  And it's it's only just now in 2025 are we actually trying to hack and slash and kill some of these systems to go. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=1379.8999999999999s)]
*  No if you want to look at the map just look at the map. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=1386.1s)]
*  If you've got some weird unique data like we do we do fires like we do artillery like all those unique things that are unique to us as a as a military. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=1389.7s)]
*  We'll figure out a way to get those on the map. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=1398.9s)]
*  But we the Department of Defense are certainly not in 2025 who is building the best maps. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=1400.7s)]
*  We're not building the best data platforms. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=1406.5s)]
*  We're not building the best API gateways. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=1408.1000000000001s)]
*  So let's not pretend it. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=1410.3s)]
*  Let's just get all those pieces together and collapse all of these other vestigial organs. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=1411.3s)]
*  It's been I cannot describe how excited I am because this is a real like we're doing it. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=1415.8999999999999s)]
*  We're doing it live and I love it. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=1420.7s)]
*  It's a leverage play. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=1423.3s)]
*  Yeah the reuse piece. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=1424.3s)]
*  We're even using some of what the Army's doing and vice versa. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=1425.3s)]
*  Go ahead. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=1427.7s)]
*  Well no it's interesting because I never thought about it from this angle but it's not unlike venture capital where you know we're making bets on companies like you know it's not about you know can this company move the needle by 10x because to your point you know there there's this switching cost. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=1428.1s)]
*  So we're investing in 100x solutions. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=1443.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=1445.7s)]
*  And then you all need to be able to validate that this new solution is going to provide 100x outcome and you also need to be able to sort of replace and sunset capabilities as well. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=1445.8999999999999s)]
*  So it sounds like the we're not our organizations are not that dissimilar. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=1456.7s)]
*  They're not. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=1460.3s)]
*  And what I appreciate is I as I've learned what venture looks at and how you grade and how you assess risk is you do not expect every company to be good at everything. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=1460.7s)]
*  And that is a failure that we as a Department of Defense and really in anybody who's done federal acquisition sort of falls into the trap of where if you came up and you won a program I expect you to deliver every part of that top to bottom even the stuff you're not good at. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=1470.7s)]
*  Well what that does is it creates an amalgamation of things that people aren't good at and and you can actually multiply those tolerances across lots of systems until you get something that looks like oh there's a lot of not good stuff here. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=1486.5s)]
*  Well what we're trying to do now is just figure out how do I put on a Lego person like how do you find the right Lego pieces and how do you put them together so that if if if Justin Corp is really really good at serving data. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=1499.3s)]
*  I get him serving data. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=1513.8s)]
*  Layla Corp is really really good at UI. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=1515.3s)]
*  You're doing UI. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=1517.6000000000001s)]
*  I don't make you do the things you're not good at because frankly your engineers are hyper focused and excited on doing the things you're good at and I can I can put all these things together. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=1518.5s)]
*  And that's what we expect in our everyday lives there. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=1527.3999999999999s)]
*  It is shocking to me how much stuff we buy for soldiers that no one would accept if I handed to you in your everyday life and that is a mindset that we are changing and I love the secretary is on board the chief is on board all of these senior leaders within the army are just really going. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=1530.6s)]
*  Hey common sense like what's the value and what's the opportunity cost of making really dumb decisions and how do we stop doing that. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=1544.8999999999999s)]
*  Yeah and one of the unlocks there is like they're acknowledging the secretary of defense is acknowledging that the software defined warfare is here. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=1550.8999999999999s)]
*  And if you can use one component that is higher performing than others should we have a fully different artificial intelligence stack for Edge compute for sensor integration. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=1558.8s)]
*  Then we do it with no leverage as an enterprise use case no of course not right like what does the governance look like versus what does the compute look like we need economies of scale and so we're working together more with our vendor partners and even like signaling to some of the investors to say here is our hard problem. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=1571.8s)]
*  But can we land the plane on buying them can we land the plane in sustainable cost whether it's in a program executive office or not everyone has to should have to sing for their dinner every year but the idea of bringing those breakthroughs in and then again zamboni in out the legacy capabilities so we can unplug them for the first time in a long time these work together within the valley of death like this is actually happening within our budget cycle. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=1593.1s)]
*  If we do it well it sounds like you guys are really trying to break down a lot of these silos with the program offices there are 75 of them there are all these different programs and you all are thinking about how can we find some of these horizontal capabilities that are relevant. [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=1623.1999999999998s)]
*  Not just within the Navy or the army but across the services to be able to find economies of scale for your organizations and that also make it easier for startups to partner with you all and scale with you is that am I hearing that right. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=1639.6999999999998s)]
*  Yes and one of the things that I've been really big on is we need the enterprise to do enterprise things and get us out of the business of doing things that are common to all in the intelligence community. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=1652.4s)]
*  We had this concept of services of common concern and what that means is it is something that everyone should be able to use therefore don't let every individual agency or organization do it themselves. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=1665.5s)]
*  That's just it's a sort of a common sense on the face of it thing however. [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=1676.7s)]
*  In the the combat side of the department we've had a really hard time adopting I'll give a couple examples so so the the CDAO and DIU and some of these other organizations have said hey we're going to pull capabilities up and deliver it in a common way for everyone. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=1683.3s)]
*  That's great for things that are common so that when Justin and I go back to our offices if we need to share data we can do it in a common way for things that are unique to me. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=1696.7s)]
*  Are you unique to him or unique to the Air Force or unique to the to the to the Space Force or the Coast Guard Marines whoever if it's really really really unique like can only be done by them and should only be done by them that's where we want to focus on because that's the niche. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=1706.0s)]
*  But I will keep keep hampering on this there's option for startups and small companies and all of that because some of the. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=1721.1s)]
*  I I pounds here was an incutile investment like we found them as a very small company and now it's driving a lot of the way we do warfare so even those big companies will go I'm not good at this but that company that really small company they're really good at that I want them on my team. [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=1730.7s)]
*  We want to unlock all of that and we want to enable it and I'm I'm trying not to be super super technical just because this is not a technology problem. [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=1746.4s)]
*  This is a culture and a process problem that we can apply technology to I had a chance last week to sit with. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=1756.0s)]
*  All of the big LLM providers and I I loved the conversation because they were ruthlessly honest with with me and with each other. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=1763.2s)]
*  In that hey all of these things are available whether it's llama or clawed or chat GPT or even deep see they're all available what makes them what makes them unique and good and competitive there is the unique data sets that their customers have. [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=1771.8s)]
*  And the unique ways that they're going to use them that's us like that's my job to be able to go hey here's the unique mission for my soldiers and here's how we're going to do that. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=1786.9s)]
*  Startups can't solve a fundamental deficiency in us not being able to describe our problems but they can help us identify where those problems are this is why it's really important to be close to the war fighter if you are. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=1795.2s)]
*  A startup CEO don't hire sales people before you understand the ecosystem move to San Diego or get close like spend nine months near the group that you are trying to positively enable and empower to do their job ten or a hundred times better than they are right now so that proximity piece is real. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=1807.8s)]
*  For unique or specific problems and then more often than not there is some aspect that should be evaluated as dual use from a shared services perspective. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=1828.6s)]
*  Alex already said it we're doing more common. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=1839.1999999999998s)]
*  And similar than dissimilar from industry in some cases were just like. [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=1843.1s)]
*  Not making the tough decisions to scale what's working fast enough and so if we have more shared services at the department level like how can we do autonomy together as services how can we make sure that that is well integrated from the ground up and we're not like looking at this as an integration problem because we made separate decisions three years later. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=1850.0s)]
*  From an artificial intelligence perspective right now we're leveraging an air force and army and navy solution can we single up for common enterprise problems in one place and other places can we have narrow models where we share and all of them feed into some of the more unique problems like. [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=1872.0s)]
*  Command and control and so we're starting to architect in that way and make decisions based on what's available not based on what we've done now one kind of an older comment you made was like we have some things in common with VC. [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=1890.1s)]
*  Sure from a funnel perspective that would be the ideal state one of the tricky parts for us because we are such a big organization is finding people who think that way and and fanning the flames and empowering them and so we there every organization has latent risk takers even if they're conditioned to not take risk. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=1906.5s)]
*  I mean the acquisition community teaches us that lowering risk reducing risk is the goal so essentially like playing not to lose that's doesn't really keep pace with in a lot of cases in many many cases with the current trajectory of technological advancement and so we have found. [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=1928.3s)]
*  Unleashed people mavericks who are willing to work against their self interest to bring breakthrough capabilities through I want to double click another just a little bit. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=1949.8999999999999s)]
*  We could I know Justin I could sit here and talk like really deep tech all day long and we can go into the nuts and bolts we will it don't. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=1958.6s)]
*  The there's two things the silos and they just sort of put something in my brain I want everyone who listens or see this to understand we haven't missed the signal like the department hasn't missed a signal in 1968 something fundamentally changed the way that we do buying in the government. [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=1967.8s)]
*  And it has not stopped changing since then in 1968 there was a program put directly in the United States budget and it was the minimum three program that was the first time that a program by name was put into the budget that we had to spend money against. [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=1986.1s)]
*  Before that there were just these big pots of money like the army had vehicles and ammunition and soldiers and all of the money was just a do what you need to do to run the army a portfolio a portfolio yeah absolutely. [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=2000.3s)]
*  And then and then in 1968 being a minute man threes in there and I get it from a national security perspective you want to make sure that money goes into a long term project and you want to make sure that is successful because. [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=2015.0s)]
*  We were the only people who are going to do that we the government with the only people who are going to do that now today the army is only 21% of the defense budget. [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=2024.2s)]
*  We are everywhere we the army are everywhere and again this is going to sound a little parochial but we're on the border where the global response force where the immediate response force where the homeland defense brigade we're in Haiti. [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=2035.0s)]
*  We're in Africa weren't sent Tom we're in Paycom we are everywhere 21% of the budget and less than 50% of that do we have any flexibility to spend. [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=2045.8999999999999s)]
*  To change our spending even less than that there are thousands of budget line items that are directed to us in the national defense authorization act everywhere that tell us exactly how we're going to spend that money. [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=2055.3s)]
*  So is just we're talking about earlier that three year spin cycle what that really means for us is we have to predict the future three to five years out hope for the best and then work in the year of execution to move money around the edges to try to do advanced technology. [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=2067.3s)]
*  Otherwise what happens is. [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=2082.7000000000003s)]
*  We give money to our labs and they try to do the right thing and they try to pull advanced technology and and they try to like land this transition this magical transition where it goes from from you know something that works in a lab to something that works in the field. [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=2084.8s)]
*  In one in one go and we know that that's not real because technology evolved so fast where you could go from something that is a concept to someone writing it up and doing it in software space in days to weeks. [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=2099.6s)]
*  In our entire system the entire way we think is predict the future three to five years out land the perfect shot get a trick shot and go and it just doesn't work it does not work. [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=2111.4s)]
*  This is all the more reason that if someone does have a capability that is so much better than what we have in the field right now like we have. [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=2122.4s)]
*  Stocked up the pipeline but those actual the data and the stories associated with that we want it to be undeniably good so that we can then make the case. [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=2132.9s)]
*  People come to me and they say isn't the zero touch AI better than how you're doing unified endpoints right now yes of course it is but I am trying to and we are trying to make the case that this will save us money we need a little bit of capex so that we can get the op X right. [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=2145.4s)]
*  But the total cost of ownership and the impact of this from a mission perspective is best for those who are protecting us right here are ways that we can lower the tail on ineffective things but we have to like just aim at the exact solution that we have even if it's a manual process. [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=2162.4s)]
*  And if we can find several things we can find enough room until all the workarounds are turn into scale solutions that Alex is talking about we can still pull that through but if you can make the aid of be not close blow it away that's what we want to see and so we use world class alignment metrics to show how a divestment is possible through a game changing investment and that's a really big change we want that to be. [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=2181.4s)]
*  90% of the portfolio like I just really a big percent of the like it's there each is right we still talk about the IU is like less than 1% of the budget like these innovation activities are still very small so it is a good signal that we're doing them. [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=2208.4s)]
*  The impact of scaling what's working. [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=2223.4s)]
*  Again once in a lifetime opportunity and imagine how much more secure that our country and the world would be if we were making the exact kind of ruthless highest impact decisions across the board. [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=2228.4s)]
*  So I want to double click into the culture piece that is that door locked to protect. [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=2244.4s)]
*  The world I'm in venture capital we're in the business of risk we're all in on risk and that's how we think about the world obviously with the Pentagon. [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=2251.4s)]
*  That's different you all are making a lot of strides to change that but I'd love your perspective on like how do we get closer together between Silicon Valley in Washington and kind of get that risk appetite up a little bit. [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=2260.4s)]
*  We're assessing risk on different things and it's in at a necessity it's I'm using big we there's there's a lot of folks in the department who actually understand venture whether or not they came from that or they've just been working with the venture ecosystem for a long time and I mentioned in Utah earlier that's like that's a really good very public facing example. [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=2273.4s)]
*  In details ratio is 25 outside dollars for every federal dollar spent and then dual you use kind of takes care of the rest of that and so this is one example where like we've proven this model what we have to work through and and Justin said it really elegantly earlier. [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=2292.4s)]
*  The people who take risk they their job and I'm don't want to disparage anybody because they are hardworking Americans trying to do the right thing their job is to minimize the risk to the government and the way that they measure risk is the potential for waste fraud or abuse of dollars. [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=2309.4s)]
*  So what they're trying to say is hey if I give you a dollar do I get a dollar of value out of it that's a good metric. [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=2325.4s)]
*  What they don't do is if I give you a dollar and I take 10 years to spend that dollar is it still worth a dollar so what we're trying to do is figure out. [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=2332.4s)]
*  Hey I'd rather lose a dollar right now I'd rather try it on a company and they go I just didn't work out then spend that 10 years because that that is also super valuable time that we could be trying to figure out what those what all of the players in startup landscape and all of the players in the venture landscape and frankly all the because once you sell your first product you're not a stockholder. [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=2342.4s)]
*  So if you're a startup your business and all the businesses that are available how do they get us the best war winning capabilities right now and I know it maybe it sounds cheesy but I mean it the risk calculus we were not comparing the same things and what would help is of those venture folks talk to our leadership continuing to engage because we're going to we're going to work up they need to work laterally to go hey the way you measure risk is fundamentally incoherent with where technology is going. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=2362.4s)]
*  If a quarterback was measured on not making mistakes versus throwing touchdowns or winning games the performances would be a 100% different right and so if your goal is to hedge against anything happening then you're fighting against inflation as opposed to against disruptive technology. [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=2389.4s)]
*  And so we used to have something called cost is an independent variable we make anything an acronym so cave and so this was to say like how do you back in and make sure that you're spending the budget and then optimizing for that if we had speed as an independent variable save and we measured based on outcomes then. [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=2410.4s)]
*  Then I think that looks pretty different like that looks more like executing and so people are doing that right and so when we when we say hey unleashed folks what do you have they're not bringing 20% better capability they're saying hey we're doing cross domain solution right now through a bunch of different program offices the army's doing that as a service. [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=2433.4s)]
*  Can we jump on cross domain even if it'll affect or make some people that created something in house upset yes for the sailor for the marine yes and but hold on and I want you to tell your story I just want people to understand who's listening how ridiculous this is because cross domain as a service is an API for binary XML between two networks that's all we're talking about now there's there's national security implications but that is a solved problem. [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=2456.4s)]
*  And now we are fighting over we want to keep solved problems solved right get higher up the stack in general I think it's academically interesting to resolve the same problem that's for school and so we have marine innovation unit that is a way to keep really talented Marines in the reserves who have venture jobs as their full time job we're using them to scout technologies we have folks. [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=2486.4s)]
*  Over in in Europe right now so like working with some of the startup founders to say hey here is a breakthrough what would scaling this look like well it would mess up our program of record plan that's not what we're optimizing for we have contracting officers sometimes say well I want to do fewer contracts well I want to win so and so then there are really good contracting officers who get that and and you know short of like changing the way that we. [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=2512.4s)]
*  Kind of fuel incentives with measuring how much better 25 times better like get after it folks are in different organizations that K curve fuels us and it actually gives us more leverage to do more of this and so ultimately send your success stories if you are doing this really well and you're already in you've made it because we want to double down on this flywheel of this can happen we don't want to successes on this. [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=2540.4s)]
*  We want to overwhelm the system with how much better it can be if you're not ready when the window of opportunity opens sometimes you're waiting a really long time and so we put cape our mobile virtual network operator company startup in Guam and then we needed them so like hey the pilot was ready for actual use here places where if we are out. [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=2570.4s)]
*  Hands on testing with the best stuff and we have an opportunity to scale in a significant way much shorter than any of these timelines you hear about whenever you read about the government very optimistic this is really excited it feels like we're in the lightning in the bottle moment where there's a lot about to happen I'd love to just get your quick take on. [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=2594.4s)]
*  The future the year ahead what you both are most excited about I'm excited about the idea of like we don't have to prove that these things work anymore so if we scale. [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=2614.4s)]
*  Half of what's working well right now I mean the the software acquisition pathways we have gotten more permission like significant permission to do the right thing now how many people do it and like what does that look like and what wins do we get out of that and so ultimately the. [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=2625.4s)]
*  The I am excited about participating in the race to have the best technology solutions and the companies that are offering the best breakthroughs to be fielded into. [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=2643.4s)]
*  To that operations and maintenance pot and getting that to the production to our warfighters hands sooner so I'm excited about the best chance I've ever seen in the next 6 to 12 months to get capability that wasn't under government contract into full scale production. [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=2657.4s)]
*  Hell yeah. [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=2676.4s)]
*  I'm actually really excited about a lot of things this year we are going to put the consortium for the army's next generation command and control into. [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=2679.4s)]
*  Into its program phase so right now it's been in software pathways army futures command has been piloting this we have a consortium and I keep using that term deliberately of just. [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=2689.4s)]
*  Great companies who are going here's what technology can bear and I was in the I was at the National Training Center out in the middle of the Mojave Desert last week and I crawled into an M1A1 M1A2 set V3 tank the coolest you know 8 year old Alex was very excited because I was in a tank. [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=2699.4s)]
*  But that tank commander who's wearing the same socks I was wearing Alex was running this unfortunate son all day long but I was sitting there with that tank that tank commander and he showed me because we have taken a 20 year old tablet that's mounted in that Abrams that's really hard to move and we've given him everything on his tack device which is an Android app on an Android phone and now he can command and control his his tank company. [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=2717.4s)]
*  So we're going to take that next generation command and control into you know get that on contract and start moving forward and get that fielded to one of our divisions this year in Europe we're doing this thing called project fly trap I welcome anybody to come come try it it's countering unmanned system so we are learning from. [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=2741.4s)]
*  Ukraine and what's happening over there and we're actually going to with fifth quarter with UCF we're actually going to work on how we we scale up adding non conventional sensors non conditional compute how do we do automation so that if you were driving and it doesn't matter what part of the world you're in if you're an American war fighter and there is a drone threat there is a bunch of automated decision mechanisms that are just going hey I sent something in the electromagnetic spectrum spectrum I hear something in acoustics here's what you need to do and you you don't have to do it. [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=2757.4s)]
*  You don't have to worry about it in the IED fight they taught us something when you're going to take to combat readiness they said you know down out up you have to look down to make sure you're not stepping in IED you have to look out to make sure you're not going to walk into an IED you have to look up to make sure that you're not getting shot at. [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=2787.4s)]
*  Now like people have to look and make sure that they they aren't seeing you know drones flying and I want to automate that we are going to put together a consortium for autonomy so we're going to take a lot of the vehicles that the army has and think about what does an autonomous formation look like how does that. [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=2802.4s)]
*  How does that pair with people so that and this is you know true the US Army should never trade blood for blood in first contract and it should always be blood for an iron and it should always be their blood and we have to make sure that we can actually get the autonomy pieces together and it's not one company it's not Miller Corp that's going to solve autonomy it's how do we get the right tool chain in place from SIM all the way through VNV and then how do we get the right actions in the right libraries and how do we get ourselves off of this sort of archaic microcontroller based autonomy kick. [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=2817.4s)]
*  I mean that's just off the top of my head those are three technology three things we're going to do is just mass on the problems all the policy blockers that have stopped us. [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=2847.4s)]
*  Like I said it's a with our shields are on it type of phase we're going to body block our way through this to do the right thing because just just we can't not do it. [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=2857.4s)]
*  I wanted to ask you guys a couple lightning questions I could talk to you guys all day. [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=2866.4s)]
*  Okay very quickly red flag green flag what do you love startups doing what do they need to stop doing when they come talk to you. [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=2870.4s)]
*  Red flag I would say at this point don't work with bad requirements these long requirements documents there are enough capability needs statements out through software acquisition pathways and commercial solution offerings don't bang your head against the wall find top level requirement or something easier to work with and people who get outcomes. [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=2880.4s)]
*  Green flag keep building the product that you started on the path to build you have your north star and then work with us to figure out how to do you know roof shots as you're on your way to your moonshot rather than trying to tailor it to us the D.O.D. [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=2900.4s)]
*  Like we are going to be a better customer I wholeheartedly believe that but if you had a vision like go after your vision and then get it in the hands of our war fighters to help tailor it. [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNSXYD4nnw0&t=2915.4s)]
