# Crypto Experts Explain Stablecoins & the Future Financial System w/ Ali Yahya & Arianna Simpson
**The a16z Podcast:** [July 09, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ)
*  Crypto can help decentralize the power structures that are emerging in AI. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=0.0s)]
*  Chris always talks about like, do you want to be the indie band or do you want to play like [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=4.88s)]
*  the Super Bowl or the Mega Stadium? And I think like stablecoins really have the ability to appeal [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=8.4s)]
*  to like a much broader audience. So there's something like 16 trillion dollars in volume [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=14.0s)]
*  on stablecoins per year. I actually think it's a great time for folks to be building token networks. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=19.12s)]
*  Crypto is like a fundamentally radical set of technologies that is very, very hard for [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=24.96s)]
*  incumbent players to adopt and run with, precisely because it is so fundamentally [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=31.92s)]
*  disruptive to the way that they do things. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=37.120000000000005s)]
*  Ali, Ariana, welcome to the podcast. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=48.8s)]
*  Thank you. Great to be here. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=50.8s)]
*  So I'm excited to do a deep dive with you on where we're at right now today in the space. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=52.4s)]
*  So crypto is a space where people have long been excited about the vision and the potential, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=57.519999999999996s)]
*  and people have long also been skeptical about where are the use cases, what's happening, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=63.28s)]
*  what's actually working. So here we are in May 2025. Why don't you give some context on [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=67.68s)]
*  what's actually worked so far or what's working right now? Maybe Ali, why don't you start off? [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=74.24s)]
*  Sure, happy to. So actually, it's quite interesting because if you go back all the way [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=77.6s)]
*  to 2009 when the original Bitcoin white paper was published, the first line, or it was one of the [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=81.92s)]
*  first few lines of the paper, describes Bitcoin as a peer-to-peer electronic cash system, a payment [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=88.96000000000001s)]
*  system, which was kind of the original vision behind what a blockchain could do. And it's really [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=94.24000000000001s)]
*  taken us like 15, 16 years to get to a point where the technology is mature enough to actually make [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=99.52000000000001s)]
*  that a reality. And this is now manifesting with stable coins. So some of the big issues that Bitcoin [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=106.24s)]
*  had that made it impossible for Bitcoin to become that peer-to-peer electronic payment system is that [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=112.88s)]
*  one, it was extremely inefficient and very slow, and it still is. And therefore, it's become more [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=118.72s)]
*  of a store of value type of system as opposed to stable coins. And two, Bitcoin is not a stable unit [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=123.36s)]
*  of account. And so it's very hard to use it for payments. And so since then, one of the big things [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=129.76s)]
*  that has happened is that the infrastructure has matured tremendously to the point at which now we [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=134.72s)]
*  are at a level where a transaction of any amount of money can be done for less than a penny in cost, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=138.88s)]
*  and it can be done in under a second, roughly. Those numbers are kind of approximate, which [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=146.72s)]
*  finally makes something like a peer-to-peer transaction of a few dollars viable on the [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=153.44s)]
*  blockchain. And that combined with the kind of the regulatory clarity that we're having now as of [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=158.56s)]
*  the new administration makes stable coins something that are really beginning to happen. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=164.56s)]
*  So that's maybe like the biggest thing that's going on in the crypto world at the moment is that [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=169.52s)]
*  stable coins are beginning to really gain traction. So there's something like 16 trillion dollars in [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=175.04s)]
*  volume on stable coins per year. And there are many traditional financial institutions that are [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=179.84s)]
*  beginning to use stable coins to rip out a lot of the kind of the backend of their financial [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=187.2s)]
*  systems. And these are like fintech companies, think Stripe, think Revolut, think Robinhood. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=192.8s)]
*  Some of the companies in the traditional financial system that rely heavily on the [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=197.04000000000002s)]
*  trad financial system are now realizing that stable coins are a much better way to do things. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=201.12s)]
*  So that's kind of like the biggest thing that's going on. And we believe that that will likely [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=206.4s)]
*  lead to this cascading sort of trend of adoption, because once stable coins become a more kind of [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=210.16000000000003s)]
*  mainstay of the way that the financial system works, that opens the door for a lot of the other [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=218.16s)]
*  more advanced and futuristic ideas that crypto has introduced like DeFi to begin to also gain adoption. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=223.76s)]
*  And I think that that as a result will lead to kind of all the other things that we believe [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=230.4s)]
*  crypto can offer to really start to ramp up. One interesting thing though is that stable coins, [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=235.76s)]
*  at least us who are in the industry full time have been thinking about for like years and years, [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=241.92s)]
*  because I remember talking about them in like 2017, 2018. And I think there was always kind of [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=246.08s)]
*  a narrative about them being useful for remittances or in countries that have had hyperinflation. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=250.56s)]
*  And for those countries, Bitcoin is a better store value than their native currencies, [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=256.48s)]
*  because sometimes it goes up, unlike those which only go down. But it's not ideal, because again, [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=260.56s)]
*  as Ellie mentioned, it's not a stable unit of account. And so it's interesting to see that, [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=264.96000000000004s)]
*  even though this has been talked about for years, now it's sort of really having its moment. And I [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=270.0s)]
*  think to Ellie's point, a big part of why that's happening is because the infrastructure has [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=274.8s)]
*  evolved to a point where you can now efficiently move money, and you're not having to spend, [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=279.68s)]
*  you know, a huge amount of money to move the money, among other things. So I think that's why [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=284.64s)]
*  we're sort of starting to really see it shine now. I would also add that it's sort of intersecting [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=289.84000000000003s)]
*  in interesting ways. We're still super early in this, but there's obviously a lot of talk about [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=296.24s)]
*  AI and agents. And if you want to dispatch your agent to go transact on your behalf, [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=300.8s)]
*  you can't really give them your bank account or your credit card, but instead you can give them [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=306.72s)]
*  your crypto wallet. And so kind of this interplay of agents, you know, buying or spending money on [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=311.2s)]
*  behalf of their users with stable coins is a really interesting theme that we're sort of starting to [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=316.48s)]
*  explore. To that point, it's kind of ridiculous to think about the way that the financial system [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=321.68s)]
*  works today, where even a normal sort of local, like domestic financial transaction, where you go [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=327.28s)]
*  to like a coffee shop and you buy a coffee with a credit card, that transaction involves like the [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=333.76s)]
*  point of sale, the payment processor, the issuing bank, the acquiring bank, the credit card network, [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=339.03999999999996s)]
*  and each of these intermediaries takes some cut, some like some fee on the transaction to add up [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=344.4s)]
*  to something like multiple percentage points on the transaction. And that is the case in a domestic [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=350.47999999999996s)]
*  transaction. And if the transaction happens to be international, then that entire stack of [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=355.76s)]
*  participants and intermediaries gets duplicated and mirrored on the other side to the point that [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=360.4s)]
*  that kind of any kind of financial transaction across borders is kind of insane in terms of [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=365.44s)]
*  its inefficiency. It can take up to like three to seven days to move money from one country to [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=369.84s)]
*  another, and it can cost like up to 10% of the transaction to do it. So when you have a technology [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=375.2s)]
*  that can now again move an arbitrary amount of money from anywhere in the world to any other [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=380.0s)]
*  place in the world for under a penny and under a second, that truly is very transformative. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=384.64s)]
*  And it'll be very kind of disruptive to the way that find the financial system works. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=389.68s)]
*  So to Oriana's point about AI agents, it's kind of inconceivable that then a human may want to [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=393.68s)]
*  participate in the financial system would have to kind of go through all of that inefficiency and [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=399.12s)]
*  deal with all of these arcane human intermediaries, some of which are not even really automated. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=403.76s)]
*  That's inconceivable. And the only real way to bring online millions or potentially billions or [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=409.44s)]
*  more AI agents into the kind of the financial system is through a technology that's fully based [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=415.44s)]
*  on software in as efficient as like the crypto, kind of the crypto rails that are now available [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=421.12s)]
*  and now can be used. So say more about some of the use cases that stable coins are currently [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=427.04s)]
*  enabling. Is it mostly on institutional level? Is it on a consumer level? Or where's sort of the [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=432.24s)]
*  common interactions people are having with the system right now? [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=437.44s)]
*  I think it's both. It depends sort of what markets you're talking about. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=439.91999999999996s)]
*  There's a company in our current accelerator batch called Zarpei, which is [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=443.28s)]
*  operating in Pakistan. And they're basically creating a network of small, you know, the little [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=447.76s)]
*  shops if you've been to Africa or wherever they have these little sort of mobile kiosks where you [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=454.15999999999997s)]
*  can put money on your phone and that sort of stuff. And so they're basically using that network in [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=458.96s)]
*  order to create a way for people to come in and deposit their local currency and get stable [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=464.48s)]
*  coins. And then they're building a whole suite of like financial services around this kind of as the [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=469.76s)]
*  atomic unit. And I think a lot of countries that have, you know, unstable currencies or other [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=474.96000000000004s)]
*  financial issues for which holding dollars or the equivalent of dollars and stable coins is very [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=480.96000000000004s)]
*  appealing immediately understand the value of this and are very attracted to using it. So I think, [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=485.68s)]
*  you know, it goes from that all the way through to banks and financial institutions. I think in [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=492.96s)]
*  many cases there's been an interest in crypto and some of the banks and financial institutions [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=498.4s)]
*  have wanted to get involved, but it's been very unclear how they could do it largely as a result [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=503.2s)]
*  of the lack of regulatory clarity, but also because, you know, crypto can be a little scary [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=510.15999999999997s)]
*  or whatever. And so it hasn't always been obvious for them to see a path. How do we get involved? [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=514.24s)]
*  What's the way that we can, you know, bring this to our consumers? And so stable coins, I think, [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=521.4399999999999s)]
*  are kind of like a baby step in the sense that it's a lot more clear what the value proposition is. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=525.36s)]
*  It's a non-speculative use case. And so I think it's just a good entry point for some of these [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=534.3199999999999s)]
*  larger institutions. Ali, why don't you give a brief overview or help us understand better sort [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=540.7199999999999s)]
*  of the stable coin landscape around like what big companies or types of companies have emerged or [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=545.52s)]
*  will emerge as a result of it or what it means for how it impacts the crypto startup ecosystem [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=550.4s)]
*  more broadly? Right now, at the center of all of the action are the stable coin issuers. So we've [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=555.1999999999999s)]
*  got two of the major ones right now are USDC, which is created by this consortium between [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=561.68s)]
*  Coinbase and Circle. And then there's Tether. And so both of these are like the kind of the [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=568.48s)]
*  biggest two issuers of stable coins today. Then, of course, like both of these stable coins operate [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=573.6s)]
*  on top of blockchains. So another important piece of the stack is the infrastructure on top of which [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=581.36s)]
*  some of these stable coins operate on. And then you have like this kind of sort of a collection [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=587.2s)]
*  of companies at the periphery that are generally just companies that help connect the crypto world [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=593.36s)]
*  to the external world. And that would include wallets, it would include like some of the kind of [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=599.2s)]
*  fintech companies that are using blockchain technology as the backend, but have a front end [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=603.84s)]
*  that looks more like a web two type of front end and doesn't expose the crypto aspects to the end [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=608.5600000000001s)]
*  user as much. And all those players will be a part of the story as well. So one of the things that [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=615.12s)]
*  we talk a ton about is like, what will this stack look like end to end as the space evolves? [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=620.6400000000001s)]
*  And one of the exciting things that we are hoping will happen soon is it will have we'll get [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=628.32s)]
*  legislation that sets the rules of the road for stable coins and for what is required for an [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=632.96s)]
*  issuer to create a stable coin, what kind of collateral is needed for the stable coin to be [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=641.28s)]
*  compliant. We strongly believe it will likely happen this year. It will, to some extent, [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=645.52s)]
*  commoditize the issuance layer because it will be easier for new issuers to emerge and create [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=652.4s)]
*  their own stable coins that are also USD denominated to the point that those new stable coins are [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=657.76s)]
*  somewhat fungible and interchangeable with USDC and with Tether. Because if all of them are compliant, [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=665.6s)]
*  then you kind of can trust that all of them are likely to be ultimately redeemable for a dollar [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=672.0799999999999s)]
*  and they're equally trustworthy, which means that then the issuers may no longer be the ones [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=677.2s)]
*  that capture all the value the way that they do now. And instead, a lot of the value might be [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=683.5200000000001s)]
*  captured by some of the other layers. Like for example, the infrastructure is likely to capture [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=688.24s)]
*  a lot of the value because a lot of the activity, a lot of these sort of transactions, stable coin [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=693.5200000000001s)]
*  transactions that are happening, happen on blockchains like Solana, Ethereum, Zouyi, [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=697.6800000000001s)]
*  a number of other kind of important layer one blockchains. And all of those require payment [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=703.0400000000001s)]
*  of gas for all of those transactions. So those blockchains are likely to be important players [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=709.44s)]
*  in kind of like the way that this unfolds. And then I think the other, like that's on one another [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=715.6s)]
*  stack and then the other end will be kind of the end point, like the user, the interface that [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=720.96s)]
*  connects this whole crypto world to the end users or wallets will be likely important. One of our [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=726.88s)]
*  portfolio companies, Phantom, likely be built well positioned as a gateway or an interface for [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=732.4s)]
*  people to interact with stable coins and get kind of exposure to US dollars, regardless of where [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=737.92s)]
*  they may be. So that's maybe a bit of a layout for what the ecosystem looks like at the moment. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=743.1999999999999s)]
*  It seems like for yours has been this question of, hey, what's going to make it so that there's [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=748.9599999999999s)]
*  hundreds of millions of users? I'm not sure what it is at the moment across all of crypto or a [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=752.56s)]
*  billion users. They asked before that, kind of what's the iPhone moment? What's sort of the [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=757.44s)]
*  product that everyone's going to be using that's also a platform for everything? Is it stable coins [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=762.32s)]
*  or is it something else? How do we think about that? I mean, I think the odds are good that [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=765.2800000000001s)]
*  stable coins are that thing. I also don't think that necessarily there needs to be one thing. I [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=770.24s)]
*  think, you know, we mentioned AI, Ali has made some investments in that category. We've done some as a [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=776.4000000000001s)]
*  team. I think like, you know, there's going to be different waves that bring in different users. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=783.2s)]
*  A while ago, Web3Games was a big entry point. Now it's AI and stable points. So I think, you know, [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=789.76s)]
*  the users do come in waves. I think there's a lot of it that sort of tracks the cycles that, you [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=796.1600000000001s)]
*  know, we see every couple of years in crypto. You know, Chris always talks about like, do you want [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=802.08s)]
*  to be the indie band or do you want to play like the Super Bowl or the mega stadium? And I think [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=805.5200000000001s)]
*  stable coins really have the ability to appeal to like a much broader audience because, [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=811.36s)]
*  like we said, it's just a use case that makes sense. It's pretty clear what the value proposition is. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=815.6s)]
*  And so it appeals to a broader audience. Yeah, in part also because it addresses a very real [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=821.44s)]
*  pain point, whether it be for people in third world countries that want exposure to the dollar [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=826.72s)]
*  because their local currency may not be as reliable, or people who want to move money [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=833.92s)]
*  between borders. And we talked about how that can be extremely inefficient, or even companies [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=838.32s)]
*  that want to move money across borders. They still have to deal with all the inefficiency and [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=842.88s)]
*  stable coins are actually like apparently companies like SpaceX are already using stable coins for [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=847.84s)]
*  treasury management to move money from one country to another in a way that's much more efficient [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=853.2800000000001s)]
*  than using the traditional national risk. Yeah, I believe they were using Bridge, which Stripe now [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=858.8000000000001s)]
*  acquired. Yeah, I mean, it's interesting. Stripe Sessions, you know, their big conference was like [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=862.24s)]
*  all about stable coins, like so many of the talk tracks last week were about that. And so I think [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=866.72s)]
*  it's really indicative of the fact that this is kind of permeating not just crypto companies, but [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=871.6s)]
*  out more broadly. And I think obviously the other necessary element in addition to the infrastructure [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=876.0s)]
*  improvements and all that is just the fact that now we have a more friendly regulatory regime, [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=880.5600000000001s)]
*  which is interested in seeing these kinds of things flourish. One thing I've always appreciated [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=884.72s)]
*  about crypto investing is you guys as domain experts don't just need to understand the [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=888.24s)]
*  technology, which is complex enough in itself, but you also need to understand [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=893.04s)]
*  sort of the policy regime, law, monetary policy, economics, foreign policy, and how all these things [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=897.52s)]
*  are sort of intersecting with crypto startups. Well, I mean, I'm certainly not the domain expert [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=904.8s)]
*  on some of the policy stuff, but we've really assembled a super strong team who has been kind of [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=909.92s)]
*  very involved in DC and trying to kind of push the ball forward for the whole industry. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=914.48s)]
*  You mentioned Stripe getting deeply involved in crypto. Isn't it because people often contrast [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=918.8s)]
*  it with AI and say, Hey, AI is mostly sustaining innovation. And that of course, there's massive [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=922.72s)]
*  companies that have been sort of formed, but a lot of the gains have gone to the biggest companies. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=926.96s)]
*  Whereas crypto is mostly a startup, though some companies are getting some bigger companies are [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=932.64s)]
*  getting involved too. Another, it's funny, like maybe Facebook was just a few years too early with [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=937.36s)]
*  if they launched Libra and a more friendly regime, might that have worked? How do you think about sort [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=942.1600000000001s)]
*  of the startup versus incumbent distinction in this space? Yeah, crypto is like a fundamentally [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=946.24s)]
*  radical set of technologies that is very, very hard for incumbent players to adopt and run with, [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=953.2s)]
*  precisely because it is so fundamentally disruptive to the way that they do things. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=960.88s)]
*  I was at Google a while back, I was at Google X working on a robotics project, but I was already [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=966.48s)]
*  very interested in crypto. And Google X is supposed to be like the moonshot factory, [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=971.36s)]
*  and it's supposed to be super innovative and open to new ideas, open to start new companies, [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=975.52s)]
*  but they don't want new ideas. I tried, I tried to get Google X to... [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=979.92s)]
*  I tried at Facebook, by the way, same thing. And it's like Google would not touch crypto [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=983.12s)]
*  with a thousand foot pole, unless it was like a very, very kind of vanilla, like we will like [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=988.0s)]
*  run some like node or whatever. Are they like, this makes no sense? Or were they like it's evil? [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=992.4799999999999s)]
*  I think yeah, they kind of fundamentally didn't get it. They were afraid about the optics, [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=996.9599999999999s)]
*  they were afraid about the regulatory dissociation with it, the reputational consequences. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=1000.64s)]
*  Also like the whole web three vision, the vision of decentralizing web services, which is I think [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=1006.64s)]
*  the kind of the most futuristic vision for crypto is fundamentally disruptive to the way that these [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=1014.0s)]
*  companies work. These are centralized companies that make money and have power precisely by virtue [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=1019.04s)]
*  of being so centralized. And if you build something like a social network that is fully [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=1025.6s)]
*  decentralized and has no core central company, like no monopolistic tech giant that's worth $44 [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=1031.44s)]
*  billion that controls what recommendation algorithm is used and who gets to follow whom and [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=1037.1200000000001s)]
*  all of the data and the social graph itself, then that company no longer has a business model. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=1043.8400000000001s)]
*  Right. It's like, it's a very, very different business model to build a social network that's [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=1050.4s)]
*  decentralized in the way that's a, like a company like Farcaster currently is. And so for a company [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=1054.8s)]
*  like say Facebook or Google in its own way to decentralize itself and to truly embrace [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=1060.64s)]
*  crypto with arms wide open, it would have to kind of cannibalize its own business model. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=1067.2s)]
*  And I think that's actually becoming true for AI as well. I think that it was very, very true that [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=1072.0s)]
*  AI was a very sustaining innovation before, but it's gotten so powerful that there are many elements [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=1076.72s)]
*  of it that are disruptive. Like if Google wanted to re-embrace AI, it would have to replace search [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=1083.0400000000002s)]
*  with an AI, with an LLM instead of having its current model. And of course that's a hard thing [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=1090.24s)]
*  for it to do given that's kind of the insanely profitable business model that they currently [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=1094.8799999999999s)]
*  have. Yeah. Yeah. Is that still the vision that we'll have decentralized social networks, [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=1099.92s)]
*  decentralized marketplace, or kind of where are we on that vision and what are the bottlenecks to [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=1104.32s)]
*  that vision being realized? Sort of, you know, networks at scale that are truly decentralized [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=1108.6399999999999s)]
*  and competing with some of the centralized ones. Is it technological or is it that people just [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=1113.68s)]
*  don't really care about sort of this in the same way or like, why hasn't it happened yet? [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=1116.96s)]
*  I think it's mostly a consumer preference issue. I do think like now some of the products have [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=1121.2s)]
*  gotten really good, like Farcast for example, the product experience is very good, but it's just [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=1128.56s)]
*  challenging to get people to switch because, you know, the reason you're on the social network is [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=1133.44s)]
*  for the graph. And so it's difficult to kind of export an entire graph. I think like users are [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=1139.44s)]
*  kind of accustomed to being the product. Like, you know, if you're not paying for the product, [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=1147.1200000000001s)]
*  you are the product. And I think in many cases, consumers are kind of used to that experience. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=1153.68s)]
*  And, you know, ads are annoying, but they're not necessarily that bad. And so people just kind of [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=1158.0s)]
*  accept it and don't think too much about it. And by the way, this is interesting because if you [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=1165.04s)]
*  look at like all of the big social networks, none of them have been started in the last decade. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=1168.96s)]
*  And that's not true just of crypto, it's true in general. And so it's just very difficult, [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=1175.8400000000001s)]
*  I think, to kind of get over this hurdle of like reaching a critical mass whereby people actually [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=1180.88s)]
*  say, oh, I'm in the network and I'm going to stay in the network. So it's not just a crypto thing. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=1186.48s)]
*  I think it's just difficult nowadays. People only have so much attention and, you know, [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=1191.1200000000001s)]
*  with the networks that there are, most of the attention span has already been captured. So I [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=1196.16s)]
*  think we may need to see some of the existing ones falter before there's like enough room for [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=1201.3600000000001s)]
*  some new ones to really take hold. We'll see. Yeah, we used to believe that these ideas and [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=1206.96s)]
*  these companies would be the first to get adoption. And that was largely because all of the financial [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=1214.16s)]
*  use cases like the DeFi use cases, even like the stablecoin use cases were illegal. Yeah, [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=1219.68s)]
*  as was the case in the previous administration. And so it felt to us like the more kind of innocuous [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=1225.44s)]
*  seeming social network use cases, gaming use cases would more likely gain adoption. And then [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=1230.0s)]
*  that will be the gateway for other things to eventually become legitimate and maybe it's [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=1235.28s)]
*  very good acceptance from a regulatory standpoint. But now that the regulatory landscape has shifted [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=1239.8400000000001s)]
*  so much to the point at which it's now a much more friendly landscape. And as a result, we have like [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=1245.28s)]
*  all these traditional financial institutions getting involved and stablecoins are really [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=1250.0800000000002s)]
*  having a moment combined with the kind of the infrastructure clicking into place is now much [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=1254.0s)]
*  more clear that the kind of the more financial use cases are likely to happen first. Those will act [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=1258.48s)]
*  as a legitimizing force for the rest of the space. And then the consumer use cases, which we still [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=1263.2s)]
*  believe in, will take longer. And I think as around is saying, it's very, very hard to get [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=1267.2s)]
*  those things right. Like the bar that a consumer has on the quality of a consumer facing application [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=1271.6000000000001s)]
*  is extremely high. And scripto has not yet figured out all of the UX challenges and like the kind of [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=1278.32s)]
*  the seamlessness and usability challenges of crypto are still, it's still a nascent technology [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=1284.0s)]
*  on that front. So it'll take longer for all of those things to get resolved. But in the meantime, [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=1289.12s)]
*  we have all these other financial use cases, which I think will kind of solidify the technology will [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=1293.84s)]
*  legitimize the space for a broader group of people will get more entrepreneurs to come into the space. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=1299.36s)]
*  But yeah, I think on the point of the attention span or lack thereof of consumers, it's interesting [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=1304.56s)]
*  when you see kind of a new network created around an area that doesn't already have somebody [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=1309.4399999999998s)]
*  in the non web three world occupying it. So for example, I think a good example of this is [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=1315.1999999999998s)]
*  Blackbird, which is kind of a network for restaurant lovers. And you can think about it as AmEx points [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=1320.8799999999999s)]
*  for for restaurants and they're, you know, occupying a space that nobody really owns it [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=1328.0s)]
*  right now, like the credit card companies kind of do, but it's still sort of a so so experience at [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=1334.08s)]
*  best. And when you have a great entrepreneur who is really deep in restaurant tech, like Ben [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=1340.32s)]
*  Leventhal, who's the founder, tackling a problem like that, bringing a kind of consumer web two [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=1345.28s)]
*  experience, but using web three, therefore, allowing the restaurants and the consumers to [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=1352.6399999999999s)]
*  actually have ownership in this network, which wouldn't be possible in a web two context, [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=1358.1599999999999s)]
*  then it's pretty interesting because that's something that, you know, you couldn't really [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=1362.08s)]
*  give the same ownership. And if you look at some of the platforms like Uber Eats or DoorDash, [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=1365.6s)]
*  the restaurants kind of have to work with them because their margins are so slim. And so they [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=1370.32s)]
*  kind of need as much volume as they can basically. But it's not great because the platforms are in [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=1373.6s)]
*  many cases quite extractive and deep, dig deeper into the margins of the restaurants. And so [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=1380.24s)]
*  if you are using stable coin payments to bring down transaction costs, and you're also giving [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=1387.52s)]
*  restaurants actual ownership in the network, therefore, you know, helping their bottom line [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=1392.64s)]
*  in that way, too, it's really interesting. Ali, let's go a bit deeper on sort of AI and the [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=1397.84s)]
*  intersection between AI and crypto. What's what's working there? Where are you most excited? [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=1403.52s)]
*  Peter Thiel actually had the this tongue in cheek line back in 2018, which I think [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=1408.88s)]
*  rings true, which is that AI is communist and crypto is libertarian, which I think is actually [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=1415.8400000000001s)]
*  like the kind of the meta point is that these two technologies are very different from one another. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=1422.24s)]
*  And in many ways, they're actually counterweights for each other. So there are many ways in which [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=1428.64s)]
*  they're intersecting, we can talk we can talk through a few of them. Yeah, I think one of the [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=1434.0s)]
*  most important ways is, is that AI is creating a kind of overabundance of media, and of human [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=1438.96s)]
*  looking entities, agents that can pretend to be human, or deep fakes of video or audio that that [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=1447.04s)]
*  seems very human. And it's hard, it's hard to know whether you're looking at something that's real or [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=1455.52s)]
*  something that's purely generated. And crypto happens to be a really good technology to to help [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=1460.3999999999999s)]
*  authenticate media or help authenticate data in general. One of the ways in which these two worlds [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=1465.84s)]
*  will collide is that there are crypto projects that are working on among many other things, [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=1472.08s)]
*  proof of humanity, which would allow someone anyone and a user on the internet to, to prove [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=1478.0s)]
*  that they actually are human so that anyone on the other end can, can know that they're interacting [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=1484.96s)]
*  with a human and not with a with an AI bot or an AI agent. Worldcoin is one of these companies is [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=1490.08s)]
*  one of our portfolio companies, and they built an orb that uses biometric information and also uses [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=1495.36s)]
*  zero knowledge proofs to keep all of the biometric data private. In fact, like the data itself never [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=1499.84s)]
*  leaves the orb, and only a code or a cryptographic object that is derived from the biometric data [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=1504.8799999999999s)]
*  ever leaves the the orb and from that cryptographic object that is not possible [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=1512.6399999999999s)]
*  to and for anything about the biometric data itself. And it's a technology that allows anyone [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=1516.72s)]
*  to to prove their humanity on the internet. There was that famous line in the 90s that on the internet [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=1523.04s)]
*  nobody knows you're a dog. And that is very, very true now in in 2025, where like on the internet [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=1528.24s)]
*  nobody knows you, you're human. Like you could be, it could be anything. You could be a dog or a dog. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=1535.3600000000001s)]
*  So that's one way I think that that cryptography, blockchains will help kind of deal with the kind [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=1541.0400000000002s)]
*  of the immensity and of abundance of of signal and noise that AI will will generate. Another big one [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=1550.4s)]
*  is that crypto can help decentralize the power structures that are emerging in AI. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=1558.72s)]
*  At the moment it seems like there will be a small number of very, very powerful players in the AI world. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=1565.44s)]
*  It's looking like even though it's unclear as to whether there are things like network effects that [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=1573.92s)]
*  drive defensibility, there are just a handful of really powerful players in the space, at least at [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=1578.24s)]
*  the kind of the model layer like OpenAI and the other kind of big companies that build foundation [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=1583.68s)]
*  models. Crypto offers an alternative for creating AI systems that's more decentralized. So an example [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=1589.76s)]
*  of this is a company called Jensen, which is also in our portfolio that builds a kind of marketplace [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=1597.04s)]
*  for compute. So someone on one side of the marketplace can provide their idle GPU capacity [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=1602.5600000000002s)]
*  to the network and then someone on the other side who might want to use the GPU compute for training [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=1610.0s)]
*  a model or for doing inference on a model can through the network make use of all of that [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=1615.2s)]
*  compute. And the network manages all of these heterogeneous computational resources to create [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=1620.72s)]
*  something that feels like a unified cloud on which you can run all of these machine learning AI [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=1626.16s)]
*  workloads in a way that's fully decentralized, in a way that is not kind of controlled by a single [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=1632.4s)]
*  company, and in a way that could actually be more efficient than a cloud by virtue of using [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=1636.88s)]
*  capacity that otherwise would just go idle and unused. It's just capacity that's locked away in [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=1644.0s)]
*  all of these like pockets that are far removed and not in one particular data center. There are many [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=1649.04s)]
*  hard technical challenges to get there, but there are a lot of smart people working toward [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=1655.52s)]
*  figuring that out and we're kind of very optimistic that that will also happen. It'll also allow for [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=1660.24s)]
*  machine learning workloads to run in a way that is also verifiable. So this way you don't have to [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=1667.68s)]
*  trust a centralized company like say like Facebook or like one of the kind of social media companies [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=1672.72s)]
*  that the machine learning model, that the AI model that they're running for say like the [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=1680.48s)]
*  recommendation algorithm is unbiased or has particular properties. You can actually, [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=1685.68s)]
*  with cryptography, verify that those things are the case and that these things are executed in a [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=1693.92s)]
*  way that's correct. You can use some of these decentralized systems for that as well. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=1699.04s)]
*  And then maybe the final one, which I think is the most futuristic and the most challenging, [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=1704.1599999999999s)]
*  is having crypto help AI figure out the new business models for the internet. So one of the [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=1708.32s)]
*  issues that AI will create with the current business models of the internet is that right now [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=1715.12s)]
*  the way that the internet works is that you have an aggregator like a search engine driving traffic [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=1722.32s)]
*  to creators of media like say someone who has written a blog post or someone who has [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=1729.2s)]
*  like a page that has content and there's ads as like the business model that mediates that [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=1734.48s)]
*  whole interaction and that entire business model goes away if you just have an AI that just gives [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=1741.84s)]
*  you the answer that you're looking for. So instead of doing search on Google, getting exposed to a [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=1748.56s)]
*  bunch of ads and then clicking through to a website and having all of those parties kind of [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=1753.2s)]
*  be happy because the business model includes all of them, now instead of that you just interact [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=1757.84s)]
*  with an LLM and you get the answer immediately and you never click through to the final page and you [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=1764.1599999999999s)]
*  never get exposed to an ad. That kind of completely changes the way that the internet works and we're [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=1769.28s)]
*  going to need new business models for the internet if that's the case. So one idea is that you could [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=1774.8s)]
*  you could through there are a lot of these research efforts to try to figure out [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=1781.2s)]
*  attribution in the training of a machine learning model for what pieces of data contributed to a [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=1788.72s)]
*  particular output. So you're asking an LLM a question you kind of want to know what pieces of data [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=1795.44s)]
*  that were used to train that LLM contributed to the answer that the LLM ultimately gives you when [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=1803.92s)]
*  you ask it a question. And if you could know that then you could come up with a business model that [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=1810.08s)]
*  rewards the people who contributed that data originally and crypto could be part of that. [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=1814.32s)]
*  So there are open problems on both sides that you have to figure out this attribution challenge [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=1818.8799999999999s)]
*  in the AI world and there are people working on on that problem and then there's a challenge [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=1822.6399999999999s)]
*  on the crypto side like how do you build a network that can using that information compensate all of [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=1827.4399999999998s)]
*  the parties involved in having the AI actually give you what you ultimately want. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=1834.56s)]
*  Fascinating. Are the big labs interested in crypto? Do they need to be interested in crypto [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=1840.08s)]
*  for this to happen or is this largely coming from startups? You know it's funny Sam Almond of course [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=1844.96s)]
*  OpenAI but also WorldCoin so he has some familiarity but what can you say about this? [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=1849.1999999999998s)]
*  For the most part I don't think so. I think for the most part the AI labs they're just running [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=1853.52s)]
*  with AI and there's so much that's exciting in that world that I think crypto is not doesn't [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=1856.96s)]
*  really factor actor in at all but there are crypto companies that are very interested in AI and are [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=1860.8799999999999s)]
*  thinking about the ways in which crypto will ultimately make a difference in that world. [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=1866.96s)]
*  So like this company I mentioned Jensen actually the founders are very very deep in AI they have [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=1871.8400000000001s)]
*  an AI background but they also happen to have like a deep commitment to building things and [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=1876.8s)]
*  has open source networks that that are ultimately decentralized and so they are of the few people [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=1882.4s)]
*  who really do straddle both worlds. Zooming out a little bit what are some of the biggest [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=1888.64s)]
*  misconceptions people you think people have about the space right now maybe Aran is starting with you? [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=1894.96s)]
*  Well I mean I think for the last few years it's been really challenging to launch a token network [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=1899.04s)]
*  in the United States in particular because there was a lack of clear legislation and then there [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=1904.08s)]
*  were very aggressive folks in several agencies you know working on basically not allowing [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=1912.8s)]
*  entrepreneurs to launch networks and that applied to entrepreneurs who were very well [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=1921.44s)]
*  meaning and very much wanted to do things by the books and so I think one of the the challenges [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=1926.8s)]
*  was that people obviously didn't want to end up in legal trouble and therefore in many cases kind [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=1932.16s)]
*  of pulled back their plans on that front which really impeded their progress on the product side [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=1936.72s)]
*  as well so they couldn't really build their vision because I think tokens are part and parcel of [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=1942.3200000000002s)]
*  what's valuable and interesting about crypto and so if you remove that piece it doesn't make any sense. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=1949.04s)]
*  So the thing that's a misconception perhaps is that the situation is very different now you know [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=1954.3999999999999s)]
*  we have a much friendlier administration in place we have a very different situation in terms of the [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=1960.24s)]
*  leadership of these agencies now and so I actually think it's a great time for folks to be building [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=1967.2s)]
*  token networks and I think that message hasn't necessarily fully made it out there so I'm hopeful [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=1973.6s)]
*  that you know more entrepreneurs kind of realize that the situation is again very different from [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=1980.3999999999999s)]
*  what it was just a few months ago and start to kind of come back in in force. Yeah I completely [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=1984.72s)]
*  agree with that I think another big one is outside of like our immediate circles like if you go [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=1991.52s)]
*  outside of the world of tech it's shocking to me that people continue to think of crypto as just [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=1998.48s)]
*  like a thing that's supposed to be money only or they think of a blockchain as a kind of ledger [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=2004.0s)]
*  for money and I think that that misconception comes from bitcoin from bitcoin trying to be money and [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=2011.6799999999998s)]
*  only money and not really trying to be anything else and the fact that [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=2019.28s)]
*  like this misconception is that like ethereum is like bitcoin and ethereum is actually the [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=2023.76s)]
*  silver to bitcoin's gold and that all that crypto really is it's just another kind of attempt to [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=2029.12s)]
*  doing what bitcoin did the fact that that ethereum actually is a fundamentally different thing [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=2034.56s)]
*  then bitcoin is is still not widely understood the fact that ethereum is actually a kind of computer [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=2040.48s)]
*  where you can build all sorts of different applications where the software that runs on [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=2046.32s)]
*  top of the computer has unique properties that no other software has ever had is is I think not [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=2051.12s)]
*  widely understood and these are programs that like the programs that run on a blockchain like [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=2059.3599999999997s)]
*  ethereum are programs that have a life of their own they are programs that can make commitments [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=2063.68s)]
*  that no one has to trust anyone to believe in it's essentially free from interference from anyone [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=2071.52s)]
*  including the people who originally wrote the program and so that's a very unique property that [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=2077.36s)]
*  no other kind of software has it's a it's a kind of technology that inverts the power relationship [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=2082.56s)]
*  between the software and the hardware whereas historically the hardware has always had power [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=2087.84s)]
*  over the software because whomever controls the hardware can turn off the software or change it [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=2092.6400000000003s)]
*  in some way whereas in crypto with blockchains the hardware is a commodity these are people who run [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=2097.76s)]
*  like the miners for example or validators in the blockchain context don't have any power [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=2104.64s)]
*  over the software that runs on top and that's what makes a blockchain unique and that's what [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=2109.44s)]
*  makes it capable of doing so much more than than just money you can you can kind of build [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=2113.68s)]
*  them far more sophisticated primitives so stable coins are the first thing but the things that come [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=2119.7599999999998s)]
*  after things like defy where you can build much more sophisticated financial primitives on chain [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=2124.0s)]
*  or some of these other more futuristic ideas where you can do ai you can do deep in you can do [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=2130.88s)]
*  some of these sort of consumer facing applications like decentralized social networks [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=2137.52s)]
*  all of that relies on the properties of a blockchain computer that's not just a ledger [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=2142.4s)]
*  it's a full-on computer on which you can build applications that i think is not something that [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=2147.84s)]
*  most people really get maybe ali can you give a bit of an update and kind of the [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=2152.6400000000003s)]
*  smart contract platform wars as a outsider or someone who's paid attention you know at certain [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=2156.96s)]
*  times and not at certain times what i've sort of heard or gleaned is hey bitcoin as you mentioned [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=2161.76s)]
*  has been as tried to be money but there's a little bit of a nascent bitcoin builder movement i'm not [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=2166.16s)]
*  sure if they've really um if that's led to something particularly meaningful in the space [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=2170.4s)]
*  and then my understanding is that ethereum has tried to sort of optimize across multiple [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=2175.04s)]
*  dimensions both trying to be money but also trying to be sort of the the base layer for [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=2179.2s)]
*  sort of decentralized internet and committed to decentralization in a way that some people think [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=2184.32s)]
*  is at the sacrifice of of usability when whereas solana has not had the same commitments to [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=2188.48s)]
*  decentralization is really optimized for usability one is that a fair characterization how would you [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=2194.0s)]
*  edit the characterization and two how is this all played out or where are we right now on that well [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=2198.4s)]
*  there's actually a really good characterization i think uh the way that i would i would break [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=2202.96s)]
*  things down is that there there is a very large and multi-dimensional trade-off space and it's [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=2208.32s)]
*  very hard for any one system to cover the entire space so it makes sense that you'd end up with [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=2213.84s)]
*  different systems specialize with different things and and then as a result having different use [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=2219.76s)]
*  cases in different value propositions so bitcoin i think has been extremely successful at becoming [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=2223.92s)]
*  like a kind of digital gold it's been extremely volatile but but i think that there is this [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=2229.28s)]
*  belief there's a there's a memetic value that bitcoin um is long term a pretty good [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=2233.52s)]
*  store of value that will that will be around for a very very long time it's not going anywhere and [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=2241.52s)]
*  and will have properties that are that are desirable that that are not provided by other things like [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=2246.96s)]
*  fiat or or like a gold itself or anything it's funny it's only been around for less than 20 years [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=2252.32s)]
*  but in my head i sort of treat it as gold it's like going to be there forever and exactly exactly so [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=2257.44s)]
*  it's really succeeded at that and and i think some of the things that has helped it succeeded that is [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=2262.4s)]
*  is the fact that it is so hard to change and the fact that it is so simple and you can't do that [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=2267.52s)]
*  much with it those things are disadvantages in some contexts but they're real advantages when [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=2270.8s)]
*  trying to solve for that particular thing then there are like all the other uh smart contract [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=2275.44s)]
*  platforms that are trying to do much more and are trying to be computers and ethereum lands in some [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=2280.48s)]
*  part of the trade-off space here where they do really optimize for decentralization and they are [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=2286.1600000000003s)]
*  fully decentralized and so it's it's a it's like a hard it's hard for ethereum to change quickly [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=2291.2000000000003s)]
*  because there are a lot of stakeholders and a lot of people who who want to be able to [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=2296.24s)]
*  influence its direction um so the choices that it has made have made it a pretty good platform for [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=2301.3599999999997s)]
*  some of the kind of the higher stakes like defi applications or for the issuance for example [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=2308.4799999999996s)]
*  issuance of new assets on ethereum that that might be the default simply because it's been around [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=2312.8799999999997s)]
*  the longest and its high amount of decentralization make it very suitable for that [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=2317.52s)]
*  and then there are blockchains like say solana and sui which are extremely high performance [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=2322.08s)]
*  they are very well suited for for transactions and for payments and for for things that do require [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=2326.3199999999997s)]
*  that that level of performance if you wanted to build something like like the nasdaq exchange on [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=2331.44s)]
*  chain there's no way you're doing that on the thermal one uh you you probably need a blockchain [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=2336.4s)]
*  that has the kind of the level of performance that a solana or a sui or some of the other kind of [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=2341.2799999999997s)]
*  more modern or more recent blockchains have so i think i expect that that uh that that each of [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=2347.04s)]
*  these ecosystems will likely find uh their niche um is obviously very uncertain and there's all this [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=2353.92s)]
*  talk about how maybe solana will kind of eat the theorems lunch and that's possibility but it's [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=2361.52s)]
*  still wide open is basically what you're saying yeah it's wide open and there's like a lot of [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=2367.3599999999997s)]
*  ways in which in which it can play out yeah so ariana with the double click on your point about [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=2370.64s)]
*  the misconception in terms of how the regime policy regime has changed if you look at the [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=2375.44s)]
*  novi libra you know it had seven different names so whichever one you want to use um that was [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=2380.2400000000002s)]
*  something that could have been incredibly interesting because you have um facebook now now [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=2385.28s)]
*  meta with such an enormous distribution network already has all the users um integrating payments [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=2391.04s)]
*  into that via crypto made all the sense in the world um but obviously they were told in no uncertain [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=2398.64s)]
*  terms that that was not something that they could proceed with and then unfortunately um [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=2404.72s)]
*  you know the whole project kind of died i will say it went on to um flourish and under other forms [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=2410.0s)]
*  because you know we're investors in uh missin and swede yeah they spun out of there so there have [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=2416.56s)]
*  been actually a number of great teams who came from there so i think the diaspora of talent has [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=2421.52s)]
*  continued to kind of fight the good fight and build but in general um you know that's another [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=2426.64s)]
*  project that i think sort of as it was initially conceived had to die on the vine because of that [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=2431.04s)]
*  so yeah you know it's it's i think as investors it's not necessarily our job to envision like [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=2436.32s)]
*  what is possible but rather to recognize it when we see it um and so i'm i'm personally very excited [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=2442.72s)]
*  to see what entrepreneurs come up with in um the next couple years now that we have kind of a new [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=2448.08s)]
*  opportunity space. [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biSwEL5eMQ&t=2453.2s)]
