# The 2025 AI Search Race
**The a16z Podcast:** [December 09, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv36kG4bR3w)
*  This is a massive, massive market, one of the largest out there. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv36kG4bR3w&t=0.0s)]
*  10% of consumers, they're now referring to ChatGBT as their search engine of choice. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv36kG4bR3w&t=3.6s)]
*  Perplexity queries are growing 25 to 30% month over month. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv36kG4bR3w&t=9.200000000000001s)]
*  My big idea is that the search monopoly, particularly around Google, is coming to an end. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv36kG4bR3w&t=17.400000000000002s)]
*  They control 90% of the market, but their grip is slipping. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv36kG4bR3w&t=23.7s)]
*  ChatGBT, Perplexity, all of these AI service providers, they're coming for them. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv36kG4bR3w&t=28.5s)]
*  There's a bit of an innovator's dilemma here for Google, and I'm excited to watch it play out. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv36kG4bR3w&t=34.0s)]
*  Maybe start by setting the stage. So how big is the search market today? [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv36kG4bR3w&t=38.6s)]
*  The search market is enormous. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv36kG4bR3w&t=42.6s)]
*  Anyone listening to this uses search. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv36kG4bR3w&t=44.8s)]
*  Virtually anyone with the internet uses search. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv36kG4bR3w&t=47.4s)]
*  But to put some numbers around it, Google that I just mentioned, they're the biggest game in town. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv36kG4bR3w&t=50.8s)]
*  They're approaching 200 billion of revenue annually. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv36kG4bR3w&t=55.400000000000006s)]
*  They're still growing double digits, highly profitable. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv36kG4bR3w&t=58.900000000000006s)]
*  Microsoft Bing, which has been the number two player for a long time, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv36kG4bR3w&t=62.6s)]
*  mid single digit market share, so pretty small. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv36kG4bR3w&t=66.2s)]
*  They have 12 billion of revenue. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv36kG4bR3w&t=69.4s)]
*  This is a massive, massive market, one of the largest out there. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv36kG4bR3w&t=71.9s)]
*  Totally. And it does feel like there are forces reshaping this industry. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv36kG4bR3w&t=75.30000000000001s)]
*  So tell me about those. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv36kG4bR3w&t=79.2s)]
*  So there's certainly AI, AI, AI. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv36kG4bR3w&t=80.60000000000001s)]
*  But before we jump into that, we can level set with the legal pressure that's mounting on Google. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv36kG4bR3w&t=83.2s)]
*  So earlier this year, Google was declared a monopoly. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv36kG4bR3w&t=89.10000000000001s)]
*  The court ruled that they're spending billions of dollars to phone manufacturers. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv36kG4bR3w&t=92.8s)]
*  In the case of Apple, tens of billions of dollars is monopolistic. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv36kG4bR3w&t=98.8s)]
*  It's anticompetitive and it's preventing their competitors from gaining share in the marketplace. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv36kG4bR3w&t=104.2s)]
*  They are the default search engine on all these phone manufacturers. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv36kG4bR3w&t=109.4s)]
*  And it basically makes it impossible for any of the others to gain share. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv36kG4bR3w&t=113.2s)]
*  So the exciting technological change, of course, is around AI. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv36kG4bR3w&t=117.80000000000001s)]
*  The gen AI search providers are fantastic. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv36kG4bR3w&t=122.4s)]
*  The market has been dominated by Google for close to 25 years at this point. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv36kG4bR3w&t=126.2s)]
*  And as a monopoly, they're not really innovating. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv36kG4bR3w&t=132.1s)]
*  They have no incentive to until now. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv36kG4bR3w&t=135.3s)]
*  If you think about the Google experience as it is today, it's just a long list of links. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv36kG4bR3w&t=138.6s)]
*  And the first few are sponsored. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv36kG4bR3w&t=144.79999999999998s)]
*  They're ads. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv36kG4bR3w&t=147.0s)]
*  And I as a user, when I make a query on Google, I then need to make the decision. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv36kG4bR3w&t=148.6s)]
*  I have to sift through the information on that site and find the answer that I'm looking for. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv36kG4bR3w&t=153.79999999999998s)]
*  That's actually a pretty long process. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv36kG4bR3w&t=158.4s)]
*  Instead, with gen AI, I can just get the answer. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv36kG4bR3w&t=160.79999999999998s)]
*  So on chat, GBT perplexity, Claude, or when I'm chatting with my AI friends on character AI or on PoE, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv36kG4bR3w&t=164.79999999999998s)]
*  I get an answer immediately. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv36kG4bR3w&t=172.1s)]
*  And that's just a much, much better experience. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv36kG4bR3w&t=173.89999999999998s)]
*  Totally. And I hear tons of people saying they're trying these new tools. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv36kG4bR3w&t=177.5s)]
*  But maybe you can give us a sense. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv36kG4bR3w&t=180.7s)]
*  Is this shift really stark? [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv36kG4bR3w&t=182.5s)]
*  Like are people really moving over? [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv36kG4bR3w&t=184.5s)]
*  People are definitely moving over. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv36kG4bR3w&t=186.29999999999998s)]
*  And I'd say there's four main reasons. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv36kG4bR3w&t=188.29999999999998s)]
*  One is the one we just talked about, the shift from links to answers. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv36kG4bR3w&t=190.6s)]
*  A second one would be how they are personalized, how the answers feel interactive, how they are conversational. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv36kG4bR3w&t=195.4s)]
*  The average query on one of these new services has a follow up question. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv36kG4bR3w&t=204.0s)]
*  So it's not just about that initial engagement. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv36kG4bR3w&t=209.2s)]
*  It's about the ongoing conversation. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv36kG4bR3w&t=212.5s)]
*  The third difference is about how these new services engage with complex queries. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv36kG4bR3w&t=215.6s)]
*  So the average query on perplexity is 10 to 11 words. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv36kG4bR3w&t=221.79999999999998s)]
*  The average search on Google is two to three keywords. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv36kG4bR3w&t=225.9s)]
*  As you can imagine, their ability to leverage that information and get you what you want is much higher. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv36kG4bR3w&t=229.5s)]
*  On Google, you're going to get a list of links. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv36kG4bR3w&t=236.0s)]
*  One of those links might have one side of the debate. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv36kG4bR3w&t=238.5s)]
*  Another link may have the other side. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv36kG4bR3w&t=241.4s)]
*  You may never make it to that second side. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv36kG4bR3w&t=243.4s)]
*  On perplexity, on ChatGBT, they're going to synthesize both sides. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv36kG4bR3w&t=245.70000000000002s)]
*  They're going to give me both perspectives. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv36kG4bR3w&t=249.4s)]
*  And then the fourth, they're just not cluttered with ads. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv36kG4bR3w&t=251.60000000000002s)]
*  That may change over time. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv36kG4bR3w&t=255.0s)]
*  Putting it all together, it should be no surprise that these AI native services are gaining share. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv36kG4bR3w&t=256.90000000000003s)]
*  For 10% of consumers, they're now referring to ChatGBT as their search engine of choice. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv36kG4bR3w&t=262.6s)]
*  Perplexity queries are growing 25 to 30% month over month. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv36kG4bR3w&t=268.5s)]
*  And I saw a survey last week that 60% of consumers for purchase decisions in the last 30 days used a chatbot. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv36kG4bR3w&t=274.1s)]
*  All of these services are growing massively. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv36kG4bR3w&t=282.4s)]
*  So if we look at some of the tools that exist today that are coming for that market share, [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv36kG4bR3w&t=286.0s)]
*  you take a perplexity or you take a ChatGBT, those are also broad-based search engines or chatbots. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv36kG4bR3w&t=290.0s)]
*  But there are these other players you mentioned, ConsenSys or Hebia, for example, that are verticalized. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv36kG4bR3w&t=296.5s)]
*  Does it surprise you that the last wave of search engines weren't verticalized? [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv36kG4bR3w&t=301.9s)]
*  It does not surprise me that the last wave or the next wave will result in a winner-take-most dynamic. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv36kG4bR3w&t=306.9s)]
*  It's a pretty monopolistic market. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv36kG4bR3w&t=315.6s)]
*  Search is very much a distribution game. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv36kG4bR3w&t=318.4s)]
*  Google has an incredible brand. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv36kG4bR3w&t=321.6s)]
*  They have incredible direct traffic. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv36kG4bR3w&t=323.3s)]
*  They are the default search engine on most browsers. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv36kG4bR3w&t=325.0s)]
*  They are the Kleenex, the bandaid of online search. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv36kG4bR3w&t=328.5s)]
*  It's important to note that search engines definitely benefit from network effects. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv36kG4bR3w&t=332.8s)]
*  More users coming to Google provides more data around preferences. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv36kG4bR3w&t=338.5s)]
*  For Google, that means the next search has more relevance and brings more users. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv36kG4bR3w&t=343.0s)]
*  It also means more users means more advertisers, more profit dollars that you can invest back in the service. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv36kG4bR3w&t=348.2s)]
*  Or into ensuring that Apple puts them as the default provider. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv36kG4bR3w&t=354.9s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv36kG4bR3w&t=359.79999999999995s)]
*  As we think about this next AI wave, it sounds like you think maybe a similar dynamic might be at play. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv36kG4bR3w&t=360.79999999999995s)]
*  Or how do you think about maybe these smaller players actually finding a wedge or differentiating? [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv36kG4bR3w&t=367.0s)]
*  One framework for thinking about how search could fragment or verticalize is just looking at why does vertical software beat horizontal software in some cases. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv36kG4bR3w&t=372.79999999999995s)]
*  And it's typically the vertical requires a specific user interface, proprietary data, features, workflows, compliance, etc. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv36kG4bR3w&t=383.6s)]
*  And that's why Viva in Life Sciences and Pharma can beat Salesforce in horizontal CRM. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv36kG4bR3w&t=394.3s)]
*  For the average query on ChatGBT, Perplexity or Google, they're pretty good. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv36kG4bR3w&t=402.3s)]
*  You don't need a vertical specific application. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv36kG4bR3w&t=408.3s)]
*  But for deep domain research, I can imagine a world in which standalone apps thrive. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv36kG4bR3w&t=412.4s)]
*  In the case of our portfolio company, Hebia, they have a unique interface. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv36kG4bR3w&t=420.0s)]
*  It kind of looks like a spreadsheet, which is native to financial services and their customers. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv36kG4bR3w&t=425.7s)]
*  It brings in public filings, earnings, transcripts, but also private data. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv36kG4bR3w&t=431.2s)]
*  It can bring in research. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv36kG4bR3w&t=436.59999999999997s)]
*  It can bring in survey results. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv36kG4bR3w&t=438.09999999999997s)]
*  You can query and then the output can also be specific to that industry. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv36kG4bR3w&t=440.1s)]
*  Not just look like a spreadsheet, but populate a meeting agenda so you can go in immediately prepared. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv36kG4bR3w&t=446.8s)]
*  And so when I think about vertical search or vertical apps, it's not just about the search. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv36kG4bR3w&t=453.0s)]
*  It's about everything around the search. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv36kG4bR3w&t=458.1s)]
*  That's a good distinction. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv36kG4bR3w&t=460.1s)]
*  And as we think about how this maybe continues the progression of this industry, if we go back to the last wave of search, [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv36kG4bR3w&t=461.4s)]
*  we did see a bunch of search engines kind of get traction to start maybe Alta Vista or Ask Jeeves. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv36kG4bR3w&t=468.5s)]
*  We all pick on Ask Jeeves. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv36kG4bR3w&t=473.4s)]
*  All the Gen Z'ers will not know what the hell any of that is. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv36kG4bR3w&t=475.2s)]
*  But they had some traction and then Google kind of exploded and took over. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv36kG4bR3w&t=479.7s)]
*  Do you expect that same kind of consolidation or is this time different? [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv36kG4bR3w&t=484.5s)]
*  I think consolidation should be expected in general purpose search because of distribution, because of network effects. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv36kG4bR3w&t=488.7s)]
*  Google won the last time around in part because of their PageRank algorithm. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv36kG4bR3w&t=497.1s)]
*  It produced superior results. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv36kG4bR3w&t=502.6s)]
*  It had a minimalist UI. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv36kG4bR3w&t=504.8s)]
*  It was really simple. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv36kG4bR3w&t=507.20000000000005s)]
*  Ask Jeeves, Alta Vista, they had tons of ads. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv36kG4bR3w&t=508.3s)]
*  It was cluttered links on the home page. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv36kG4bR3w&t=511.8s)]
*  No one wanted to use it. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv36kG4bR3w&t=514.8000000000001s)]
*  The irony is that today what we're all complaining about with Google is that their pages are cluttered with ads on the results [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv36kG4bR3w&t=516.4s)]
*  and that creates the opportunity for these new search engines. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv36kG4bR3w&t=523.1s)]
*  I would expect consolidation again. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv36kG4bR3w&t=527.1s)]
*  And I think something else that's interesting is what you're pointing at with some of these verticalized solutions [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv36kG4bR3w&t=529.5s)]
*  is that it's not just for the everyday consumer, but also, you know, for the lawyer or for the academic researcher. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv36kG4bR3w&t=535.3s)]
*  Do you think that is also part of the fragmentation? [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv36kG4bR3w&t=542.1s)]
*  Do you expect that to continue? [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv36kG4bR3w&t=544.8s)]
*  Search historically has been thought of as a consumer product and for good reason. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv36kG4bR3w&t=546.0s)]
*  I make a lot of searches that are related to my personal lives, but I use, as do all the professionals you named, search at work. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv36kG4bR3w&t=551.4s)]
*  I probably make more Google searches at work than I do around personal matters. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv36kG4bR3w&t=559.6999999999999s)]
*  But there is a category of enterprise search in a market that has existed. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv36kG4bR3w&t=565.1999999999999s)]
*  And you can think of that as querying box, Dropbox, Salesforce, all in one. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv36kG4bR3w&t=569.6999999999999s)]
*  But I think those two worlds are going to blend together. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv36kG4bR3w&t=575.9s)]
*  Consumer search should not just be limited to what's on the web and enterprise search should not be limited to just proprietary data. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv36kG4bR3w&t=579.0s)]
*  It should have both. And a lot of these AI native services are working on that. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv36kG4bR3w&t=586.7s)]
*  Yeah, that's a great point. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv36kG4bR3w&t=590.6s)]
*  And as we think about those two models maybe blending together, we think of consumer search for sure. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv36kG4bR3w&t=591.6s)]
*  It's always been an ad-based model, or at least today. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv36kG4bR3w&t=597.4s)]
*  Like Google is this massive economic engine, but no one's paying a subscription for that. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv36kG4bR3w&t=600.0s)]
*  The new entrants do seem to have a more subscription-based model. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv36kG4bR3w&t=605.1s)]
*  Is this a temporary thing or how do you see those two dynamics playing? [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv36kG4bR3w&t=609.1s)]
*  So the subscriptions could stick around, but I think this is going to continue to be a digital advertising-focused market. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv36kG4bR3w&t=613.0s)]
*  And I think digital advertising is going to grow because of these AI services. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv36kG4bR3w&t=619.6s)]
*  So these AI services today, they don't have ads. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv36kG4bR3w&t=624.4s)]
*  I imagine that's going to change. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv36kG4bR3w&t=627.1s)]
*  It's been in the news that Perplexity is already talking to advertisers. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv36kG4bR3w&t=629.0s)]
*  They have a high-income, highly educated user base that should be attractive to these advertisers. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv36kG4bR3w&t=633.6s)]
*  But as we discussed earlier, the queries on these services, they're longer. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv36kG4bR3w&t=641.4s)]
*  They're more complex. They're more detailed. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv36kG4bR3w&t=645.9s)]
*  They're more personalized. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv36kG4bR3w&t=648.0s)]
*  And because of that, there's greater intent, which should be more helpful to advertisers in producing the best results on their end and creating an even larger market. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv36kG4bR3w&t=650.0s)]
*  But in the meantime, these subscription business models, they make a lot of sense. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv36kG4bR3w&t=659.4s)]
*  They bootstrap the business. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv36kG4bR3w&t=663.6999999999999s)]
*  They cover costs. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv36kG4bR3w&t=664.9s)]
*  And from a personal perspective, I'm very happy to pay $20 a month for Chat, GBT, Perplexity, and PoE. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv36kG4bR3w&t=666.0s)]
*  I mean, they provide so much value. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv36kG4bR3w&t=672.8s)]
*  A lot more than $20 a month. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv36kG4bR3w&t=674.4s)]
*  Yes. Yes. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv36kG4bR3w&t=676.1s)]
*  So obviously, this was your 2025 big idea. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv36kG4bR3w&t=677.0s)]
*  And I know this is going to be a many-year, maybe even decade-long progression. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv36kG4bR3w&t=680.1s)]
*  But what are you paying attention to in the next year? [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv36kG4bR3w&t=684.0s)]
*  What opportunities are still on deck? [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv36kG4bR3w&t=686.1999999999999s)]
*  As I looked at 2025, Google it may be on decline, but I don't expect them to go down without a fight. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv36kG4bR3w&t=688.2s)]
*  Google and Meta, I think they can be big players. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv36kG4bR3w&t=695.9000000000001s)]
*  Google AI Overviews already has a billion monthly active users. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv36kG4bR3w&t=699.6s)]
*  Meta's not far behind. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv36kG4bR3w&t=704.6s)]
*  They have 500 million monthly active users. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv36kG4bR3w&t=706.0s)]
*  Again, this shows the power of distribution for search. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv36kG4bR3w&t=708.2s)]
*  And maybe to that end, Apple, if you could call them a dark horse, is a dark horse. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv36kG4bR3w&t=712.1s)]
*  They are not investing the CapEx like Meta and Google and Microsoft and Amazon. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv36kG4bR3w&t=717.8s)]
*  But they control a central node to the consumer. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv36kG4bR3w&t=724.1999999999999s)]
*  And if they wanted to build a search application, the next day they could have a billion users. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv36kG4bR3w&t=727.6999999999999s)]
