# Olivia Moore on Key Trends Powering App Stores
**The a16z Podcast:** [February 18, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCBKkb1pLEE)
*  What is interesting and always fun to see is sometimes there's these big acquisition moments that aren't at all orchestrated by the company but orchestrated by the user base and they're almost their own kind of special form of word of mouth but at like massive scale. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCBKkb1pLEE&t=0.0s)]
*  One of the top apps this year was called Talking Ben the Dog which is a kids educational science game where you're taking care of this fluffy dog and you can ask him questions about science and do experiments with him. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCBKkb1pLEE&t=19.0s)]
*  But it went viral after this YouTuber with 15 million subscribers, an adult YouTuber, started making videos of himself trying to debate really serious topics with Ben. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCBKkb1pLEE&t=33.0s)]
*  And then of course it turned into a meme and everyone else made their own videos about it and then the app was suddenly at number one again after being released years and years ago by an app studio who made it for a completely different use case than where it actually took off. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCBKkb1pLEE&t=45.0s)]
*  I know the users have a mind of their own. The other story I like was shared by your sister, which was this boating app right there was a girl whose father had created this boating app. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCBKkb1pLEE&t=61.0s)]
*  And then there's this clip of him at a conference where he's trying to get people to download the app and quite frankly it was really sad or it sparked that emotion and it just said something like, hey, please help my dad's boating app or something like that. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCBKkb1pLEE&t=72.0s)]
*  A really, really short video as you said on TikTok, which seems to be a place where people are getting these viral hits. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCBKkb1pLEE&t=87.0s)]
*  And I think it hit number seven or something in the app store, which maybe people are like, oh, number seven's not that high. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCBKkb1pLEE&t=94.0s)]
*  But again, you said to hit number one, all of these are social apps, general mass marketed apps, and they require 100,000 downloads. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCBKkb1pLEE&t=99.0s)]
*  So that's still a lot of downloads in a day. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCBKkb1pLEE&t=109.0s)]
*  A lot of downloads and it illustrates just the pure difficulty of getting to number one because her TikTok had more than 20 million views. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCBKkb1pLEE&t=112.0s)]
*  And then she made several follow up videos that also had hundreds of thousands, if not millions of views. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCBKkb1pLEE&t=121.0s)]
*  So if that can't even hit, you know, number one for the day, then it kind of just puts into context how much of a challenge it can be. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCBKkb1pLEE&t=126.0s)]
*  There have been some other apps which, as you said, did not hit number one, but still really hit some traction. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCBKkb1pLEE&t=134.0s)]
*  And I want to talk about the different categories outside of social that saw some movement in 2022. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCBKkb1pLEE&t=139.0s)]
*  So what were some of those categories that we saw outside of social? [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCBKkb1pLEE&t=146.0s)]
*  There were two or three kind of themes that to me dominated the apps at the top this year. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCBKkb1pLEE&t=149.0s)]
*  And two of them were actually what I see as tech shifts or tech progress that enable new consumer behavior. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCBKkb1pLEE&t=154.0s)]
*  So one big example of that is widgets. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCBKkb1pLEE&t=161.0s)]
*  We saw a couple of widget apps at the top at some point, mostly in summer 2022. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCBKkb1pLEE&t=164.0s)]
*  And these kind of exploded after Apple made a change to iOS 16 that allowed users to put widgets on their home screen of their phone and also on their lock screen of their phone. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCBKkb1pLEE&t=170.0s)]
*  So you didn't even have to unlock the phone and you could see what popped up on a widget. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCBKkb1pLEE&t=181.0s)]
*  So then there was a group of new companies, NoteIt, for example, is one where you could send little notes to your significant other or little drawings. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCBKkb1pLEE&t=184.0s)]
*  LockIt widget was probably the first one to explode in January and then was followed by LiveIn, Widgetable, a bunch of other apps that really capitalized on this kind of not a full platform shift, but kind of maybe an operating shift, a system shift by Apple that allowed for this. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCBKkb1pLEE&t=192.0s)]
*  Another big tech shift that became a trend in top apps was AI, of course. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCBKkb1pLEE&t=210.0s)]
*  Of course. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCBKkb1pLEE&t=216.0s)]
*  And that came as mostly in the fall when models like stable diffusion became available to fully build into mobile apps and create experiences where you didn't have to have your own AI model as a developer, but you could still allow people to kind of spin up beautiful art or avatars. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCBKkb1pLEE&t=217.0s)]
*  We saw those apps basically dominate the late Q3, early Q4 top charts. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCBKkb1pLEE&t=236.0s)]
*  And the last theme is actually not at all unique to 2022, in my opinion, but is kind of evergreen, which is anonymous social apps. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCBKkb1pLEE&t=241.0s)]
*  We see these pop up pretty consistently every year. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCBKkb1pLEE&t=251.0s)]
*  When I was a teenager, it was like Honesty Box on Facebook and then Ask FM and FormSpring. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCBKkb1pLEE&t=254.0s)]
*  Gas app was, of course, probably the best example of this for 2022. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCBKkb1pLEE&t=261.0s)]
*  Nikita, the founder, just sold the Discord and he actually developed a very similar app back in 2016, 2017 that he sold to Facebook that also hit number one for a while. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCBKkb1pLEE&t=265.0s)]
*  So I think the big lesson there is like the FOMO poll, especially for teenagers of what are my friends saying about me is very, very hard to resist. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCBKkb1pLEE&t=277.0s)]
*  It's so true. And I can think of so many apps from when I was growing up that were really successful for a period of time. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCBKkb1pLEE&t=286.0s)]
*  And then you've seen iterations of them since. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCBKkb1pLEE&t=292.0s)]
*  And to your point, like Nikita literally just copied what worked before, what he sold to Facebook before and then repurposed it, created Gas and has now had another acquisition. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCBKkb1pLEE&t=294.0s)]
*  So, I mean, maybe this is a silly question, but is that worth doing as in if you're if there's a founder out there or potential founders, should they just be combing through previous successful apps like a Yik Yak, for example, and just creating the Yik Yak of 2023? [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCBKkb1pLEE&t=305.0s)]
*  Because we've seen how effective they can be and how also kind of evergreen they are because there's these like innate human emotions like Gas app to be complemented or be real to like to be understood. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCBKkb1pLEE&t=320.0s)]
*  Right. There's like these fundamental human emotions that don't change across generations. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCBKkb1pLEE&t=335.0s)]
*  I feel like a consistent debate in the tech world of like, who's going to build the first anonymous social app that has like true staying power and becomes a billion dollar company on its own. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCBKkb1pLEE&t=340.0s)]
*  There's already in 2023, a new app that just raised a seed round that hit number one in Germany. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCBKkb1pLEE&t=351.0s)]
*  It's called Sleigh, very similar to Gas app and TBH. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCBKkb1pLEE&t=358.0s)]
*  So another example of kind of that trend playing out. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCBKkb1pLEE&t=362.0s)]
*  I think there's I mean, and Nikita himself has said this, there's always going to be a question of these apps that are based around kind of anonymous networks. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCBKkb1pLEE&t=365.0s)]
*  Can you really build like a lasting social network because people aren't really storing relationships on the app. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCBKkb1pLEE&t=375.0s)]
*  They're not really communicating or direct messaging through the app. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCBKkb1pLEE&t=381.0s)]
*  So they get very popular, very, very fast. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCBKkb1pLEE&t=385.0s)]
*  If there's no maybe act two of the app, like if there's no what's next, then they can also kind of decline very, very fast as that core dense group of people that joined unravels a little bit more and moves on to the next thing. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCBKkb1pLEE&t=388.0s)]
*  I also wonder we've talked already about this phenomena where it seems like people are cycling through apps more quickly. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCBKkb1pLEE&t=402.0s)]
*  And if that really is an underlying foundational trend, is there maybe an argument to say like, you don't need to last very long and really the goal is to create some sort of viral sensation, but also build monetization in from the get go. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCBKkb1pLEE&t=409.0s)]
*  I mean, gas, I feel like is a good example of this. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCBKkb1pLEE&t=424.0s)]
*  I think Nikita has publicly said that they made millions of dollars in the several months where they were trending prior to the acquisition. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCBKkb1pLEE&t=426.0s)]
*  And so ignore the acquisition. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCBKkb1pLEE&t=435.0s)]
*  If someone, a founder, built a successful social app that trended even for a few months and made several million dollars, like I would say that's a success. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCBKkb1pLEE&t=437.0s)]
*  It's not a faying level success where you go on to be a multi-billion dollar company. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCBKkb1pLEE&t=444.0s)]
*  But I think maybe would you say there's an argument to people focusing more on that given the state of the app store? [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCBKkb1pLEE&t=449.0s)]
*  Oh, absolutely. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCBKkb1pLEE&t=457.0s)]
*  I think it all comes down to what you as a founder are wanting to build. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCBKkb1pLEE&t=458.0s)]
*  And I think the opportunity maybe has never been greater to build and monetize a mobile app quickly, make a few million dollars and retire if that's what you want to do. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCBKkb1pLEE&t=461.0s)]
*  Clearly Nikita is still building, so he's not at the retirement point yet. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCBKkb1pLEE&t=472.0s)]
*  But I think his one of his last tweets about the app before the acquisition said they had had like 10 million downloads and 6 million in revenue, which is just amazing. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCBKkb1pLEE&t=476.0s)]
*  There used to be this kind of paradigm and consumer where the goal was to build an app, get it to the mainstream, get it to Facebook level, Instagram level, millions, if not hundreds of millions of users. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCBKkb1pLEE&t=486.0s)]
*  And then you would monetize people through ads like the user kind of becomes the product. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCBKkb1pLEE&t=497.0s)]
*  And now I've been trying to pinpoint exactly what it is. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCBKkb1pLEE&t=503.0s)]
*  I think it's a mix of like Apple Pay and Google Pay adoption and saturation, people getting more comfortable making purchases online. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCBKkb1pLEE&t=507.0s)]
*  Maybe it's the younger generation who is, you know, happy and feel safe buying something on their phone versus my parents generation is still like suspicious of Venmo and thinks their money is going to get stolen every time. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCBKkb1pLEE&t=515.0s)]
*  But we are seeing many more apps get big and make money at the same time and at an early stage in their life. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCBKkb1pLEE&t=529.0s)]
*  Lenza is another really good example of this, which was another number one from late 2022. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCBKkb1pLEE&t=537.0s)]
*  They are an AI avatar company and some of the external app data estimates say that they made, you know, upwards of 20 million dollars in a couple weeks getting people to buy a pack of avatars for eight dollars. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCBKkb1pLEE&t=543.0s)]
*  I certainly participated in that. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCBKkb1pLEE&t=556.0s)]
*  I did too. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCBKkb1pLEE&t=558.0s)]
*  It's hard to resist if you see everyone else posting them on Twitter and it seems like a fairly minor payment at the time. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCBKkb1pLEE&t=560.0s)]
*  I think Lenza is an interesting one because you then want to say like what's the next act of the company is the goal to get people to give you money once and then they get all the value out of the product and leave. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCBKkb1pLEE&t=567.0s)]
*  Lenza has been smart in that they're constantly releasing new styles, new packs, new avatars. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCBKkb1pLEE&t=579.0s)]
*  They did dog avatars for the first time a few weeks ago, which I bought. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCBKkb1pLEE&t=585.0s)]
*  So I think once you're on someone's phone and can send them notifications, there is a potential to kind of continue to capitalize on that down the line. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCBKkb1pLEE&t=589.0s)]
