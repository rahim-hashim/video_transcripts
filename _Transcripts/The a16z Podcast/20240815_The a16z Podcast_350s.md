# Ideogram: Unlocking Precision Image Generation
**The a16z Podcast:** [August 15, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yn0m8JJCFUc)
*  everybody has an innate desire to create. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yn0m8JJCFUc&t=0.0s)]
*  What's finally possible with technology and AI is to help people [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yn0m8JJCFUc&t=2.8000000000000003s)]
*  express themselves visually and creatively without a lot of expertise in craftsmanship around art. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yn0m8JJCFUc&t=6.8s)]
*  My name is Mohammed Nourouzi. I'm the co-founder CEO at Ideogram. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yn0m8JJCFUc&t=24.400000000000002s)]
*  Before this, I was at Google on the Brain team doing AI research [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yn0m8JJCFUc&t=28.24s)]
*  with a bunch of my former colleagues who started Ideogram. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yn0m8JJCFUc&t=33.199999999999996s)]
*  Ideogram is a visual communication platform that uses generative AI to help everyone become creative. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yn0m8JJCFUc&t=36.56s)]
*  Text creation can be very useful, but for me personally, like, image is somewhat unique. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yn0m8JJCFUc&t=43.839999999999996s)]
*  You can communicate visually at a deeper level and there's a lot of potential in image and video. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yn0m8JJCFUc&t=50.32s)]
*  When you think of using image for communication, then you can communicate much more effectively [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yn0m8JJCFUc&t=57.68s)]
*  if you have image and text together and if you can do really unique custom fonts. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yn0m8JJCFUc&t=65.92s)]
*  And when you think of a lot of marketing, advertising applications, visual storytelling, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yn0m8JJCFUc&t=75.6s)]
*  somehow including text in the image helps you tell stories better, think of all the memes. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yn0m8JJCFUc&t=83.92s)]
*  And so that's where we started and pushed really hard to perfect the text rendering as part of the [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yn0m8JJCFUc&t=91.04s)]
*  image, but do it in an aesthetically pleasing and unique way. So basically it was the version 0.1 [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yn0m8JJCFUc&t=96.8s)]
*  as we called it and this is back then in September of 2023. It wasn't perfect, but we felt like [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yn0m8JJCFUc&t=103.28s)]
*  it's already good enough to give it to users and it was the first model that could put [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yn0m8JJCFUc&t=111.68s)]
*  legible text into images. So it kind of went viral because of the unique capability of the model. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yn0m8JJCFUc&t=118.08s)]
*  Now looking back, those images look really bad, but we had to start from somewhere and what's [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yn0m8JJCFUc&t=125.2s)]
*  interesting is our users used Ideogram to tell us what they want. So they were like, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yn0m8JJCFUc&t=131.68s)]
*  we want image upload, we want comments, we want more servers and somehow the ability to put text [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yn0m8JJCFUc&t=137.6s)]
*  into images and have image and text as part of a visual element felt needed and people just got it [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yn0m8JJCFUc&t=144.56s)]
*  right away. I mean it's always interesting how much people can push the model in different [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yn0m8JJCFUc&t=154.64s)]
*  directions and bring unique capabilities out of the model. You see a lot of creative use of [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yn0m8JJCFUc&t=161.28s)]
*  Ideogram these days. Again, the combination of text and image opens new doors. In terms of the [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yn0m8JJCFUc&t=168.64s)]
*  use cases, for example, a friend of mine has a small business for packaging of his products. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yn0m8JJCFUc&t=173.92s)]
*  He's starting to think about using Ideogram and he's already using it in terms of being able to [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yn0m8JJCFUc&t=180.48s)]
*  build the prototype and communicate with designers much more effectively this way. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yn0m8JJCFUc&t=187.28s)]
*  You see a lot of memes coming up, not surprisingly. And what's interesting is on the platform, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yn0m8JJCFUc&t=193.36s)]
*  users can like the content that they appreciate and that kind of pops up and more people see it. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yn0m8JJCFUc&t=200.64000000000001s)]
*  So we are having a lot of fun. When it comes to text, there's also something we call prompt [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yn0m8JJCFUc&t=205.92000000000002s)]
*  adherence, which is I want a certain character eating pasta with a certain color of background [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yn0m8JJCFUc&t=211.28s)]
*  with another character sitting by their side. The problem with a lot of AI tools right now is the [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yn0m8JJCFUc&t=218.8s)]
*  moment you start adding more and more characters and extending the description, at some point they [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yn0m8JJCFUc&t=225.12s)]
*  break. And what's unique about Ideogram is you can really have very detailed prompts and it tries to [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yn0m8JJCFUc&t=231.2s)]
*  follow all of the nuances of the description. So that's one element of text to image and text [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yn0m8JJCFUc&t=238.08s)]
*  consistency that we call prompt adherence. And another element is when you want to have text as [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yn0m8JJCFUc&t=244.24s)]
*  part of the image, the accuracy of text and the quality of text is difficult to get, but we've been [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yn0m8JJCFUc&t=250.32000000000002s)]
*  able to push that to its limits and it's the best model in terms of being able to put multiple [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yn0m8JJCFUc&t=259.44s)]
*  words into the image and really put it in a statistically pleasing way. Because it's not only [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yn0m8JJCFUc&t=265.36s)]
*  about the accuracy of the text, but it's also about the aesthetics of it. And we are trying to really [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yn0m8JJCFUc&t=270.24s)]
*  push the limits of fonts to make it really custom and unique for lots of design applications. And [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yn0m8JJCFUc&t=275.04s)]
*  we are the platform of choice for print on demand. We kind of use our user base and the prompts that [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yn0m8JJCFUc&t=282.48s)]
*  they enter into the system to decide how to evaluate the quality of the model and what to [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yn0m8JJCFUc&t=288.88s)]
*  prioritize. So I guess the good news is we already have this flywheel of users coming and using it. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yn0m8JJCFUc&t=295.68s)]
*  Some are paid, some are free and that sets the vision for us. As humans, we have this [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yn0m8JJCFUc&t=302.48s)]
*  inner creative child. What I find interesting is that the education system sometimes [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yn0m8JJCFUc&t=308.4s)]
*  kills this creative child, unfortunately. And what's finally possible with technology and AI [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yn0m8JJCFUc&t=315.84s)]
*  is to help people express themselves visually and creatively without a lot of expertise in [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yn0m8JJCFUc&t=322.56s)]
*  arts and without knowing the handcraftsmanship around art. So it was just, the timing is right. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yn0m8JJCFUc&t=332.15999999999997s)]
*  We can finally combine arts and technology and let's do it. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yn0m8JJCFUc&t=339.68s)]
