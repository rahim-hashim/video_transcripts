# Palmer Luckey on the Opportunity to Reinvent the Defense Industrial Base
**The a16z Podcast:** [February 25, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GlQUjKS4eI)
*  You can't credibly deter war without superior technology. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GlQUjKS4eI&t=0.0s)]
*  And this has happened over and over, not just in the United States and not even in modern [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GlQUjKS4eI&t=7.88s)]
*  history, but going all the way back into ancient history. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GlQUjKS4eI&t=11.92s)]
*  Unfortunately, America's defense industrial base, which one produced technology that was [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GlQUjKS4eI&t=14.36s)]
*  far beyond even what we imagine in science fiction, has largely stopped innovating, especially [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GlQUjKS4eI&t=18.38s)]
*  when it comes to systems that actually get fielded, that actually get deployed, that [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GlQUjKS4eI&t=24.16s)]
*  get out of the lab and into major budgets. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GlQUjKS4eI&t=27.6s)]
*  And despite spending more money than ever on defense, our military technology for the [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GlQUjKS4eI&t=32.160000000000004s)]
*  last few decades has largely stayed the same. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GlQUjKS4eI&t=35.84s)]
*  There's more AI in a John Deere tractor than there is in any system that the U.S. DOD is [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GlQUjKS4eI&t=38.56s)]
*  fielding. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GlQUjKS4eI&t=43.84s)]
*  There's better computer vision in your Snapchat app. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GlQUjKS4eI&t=44.84s)]
*  And until 2019, the United States' nuclear arsenal was still operating off of floppy [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GlQUjKS4eI&t=48.0s)]
*  disks. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GlQUjKS4eI&t=52.040000000000006s)]
*  But at the same time, China and Russia and other smaller states have sought to seek asymmetric [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GlQUjKS4eI&t=53.44s)]
*  advantage by aggressively modernizing their armed forces, taking advantage of technologies [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GlQUjKS4eI&t=58.839999999999996s)]
*  that were developed for the consumer sector, that were developed for business applications, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GlQUjKS4eI&t=63.44s)]
*  and applying it to their military technology. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GlQUjKS4eI&t=67.8s)]
*  They've been spending their resources not just to outbuild us on things like ships or [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GlQUjKS4eI&t=71.36s)]
*  outbuilding us on the number of aircraft, but also on things that are going to have [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GlQUjKS4eI&t=76.16s)]
*  an asymmetrical advantage, things like jamming our communications link, degrading the way [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GlQUjKS4eI&t=81.0s)]
*  that our current systems work, and creating armies of cheap autonomous systems that are [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GlQUjKS4eI&t=84.76s)]
*  uniquely suited to going up against our very, very expensive exquisite systems that cost [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GlQUjKS4eI&t=89.28s)]
*  an enormous amount of money per shot. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GlQUjKS4eI&t=94.32000000000001s)]
*  And the result of this is that today, in almost every war game that the United States simulates [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GlQUjKS4eI&t=96.48s)]
*  against China or their proxies, the United States, if we don't lose, certainly end up [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GlQUjKS4eI&t=101.6s)]
*  in a very, very bad situation. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GlQUjKS4eI&t=107.68s)]
*  And of course, it wasn't always like this. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GlQUjKS4eI&t=110.44s)]
*  Silicon Valley itself was founded by patriots who are pushing science and engineering forward, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GlQUjKS4eI&t=112.04s)]
*  specifically with a mind towards the national interest, not just profit, not just making [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GlQUjKS4eI&t=117.32000000000001s)]
*  money, but also making sure that their country actually remained as it was so that you could [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GlQUjKS4eI&t=122.32000000000001s)]
*  have future economic growth. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GlQUjKS4eI&t=127.52000000000001s)]
*  War research and development was what turned futuristic dreams into household staples. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GlQUjKS4eI&t=129.68s)]
*  Social computing, GPS, the internet, commercial air travel, and so many more things were born [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GlQUjKS4eI&t=134.12s)]
*  of military investment that was later commercialized. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GlQUjKS4eI&t=139.72s)]
*  In 1947, half of Stanford's engineering budget came from the Department of Defense. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GlQUjKS4eI&t=143.48000000000002s)]
*  Just think about how incredible that is, that you'd have a university like Stanford would [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GlQUjKS4eI&t=148.56s)]
*  have so many of their brilliant minds focused on that to the point where it was the majority [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GlQUjKS4eI&t=152.56s)]
*  of the research and development that they were doing. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GlQUjKS4eI&t=156.92000000000002s)]
*  World War II and the 50s were really a golden age of this type of investment. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GlQUjKS4eI&t=160.12s)]
*  Defense innovation, government efficiency applied to these types of technologies. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GlQUjKS4eI&t=164.12s)]
*  We built the Pentagon in 16 months. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GlQUjKS4eI&t=168.44s)]
*  We completed the Manhattan Project in three years. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GlQUjKS4eI&t=170.16000000000003s)]
*  We put a man on the moon in under a decade. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GlQUjKS4eI&t=172.52s)]
*  In the 50s alone, we built five generations of fighter jets, three generations of bombers, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GlQUjKS4eI&t=175.04000000000002s)]
*  two entirely different classes of aircraft carriers, nuclear-powered attack submarines, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GlQUjKS4eI&t=180.44s)]
*  and submarine-launched ballistic missiles, just to name a few. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GlQUjKS4eI&t=185.32000000000002s)]
*  And that's why in 1960, the Department of Defense accounted for 36% of all research [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GlQUjKS4eI&t=188.72s)]
*  and development in the entire world. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GlQUjKS4eI&t=193.8s)]
*  But starting in the 1960s and moving into the decades that followed, our defense industry [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GlQUjKS4eI&t=197.92s)]
*  became more focused on process than progress. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GlQUjKS4eI&t=201.52s)]
*  Unlike many of our other industries that have continued to rapidly advance in recent decades, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GlQUjKS4eI&t=205.48s)]
*  defense companies are rarely asked to innovate as a matter of survival. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GlQUjKS4eI&t=209.52s)]
*  Instead, they build specifications that instruct them what they are going to build. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GlQUjKS4eI&t=213.6s)]
*  And because defense firms are reimbursed by taxpayers for every hour they work, well [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GlQUjKS4eI&t=218.4s)]
*  before they built a working product, they're incentivized to come up with things that cause [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GlQUjKS4eI&t=222.20000000000002s)]
*  work to be done rather than making things that actually work. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GlQUjKS4eI&t=226.4s)]
*  Because of that, we now have a defense industry that spends a measly 1% to 4% of revenue on [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GlQUjKS4eI&t=230.72s)]
*  internal research and development, IRAD. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GlQUjKS4eI&t=235.1s)]
*  And you can compare that to modern technology companies that need to move quickly, that [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GlQUjKS4eI&t=237.56s)]
*  need to invest in their own products, that need to build the things that they know are [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GlQUjKS4eI&t=240.88s)]
*  going to lead into the future on their own dime, spending as much as 20, 30, even 40% [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GlQUjKS4eI&t=244.58s)]
*  of their revenue on internal research and development. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GlQUjKS4eI&t=250.14000000000001s)]
*  Andrel is currently spending over 50% of our revenue on research and development. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GlQUjKS4eI&t=253.42000000000002s)]
*  So we're pretty great. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GlQUjKS4eI&t=257.66s)]
*  But the result of this disparity, this result of this difference between how our private [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GlQUjKS4eI&t=261.06s)]
*  sector technology companies and our more defense-focused companies work is that we have an aging and [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GlQUjKS4eI&t=265.54s)]
*  top heavy industry that moves very slowly because that's the incentive structure that [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GlQUjKS4eI&t=271.94s)]
*  they've been given. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GlQUjKS4eI&t=277.06s)]
*  It moves slowly because not that many people are actually chasing it. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GlQUjKS4eI&t=278.54s)]
*  And when I say not many, I don't mean by people, I mean by corporate entity. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GlQUjKS4eI&t=282.34s)]
*  There's certainly an enormous number of people working in those top three firms. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GlQUjKS4eI&t=285.5s)]
*  But the 10 largest defense companies in the United States account for over 80% of the [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GlQUjKS4eI&t=288.92s)]
*  industry's revenue. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GlQUjKS4eI&t=295.38s)]
*  I don't think there's really any other industry where you would see anything like that unless [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GlQUjKS4eI&t=296.38s)]
*  you chop it into really, really small slices and how you define it. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GlQUjKS4eI&t=300.02s)]
*  Nearly two-thirds of major weapons system contracts in the United States have just one [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GlQUjKS4eI&t=303.73999999999995s)]
*  bidder. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GlQUjKS4eI&t=307.58s)]
*  One bidder means that nobody else is even trying to win the money. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GlQUjKS4eI&t=308.58s)]
*  How can you have competition and how can you have innovation when you only have one company [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GlQUjKS4eI&t=312.5s)]
*  showing up to build something? [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GlQUjKS4eI&t=316.28s)]
*  Understandably, most engineers and a lot of founders in the United States don't want to [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GlQUjKS4eI&t=318.38s)]
*  work under these conditions. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GlQUjKS4eI&t=322.26s)]
*  Engineers want to see their code deployed, their robots in motion, their products out [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GlQUjKS4eI&t=324.14s)]
*  in the world making an impact. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GlQUjKS4eI&t=327.47999999999996s)]
*  And they don't want to wait years or even decades for that to happen. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GlQUjKS4eI&t=329.03999999999996s)]
