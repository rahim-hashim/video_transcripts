# Beyond Avatars: How AI is Reshaping Online Identity (Danny Postma and Sinead Bovell)
**The a16z Podcast:** [April 24, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU)
*  I barely sleep at night because every time I wake up the next morning, there's something new that's launched. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=0.0s)]
*  In the arc of innovation, a few years can feel like a long time or no time at all. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=4.4s)]
*  Because early on, things move slow. People ask, are we there yet? And also jump to point out that [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=9.84s)]
*  we're not exactly where people thought we would be. But when technologies hit that exponential phase, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=15.92s)]
*  things move really quickly. Sometimes so quickly that we forget that tools like mid-journey or [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=22.56s)]
*  stable diffusion literally did not exist one year ago. Now, in a recent episode, we discussed the [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=27.84s)]
*  first wave of technology used to build digital influencers. And we did that with the creators [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=33.84s)]
*  of Lil Mikaela. Mikaela was a first mover and she was built in 2016. But at the same time, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=39.44s)]
*  she was built with CGI. But today, we're actually presented with an entirely new set of tools, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=45.519999999999996s)]
*  these AI tools that give almost anyone the opportunity to build a digital influencer of [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=51.2s)]
*  their own. So in today's follow-up episode, I thought it'd be interesting to bring in two [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=56.8s)]
*  new voices, seemingly from different worlds, but also converging on one topic. That topic being, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=61.519999999999996s)]
*  how does artificial intelligence fundamentally change the way that we all represent ourselves [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=68.47999999999999s)]
*  online? The first voice is Sinead Bovell. Sinead describes herself as a futurist, but she also [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=73.6s)]
*  wrote an article titled, I am a model and I know that artificial intelligence will eventually take [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=80.16s)]
*  my job. But here's the thing. She wrote this three years ago, which again, depending on the [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=85.76s)]
*  prism that you have on the world can both feel like yesterday and forever ago. Our second voice [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=92.80000000000001s)]
*  is Dani Posma. Dani has explored the many ways that AI can reshape how we express ourselves online [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=98.88000000000001s)]
*  by building the tools to actually enable that. So that ranges from the memes that we post to the [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=105.04s)]
*  tattoos that we put on our body, to the headshots that we all post on LinkedIn. And over the last [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=110.72s)]
*  few months, yes, months, not years, he's created seven different projects. And that ranges from [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=115.6s)]
*  the things I just mentioned, tattoos, memes, headshots, but also a virtual modeling agency. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=121.75999999999999s)]
*  And honestly, if you've been on AI Twitter recently, I can almost guarantee you've seen [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=128.24s)]
*  at least one of his projects. So we brought in Sinead and we brought in Dani and together we [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=133.04s)]
*  explore how these tools may impact the world of modeling, but also creators and just about any [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=138.4s)]
*  forum that we as humans show up online. We'll discuss the deflationary nature of these tools, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=143.28s)]
*  what they unlock, how to build a moat and so much more. And I'll also say that Sinead, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=148.72s)]
*  unfortunately had to drop a little bit early, but Dani stuck around with us till the very end. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=153.44s)]
*  All right, let's get started. As a reminder, the content here is for informational purposes only. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=158.08s)]

*  Please see asixnz.com slash disclosures for more important information, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=172.8s)]
*  including a link to a list of our investments. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=177.04000000000002s)]
*  I'm so excited to have you two online today. As you both know, we did an interview with the [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=188.4s)]
*  creators of Loma Kayla just before this. And Loma Kayla is created with CGI and it was started in [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=194.4s)]
*  2016. I should say she was started in 2016. And now it feels like we're going through a second [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=200.64s)]
*  wave of swords. It feels like maybe anyone can create these characters online. And that could [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=207.6s)]
*  be characters that are net new, that are not necessarily representative of them, or it could [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=212.72s)]
*  be representing their own personality, their own likeness in a new way using, you know, I feel like [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=217.51999999999998s)]
*  the technology of the year, AI. So before we get into that technology and what people are [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=223.83999999999997s)]
*  building there, Sinead, you wrote an article in 2020 with Vogue that I feel like was really [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=230.4s)]
*  prescient. It was called, I am a model and I know that artificial intelligence will eventually take [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=236.56s)]
*  my job. And here we are in 2023. Maybe this does not sound surprising three years later, [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=242.88s)]
*  but back then that was a statement. And so tell me a little bit more about that article and what [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=248.56s)]
*  inspired you three years ago to write it. Yes. So, you know, I also work as a futurist. So a lot [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=254.24s)]
*  of my time is spent buried in data tracking trends. And I had come across a company called [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=261.2s)]
*  Data Grid using a form of generative AI called adversarial networks. We would know more formally [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=268.32s)]
*  or informally as deep fakes. If this technology can so accurately create artificial identities, [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=273.76s)]
*  artificial beings, what industry could that have a lot of ramifications for? And the clear cut for [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=281.28s)]
*  me was fashion, especially when it comes to e-commerce, a line or a segment of fashion where [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=287.59999999999997s)]
*  it is not necessarily about these creative big movements for a fashion model, but instead just [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=294.55999999999995s)]
*  small variations in the posing. And that in some ways is somewhat robotic already. We do not have [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=300.23999999999995s)]
*  a lot of variability into the types of poses we can do or the things that we can try when it [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=306.71999999999997s)]
*  comes to e-commerce. It has to look good on a website. And so that to me was a very clear trend [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=311.12s)]
*  line that I was able to draw. And I did also see as I was reaching more and more fashion companies [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=316.08s)]
*  like Zilando, a big e-commerce giant in Germany, also researching the technology. And then when you [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=322.16s)]
*  combine it with a little Michaela was also a big influencer back then. This was like 2019 when I [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=327.92s)]
*  started to research all signs pointed to a future where society might be okay with artificial [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=333.44s)]
*  beans representing clothing and where it could be a much more cost-effective future for fashion [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=340.72s)]
*  companies. Totally. And we're seeing this be extrapolated not just to fashion. And we'll get [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=346.08000000000004s)]
*  to that. But I want to hear when you wrote this article, what was the response and maybe break [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=351.20000000000005s)]
*  that down both by the people in the modeling industry and then also outside. Yeah. So it was [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=356.56s)]
*  definitely a shock to a lot of people. And I think for a long time, even though technology has always [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=362.24s)]
*  disrupted fashion, whether that's e-commerce or whatever it may be, that nobody was really talking [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=369.52s)]
*  about the impact of automation on creative jobs at that time and especially not fashion modeling. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=376.08s)]
*  So the fashion world, a little bit of fear, I would say in the modeling world. But I also tried to, [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=381.84s)]
*  I don't like to just drop kind of fear mongering things and leave everybody defend for themselves. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=388.64s)]
*  Saying things like it isn't just models, right? Everybody's going to have to prepare for the [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=392.64s)]
*  future of work. So providing that perspective, I think was a little bit reassuring for people. But [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=396.96s)]
*  the amount of responses I received, and not even just in the modeling world, people in advertising, [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=402.79999999999995s)]
*  photography, all sorts of surrounding ecosystem players in the world of fashion that will [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=408.88s)]
*  inevitably be impacted by a world where we can digitally generate photo shoots. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=414.64s)]
*  The article was received as something highly likely, but I think people couldn't conceptualize [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=419.91999999999996s)]
*  how this transformation would actually come about. So it became suddenly true for people that, okay, [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=427.2s)]
*  in some way, modeling might be impacted by AI, like other industries would be, but they couldn't [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=432.8s)]
*  actually understand what that could actually look like. It became hard to see how that would [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=439.36s)]
*  materialize. And then now in this kind of explosion of generative AI, it's like all the light bulbs [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=443.6s)]
*  are going off, connecting all of the pieces. Yeah. And as I said, it's not just models. I think [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=449.28s)]
*  a lot of people, as you said, it's materializing where they're seeing how these tools today are [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=454.88s)]
*  already maybe not replacing them, but are able to do things that they previously thought they were [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=460.08s)]
*  safe from the advancements of these technologies. In fact, that was really how people viewed it. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=466.0s)]
*  They were like, if you're creative, that's where the robots are unable to match you. And we're now [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=470.88s)]
*  seeing that maybe that's not the case. And so talking about some of these tools, Danny, [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=476.0s)]
*  let's move on to you created many different projects and we'll get into more of them. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=480.64s)]
*  But one of them was really this photo studio of the future, this modeling agency where you really [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=485.36s)]
*  could spin up a model, put them in these different backdrops, drop in your product, things like that. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=491.2s)]
*  And so you posted this a couple of weeks ago and it went really viral. I think one tweet in particular [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=496.64s)]
*  reached like 2 million people, but you also, I think saw maybe similar to Sinead's article, [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=502.64s)]
*  a range of responses. And so tell us a little bit about what that product was, but also how [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=508.56s)]
*  people responded to it. I've been dabbling with different kinds of projects and it all came together [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=514.24s)]
*  and I made this tweet. My product wasn't ready yet. Deep Agency, the tweet went absolutely viral. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=518.96s)]
*  So within 24 hours, I had to come up with something to put live because otherwise there [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=524.48s)]
*  wasn't the website online. I think it went viral, got 30 million views as a modeling agency and it's [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=529.92s)]
*  nowhere close to that. I think there's a lot of other tools that are way better doing those kind [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=535.28s)]
*  of things. But yeah, as you said, all the technology is coming together right now, [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=539.1999999999999s)]
*  all these different kinds of models, the ability to generate deep fakes, deep non-existing people, [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=543.12s)]
*  but also the ability to put the clothing on those kinds of models. It's like all these [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=550.0s)]
*  separated tracks of development by researchers over the last past years that are all coming together [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=553.4399999999999s)]
*  in 2023 turning into tools like this. Since you've been kind of in the bowels of these tools, [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=558.88s)]
*  Danny, do you think, let's say like a year from now or maybe even five years from now, [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=564.24s)]
*  is it realistic that basically you can represent what the modeling industry does today or what [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=568.88s)]
*  influencers do today with these technologies and have it be pretty much like a one for one or a [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=575.2s)]
*  match in terms of it being as good? So what I'm able to do right now, what others are able to do [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=581.84s)]
*  right now is the ability to use DreamBoof, which is technology to train an AI on top of someone's [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=588.16s)]
*  face. You can basically make a clone, a digital twin or whatever of someone. There are other models [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=593.44s)]
*  called StyleGAN, which basically are trained on millions and millions of photos, and they can [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=599.12s)]
*  generate faces and heads that do not exist at the moment. They are non-traceable. They don't exist. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=604.24s)]
*  Combine those two and you can train a DreamBoof model on a non-existent person and create a model, [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=610.96s)]
*  for example. And then there are other deep learning models that are able to make a, [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=616.08s)]
*  and I believe the name is like a top down photograph of a clothing that's not being [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=622.56s)]
*  worn by someone. And the AI knows how to put that clothing in kind of the folding ways to put it on [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=626.3199999999999s)]
*  top of someone's body, being able to dress the model in that kind of way. So the technology is [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=632.4s)]
*  there at the moment, I believe. It's up to a company that understands the fashion industry [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=637.5999999999999s)]
*  to take it to the other level. Well, I love that point because there is [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=643.28s)]
*  this sense of taste of the people in the modeling industry are not just the folks who [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=647.4399999999999s)]
*  look a certain way or able to hold a camera a certain way, but they do have this background, [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=652.32s)]
*  this understanding of aesthetic. And so Sinead, tell me a little bit more about how maybe some [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=656.8000000000001s)]
*  of these companies are using this technology today. Are they leaning in and saying, oh, actually, [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=661.6s)]
*  this is really valuable. We're going to utilize these new tools because we are in this new era, [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=665.9200000000001s)]
*  or are they kind of resistant to this new wave? Yeah, I think it kind of depends on the [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=672.24s)]
*  type of fashion company. So if you look at e-commerce and a company, although we might [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=679.76s)]
*  not be as familiar with Zulando in America, they're quite a big fashion giant in Europe. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=684.64s)]
*  For them to be researching this technology and showing very viable proof of concept as early as [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=689.84s)]
*  2019, we know that fashion companies are exploring this. And we can also say a company like H&M, [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=695.0400000000001s)]
*  they have thousands of data scientists that use AI to do things like forecast trends and [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=700.96s)]
*  understand and analyze supply chain. So they already have the somewhat of the infrastructure [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=707.2800000000001s)]
*  to deploy the next advancements in what the industry will be adopting. I would say where [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=712.88s)]
*  we might see a little bit more resistance is potentially in high fashion when it comes to [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=719.36s)]
*  using AI for things like design, although I do expect as any tool, it will eventually be adopted. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=725.6800000000001s)]
*  But I would argue that there's probably been certain instances where any of us on this [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=732.88s)]
*  podcast right now have come across an AI model and just not realized it, shopping online. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=738.08s)]
*  So I think the technology has been here for years. It's 2023. Companies were investing in it in 2018. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=743.36s)]
*  It's largely here. It just hasn't materialized as broadly at scale yet, but that's coming. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=750.4000000000001s)]
*  I think maybe one pushback people might have is like, okay, if this thing is AI generated, [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=756.1600000000001s)]
*  it's not quote unquote real. But how real are the photos that we're seeing today anyway? [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=761.6s)]
*  Ignore the digital virtual influencer concept. The photos that we're seeing on a billboard, [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=767.12s)]
*  how photoshopped are those? How real is the end image that we're seeing today? I feel like there's [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=773.28s)]
*  a degree of fabrication already. And so maybe you could just speak to that concept and maybe, [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=778.48s)]
*  again, just the natural pushback for us to say, well, this is not human anymore. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=783.76s)]
*  But how far past the original photograph were we already? [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=788.24s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, that it also depends on how representative the models are of society. So [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=792.64s)]
*  it could be argued that it is hard to find examples of diverse representation in the fashion industry [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=798.5600000000001s)]
*  as it stands today. And so therefore, seeing a piece of clothing on somebody else, how helpful [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=804.64s)]
*  is that if you can't necessarily or your body is a different shape or you couldn't conform to the [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=809.44s)]
*  clothes in the same way. And in terms of the actual shoots themselves, of course, there is a [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=814.48s)]
*  lot of pinning and last minute stitching and things to make things appear to fit a certain way. And [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=818.16s)]
*  then of course, the the Photoshop part towards the end, I am not the person on the computer doing the [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=825.44s)]
*  Photoshop. So I couldn't tell you exactly how much Photoshop there is. The end of the day, yeah, [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=830.32s)]
*  an image definitely does get altered. So it isn't entirely like this documentary style [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=835.84s)]
*  photography where it just goes specifically from shoot straight to market. But at the same time, [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=842.32s)]
*  there are interesting social and cultural trends that are converging. The idea of [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=847.2800000000001s)]
*  Photoshopping images is becoming a little bit more taboo. People are speaking up against it, [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=851.9200000000001s)]
*  that they want to see maybe some of the stretch marks or the cellulite or the or the acting, [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=857.6s)]
*  the things that make people human. And so it's interesting that that's also those types of social [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=861.44s)]
*  and cultural trends are appearing at a time when we're arguably becoming less human in some ways, [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=867.36s)]
*  or how fashion and culture is represented is becoming a little less human. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=872.72s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I think maybe one of the most interesting aspects of AI is that you can really [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=876.16s)]
*  prompt it to give you whatever you want. And so you can prompt it literally to say, Hey, I want [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=880.16s)]
*  this person to have acne, I want this person to be of my race or culture or gender, you can really [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=885.28s)]
*  prompt it to give you whatever you want. But at the same time, I think there is this yearning for [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=890.4s)]
*  what people again call real. And I think that term is going to take on a whole new dimension [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=895.52s)]
*  as we look forward. But the last thing I want to ask just as we talk about fashion and modeling is [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=900.88s)]
*  maybe a sense of the cost. The cost differential is something that ultimately plays a role in [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=905.68s)]
*  adoption. And so Danny, let's just use an example, right? So you have this AI model, this person [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=911.04s)]
*  doesn't exist. In fact, you did create one of these, her name is Alice, and people can find [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=916.96s)]
*  this model at thismodeldoesnotexist.co, I believe, and we'll link that in the show notes. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=922.0s)]
*  Let's just use that as an example. If you wanted to do a photo shoot with Alice, how much would [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=927.52s)]
*  that cost? And let's break that down between actually training the initial data set or the [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=933.12s)]
*  initial face, and then actually generating a bunch of images. Let's just give the audience a sense [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=938.8s)]
*  of what that takes. So currently to deep train a model on someone's face, to be able to [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=943.84s)]
*  generate photos after that, it costs 60 cents to generate this. So not even a dollar. And then [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=951.84s)]
*  I think per photo you're at a fraction of a cent right now. So you could generate hundreds of [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=959.2s)]
*  thousands of photos for less than a hundred bucks. So technology is pretty cheap already in that [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=964.8000000000001s)]
*  sense. So I believe this is from what I've seen talking to customers, people. The number one [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=970.4s)]
*  question in my live chat is from mom and pop shops with clothing brands who do not have the funds [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=979.04s)]
*  to hire models to put on clothing for the web shops, who I think probably wouldn't even ever [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=985.04s)]
*  be able to hire a model to do the photo shoots for them. So I see this as a, it's like democratizing [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=990.96s)]
*  for the lower spectrum of the small business, enabling them to do the fashion shoots. And [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=997.6s)]
*  yeah, I think it's mostly for those kinds of consumers that this is interesting to do. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=1004.1600000000001s)]
*  Yeah. And there's other applications of that. I did a presentation recently and I used Mid Journey [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=1009.12s)]
*  for all of my images within that presentation. And I probably would not have had those images. I [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=1014.48s)]
*  wouldn't have hired someone at the very least to go create them. And so there is, as you said, [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=1021.6s)]
*  this democratizing force, this ability for folks that didn't have access to a specific technology [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=1025.68s)]
*  to use it in these new ways. Sinead, let's hear the other side of that. Maybe perhaps some of these [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=1031.36s)]
*  folks who are models may not be hired for the same roles, or maybe they will still be. And in the [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=1037.76s)]
*  case where they are, what are the benefits of all this? Can you do a bunch of shoots where your [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=1044.6399999999999s)]
*  avatar is quote unquote attending those shoots without you actually physically being there? [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=1051.6799999999998s)]
*  Can you save a bunch of money, fuel and not traveling? Can you actually upgrade yourself [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=1057.8400000000001s)]
*  in some way? I'm just kind of throwing ideas out there, but how might this actually change [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=1063.8400000000001s)]
*  the industry for the better? Is there a world in which a model can be in multiple places at one [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=1068.0s)]
*  time and therefore increase their income stream and have more assets of themselves to be out in [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=1073.68s)]
*  the market? Absolutely. That could be quite profitable, quite lucrative if the industry does [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=1079.8400000000001s)]
*  evolve that way in a world where we want to see the same influencers and people we look to [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=1086.4s)]
*  in fashion to continue to be the face of brands and the clothing. But if you look at the history [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=1094.0s)]
*  of technology, technology is often quite deflationary over time, especially when it comes to wages. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=1099.2800000000002s)]
*  So in a world where a model can be in multiple places at one time, yes, they may be able to [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=1106.0800000000002s)]
*  have more revenue streams coming in, but do we see downward pressure on prices? Because a lot of [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=1111.44s)]
*  it's created digitally and there is an increase in supply of identities that could pass for [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=1117.1200000000001s)]
*  being human. And so that's where things get a little bit gray and a little bit ethically [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=1124.48s)]
*  red flags and kind of caution tape. And I will say again, it's not that this is unique to modeling. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=1129.3600000000001s)]
*  We're going to see this across the board with AI. It's going to put downward pressure on a lot [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=1134.4s)]
*  of different wages from modeling to programming, but that's where it becomes a little bit [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=1138.16s)]
*  challenging. And then what is uniquely applicable to modeling and maybe acting is that not only are [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=1142.88s)]
*  people getting automated, but their likeness and the communities they represent are also getting [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=1150.72s)]
*  automated, but someone is still benefiting off of that very specific identity. So that's where it [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=1157.2s)]
*  starts to become a little bit gray. Yeah. I mean, it's going to be interesting to see how that all [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=1163.84s)]
*  evolves if you, like what regulation gets put in place, what IP people own or do not own that goes [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=1170.9599999999998s)]
*  into these models on the topic that this really does expand past modeling. I think what's fascinating, [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=1178.24s)]
*  Dani, is you've really went on this sprint over the last few months you've created. I mean, [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=1183.6s)]
*  I'm just going to name some of the projects you did. Tattoos AI, which is an AI-powered tattoo [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=1187.84s)]
*  artist. We mentioned Alice, this model that does not exist that you created. You started, I think, [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=1193.12s)]
*  or one of your early projects was Profile Picture AI, which is similar to Lenza, which most people [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=1198.08s)]
*  would recognize. We talked about deep agency, meme morph, people can morph themselves into their [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=1202.32s)]
*  favorite meme. And then most recently you're working on Headshot Pro, which is basically people can [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=1207.6s)]
*  create their next corporate headshot or a company can create a kind of wave of headshots for [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=1213.12s)]
*  their entire staff. And so among those projects, first just kind of tell me what you're seeing as [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=1219.6799999999998s)]
*  you've launched these projects, what people are getting excited about, what you're getting a lot [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=1226.1599999999999s)]
*  of traction with right away without maybe perhaps even trying and where actually this technology [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=1231.76s)]
*  may be interesting, but it feels more like a trek uphill, if that makes sense. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=1238.32s)]
*  Yeah. So first of all, the whole reason this scales really fast for me, this gets a lot of [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=1244.56s)]
*  tension because it's indistinguishable from magic at the moment. You upload a few photos and [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=1249.84s)]
*  suddenly you get hundreds and hundreds of profile pictures out for it. So this is why people keep [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=1253.76s)]
*  sharing it on Instagram, on TikTok, it goes viral really fast. The second, I think what mostly gets [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=1258.0s)]
*  solved at the moment is I get a lot of messages from folks who say, I don't have any profile [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=1264.08s)]
*  pictures, I don't have any photos. And suddenly I can look really well online. And this is [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=1268.48s)]
*  one of the major selling points for headshot, for example. Well, like me, for example, I hate [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=1274.0s)]
*  going to photo shoots because I always look super awkward. I don't smile. So for them, this solves [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=1278.32s)]
*  an actual issue that they can look good on their LinkedIn. Same with profile picture, you can turn [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=1284.48s)]
*  yourself into whatever you want. Lancer showed how popular that could be. I believe Lancer did $40 [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=1288.88s)]
*  million with that. I like this as an art. I like to dabble with it. I like to try things out. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=1293.6s)]
*  I get an idea. I have to work it out. It gets easier and easier because it uses the same [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=1298.8s)]
*  technology. And headshot has been the biggest success traffic wise, financial wise at the moment. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=1302.9599999999998s)]
*  For remote teams, which it branded at the moment, like good luck trying to get a photographer. If [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=1309.04s)]
*  your team is remotely and you have people in Asia, America, Europe, and you want to get the same [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=1313.6799999999998s)]
*  photo style, like you cannot send a photographer all around the world to get the same style, [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=1318.16s)]
*  but everyone can upload a photo, train an AI model on them, use the same styles to generate it. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=1323.6000000000001s)]
*  And basically everyone gets the same headshot for their team. If you're creative enough in it, [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=1329.0400000000002s)]
*  you try enough. There are use cases that people think it's going to take away the photographer, [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=1332.88s)]
*  but I think it's going to enable different kinds of things that weren't possible before [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=1338.24s)]
*  with this technology, like having a photographer everywhere in the world, [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=1343.2s)]
*  trying out different hairstyles, for example, things that weren't able before that are [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=1347.2s)]
*  enabled now by this technology. Yeah. It's kind of crazy. If you go to [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=1352.16s)]
*  Headshot Pro, I think you have this live counter. And last time I checked it said 450,000 plus [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=1356.4s)]
*  headshots were created and that's just- I think it's a million now because I have to [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=1364.24s)]
*  manually update it and it's to reach live now. Yes. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=1367.92s)]
*  Oh, I was going to say, I just checked it last night. You kind of alluded to this, but [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=1370.24s)]
*  there's ways that people are using this product. You're creating these projects and you're [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=1374.24s)]
*  releasing them into the world and you're kind of tinkering and thinking, oh, maybe people will [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=1379.1200000000001s)]
*  use it in this way. But I've seen you tweet about the fact that you've actually been surprised that [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=1383.52s)]
*  as you released this tool, people are using the tool in ways that you didn't even expect as the [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=1388.0s)]
*  creator. Well, that's like with Provo Picture, I learned from the headshots and D-map shots, [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=1393.1200000000001s)]
*  because we used to do only these artsy styles and people kept requesting, hey, can I get a [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=1397.6s)]
*  LinkedIn photo for myself? So we kept tinkering with that way. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=1402.88s)]
*  Yeah. And just on the note of what people are being drawn to, I think maybe one way to have [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=1405.92s)]
*  a pulse on that is what people are willing to pay for. And so among your projects, have you noticed [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=1411.8400000000001s)]
*  any trends there in terms of things that people almost seem allergic to? Like, oh, this is cool. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=1417.44s)]
*  This is novel, but I'm not going to pay you $30 for that versus maybe the headshot example is [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=1422.0s)]
*  something that people have ingrained in their mind. Like, oh, a headshot is worth X dollars. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=1428.64s)]
*  So with Provo Picture, we started pretty expensive at the time and I've been lowering the price, [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=1434.0s)]
*  lower, lower, lower. And I think we're almost around cost price at the moment, $5 to generate [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=1437.92s)]
*  them. So yeah, Lenza basically killed the whole market after they went live. So yeah, I think [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=1442.48s)]
*  mostly now it's the high quality output. And I really wonder where we're going to go in the next [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=1450.0s)]
*  few months because these models keep releasing, keep releasing. I barely sleep at night because [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=1455.04s)]
*  every time I wake up the next morning, there's something new that's launched that already makes [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=1461.6s)]
*  the whole technology obsolete. It's going so fast. So I don't know where it's going to end up. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=1465.2s)]
*  Well, I know. I feel like a lot of people would agree with that sentiment that it's moving so [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=1471.84s)]
*  quickly. It's so hard to keep up. On the note of it evolving though, these new models are being [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=1477.2s)]
*  released all the time. What ways does this really change or shape the way that people can represent [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=1481.76s)]
*  themselves online? I think if you use a headshot example, that's kind of a one-to-one parallel to [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=1486.8799999999999s)]
*  what we did before this technology existed. But maybe what are new, exciting ideas that people can [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=1492.08s)]
*  look forward to? I mean, one example of this in fashion is, I can't remember how long ago this [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=1498.24s)]
*  was, but Bella Hadid's spray on dress was a new kind of concept within fashion where people are [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=1504.48s)]
*  wow, we have this new technology that fundamentally changes what we can create. So Sinead, [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=1510.4s)]
*  maybe I'll start with you there, but any ideas on how this really, again, doesn't just replicate [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=1515.84s)]
*  what we've done before, but maybe unlocks a whole new wave of creativity? On the one hand, [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=1520.56s)]
*  it puts design tools in the hands of people who wouldn't have been able to step into the market. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=1526.16s)]
*  What does it look like to have an AI system that's been refined on a certain style that you like, [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=1532.16s)]
*  that you're able to kind of tweak and then digitally apply those images to your body or [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=1537.92s)]
*  your photograph? So maybe you can't really afford the high brand luxury fashion, but you can generate [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=1544.24s)]
*  your own version of luxury using these systems and digitally apply the clothes to you afterwards. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=1552.4s)]
*  And I know that the digital application of clothes has been something that's been seeming to be in [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=1557.92s)]
*  the pipeline for the last few years, but now it really is possible to retrospectively apply [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=1562.48s)]
*  clothes to images. And if you look at what the internet and social media did to fashion, [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=1567.68s)]
*  we saw the birth of all of these small brands that finally had a shot. In some ways, [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=1573.28s)]
*  it actually became really cool to be the undiscovered brand that suddenly kind of, [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=1578.0s)]
*  you know, was discovered and popped off by a certain celebrity figuring them out. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=1582.0s)]
*  Imagine what happens when more of us get access to these design tools. Fashion is really [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=1586.56s)]
*  a communicator of culture. And now we can push the bounds on that almost infinitely, [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=1592.8799999999999s)]
*  where we conduct photo shoots, who gets to be in them. When we go digital, things change a lot. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=1597.84s)]
*  Of course, again, you know, there are ethical challenges that come with that, [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=1604.1599999999999s)]
*  even things like copyright. Am I allowed to be inspired by Celine, for example, [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=1607.9199999999998s)]
*  have an AI system look at the latest collection and then say, put me in clothes that look like [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=1613.12s)]
*  the latest Celine, you know, suit and shoes, but it's not Celine. Where does the IP go there? And [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=1618.48s)]
*  you know, are there real designers on the line who may see knockoffs at a whole other scale than [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=1624.96s)]
*  we already do. So we do have to figure out what are the boundaries of this technology, [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=1631.76s)]
*  where does IP start and stop in a world where we're a lot more digitized. But I think [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=1636.0s)]
*  the what could be possible and who gets to be a designer, I think could be really interesting. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=1641.2s)]
*  Definitely. Danny, what about you? Anything come to mind in terms of how this technology maybe [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=1646.08s)]
*  unlocks again, like a new wave of creativity or new opportunities? [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=1650.96s)]
*  Photoshop shaped up this whole industry where suddenly you could make photos and you're [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=1655.92s)]
*  adjusting it afterwards. So you would make a photo and Photoshop was the post-production. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=1659.84s)]
*  I wonder how AI can do something. And I think it's going to go there, how AI can be the [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=1665.2s)]
*  pre-production. Whereas you generate the photos, you can do the real photo shoots to [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=1670.0s)]
*  solve for missing content that you cannot make with the AI and then have Photoshop stitch those [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=1677.52s)]
*  pre-generation and post-generation together. For example, what I would think for Hedgehog Pro is [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=1682.32s)]
*  like the customers who get the best output from me did a photo shoot themselves. Very basic photo [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=1687.68s)]
*  shoot on a wide screen, train the AI on the photos and then I could generate hundreds and hundreds of [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=1694.0s)]
*  photos of them in a park, in an office, wherever they want to be. So I wonder if Hedgehog [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=1699.12s)]
*  photographers are going to transition towards generating really, really high quality training [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=1703.6799999999998s)]
*  images, for example, and then use AI tools like the next Photoshop to put their customers without [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=1708.4799999999998s)]
*  having them to go outside, having to go whatever, make the perfect photo for themselves. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=1714.0s)]
*  Now, I'll also add to that, I think where we each get to be the model in the shoots that we see. So [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=1718.8799999999999s)]
*  instead of just looking at the campaign, there might be an interactive option where you could [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=1725.04s)]
*  drop in your own virtual twin to see how you would personally look in that image. And I think that [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=1729.2s)]
*  that could be really, really interesting and maybe be even more accurate in terms of how things would [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=1734.8799999999999s)]
*  likely fit on your body if we could get the physics of clothes right online. And I wouldn't be [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=1740.24s)]
*  surprised if any social media is going to do this soon because Instagram already has photos of your [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=1745.92s)]
*  face, right? They could already train a model on your face in that kind of sense. And you could [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=1750.16s)]
*  put the clothing on it that they put in their shop in Carousell, for example. So I think [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=1755.28s)]
*  social media platforms are going to integrate this in a few years or within a year, for example. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=1759.44s)]
*  This is going to be reality. Yeah. I mean, I think if anything, we'll at least learn a lot about our [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=1763.8400000000001s)]
*  own preferences because I don't know about you. I don't want to see my face online everywhere, [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=1768.48s)]
*  but some people might, but also you might learn about what you do want to see. What kind of person [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=1774.4s)]
*  do I want to see modeling in front of me online? Right now, I don't have that option to decide. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=1778.96s)]
*  But as we do get more of these options, and I think what both of you are pointing towards is like, [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=1784.48s)]
*  we have with these tools eventually more say, and it'll be interesting to see how people utilize [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=1789.04s)]
*  that say, right? How they want to participate in that ecosystem. And I think we'll learn a lot [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=1796.32s)]
*  both individually, but also as a society about what we want to see because previously there [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=1800.24s)]
*  weren't so many people involved in making that decision. One place that would be great to end [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=1805.44s)]
*  off is, I mean, both of you have voiced how quickly this is moving in your respective spaces. [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=1810.0800000000002s)]
*  And by the way, respective spaces could mean Sinead, you as a model, but also as a futurist. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=1815.2s)]
*  Dani, that could mean you as an indie hacker, it could mean a developer, as a nomad. As this evolves [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=1819.6000000000001s)]
*  in many dimensions, what are you doing to quote unquote keep up? And you can interpret that as [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=1824.64s)]
*  you'd like. I spend a significant portion of my day buried in academic white papers [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=1830.48s)]
*  to see what is likely coming down the line in the next few years and kind of plotting out those [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=1836.0s)]
*  those trend graphs and those trend lines. But I also feel a little bit of a responsibility to [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=1842.0s)]
*  bring other people along with me and to make sure that these conversations are accessible and [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=1848.4s)]
*  digestible to everyone. I think we all have a right to learn about and try to shape our own futures. [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=1853.3600000000001s)]
*  And it becomes really challenging if it's only the same few people invited to the conversations [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=1859.28s)]
*  all of the time. For me, I'm completely relearning how to program different languages. I'm learning [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=1863.12s)]
*  Python, learning all the things to develop it. Also for me, I'm dabbling in all the white papers. [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=1868.24s)]
*  I don't have an academic background, so I'm using chat GPT a lot to summarize those things [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=1872.8s)]
*  and understanding it mostly. What I enjoy the most is most of AI and machine learning, as [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=1876.8799999999999s)]
*  Sinead said, it's in academic papers, totally un-understandable for the regular people, [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=1882.48s)]
*  especially me too. So I like to try things out, make tools out of it so it's more [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=1889.3600000000001s)]
*  comprehensible for the regular Joe. My following on Twitter has grown a lot by just showing what [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=1894.3200000000002s)]
*  is possible in those kinds of sense. It really is what I enjoy doing. So very little sleep and a [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=1900.0s)]
*  lot of building and trying out. Well, I think your Twitter following has grown because like you said, [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=1905.1200000000001s)]
*  there's just so much appetite for people to follow along and try to understand what is happening. [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=1910.72s)]
*  And I'm also just curious because you were quite early to the stage here, especially with profile [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=1916.72s)]
*  picture.ai. It's kind of crazy to think about. That was not that long ago, a few months ago, [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=1921.92s)]
*  six months ago. October, I think. It's not even been a half a year since all this tech is out. [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=1926.4s)]
*  Yeah. And it feels like forever ago. That seems like a perfect example of where you were early, [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=1933.52s)]
*  but then to your point, it moves so quickly. This world moves so quickly that ultimately, [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=1938.56s)]
*  Lenza came in. Lenza, I think ended up, if you were to declare a winner, not like it actually [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=1943.36s)]
*  works that way, then Lenza took a majority of that market share. And I think a lot of people [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=1949.04s)]
*  also have the question as they debate whether to build with these AI tools is, well, if it's all [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=1954.56s)]
*  based on the same model, then ultimately, do I have emotes? Do I have anything that actually will [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=1960.0s)]
*  stand the test of time? No, I got a really good wake-up call because every indie hacker, [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=1966.4s)]
*  we like to develop, right? We like to build things. We don't do marketing. And seeing Lenza [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=1971.68s)]
*  swoop in one month after we actually launched this already and just did our revenue in one hour or [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=1976.88s)]
*  something, it's a wake-up call for a developer. You've got to do distribution is everything. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=1982.24s)]
*  Marketing is everything. It's really important. It's always been important with product launches [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=1986.24s)]
*  and especially with AI where you have less of a mode. Hiring TikTok influencers, letting it post [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=1990.0800000000002s)]
*  it and it's going really fast due to it. But I think someone is going to come out who has a way [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=1995.84s)]
*  bigger budget for that. And that in the sense, you shouldn't build on a hype. So what I'm focusing [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=1999.76s)]
*  on mostly now is SEO, building tools, getting backlinks, trying to get it to stand the time [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=2004.32s)]
*  longer than just a hype. Focus on something small, some small problems to solve and do your marketing, [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=2012.32s)]
*  do the distribution. Don't just build. You got to sell it. [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=2020.1599999999999s)]
*  What might people not realize is surprisingly hard. And so maybe one simple example of that is [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=2023.6799999999998s)]
*  as you're building these models, everyone jokes about the hands. I think that's being solved. [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=2030.3999999999999s)]
*  But I think there's probably infinitely more things that you've encountered as you're building [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=2034.9599999999998s)]
*  these projects that like, again, people see the end result and they're like, Alice looks amazing, [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=2040.0s)]
*  or like deep agencies working for me, or what a great headshot. But what might people not realize [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=2045.4399999999998s)]
*  if they haven't built these tools is actually, again, really, really hard. [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=2050.8s)]
*  So it might look easy on the inside, like on the outside. Okay. You upload some photos and 20 [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=2055.2000000000003s)]
*  minutes later, the photos are done. But actually, so profile picture was just dream. There was no [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=2059.52s)]
*  mode on it. And what I'm doing with Headshot is basically it's 15 different AI models stacked on [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=2064.96s)]
*  top of each other in like a sequence of doing things together. Like it's a modern, like [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=2070.0s)]
*  their custom models built right now. So if you want to stand up, yeah, I think at the moment, [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=2075.7599999999998s)]
*  it's 15 different AI models doing things on top of each other to optimize the photo quality, [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=2081.52s)]
*  to optimize the training, upscaling, generating. Yeah. If you want to go more unique, yeah. I [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=2087.2799999999997s)]
*  didn't know Python. I didn't know machine learning. I had to learn all those kinds of things so I [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=2094.08s)]
*  could build my own models in that sense. What's surprisingly easy these days is, and what used [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=2097.68s)]
*  to be hard is deploying those models. Running your GPUs used to be really hard, but there's [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=2103.6s)]
*  all these startups springing up since, I think October, also since the hype, they wanted to [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=2109.7599999999998s)]
*  capitalize on, okay, AI is hot. What is hard is hosting the models. So that part got released [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=2114.3199999999997s)]
*  these times. So it's easier than ever to start at the moment. And just for those who maybe are [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=2120.88s)]
*  at the very earliest stages where they're like, okay, I want to do this. I want to play around. [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=2127.36s)]
*  Where would you start? How do you learn how to train your own models? How do you learn to deploy [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=2133.2799999999997s)]
*  them? How do you learn to interface with something like stable diffusion? So the easiest way would be [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=2137.6s)]
*  to go to replicate.com. They host all the models. You can just select what you want. You could select [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=2143.2s)]
*  a stable diffusion, for example, and they have a few simple input fields where you can just type [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=2148.3199999999997s)]
*  in what you want and that outputs the photo. They make it super easy. They have an API that you [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=2152.96s)]
*  could hook up to a no code tool, for example, if you don't want to build it in no code. I believe [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=2157.3599999999997s)]
*  Sapir loans their stable diffusion integration. So you could just plug that into an email or [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=2162.32s)]
*  Discord or whatever. So those two are really easy to get started with by making some simple AI tools. [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=2169.36s)]
*  Yeah. And if you want to go deeper, you probably need some coding knowledge, [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=2177.2000000000003s)]
*  but I think 99% of the apps you can build right now with API repers with no code tools. [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=2180.8s)]
*  That's super cool because I think a lot of people who don't know how to code can actually participate [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=2186.4s)]
*  in that ecosystem. We veered from the original conversation, but I guess just closing off, [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=2191.36s)]
*  because you have built all of these projects. How do you think about what to focus on now moving [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=2196.56s)]
*  forward? This ties into our conversation around what really has a moat, what people are really [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=2202.0s)]
*  willing to pay for, especially because you are an indie hacker and you do need sleep eventually. [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=2207.2000000000003s)]
*  I wouldn't dabble in any image generation in that sense because Adobe already does it. [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=2214.08s)]
*  Canva does it already. I wouldn't build any chat bots because chat GPT, they are shipping. I don't [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=2220.24s)]
*  even know how they're doing it, but they're launching something new every week. Well, [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=2225.68s)]
*  hint Danny, they have more than one person like you. Fair enough. But just ship like a startup, [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=2229.12s)]
*  which is exciting to see because they're competing with Google and all the likes, right? No, [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=2233.6s)]
*  but I would just pick something and ID something that is you, that annoys you, where you think, [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=2237.2799999999997s)]
*  hey, maybe if I put some AI on top of this, it could speed it up. We're going into a recession, [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=2243.68s)]
*  which means people want to save money. So can you save money by removing some kind of step? [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=2249.36s)]
*  Totally. And if anyone wants an idea, Danny would love if you want to jump on this, [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=2254.2400000000002s)]
*  but a very simple thing that I still have not seen is the ability to use these text image tools, [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=2257.84s)]
*  but in a way where you can basically train it on your own brand, right? So you upload your brand [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=2263.6800000000003s)]
*  colors. If you have, let's say a blog with a bunch of sharing images from the past, you train it on [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=2268.6400000000003s)]
*  that. And I know people can set up their own models to do this, but if there was a self-serve [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=2274.4s)]
*  version where any brand today can again, upload the constraints and then spit out new images, [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=2278.96s)]
*  let me know if it exists that you've seen it. That to my knowledge does not exist in that exact form. [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=2286.2400000000002s)]
*  I'm going to 100% bet you that Canva does this in the next three months. [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=2291.04s)]
*  Okay. You've been following. Yeah. Okay. Well, maybe, yeah, we'll see if Canva does that. [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=2294.08s)]
*  For me, if I can tune in an idea, I would love to see. I don't know if we have time for that. [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=2300.08s)]
*  I would love to have... So OpenAI launched a model called Whisper, which basically lets you [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=2305.28s)]
*  transcribe audio. And all these text to voice models are getting really, really creepily real. [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=2312.08s)]
*  I would love to have someone build a tool where I say, Hey, I want the top five posts of hack news [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=2319.6s)]
*  while I was sleeping, the latest news and my favorite people on Twitter and generate me a [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=2324.16s)]
*  100% customized podcast. I can listen five minutes while I walk with my dog in the morning, [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=2330.56s)]
*  customize it for me. I think that will be really awesome and not even that hard to build, I guess. [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=2335.44s)]
*  No, I agree. And actually I've been seeing some folks, like there's this guy who's been creating [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=2340.8799999999997s)]
*  the AI version of the All In Podcast. And he just released the fifth one, but you can actually see [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=2345.04s)]
*  how with every subsequent one that he releases, it becomes less popular because at the end of the [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=2351.68s)]
*  day, that novelty factor is wearing off. However, to your idea, you're actually integrating that [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=2357.52s)]
*  with, as we've discussed, a problem that you have, which is trying to digest a specific set [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=2363.52s)]
*  of information, which is the stuff ranking on Hacker News and actually digesting that. So that's [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=2368.56s)]
*  a very clear job to be done versus a novelty of just like, let's listen to these fake people talk [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=2373.2s)]
*  about fake topics. Yeah. Don't build on the hype because you will get some attention on social media [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=2379.68s)]
*  and then it fades away for example. Yeah. For some reason, this reminded me of back in the day, [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=2385.44s)]
*  I knew this guy who used to listen to Spanish as he slept. And he was convinced that when he woke [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=2391.04s)]
*  up, he was better at speaking Spanish. He was trying to learn the language. Did it work? [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=2397.3599999999997s)]
*  He thought so. I don't know if it did, but anyway, on that note, it's super cool to be watching all [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=2402.24s)]
*  the things that you've built. I think many people would agree with that. Just like the rate of [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=2408.8s)]
*  shipping is insane. I'm sure a lot of people are inspired to go create similar things and yeah, [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=2414.2400000000002s)]
*  it's exciting to see what's being built. I agree. Thank you so much for having me on the podcast. [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVfNMuM29bU&t=2420.1600000000003s)]
