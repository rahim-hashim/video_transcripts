# Why VR Experiences Are About to Change
**The a16z Podcast:** [April 17, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETRxkHQcuBY)
*  We did a lot of shooting experiences in the beginning because you had to wear a bulky [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETRxkHQcuBY&t=0.0s)]
*  VR backpack and you know you're pretty limited. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETRxkHQcuBY&t=7.24s)]
*  But now with wireless streaming, it actually enables a lot more different genres that we [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETRxkHQcuBY&t=10.84s)]
*  can utilize. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETRxkHQcuBY&t=17.56s)]
*  I think an analogy that we would use is what sound is to silent films is what the wireless [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETRxkHQcuBY&t=18.56s)]
*  streaming is to our VR platform. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETRxkHQcuBY&t=26.92s)]
*  Because once you add a sound, there's a genre that wasn't possible before that you can utilize [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETRxkHQcuBY&t=29.76s)]
*  now. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETRxkHQcuBY&t=34.2s)]
*  So, with wireless streaming, there's a lot more mobility, there's a lot more movement, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETRxkHQcuBY&t=35.2s)]
*  and you can create experiences where every part of your body movement matters. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETRxkHQcuBY&t=40.36s)]
*  And that is why we decided to partner with Netflix on Squid Game. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETRxkHQcuBY&t=44.68s)]
*  Oh wow. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETRxkHQcuBY&t=48.68s)]
*  What a great partnership. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETRxkHQcuBY&t=49.68s)]
*  Thank you, thank you. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETRxkHQcuBY&t=52.2s)]
*  It's a great, it shows a lot of trust in us, Netflix, to be able to give us one of the [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETRxkHQcuBY&t=53.2s)]
*  best IPs. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETRxkHQcuBY&t=58.4s)]
*  But I think it's also a good marriage in a sense that we can really create a great experience [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETRxkHQcuBY&t=59.96s)]
*  where you have multiple people in the same space where you can collaborate or even sabotage [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETRxkHQcuBY&t=66.44s)]
*  one another moving freely in a shared space. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETRxkHQcuBY&t=71.68s)]
*  So not only do we get to work with a great IP, but also we're able to create an experience [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETRxkHQcuBY&t=76.4s)]
*  that fully utilizes our platform. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETRxkHQcuBY&t=82.48s)]
*  I think that's so important to your point about what the technology enables, because [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETRxkHQcuBY&t=85.12s)]
*  I actually, I was too scared to watch Squid Game, but I know the premise and I know some [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETRxkHQcuBY&t=89.84s)]
*  of the games within Squid Game. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETRxkHQcuBY&t=93.28s)]
*  And some of them would just be inherently underserved if they were done in, you know, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETRxkHQcuBY&t=95.16s)]
*  even a VR headset, if you didn't have access to your hands, because, you know, one of the [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETRxkHQcuBY&t=100.16s)]
*  games is where you're kind of like cutting open a shape within a cookie, for example. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETRxkHQcuBY&t=104.0s)]
*  You can do that with your mouse or your keyboard, but it's not the same. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETRxkHQcuBY&t=108.4s)]
*  And that's something that I really was impressed by when I went to Sandbox, which is, as you [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETRxkHQcuBY&t=111.44s)]
*  said, it's like a full body experience. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETRxkHQcuBY&t=115.48s)]
*  There's haptics on your vest. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETRxkHQcuBY&t=117.64s)]
*  You know, if my partner got killed, I go, you know, restore him with my hand. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETRxkHQcuBY&t=119.92s)]
*  And so there was just so many aspects where it was like, you are fully in this experience. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETRxkHQcuBY&t=125.67999999999999s)]
*  And I also think another element of VR, which is probably my favorite from the few in-person [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETRxkHQcuBY&t=129.92s)]
*  VR experiences I've done, is the ability for you to truly immerse yourself. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETRxkHQcuBY&t=136.44s)]
*  And what I mean by that is to start experiencing emotions like fear or joy that I don't think [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETRxkHQcuBY&t=142.32s)]
*  I've experienced to the same degree in other games. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETRxkHQcuBY&t=148.64s)]
*  To give a quick example, the first time I ever went to a VR experience was in Japan. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETRxkHQcuBY&t=151.4s)]
*  And they get you to walk across this balance beam in VR and they get you to jump to grab this. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETRxkHQcuBY&t=156.68s)]
*  There's like a helicopter with a ladder hanging down. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETRxkHQcuBY&t=163.24s)]
*  And really you're about four inches off the ground on this balance beam. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETRxkHQcuBY&t=166.64000000000001s)]
*  But because of the immersion that happens, you get scared. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETRxkHQcuBY&t=170.44s)]
*  You're like, oh gosh, I don't like, I don't know if I can make this jump because in VR, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETRxkHQcuBY&t=174.76s)]
*  there's a big city below you. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETRxkHQcuBY&t=179.16s)]
*  And the same experience I did at Sandbox, there was this point where they raised both [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETRxkHQcuBY&t=181.56s)]
*  of us up, but we went in different directions. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETRxkHQcuBY&t=185.6s)]
*  And it truly felt like I was then 100 meters away from my partner instead of, you know, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETRxkHQcuBY&t=188.36s)]
*  in reality, we were one meter away. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETRxkHQcuBY&t=193.68s)]
*  So I don't know, I'm just sharing that experience because I do think your point about the actual [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETRxkHQcuBY&t=195.84s)]
*  technology enabling concretely new experiences is really important. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETRxkHQcuBY&t=200.36s)]
*  And Squid Game seems like one of the best options to actually pursue that with. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETRxkHQcuBY&t=205.44000000000003s)]
*  It's really interesting because when we first started Sandbox and the first experience we [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETRxkHQcuBY&t=209.88000000000002s)]
*  built was a zombie experience called Deadwood Mansion. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETRxkHQcuBY&t=215.1s)]
*  We were inspired by, you know, Resident Evil Left 4 Dead. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETRxkHQcuBY&t=218.06s)]
*  And those titles generally is a very, very male dominated experience that people love. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETRxkHQcuBY&t=221.74s)]
*  But when we launched that, we were surprised that half the audience were female. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETRxkHQcuBY&t=226.82s)]
*  And we asked, you know, our customers like, hey, you know, what do you think of our experience? [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETRxkHQcuBY&t=231.54s)]
*  And for them, they say, hey, it doesn't feel like a game. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETRxkHQcuBY&t=234.98s)]
*  It felt like real life. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETRxkHQcuBY&t=237.22s)]
*  It felt like I'm a star of my own, me and my friends are stars of our own movies and [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETRxkHQcuBY&t=238.22s)]
*  we're transporting this world. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETRxkHQcuBY&t=241.98s)]
*  So we end up that we didn't create just a gaming experience. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETRxkHQcuBY&t=244.32s)]
*  It felt like an experience of consumer product. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETRxkHQcuBY&t=247.6s)]
*  The insight that we took from this was that the believability, once you hit a certain [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETRxkHQcuBY&t=250.23999999999998s)]
*  level, it just click and it just becomes real life. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETRxkHQcuBY&t=256.52s)]
*  And that's the reason why we built what we've done because when we first started out with [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETRxkHQcuBY&t=261.28s)]
*  the consumer VR headset, we still know that we were in a game because when you put on [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETRxkHQcuBY&t=264.8s)]
*  your headset, okay, you look at your body, you don't see your body, you look at your [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETRxkHQcuBY&t=269.08s)]
*  control, it's just two like floating joysticks, right? [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETRxkHQcuBY&t=272.08s)]
*  And you can't really move in your space. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETRxkHQcuBY&t=275.44s)]
*  And then if you're next to like another player online, you can't really physically interact [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETRxkHQcuBY&t=277.18s)]
*  with them. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETRxkHQcuBY&t=280.88s)]
*  But you put them in sandbox, they forget they're in assimilation. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETRxkHQcuBY&t=282.41999999999996s)]
*  And there are many times we would tell we would get complaints about noise. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETRxkHQcuBY&t=287.03999999999996s)]
*  I remembered in the early days, we work with IMAX to bring sandbox in the New York space. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETRxkHQcuBY&t=291.4s)]
*  It was right next to the theater. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETRxkHQcuBY&t=297.84s)]
*  And we found out that we had to shut our store by 5pm. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETRxkHQcuBY&t=299.88s)]
*  I was like, why? [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETRxkHQcuBY&t=302.91999999999996s)]
*  And they said, well, because people were screaming so loud that all the theaters around could [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETRxkHQcuBY&t=304.79999999999995s)]
*  hear random screaming. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETRxkHQcuBY&t=308.84s)]
*  And like they tried everything. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETRxkHQcuBY&t=311.2s)]
*  They put mattresses, they tried to muffle all the time. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETRxkHQcuBY&t=312.2s)]
*  It did not work. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETRxkHQcuBY&t=314.52s)]
*  You're fine. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETRxkHQcuBY&t=315.52s)]
*  You're fine. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETRxkHQcuBY&t=316.52s)]
*  Do that. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETRxkHQcuBY&t=317.52s)]
*  Do it right. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETRxkHQcuBY&t=318.52s)]
*  Who's that mean? [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETRxkHQcuBY&t=319.52s)]
*  Who's that mean? [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETRxkHQcuBY&t=320.52s)]
*  You don't get that unless you create something that's very real and believable. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETRxkHQcuBY&t=321.52s)]
