# Remote Work or Just Work?
**The a16z Podcast:** [February 26, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LqMYgwin8o)
*  For me, remote work is not remote work. It's just work, right? And that's, I'm hoping the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LqMYgwin8o&t=0.0s)]
*  term remote work and it disappears over time, right? It's more about how you're doing work [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LqMYgwin8o&t=7.76s)]
*  and how people are structured and the output that they have. And I think the key thing that [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LqMYgwin8o&t=11.68s)]
*  we're seeing is people are starting to, because they're starting to look out, right? From their [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LqMYgwin8o&t=15.52s)]
*  30 miles radius, right? They're starting to hire globally and hiring globally, right? Means [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LqMYgwin8o&t=20.240000000000002s)]
*  that you're starting to have more consideration, right? For what is standard in one country [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LqMYgwin8o&t=26.0s)]
*  compared to another from a benefit standpoint. But at the same time, right? As you scale, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LqMYgwin8o&t=30.8s)]
*  you want to be as standardized as possible, right? So that brings a lot of interesting [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LqMYgwin8o&t=34.160000000000004s)]
*  and complex challenges, which we're having fun solving. But yeah, I mean, overall, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LqMYgwin8o&t=38.400000000000006s)]
*  the world is a big place and there is amazing talent everywhere. And I think more and more [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LqMYgwin8o&t=43.2s)]
*  people are realizing that it's about, you know, working with the right people. It doesn't really [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LqMYgwin8o&t=49.6s)]
*  matter where they are as long as you've got the right talent, right? And I mean, I'm not saying [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LqMYgwin8o&t=54.0s)]
*  anything new here, but that's really the trend we're seeing, right? From like the small companies [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LqMYgwin8o&t=57.28s)]
*  all the way to, I mean, you know, we onboarded a formula one team yesterday as a customer, right? [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LqMYgwin8o&t=60.56s)]
*  So like you've got a very big breadth of products and people. Yeah, I will agree that long term, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LqMYgwin8o&t=64.72s)]
*  the word remote goes away and it's just work. What we're talking about is the workplace. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LqMYgwin8o&t=71.28s)]
*  We're still going to use the term remote for a while because we've done it the other way for [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LqMYgwin8o&t=76.16s)]
*  so long that it's a necessary qualifier in the language of work. But my son is three right now. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LqMYgwin8o&t=80.08s)]
*  It's highly unlikely that he'll ever see work any other way. I'll have to show him YouTube videos [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LqMYgwin8o&t=89.2s)]
*  of millions of people getting in a personal vehicle and driving to somewhere they don't live [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LqMYgwin8o&t=96.56s)]
*  to open a computer that they carried with them. And it's going to blow his mind. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LqMYgwin8o&t=103.44s)]
*  He it's going to require an explanation. It's going to be one of those generational things [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LqMYgwin8o&t=109.36s)]
*  where you can show a pencil and a small circle in a cassette. Do you know what this is? Like, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LqMYgwin8o&t=115.60000000000001s)]
*  oh yeah, I used to rewind cassette tapes using that. This is the workplace cassette moment or [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LqMYgwin8o&t=121.92s)]
*  fax machine moment. And it's very much a massive shift that shouldn't be underestimated. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LqMYgwin8o&t=127.52000000000001s)]
*  Yes, I remember talking to a friend recently and I was like, I wonder when they're going to stop [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LqMYgwin8o&t=133.28s)]
*  teaching kids handwriting in schools, which sounds crazy given our generation because that's so [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LqMYgwin8o&t=138.16000000000003s)]
*  foundational to at least my education growing up. And I don't know if that'll disappear anytime [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LqMYgwin8o&t=143.04000000000002s)]
*  soon because it is also a cultural signifier or it's almost like a step to learning to read, which [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LqMYgwin8o&t=149.20000000000002s)]
*  you know, then leads to comprehension. And so it's all interrelated, but I do wonder what things [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LqMYgwin8o&t=157.20000000000002s)]
*  we're used to, really foundational things in our society, which of those will be relics. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LqMYgwin8o&t=163.44s)]
*  And it actually reminds me also of something I saw recently, which was between I think it was from [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LqMYgwin8o&t=168.8s)]
*  1891 or sorry, the tweet covered a newspaper article from 1891 where someone was slamming [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LqMYgwin8o&t=173.6s)]
*  the office because that person felt like we should all be hunters and gatherers and like outside and [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LqMYgwin8o&t=180.07999999999998s)]
*  in the wild. And so I wonder, you know, if we're seeing certain permutations of that today, right, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LqMYgwin8o&t=185.52s)]
*  where what we think of as work 100 years ago was not the office, right? We should say 200 years ago [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LqMYgwin8o&t=191.84s)]
*  was not the office. And then 100 years ago, it was the office. And then today it's something else. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LqMYgwin8o&t=197.52s)]
*  But to both of your points, like that is work, right? Remote work is just a modifier that we've [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LqMYgwin8o&t=201.6s)]
*  added in this current juncture when there's a debate about what work should be. At its core, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LqMYgwin8o&t=207.76s)]
*  it's leveraging technology. Remote work is a product. So humankind invented the internet. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LqMYgwin8o&t=212.96s)]
*  We're finally using it and leveraging it in a way that helps people live better lives and [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LqMYgwin8o&t=217.52s)]
*  leaders build more durable organizations. So it's been a long time coming. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LqMYgwin8o&t=223.28s)]
