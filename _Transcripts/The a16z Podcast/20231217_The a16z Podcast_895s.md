*  But on deck today, you will hear directly from one of our partners as we dive even more deeply [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lU4LRKy57zs&t=52.8s)]
*  into their big idea. What's the why now? What opportunities and what challenges are on the [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lU4LRKy57zs&t=58.31999999999999s)]

*  investments in the companies discussed in this podcast. For more details, including a link to [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lU4LRKy57zs&t=86.72s)]
*  our investments, please see a16z.com slash disclosures. I'm Robin. I'm on the A16Z Games [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lU4LRKy57zs&t=91.52s)]
*  team. And my big idea for the year is on anime. So anime is a uniquely accessible art style for [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lU4LRKy57zs&t=101.92s)]
*  both kids and adults. The medium allows for many different story archetypes and player profiles. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lU4LRKy57zs&t=108.4s)]
*  There are adventure components, romance hooks, social loops, many other things within anime [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lU4LRKy57zs&t=113.68s)]
*  games that lead to deep player engagement. We're excited because things like Genshin set the new [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lU4LRKy57zs&t=118.4s)]
*  standard for a fully cross-platform performant game across multiple device types, GPUs and frameworks. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lU4LRKy57zs&t=122.96000000000001s)]
*  And there are now many passionate developers that are building new experiences for players everywhere. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lU4LRKy57zs&t=128.88s)]
*  And so we believe that anime will be a medium that transcends both different games, genres, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lU4LRKy57zs&t=132.96s)]
*  art styles, and we're excited to invest across that ecosystem. And we see this in the data too, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lU4LRKy57zs&t=139.35999999999999s)]
*  where anime has become one of the highest grossing genres in the ecosystem when calculated by average [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lU4LRKy57zs&t=145.04s)]
*  revenue per user or ARPUs. For instance, Mahoyo generated over $3.8 billion from releases like [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lU4LRKy57zs&t=150.48s)]
*  Genshin Impact and Hawkeye Star Rail in 2022. And early this year, Nintendo launched Zelda [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lU4LRKy57zs&t=156.0s)]
*  Tears of the Kingdom, which is on track to be one of the highest grossing games this year. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lU4LRKy57zs&t=161.52s)]
*  And in 2024, I expect anime's momentum to continue forward too. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lU4LRKy57zs&t=165.60000000000002s)]
*  All right. So Robin, I love this big idea and I'm sure many of our listeners are familiar with anime, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lU4LRKy57zs&t=170.0s)]
*  but for those who aren't or just to set a foundation, what actually constitutes anime [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lU4LRKy57zs&t=175.44s)]
*  and maybe how does it differ from other formats like manga or webtoons? [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lU4LRKy57zs&t=180.56s)]
*  Yeah. So I think anime is unique because it started from Japanese comics, right? And so [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lU4LRKy57zs&t=184.8s)]
*  it's defined by a few different types of art styles. So one is solid outlines, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lU4LRKy57zs&t=191.12s)]
*  exaggerated features, blocked out colors and textures and lines, things like enlarged lines [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lU4LRKy57zs&t=198.16s)]
*  and so enlarged eyes and so forth. It's a little bit different than webtoons because webtoons [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lU4LRKy57zs&t=203.84s)]
*  are originally from Korea. And so there's slight artistic differences such as webtoons tend to be [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lU4LRKy57zs&t=208.96s)]
*  a little bit more pastel and shaded. They also tend to have like more rounded shapes instead of [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lU4LRKy57zs&t=215.20000000000002s)]
*  the hard lines like anime. But there's no real hard and fast lines for what defines anime, right? [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lU4LRKy57zs&t=219.44000000000003s)]
*  So some people consider Avatar the Last Airbender, which is like an American cartoon, or RWBY, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lU4LRKy57zs&t=225.60000000000002s)]
*  which is another American cartoon anime too. And so I think the genre is pretty broad, I'd say. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lU4LRKy57zs&t=232.16000000000003s)]
*  It's more defined by its fan base because most of the core anime fan base likes a wide variety of [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lU4LRKy57zs&t=237.76000000000002s)]
*  things across these different archetypes. Yeah, definitely. And you mentioned that anime [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lU4LRKy57zs&t=244.08s)]
*  specifically is able to incorporate different components like adventure components or romance [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lU4LRKy57zs&t=250.64000000000001s)]
*  hooks or social loops. And that generates this really deep engagement. And we see this in the [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lU4LRKy57zs&t=255.04000000000002s)]
*  data, we'll get to the revenue in a second. But what do you think it is about anime style that [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lU4LRKy57zs&t=259.84000000000003s)]
*  actually sets that genre apart and allows for some of those components and some of that engagement [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lU4LRKy57zs&t=265.76s)]
*  in the gameplay? Yeah, so I think in general, different art styles are very targeted at [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lU4LRKy57zs&t=270.72s)]
*  different audiences. And so for instance, if you take something like Elden Ring, it's a very [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lU4LRKy57zs&t=277.04s)]
*  hardcore dark fantasy audience. Or if you take something like Fortnite or Roblox, those tend to [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lU4LRKy57zs&t=280.96000000000004s)]
*  be more cartoony or legoy. And so it tends to skew way younger. And so you only have a certain [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lU4LRKy57zs&t=286.16s)]
*  sub-segment of experiences that's available because your art style is tailored to that specific [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lU4LRKy57zs&t=292.0s)]
*  experience. Whereas with anime, many different types of people and many different age groups and [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lU4LRKy57zs&t=296.88s)]
*  many different demographics really like it. So you can make a casual game, like a match through game [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lU4LRKy57zs&t=302.88s)]
*  that has anime components, or you can make a romance game where people feel very deeply about [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lU4LRKy57zs&t=308.24s)]
*  the characters, or you can make an action game. And you can see that even with Genshin, it's both [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lU4LRKy57zs&t=312.24s)]
*  like an action and romance dating game. And so many of them, these genres can basically combine. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lU4LRKy57zs&t=316.88s)]
*  And so I think in general, anime is just able to combine many different types of player profiles, [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lU4LRKy57zs&t=323.03999999999996s)]
*  because a lot of people like anime, and there's a lot of different player types that just gravitate [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lU4LRKy57zs&t=328.32s)]
*  towards the video. Yeah, and there's a lot of people playing. I mean, some of the data that [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lU4LRKy57zs&t=333.35999999999996s)]
*  you shared and your big idea really surprised me. I knew anime was popping off, but some of these [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lU4LRKy57zs&t=338.4s)]
*  games are making tens of millions of dollars per month. That's not per year. And so how are these [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lU4LRKy57zs&t=342.71999999999997s)]
*  games monetizing? And is the monetization strategy any different from other genres of games? [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lU4LRKy57zs&t=348.88s)]
*  Yeah, so there's typical things like battle passes or IAP or progression loops that you can put in. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lU4LRKy57zs&t=356.15999999999997s)]
*  And so they have like standard monetization techniques that are pretty common in all mobile [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lU4LRKy57zs&t=363.36s)]
*  games, or like, oh, you buy some boosts, or you buy the battle pass for the month or so forth. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lU4LRKy57zs&t=366.88s)]
*  The one thing that's distinguishing about anime gifts in particular, which tends to drive the high [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lU4LRKy57zs&t=371.76s)]
*  ARPU is the gacha component. And so this evolves from gacha pawns in Japan, where basically, you [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lU4LRKy57zs&t=375.68s)]
*  used to put like 100 yen coin into the gacha pawn machine and get a random character out. And so this [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lU4LRKy57zs&t=381.92s)]
*  is the same idea with gacha, where like, you know, I spend $5, I roll the gacha, and I try to get like [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lU4LRKy57zs&t=388.16s)]
*  my favorite character, my favorite like husband or waifu, essentially. And so I think there are fair [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lU4LRKy57zs&t=393.44s)]
*  critiques that like this is like, you know, similar to gambling in certain ways. But basically, [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lU4LRKy57zs&t=400.0s)]
*  anime has tackled this by essentially, a lot of the best studios have tackled this by making it [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lU4LRKy57zs&t=405.44s)]
*  so that there's like a lot of pity techniques and that the earn rates and the drop rates for [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lU4LRKy57zs&t=410.8s)]
*  five star characters are like decently reasonable. And so you basically have a lot of different [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lU4LRKy57zs&t=415.6s)]
*  emergent behavior that comes from that too, because basically people will be like, you know, [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lU4LRKy57zs&t=422.0s)]
*  post YouTube videos that like drop openings and box openings and like, hey, I got my favorite [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lU4LRKy57zs&t=425.44s)]
*  character. And so it's like makes for great content. Plus, it allows for people to have like very high [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lU4LRKy57zs&t=430.0s)]
*  spend depth in the game. And so that's why you see like ARPU is as high as like 30, 40, $50. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lU4LRKy57zs&t=435.04s)]
*  Whereas like some other games, ARPU might be more than like 10 to $20 range. So it's like, you know, [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lU4LRKy57zs&t=440.32s)]
*  three X for, you know, potentially two to three X what like a regular game makes. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lU4LRKy57zs&t=445.6s)]
*  Right. Right. And just to clarify, gotcha is like those almost like vending machines in Japan, [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lU4LRKy57zs&t=451.6s)]
*  where you like insert money and then you get those like round balls with something in it. Okay, [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lU4LRKy57zs&t=456.88s)]
*  just wanted to clarify that for anyone who wasn't familiar. It does feel like certain companies, [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lU4LRKy57zs&t=462.08s)]
*  I think Netflix has announced certain investments in anime. So large companies are, I guess you [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lU4LRKy57zs&t=468.0s)]
*  could say waking up to this opportunity. But I'd love to just get your take on why it felt like [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lU4LRKy57zs&t=473.68s)]
*  maybe at least from the outside, people were sleeping on this trend and and maybe still are [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lU4LRKy57zs&t=479.52s)]
*  in a way. Do you think that'll change? And what do you think maybe has has not has not been [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lU4LRKy57zs&t=484.88s)]
*  capitalized on by by the masses yet? Yeah, I think in the past, you know, when I was growing up, [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lU4LRKy57zs&t=492.08s)]
*  anime was definitely a weird otaku like nerdy thing that people didn't like to talk about. And [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lU4LRKy57zs&t=498.15999999999997s)]
*  so you have to figure out who also watches anime and only talk about with their friends because [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lU4LRKy57zs&t=503.03999999999996s)]
*  you don't want to come off as like uncool or watching this weird Japanese cartoon thing, [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lU4LRKy57zs&t=507.04s)]
*  right. And so I think anime has changed a lot and gone way more mainstream. So you see things like [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lU4LRKy57zs&t=512.4s)]
*  Jujutsu Kaisen or Attack on Titan or even the old like Naruto, Bleach series or One Piece [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lU4LRKy57zs&t=518.16s)]
*  getting really big these days. And I think there's just like way more anime viewers, right? If you [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lU4LRKy57zs&t=524.24s)]
*  look at the stats, I think something like 50% of millennials and now like 70% of Gen Z watch anime. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lU4LRKy57zs&t=528.48s)]
*  And so like more and more young people are watching converting to the medium. And I think [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lU4LRKy57zs&t=534.08s)]
*  that's why people were sleeping on it before is because people were just like, oh, it's just like [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lU4LRKy57zs&t=539.76s)]
*  little side genre and hobby that like some people like. But actually now it's something that like a [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lU4LRKy57zs&t=543.2800000000001s)]
*  lot of people actually really enjoy because there's just many stories that you can tell through the [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lU4LRKy57zs&t=547.44s)]
*  media. And then the other thing I think people didn't realize is like, the fan base kind of [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lU4LRKy57zs&t=550.96s)]
*  keeps to itself. And so like anime fans are extremely, extremely passionate. And you can [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lU4LRKy57zs&t=555.12s)]
*  just like look at the numbers of like how much anime fans spend on like figurines and merch [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lU4LRKy57zs&t=559.36s)]
*  and games and so forth. But they don't, they keep it to themselves, right? And they like [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lU4LRKy57zs&t=565.52s)]
*  spend it within their community rather than bringing it out to like a wider community. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lU4LRKy57zs&t=569.92s)]
*  Because I think there was still that stigma before. Whereas now it's like changing. It's sort of [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lU4LRKy57zs&t=573.52s)]
*  similar to gaming, right? Like when Fortnite got big and football players started doing [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lU4LRKy57zs&t=577.04s)]
*  Fortnite dances, like then you know, like gaming is also going mainstream. I think this similar [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lU4LRKy57zs&t=580.5600000000001s)]
*  thing is kind of happening to anime now. Yeah, definitely. And I'm curious to hear your take [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lU4LRKy57zs&t=584.96s)]
*  on who you think you could say wins or really, you know, dominates this genre as we move forward. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lU4LRKy57zs&t=589.28s)]
*  There's obviously big giants like EA or Tencent that have been around forever. I think you [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lU4LRKy57zs&t=595.1999999999999s)]
*  mentioned miHoYo. Is that how you pronounce it? Yeah, miHoYo. miHoYo, which has been around since [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lU4LRKy57zs&t=600.24s)]
*  2011. So a little newer, but still around for a decade or so. But then I assume there's still [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lU4LRKy57zs&t=606.9599999999999s)]
*  room for new developers. How would you think about that? And also what lessons can developers learn [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lU4LRKy57zs&t=612.0799999999999s)]
*  from the success or the rise of anime? Yeah, I think one, it's important to be a devout [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lU4LRKy57zs&t=617.92s)]
*  follower of the medium to be successful. And so I think one of the reasons miHoYo was so successful [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lU4LRKy57zs&t=627.28s)]
*  is their tagline is literally otaku save the world. And so it's just a bunch of, it was started by a [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lU4LRKy57zs&t=631.68s)]
*  bunch of college kids who are just super passionate about the medium. And they're very specific things [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lU4LRKy57zs&t=636.64s)]
*  about the genre that you have to get right. Such as like, I think miHoYo really gets right, like [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lU4LRKy57zs&t=640.7199999999999s)]
*  the specific character design of a lot of its characters. It gets right a lot of the like [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lU4LRKy57zs&t=645.44s)]
*  archetypes of like, oh, this is a tsundere. This is a little sister type of character. There's a [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lU4LRKy57zs&t=650.24s)]
*  lot of like archetypes that you have to get right to make sure that you're doing right by the genre, [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lU4LRKy57zs&t=656.24s)]
*  essentially, and doing right by its fan base. And so I think miHoYo was super successful at that. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lU4LRKy57zs&t=660.32s)]
*  And then they also built up its capabilities over time. So some of the first Honkai games [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lU4LRKy57zs&t=664.48s)]
*  did progressively better, but nothing at like billion dollar scale. And eventually they built [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lU4LRKy57zs&t=670.8800000000001s)]
*  up the tech and capabilities to build Genshin, which is now a billion dollar scale, but took [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lU4LRKy57zs&t=674.72s)]
*  like several hundred million dollars to make. And so it takes a while to like build up to that genre [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lU4LRKy57zs&t=679.36s)]
*  and that scale. And so I think new developers have to like spend time with it. But I think what's also [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lU4LRKy57zs&t=684.4s)]
*  great about anime is just like, it's not as expensive of a medium to develop because like, [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lU4LRKy57zs&t=689.44s)]
*  a lot of it isn't even about the gameplay. A lot of it's about like the art and the story and so [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lU4LRKy57zs&t=694.64s)]
*  forth. And so you're not building something as deep as like an MMO per se, which might cost you [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lU4LRKy57zs&t=698.8000000000001s)]
*  several hundred million dollars. You can build like more casual like mobile things that are like [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lU4LRKy57zs&t=703.44s)]
*  cheaper to develop and cheaper to put out to market. And it's just like an art style, right? [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lU4LRKy57zs&t=707.9200000000001s)]
*  And so you can put out many different types of things. And so I think to answer your question, [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lU4LRKy57zs&t=711.36s)]
*  I think both big players like miHoYo will continue to generate new hits such as like [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lU4LRKy57zs&t=716.48s)]
*  Honkai Star Rail launches here. But then also I think there's a lot of opportunity for innovation. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lU4LRKy57zs&t=722.0s)]
*  And we've been on a few companies in that space, similar to so Pado Labs and also Odyssey [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lU4LRKy57zs&t=726.32s)]
*  Interactive are both building like anime style games. One is building an anime action RPG and [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lU4LRKy57zs&t=732.96s)]
*  other one launched in Megastrikers, which is like Table Hockey League of Legends. And so we're pretty [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lU4LRKy57zs&t=737.76s)]
*  excited for both. We believe that both startup devs and large companies can have a lot of [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lU4LRKy57zs&t=742.64s)]
*  potential in the space. Awesome. And I mean, just to close that out, the style itself can [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lU4LRKy57zs&t=747.76s)]
*  probably be enabled by some of the new technologies that are coming online or becoming [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lU4LRKy57zs&t=755.2s)]
*  more omnipresent. So AI, XR, what are your thoughts on how those new technologies impact [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lU4LRKy57zs&t=759.44s)]
*  the system and maybe help us invent the new next wave of anime? Yeah, I think AI is definitely an [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lU4LRKy57zs&t=763.7600000000001s)]
*  obvious one for anime because it's a 2D art style and it's a very known art style. And so [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lU4LRKy57zs&t=772.1600000000001s)]
*  the AI is very coherent and can generate very good like assets for the medium. And so you can [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lU4LRKy57zs&t=778.32s)]
*  look at things like Niji Journey, which is a fork of Mid Journey and probably the most common [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lU4LRKy57zs&t=783.9200000000001s)]
*  anime 2D art asset generation right now. And so I'm pretty sure that many people will be [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lU4LRKy57zs&t=788.88s)]
*  generating both mods and fan art, but also people will be using this in a production setting to get [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lU4LRKy57zs&t=795.0400000000001s)]
*  anime games out for cheaper and getting them out at very high quality. So I think that will [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lU4LRKy57zs&t=800.8000000000001s)]
*  definitely happen for sure. On XR, I mean, you can look at the success of like Pokemon Go, for [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lU4LRKy57zs&t=805.2s)]
*  instance. I think XR is like an interesting medium and we'll have to see what kind of games come out [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lU4LRKy57zs&t=809.6s)]
*  of the medium. But for large brands, such as like Pokemon, that I think it's like a very innovative [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lU4LRKy57zs&t=814.4s)]
*  use case for like, hey, we got out of the wild, we collect Pokemon out anywhere. And it's just like [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lU4LRKy57zs&t=820.3199999999999s)]
*  living your core fantasy that you had when you were a child. I don't think XR will necessarily, [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lU4LRKy57zs&t=825.28s)]
*  like I'm not sure exactly what will come of XR because like we don't know what we don't know. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lU4LRKy57zs&t=831.04s)]
*  And I'm sure people will come up with way more inventive things than I can come up with. So I'm [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lU4LRKy57zs&t=835.92s)]
*  just excited to see like how the platform develops and see what kind of new devs make like cool new [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lU4LRKy57zs&t=840.0799999999999s)]
*  game loops on the platform. All right, I hope you enjoyed this big idea. We do have a lot more on [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lU4LRKy57zs&t=844.16s)]
*  the way, including a new age of maritime exploration that takes advantage of AI and computer vision, [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lU4LRKy57zs&t=849.6s)]
*  plus AI versus games that never end, and whether voice first apps may finally be having their [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lU4LRKy57zs&t=855.92s)]
*  moment. By the way, if you want to see our full list of 40 plus big ideas today, you can head on [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lU4LRKy57zs&t=861.6s)]
