Video Description: The question of what is real online is increasingly difficult to answer. Most people would agree that an unedited photo is "real." But what about an edited photo? How about a highly edited photo? Reality is a sliding scale that becomes increasingly fuzzy when AI is involved. Trevor McFedries and Isaac Bratzel think digital humans are just as much a part of that shared reality as any other image AI creates.

# Redefining Reality with the Creators of Lil Miquela
**The a16z Podcast:** [April 21, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfQXoWs5qt4)
*  Do you guys see that being the case where with enough time, like that is the reality [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfQXoWs5qt4&t=0.0s)]
*  where like most things that we see online are not quote unquote real? [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfQXoWs5qt4&t=8.28s)]
*  And then also how does that change our relationship with the things that we see online? [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfQXoWs5qt4&t=13.56s)]
*  I mean, I think we could argue about real and reality, you know, at video, right? [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfQXoWs5qt4&t=18.48s)]
*  Yeah, I looked at my Instagram feed, and it's a lot of like, cryptid pranks or things that [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfQXoWs5qt4&t=23.44s)]
*  are, you know, led to make people believe that are real. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfQXoWs5qt4&t=29.52s)]
*  It, you know, people that have been highly altered in situation and context and presented [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfQXoWs5qt4&t=32.08s)]
*  as real like sitting on a private jet when you don't actually own that jet. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfQXoWs5qt4&t=36.32s)]
*  Okay. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfQXoWs5qt4&t=40.08s)]
*  And so I think I think the sliding scale of reality will probably continue to move in [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfQXoWs5qt4&t=41.08s)]
*  the direction it's been heading in. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfQXoWs5qt4&t=45.24s)]
*  But beyond that, you know, the thing that I'm most excited about is this kind of race [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfQXoWs5qt4&t=47.04s)]
*  to the bottom and a lot of media is going to like that bottom is going to hit far quicker [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfQXoWs5qt4&t=52.14s)]
*  because of AI. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfQXoWs5qt4&t=56.8s)]
*  It's going to be really easy to be good at things. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfQXoWs5qt4&t=57.8s)]
*  Yeah, good at making music, good at making visual art, good at, you know, creating content. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfQXoWs5qt4&t=60.199999999999996s)]
*  It's going to be really hard to be excellent. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfQXoWs5qt4&t=65.52s)]
*  And because, you know, models effectively are backward looking data kind of begets more [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfQXoWs5qt4&t=67.03999999999999s)]
*  data and you're going to have some like nasty feedback loops, not entirely dissimilar from [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfQXoWs5qt4&t=71.56s)]
*  like what happened to Netflix when they kind of woke up. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfQXoWs5qt4&t=75.64s)]
*  And one day everyone realized that every show was a chef's table for a different industry. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfQXoWs5qt4&t=78.4s)]
*  And they're like, wait, I like this format. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfQXoWs5qt4&t=82.67999999999999s)]
*  Clearly the algorithm said it works, but I don't feel I don't feel like I've gained any [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfQXoWs5qt4&t=85.52s)]
*  nutrients from this. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfQXoWs5qt4&t=90.2s)]
*  I've just kind of been satiated and I'm looking for nutrients. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfQXoWs5qt4&t=91.28s)]
*  And so I think we're going to have rapid ascent. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfQXoWs5qt4&t=94.36s)]
*  They think feel better on the server to go looking for substance. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfQXoWs5qt4&t=98.36s)]
*  And that's when I think they're really supposed to go rise to the top. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfQXoWs5qt4&t=101.52s)]
*  They can augment this technology with unique skill sets. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfQXoWs5qt4&t=104.28s)]
*  Do you think that maybe sometimes people misunderstand or misaligned substance with what we just talked [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfQXoWs5qt4&t=108.2s)]
*  about, like reality? [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfQXoWs5qt4&t=115.0s)]
*  Because I could see how people over time will be like, OK, my response to this, everything [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfQXoWs5qt4&t=116.12s)]
*  feels fake. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfQXoWs5qt4&t=121.84s)]
*  I want, again, like things that are truly in like meat space. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfQXoWs5qt4&t=122.84s)]
*  And that's what they look for. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfQXoWs5qt4&t=128.6s)]
*  But to your point, just because it's in meat space doesn't mean it's like real and has [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfQXoWs5qt4&t=129.64s)]
*  substance. Right. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfQXoWs5qt4&t=134.08s)]
*  And so it can be just as manufactured and less creative than actually something that [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfQXoWs5qt4&t=135.2s)]
*  is technically virtual, but has this dimension to it, has this depth, this creativity to [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfQXoWs5qt4&t=141.0s)]
*  it. And so I just wanted to double click on that. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfQXoWs5qt4&t=147.48000000000002s)]
*  Like, I guess that relationship. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfQXoWs5qt4&t=149.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfQXoWs5qt4&t=151.52s)]
*  If you have the question that's been posed for a very long time, I think, you know, even [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfQXoWs5qt4&t=152.52s)]
*  since the emergence of contemporary art, right? [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfQXoWs5qt4&t=155.56s)]
*  You have this constant dialogue where it's like mom and dad walk into the museum and [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfQXoWs5qt4&t=158.68s)]
*  they're like, what are these scribbles? [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfQXoWs5qt4&t=162.44s)]
*  A three year old could do that. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfQXoWs5qt4&t=163.72s)]
*  You know? [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfQXoWs5qt4&t=165.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfQXoWs5qt4&t=166.28s)]
*  And then they walk in front of this like photo real landscaping and they're like, no, that [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfQXoWs5qt4&t=167.28s)]
*  that's something I would pay for because they associate the ability to kind of like take [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfQXoWs5qt4&t=171.11999999999998s)]
*  an image from someone's eye and translate it onto a page with like craft and skill. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfQXoWs5qt4&t=174.44s)]
*  And I think people are constantly doing the same, right? [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfQXoWs5qt4&t=180.32s)]
*  There aren't really good ways of understanding what is good and what is bad. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfQXoWs5qt4&t=182.2s)]
*  It's so subjective that people are looking for concrete measures of what is good and [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfQXoWs5qt4&t=186.35999999999999s)]
*  what is bad. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfQXoWs5qt4&t=190.32s)]
*  And authenticity is one that's been tossed around quite a bit. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfQXoWs5qt4&t=191.32s)]
*  And I think people look for things that resonate as authentic and often associate them with [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfQXoWs5qt4&t=194.72s)]
*  like they're playing an instrument, they have a craft or they're doing. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfQXoWs5qt4&t=199.52s)]
*  And I think the reality is some of the most authentic things in the world to me are like [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfQXoWs5qt4&t=202.88000000000002s)]
*  K-pop where it's entirely scripted and fictional, but it's presented in our super authentic [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfQXoWs5qt4&t=206.76000000000002s)]
*  way and saying like, hey, they're going to be so entertaining. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfQXoWs5qt4&t=211.48000000000002s)]
*  We've plucked the most beautiful kids from Korean middle schools, give them the best [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfQXoWs5qt4&t=214.72s)]
*  choreographers and the best songs. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfQXoWs5qt4&t=218.12s)]
*  And I've taught them to speak like Justin Timberlake. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfQXoWs5qt4&t=220.08s)]
*  Like you're going to love it. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfQXoWs5qt4&t=221.76000000000002s)]
*  And there's no deception there. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfQXoWs5qt4&t=222.96s)]
*  And I think that like young people resonate with that. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfQXoWs5qt4&t=225.32000000000002s)]
*  I think it's harder for adults who have been kind of primed on these ways of understanding [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfQXoWs5qt4&t=227.6s)]
*  contemporary art. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfQXoWs5qt4&t=232.72s)]
*  And I think ads, technology evolves in ways of kind of like changing those rules of all [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfQXoWs5qt4&t=234.64000000000001s)]
*  they feel very uncomfortable and fall back on the kind of like frameworks they understand. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfQXoWs5qt4&t=240.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfQXoWs5qt4&t=244.28s)]
*  And actually these virtual influencers, I think are biggest in Korea and parts of Asia, [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfQXoWs5qt4&t=245.28s)]
*  which is interesting. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfQXoWs5qt4&t=249.84s)]
*  It's maybe a cultural thing, maybe it's an age thing. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfQXoWs5qt4&t=250.84s)]
*  So yeah, it's fascinating to. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfQXoWs5qt4&t=253.92000000000002s)]
*  I like that you use the word deception because we're all being deceived in ways and in terms [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfQXoWs5qt4&t=255.79999999999998s)]
*  of what's being put in front of us. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfQXoWs5qt4&t=260.03999999999996s)]
*  But like we do fall back on these easy mechanics of like, is it real or is it not? [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfQXoWs5qt4&t=261.56s)]
*  Yeah, 100%. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfQXoWs5qt4&t=266.92s)]
*  I think we talked about this earlier as a broad of like nobody's got to like see a movie [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfQXoWs5qt4&t=267.92s)]
*  of Mickey Mouse or the early days and be like, oh, this isn't real. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfQXoWs5qt4&t=271.46s)]
*  How dare you guys try to present this as real, right? [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfQXoWs5qt4&t=274.64s)]
*  Too clear. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfQXoWs5qt4&t=277.52s)]
*  And when the lights are to get blurred, at least for those of us who like are used to [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfQXoWs5qt4&t=278.52s)]
*  something different, we have a lot of hangups or reactions to things or like misunderstandings [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfQXoWs5qt4&t=282.48s)]
*  of what they are. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfQXoWs5qt4&t=286.92s)]
*  And to me, it all comes back to storytelling. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfQXoWs5qt4&t=287.92s)]
*  It comes back to me thinking that storytelling is one of the most important things that we [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfQXoWs5qt4&t=290.44s)]
*  have as humans and the way we connect with others, the way that we evolve emotionally [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfQXoWs5qt4&t=294.52000000000004s)]
*  and all these other things. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfQXoWs5qt4&t=298.92s)]
*  I think it's just one of the most unique things about us as animals that depresses from anything [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfQXoWs5qt4&t=299.92s)]
*  else. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfQXoWs5qt4&t=303.40000000000003s)]
*  And I think that enhancing our ability to tell those stories, especially with the world [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfQXoWs5qt4&t=304.40000000000003s)]
*  that I see coming, right? [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfQXoWs5qt4&t=308.2s)]
*  This more virtual world is more inclusive, this three dimensional state of computing [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfQXoWs5qt4&t=309.56s)]
*  metaversity, you call it. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfQXoWs5qt4&t=313.46s)]
*  I view having digital humans be able to be able to tell those stories as an essential [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfQXoWs5qt4&t=314.8s)]
*  piece of that. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfQXoWs5qt4&t=319.04s)]
*  Right. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfQXoWs5qt4&t=320.04s)]
*  And I want to help make that look a certain way and feel a certain way and allow people [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfQXoWs5qt4&t=321.04s)]
*  to tell stories in this new way. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfQXoWs5qt4&t=323.44s)]
*  So when you think of it that way, all this other stuff feels like noise. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfQXoWs5qt4&t=325.48s)]
*  Right. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfQXoWs5qt4&t=327.92s)]
*  Well, yeah, I'm actually curious from both of you over the numerous years you've been [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfQXoWs5qt4&t=328.92s)]
*  doing this. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfQXoWs5qt4&t=332.52s)]
*  What pushback did you see early on? [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfQXoWs5qt4&t=334.08s)]
*  And also, have you seen any of that pushback change? [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfQXoWs5qt4&t=336.08s)]
*  These ideas around ethics, what's real, what's not? [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfQXoWs5qt4&t=339.08000000000004s)]
*  Should you be doing this? [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfQXoWs5qt4&t=341.64000000000004s)]
*  I mean, yeah, so many. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfQXoWs5qt4&t=342.64000000000004s)]
*  That was part of the premise, though, is that we were going to be first to the door and [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfQXoWs5qt4&t=344.48s)]
*  catch all the arrows. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfQXoWs5qt4&t=347.48s)]
*  Like, we were going to make all the mistakes quite publicly. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfQXoWs5qt4&t=348.48s)]
*  But I think the really lovely part about that is that we get to kind of set the tone for [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfQXoWs5qt4&t=352.40000000000003s)]
*  how these things are understood going forward. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfQXoWs5qt4&t=356.48s)]
*  It was pretty clear that people were going to leverage generative media, virtual influencers, [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfQXoWs5qt4&t=358.12s)]
*  virtual characters to shape our reality. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfQXoWs5qt4&t=363.12s)]
*  It's too tempting not to. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfQXoWs5qt4&t=367.0s)]
*  And so how do we go and kind of set some boundaries and some ways of behaving such that people [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfQXoWs5qt4&t=370.0s)]
*  follow in our path and kind of make things that are maybe more noble and righteous and [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfQXoWs5qt4&t=375.16s)]
*  other things that could have been done? [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfQXoWs5qt4&t=378.72s)]
*  That said, some really obvious things. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfQXoWs5qt4&t=380.4s)]
*  I mean, I think people were really concerned about virtual characters and people having [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfQXoWs5qt4&t=382.04s)]
*  accounts. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfQXoWs5qt4&t=388.88s)]
*  Right? [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfQXoWs5qt4&t=389.88s)]
*  Like, it seems quite silly now. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfQXoWs5qt4&t=390.88s)]
*  They're like, wait a minute, how can this fake person have a verified account? [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfQXoWs5qt4&t=391.88s)]
*  At some point, you had to kind of come into like, wait a minute, like, what is Coca-Cola, [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfQXoWs5qt4&t=396.52s)]
*  if not a fiction? [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfQXoWs5qt4&t=400.6s)]
*  And why do they have a blue checkmark? [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfQXoWs5qt4&t=402.36s)]
*  They were interested in making like Startup Land, like what was like Startup L. Jackson, [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfQXoWs5qt4&t=404.2s)]
*  or like all these Twitter accounts that were like parodies. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfQXoWs5qt4&t=407.64s)]
*  And so a lot of those things feel quite passe now. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfQXoWs5qt4&t=410.44s)]
*  They're interesting conversations that I think are happening around AI, NFTs that feel very [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfQXoWs5qt4&t=413.96s)]
*  familiar to what we did, where it's like, this is new and scary, and I don't like it. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfQXoWs5qt4&t=419.28000000000003s)]
*  So I'm going to be upset about it, even though I'm like uninformed about it. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfQXoWs5qt4&t=424.4s)]
*  And so I think that's going to be persistent forever as over time window shifts. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfQXoWs5qt4&t=427.67999999999995s)]
*  But a lot of things that we did feel quite passe right now, where it was like a blue [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfQXoWs5qt4&t=431.91999999999996s)]
*  checkmark next to us. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfQXoWs5qt4&t=436.4s)]
*  So you're like, yeah, that's fine. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfQXoWs5qt4&t=437.4s)]
*  Totally OK. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfQXoWs5qt4&t=438.4s)]
