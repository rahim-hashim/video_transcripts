*  investments in the companies discussed in this podcast. For more details, including a link to [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1NGCapnyn0&t=86.72s)]
*  our investments, please see a16z.com slash disclosures. Hi, I'm Kimberly Tan. I'm an [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1NGCapnyn0&t=91.6s)]
*  investing partner at Andreessen Horowitz on the American Dynamism and the Enterprise team. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1NGCapnyn0&t=101.67999999999999s)]
*  And this is my big idea for 2024. I believe that in 2024, we'll likely see new applications of [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1NGCapnyn0&t=106.8s)]
*  computer vision and video intelligence in the real world. I think leveraging insights from video [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1NGCapnyn0&t=113.28s)]
*  data has become pretty commonplace in the enterprise to help companies make better informed [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1NGCapnyn0&t=118.47999999999999s)]
*  business decisions. But this capability could be even more powerful in the real world given [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1NGCapnyn0&t=123.03999999999999s)]
*  how rich and comprehensive the nature of the available data is. However, many industries today [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1NGCapnyn0&t=128.07999999999998s)]
*  still lack modern systems to actually capture and make sense of that video. And oftentimes, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1NGCapnyn0&t=134.08s)]
*  customers actually have no existing video infrastructure or use pretty legacy video systems [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1NGCapnyn0&t=139.20000000000002s)]
*  that are difficult to integrate if you actually want to use modern software. So we see businesses [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1NGCapnyn0&t=144.32000000000002s)]
*  tackling this problem by leveraging a hardware and software model, allowing them to sell both the [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1NGCapnyn0&t=149.68s)]
*  hardware video cameras as well as the software to customers. These businesses often tailor the go [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1NGCapnyn0&t=154.64000000000001s)]
*  to market approach to target a very specific customer and best serve those particular needs. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1NGCapnyn0&t=159.68s)]
*  So for instance, companies like Flock Safety are examples of this hardware and software model where [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1NGCapnyn0&t=164.4s)]
*  they've built large businesses around keeping residential neighborhoods and schools safe, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1NGCapnyn0&t=169.6s)]
*  respectively, for example. And we think that the same success could be found in other industries, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1NGCapnyn0&t=173.92000000000002s)]
*  such as, for example, transportation, industrial, agriculture, mining. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1NGCapnyn0&t=179.60000000000002s)]
*  All right, Kimberly. So this, in a way, is a whole new twist on the idea of software is eating the [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1NGCapnyn0&t=183.76000000000002s)]
*  world. In this case, it's software is eating the physical world in a way. So maybe you could just [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1NGCapnyn0&t=188.96s)]
*  give us a sense of just how much video is actually currently being captured. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1NGCapnyn0&t=194.24s)]
*  Yeah, definitely. And by the way, I think software eating the physical world is a great [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1NGCapnyn0&t=198.4s)]
*  articulation of the broader American dynamism thesis that we have at the firm that we're really [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1NGCapnyn0&t=202.48000000000002s)]
*  excited to invest behind. I would say there's a vast amount of video data that is being captured, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1NGCapnyn0&t=206.32s)]
*  just given the general prevalence of cameras, either on smartphones or just in a lot of places [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1NGCapnyn0&t=212.48000000000002s)]
*  that we live our day-to-day lives. And I think the real question is how much of that data is [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1NGCapnyn0&t=218.0s)]
*  actually being captured and utilized in some interesting way versus just passively existing [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1NGCapnyn0&t=222.32s)]
*  on different devices and not actually being analyzed or processed in any way. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1NGCapnyn0&t=228.4s)]
*  Yeah, I think that makes sense. And I think we're all very familiar with how much data each of us [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1NGCapnyn0&t=232.08s)]
*  individually is capturing. But what unlocks in the hardware or the software to process the data [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1NGCapnyn0&t=235.84s)]
*  actually allow us to better leverage this video and also maybe have contributed to just how much [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1NGCapnyn0&t=241.76s)]
*  data is being collected. I would say the reason why I'm particularly excited about this thesis [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1NGCapnyn0&t=247.92s)]
*  in the next year or so is I feel it gets the confluence of a lot of things that are finally [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1NGCapnyn0&t=254.39999999999998s)]
*  good enough that we're always on the cusp of being possible but now have hit some cliff that [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1NGCapnyn0&t=259.2s)]
*  we can see really large venture scale outcomes. So for example, just like the proliferation of [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1NGCapnyn0&t=265.44s)]
*  cameras and availability of videos, there's just more cameras getting installed for different use [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1NGCapnyn0&t=270.64s)]
*  cases where the insights aren't being leveraged as widely as they could. So like I mentioned, [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1NGCapnyn0&t=274.8s)]
*  either on people's smartphones, there's always home nest cameras that are getting built out. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1NGCapnyn0&t=279.28000000000003s)]
*  There's cameras in people's workplaces, traffic cameras, et cetera. And I think the availability [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1NGCapnyn0&t=284.8s)]
*  of actually just even having the data there is one thing that we're reaching a tipping point on. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1NGCapnyn0&t=290.0s)]
*  The second is I would say that tech just becoming broadly more cost-efficient and available. So [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1NGCapnyn0&t=295.04s)]
*  first through cloud cost dropping such that you can actually do more computation in the cloud, [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1NGCapnyn0&t=303.52s)]
*  which has historically been a barrier given just how much data there is residing in video and how [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1NGCapnyn0&t=308.32s)]
*  expensive it is to process that data. And then secondly, on that point, increases in edge [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1NGCapnyn0&t=313.91999999999996s)]
*  computing capacity through cheaper chips and camera quality per dollar, allowing you to [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1NGCapnyn0&t=319.68s)]
*  run more complex and larger models on better cameras at lower cost and thus reducing any [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1NGCapnyn0&t=325.59999999999997s)]
*  bandwidth constraints you would have had in actually sending it to the cloud. So I think [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1NGCapnyn0&t=332.24s)]
*  the tech becoming more efficient is a second reason why we're really excited. The third would [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1NGCapnyn0&t=336.96000000000004s)]
*  be just broadly innovation on the models themselves. So everybody I feel like now knows Transformers and [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1NGCapnyn0&t=342.32s)]
*  how exciting it's been for generative AI innovations that we're seeing in things like ChatGPT. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1NGCapnyn0&t=348.72s)]
*  And while Transformers were designed for language tasks initially, they've actually been applied in [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1NGCapnyn0&t=354.32s)]
*  vision applications as well and works quite well for things like image classification and object [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1NGCapnyn0&t=360.24s)]
*  detection versus the status quo previously. So I think seeing Transformers applied in the vision [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1NGCapnyn0&t=365.68s)]
*  space will be really exciting. Just see through using something like generative AI where you can [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1NGCapnyn0&t=371.92s)]
*  query with natural language instead of having to write a bunch of code to actually look through it [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1NGCapnyn0&t=376.48s)]
*  and understand it in a meaningful way. Totally. I also think there's just like a business model [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1NGCapnyn0&t=380.48s)]
*  understanding question, which a lot of people thought for a long time that selling into these [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1NGCapnyn0&t=384.48s)]
*  difficult verticals was tough. I think now that we have companies like Flox Safety proving that it [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1NGCapnyn0&t=388.32s)]
*  is possible, people can apply those lessons into other verticals where it hasn't currently been [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1NGCapnyn0&t=393.28s)]
*  applied yet. Absolutely. So it sounds like there is an element of the cost curve changing elements [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1NGCapnyn0&t=398.88s)]
*  of innovation and specifically LLMs changing the game and maybe through that business models [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1NGCapnyn0&t=404.48s)]
*  evolving. Could you speak to maybe some of the applications that you think can emerge here? I [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1NGCapnyn0&t=409.44s)]
*  mean, you mentioned transportation, agriculture, industrials and mining. Give us a sense of the [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1NGCapnyn0&t=414.08s)]
*  types of applications that might sprout from these different factors coming together. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1NGCapnyn0&t=419.59999999999997s)]
*  Yeah. I want to preface by saying there's probably like way more than we can even envision. So these [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1NGCapnyn0&t=425.59999999999997s)]
*  are just examples that I think are exciting. But in transportation, for example, there's [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1NGCapnyn0&t=429.76s)]
*  a lot of back and forth that happens with just essentially confirming that you're giving the [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1NGCapnyn0&t=434.64s)]
*  right item to the right person at the right time and charge the correct amount. And today, [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1NGCapnyn0&t=439.2s)]
*  a lot of that is done through very manual emails, invoice processing, reconciliation, confirmation [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1NGCapnyn0&t=444.24s)]
*  of receipt of items, compliance on specific tariffs, et cetera. And a lot of that through [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1NGCapnyn0&t=450.56s)]
*  computer vision, you can identify that this was the item that we gave to this person at this time [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1NGCapnyn0&t=456.24s)]
*  and just cut out a lot of that inefficiency. I think industrials and like other like pretty [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1NGCapnyn0&t=460.48s)]
*  large scale industries like that, there's a lot of labor or OSHA compliance on workplace safety [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1NGCapnyn0&t=468.88s)]
*  and conditions that have to be met that inspectors come by. You often have to fill out all these [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1NGCapnyn0&t=474.56s)]
*  checklists and make sure. And through computer vision, none of which requires actually monitoring [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1NGCapnyn0&t=479.6s)]
*  the people themselves, you can make sure that the conditions are safe for the folks who work there. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1NGCapnyn0&t=483.68s)]
*  And then in something like agriculture, you know, the bread and butter of that industry is [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1NGCapnyn0&t=488.15999999999997s)]
*  livestock or crops or whatever you're growing. And I think there's a lot of insights that you can be [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1NGCapnyn0&t=492.24s)]
*  gained without having to have somebody manually looking at it all the time about making sure that [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1NGCapnyn0&t=496.56s)]
*  the weather conditions are correct or the crops are healthy and such. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1NGCapnyn0&t=501.28000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, I think that makes a lot of sense. And I think people can easily imagine those use cases. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1NGCapnyn0&t=506.08s)]
*  But what about the use cases where this video is deeply ingrained in our everyday lives? I think [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1NGCapnyn0&t=510.8s)]
*  the natural question as it relates to that scenario is how we avoid the kind of intelligence that [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1NGCapnyn0&t=516.0s)]
*  is a slippery slope into a Big Brother scenario or something like that. How do you see, [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1NGCapnyn0&t=524.16s)]
*  or how would you calm those concerns? Or how do you see regulation potentially playing a role [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1NGCapnyn0&t=530.0799999999999s)]
*  in this maybe video centric world that you're describing? [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1NGCapnyn0&t=534.3199999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I think this is a really important question and topic that all companies in the space and we [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1NGCapnyn0&t=539.28s)]
*  monitor pretty closely. I think privacy should and will continue to be a very important question. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1NGCapnyn0&t=543.92s)]
*  I think it's hard to say how regulations will shake out, but there's a lot of things that [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1NGCapnyn0&t=551.3599999999999s)]
*  companies can do around both data rights and data privacy concerns to make sure who actually owns [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1NGCapnyn0&t=555.28s)]
*  the data at rest. There's lots of things around how long you're actually allowed to store the [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1NGCapnyn0&t=561.4399999999999s)]
*  video for. And even in computer vision itself, what are you tracking? Are you tracking, for example, [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1NGCapnyn0&t=566.9599999999999s)]
*  just the license plate? Are you tracking just the position of a certain piece of equipment at a [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1NGCapnyn0&t=572.88s)]
*  certain time instead of tracking any individual person? I think there's a lot that can be done to [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1NGCapnyn0&t=577.28s)]
*  make sure that people's privacy rights are protected while allowing us to use the technology [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1NGCapnyn0&t=582.8s)]
*  in a way that makes people's lives better. But it is one where I think companies have to work [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1NGCapnyn0&t=588.56s)]
*  very closely with the stakeholders on both the regulatory as well as the personal and business [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1NGCapnyn0&t=592.72s)]
*  side to make sure that everyone feels comfortable. Absolutely. And of course, this is a big idea for [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1NGCapnyn0&t=598.56s)]
*  2024. So we spoke a little bit to this and the different trends coming together. But why do you [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1NGCapnyn0&t=603.76s)]
*  think this is the year where we're really going to see a tipping point in terms of widespread [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1NGCapnyn0&t=609.84s)]
