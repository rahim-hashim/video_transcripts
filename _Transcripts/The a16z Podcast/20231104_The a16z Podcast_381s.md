# When Will Self-Driving Cars Become Mainstream?
**The a16z Podcast:** [November 04, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEpThtnzOmI)
*  It's felt like this is coming for a while, like I almost feel like, you know, the future is here, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEpThtnzOmI&t=0.0s)]
*  like we're seeing this, we're sitting in a car with no driver, and so maybe you could kind of map out [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEpThtnzOmI&t=7.6000000000000005s)]
*  where we are in that kind of arc, the five levels of autonomy, and also, you know, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEpThtnzOmI&t=12.64s)]
*  where we still have left to go. Yeah, certainly. We are in level four right now, so fully autonomous, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEpThtnzOmI&t=19.28s)]
*  as you can see, nobody in the front seat, no expectation of a human to take over, and, you [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEpThtnzOmI&t=25.759999999999998s)]
*  know, in level two and three, it's really, really crucial to communicate the expectations to the [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEpThtnzOmI&t=31.36s)]
*  driver, because it's very easy that during a normal situation, the driver feels, car is kind [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEpThtnzOmI&t=35.92s)]
*  of driving well, so I can, you know, pick up a book and start reading now, that's serious, and there [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEpThtnzOmI&t=40.56s)]
*  is an expectation to take over. So, we are in that level four with a certain scope, so right now, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEpThtnzOmI&t=46.16s)]
*  if we were to begin heavily snowing in SF, which it has, believe it or not, last season, there was [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEpThtnzOmI&t=51.68s)]
*  a little bit of snow, we wouldn't operate there, but level five is truly defined as anywhere, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEpThtnzOmI&t=57.2s)]
*  anytime. Right, I mean, and even the idea of autonomy, people kind of view in this binary way, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEpThtnzOmI&t=63.28s)]
*  right, like the whole idea of levels kind of puts that into perspective, like level two is [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEpThtnzOmI&t=67.6s)]
*  like lane sensing, automatic braking, is level three, we're basically, what we're doing now, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEpThtnzOmI&t=71.52s)]
*  but there would be a human in the front, or how would you define that? No, no, I would say [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEpThtnzOmI&t=76.64s)]
*  a vast difference even between level three and level four, huge, it's almost like a difference [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEpThtnzOmI&t=80.56s)]
*  between driving and flying, I would say, it's a massive difference, because this concept still, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEpThtnzOmI&t=86.0s)]
*  that within seconds you need to take over, versus now we can have this conversation, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEpThtnzOmI&t=93.44s)]
*  you can look at me, right, that would be challenging, right, but the assurance level you need to get to [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEpThtnzOmI&t=97.68s)]
*  for level four is just a universe different, I would say. Okay, so tell me a little bit more about, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEpThtnzOmI&t=103.76s)]
*  you know, the barriers along the way to level four, what would you say, was it the technology, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEpThtnzOmI&t=108.72s)]
*  the regulations, some combination, are there major factors that have really delayed us? [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEpThtnzOmI&t=114.24000000000001s)]
*  The largest challenge I would say was, largely I would call it technology, but I mean two different [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEpThtnzOmI&t=118.56s)]
*  things, one is building the driver itself that can drive under these conditions, and having the high [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEpThtnzOmI&t=124.48s)]
*  grade of, you know, performance, but also measuring that is pretty hard, this smooth sort of early [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEpThtnzOmI&t=130.16s)]
*  stage drive under very tight constraints is now relatively with today's technology, not terribly [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEpThtnzOmI&t=135.92s)]
*  hard to build, but to be able to do that at the scale, you know, 24-7, busy intersections at slow [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEpThtnzOmI&t=142.88s)]
*  speed, but also high speed intersections of Phoenix, so in Phoenix, for example, the streets are wider, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEpThtnzOmI&t=151.04s)]
*  so you don't deal with these narrow situations, but the driving speed is 45, people are sometimes [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEpThtnzOmI&t=157.28s)]
*  going 60 on that, that means you got to see a lot further, so very different sets of challenges, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEpThtnzOmI&t=163.28s)]
*  very diverse ones, and the technology, and it really required the full stack, right, we build [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEpThtnzOmI&t=168.64s)]
*  the hardware, we build the software, because if you built just the software and waited for somebody [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEpThtnzOmI&t=174.16s)]
*  else to deliver the hardware, the speed of learning, the speed of iteration that was necessary to build [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEpThtnzOmI&t=179.2s)]
*  something like this was so steep, it was not feasible, so we had to build the lasers, the cameras, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEpThtnzOmI&t=183.76s)]
*  the radars, and the software on top. Let's talk about safety, right, I mean that is like the [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEpThtnzOmI&t=188.95999999999998s)]
*  foundational piece of whether we can get these cars on the road, right, right, how would you say, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEpThtnzOmI&t=193.6s)]
*  you know, between the regulators, the technologists, like yourself, we're building this, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEpThtnzOmI&t=198.0s)]
*  and then the consumers, the people, the riders, how do each of them view this like concept of safety, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEpThtnzOmI&t=203.84s)]
*  how are you designing the product with that in mind? The analytical and quantitative version of [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEpThtnzOmI&t=210.48000000000002s)]
*  safety, you can say, you know, the nature of collisions you have, the, you know, probability [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEpThtnzOmI&t=216.56s)]
*  of entering into a certain collision under certain circumstances, a lot of complications in there, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEpThtnzOmI&t=222.64000000000001s)]
*  there's the element of risky behavior, you may have gotten lucky that you didn't get into a [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEpThtnzOmI&t=226.88s)]
*  collision, but you undertook risky behavior, and third and finally, do you make the person feel safe, [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEpThtnzOmI&t=231.12s)]
*  so you know, we could be breaking hard anytime we sense a risk, yeah, or we wouldn't feel very safe, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEpThtnzOmI&t=236.96s)]
*  exactly, you wouldn't feel very safe, and I think, and then the fourth layer I would add on top of [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEpThtnzOmI&t=245.36s)]
*  that is, just because you figured out how to drive smoothly, meeting the expectations of a rider, [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEpThtnzOmI&t=251.28s)]
*  you shouldn't falsely promise the true analytical safety either, so for example, you know, designing [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEpThtnzOmI&t=256.64s)]
*  an algorithm whereby you drive smooth on a street could be easy, but you shouldn't over promise that [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEpThtnzOmI&t=264.8s)]
*  you can detect a pedestrian jumping out of a car, that takes real, you know, heavy engineering, that [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEpThtnzOmI&t=269.6s)]
*  consumer may begin believing that, oh, just because it can drive smoothly, it can probably [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEpThtnzOmI&t=276.24s)]
*  protect me from that, and I think being truthful about your capabilities is really, really important. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEpThtnzOmI&t=282.24s)]
*  What does the data say though, can you kind of ground us in, there is a certain number of crashes [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEpThtnzOmI&t=288.08000000000004s)]
*  that humans engage with every single year, and then where the technology is at relative to that? [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEpThtnzOmI&t=292.72s)]
*  I'll give you just two examples from many safety methodologies we employ, East Valley of Phoenix, [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEpThtnzOmI&t=299.68s)]
*  we have been operating for a while, there one thing we did is we took every fatal crash that [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEpThtnzOmI&t=306.16s)]
*  had occurred and re-simulated, and showed that Wemo could avoid that, that was one, you know, [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEpThtnzOmI&t=311.92s)]
*  very specific data set. What we also did is we were the first company ever to cross one million [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEpThtnzOmI&t=316.8s)]
*  fully autonomous miles, miles like this, nobody in the front seat, so there's no debate about what the [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEpThtnzOmI&t=324.24s)]
*  similar, you know, car could have done, it was real miles, in that we published our full crash [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEpThtnzOmI&t=329.52000000000004s)]
*  tags, and there was not a single collision with injury in one million months, not a single one, [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEpThtnzOmI&t=335.6s)]
*  and only two of them would, you know, meet the standards of reportability called CISS, [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEpThtnzOmI&t=341.52s)]
*  so this element of safety, it's not just about when it's driving, [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEpThtnzOmI&t=348.16s)]
*  but it's about caring about safety every second. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEpThtnzOmI&t=351.12s)]
