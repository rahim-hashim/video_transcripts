# 7 Ways to Boost Retention (Both Pre- and Post-AI)
**The a16z Podcast:** [May 31, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM)
*  My estimate is that on average, if you employ some of these combination and these methodologies, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=0.0s)]
*  you're able to move up your what I would I would start with D30. I think you can move that up 10 to 15%. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=5.44s)]
*  Whoa. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=10.64s)]
*  Which is which goes from okay, on my on my list of like 20% D30. That's like, okay, that's good. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=12.08s)]
*  To whopping 35%. That's exceptional. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=18.88s)]
*  We are seeing in this wave of AI, a lot of questions around retention. And I think something [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=24.72s)]
*  that you've pointed out is that, you know, maybe things aren't so different from the last wave [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=29.28s)]
*  of consumer applications, or at least that we can learn from them. Right. And so you're you're an [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=33.52s)]
*  expert in this. What have you seen in terms of the past retention mechanisms that you feel like in [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=38.24s)]
*  consumer wave one can now be maybe applied to consumer wave two? [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=44.72s)]
*  Yeah, this is this is a fun one fun, very fun topic. And it actually came from one of my chats [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=48.16s)]
*  with AI native founder, who was trying to find ways to say, how do I get my product into more [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=54.48s)]
*  consumers hands? It's interesting, because I've said it once before that retention is the you know, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=59.68s)]
*  bread and butter of key consumer products. Because if you don't get users coming back, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=65.84s)]
*  and again, and again, ultimately, you have what I call this like bird forest problem, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=71.44s)]
*  where you went and cut all the trees off, and there's no more new acquisition to do. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=76.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=80.24s)]
*  So ultimately, retention is incredibly important. And it tended to be this [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=80.56s)]
*  metrics that is very difficult to move. And I remember this because I ran a gross product [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=84.64s)]
*  at snap. And when we move when I tell you 1% 100 pips, 1% of retention rate of a D 30, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=89.68s)]
*  that we're tracking, we moved it up by a percent, there was a huge party. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=98.56s)]
*  That that actually led to a very clear incremental value to the company in terms of the daily active [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=103.36s)]
*  users that we're going to keep. And the reduction and any paydads that we would have to do. And it [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=110.08s)]
*  was very, very clear benefit. So that ingrained in me, oh, my god, this this this number is very, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=114.88s)]
*  very difficult to move. Nowadays, because of these methods that are available to consumer founders, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=121.28s)]
*  my estimate is that on average, if you employ some of these combination of these methodologies, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=129.44s)]
*  you're able to move up your what I would I would start with D 30, I think you can move that up 10 [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=134.88s)]
*  to 15%. Whoa, which is which goes from okay, on my on my list of like 20%, D 30. That's like, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=139.52s)]
*  okay, that's good. To whopping 35%. That's exceptional. Yes, yeah. So what I've learned [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=147.12s)]
*  in the past two, two and a half years meeting with excellent founders who are on the front line, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=153.52s)]
*  thinking about different product mechanisms, there has been seven ways that I've seen that, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=158.32000000000002s)]
*  you know, very distinctively, you could employ to move your attention up. And the more what's more, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=164.48000000000002s)]
*  which is really exciting is that I've thought about ways that the new AI native products are [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=170.4s)]
*  actually adopting these. And they're already seeing the benefits. And the said founder that [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=175.36s)]
*  I'm talking about, had actually told me that, oh, after that chat, I employed a bunch of mechanisms [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=180.16s)]
*  and actually my weekly retention shot up by a lot. And that's all the validation I need to publish [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=185.28s)]
*  this. Amazing. Well, let's go through them. So you said you've got seven mechanisms. And as you said, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=192.8s)]
*  we're kind of seeing examples from the past from the earlier traditional consumer wave. And then [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=196.96s)]
*  you're already seeing implementation, which is kind of crazy, because we're so early into this [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=202.16000000000003s)]
*  new wave. So let's start with the first one speed to core product value. What do you mean by that? [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=205.84s)]
*  Retention is made up of two things. In my mind, onboarding matters. If the user comes on on day [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=210.32000000000002s)]
*  zero, and didn't find a product value that they're looking for, they're not going to stay. And you [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=216.56s)]
*  just like lost that user. And it's very, very unlikely that you recover from a low D zero D [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=222.4s)]
*  one retention. It's very difficult to recover from that. So onboarding really matters. And then, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=227.92000000000002s)]
*  you know, making sure that as you onboard someone getting them to experience that core product value [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=232.48000000000002s)]
*  that you're delivering quickly matters a ton. Because the less friction less time lapse you have [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=238.8s)]
*  between opening or starting the product, the better chance you have to retain them. You know, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=244.48000000000002s)]
*  if you just look at traditional companies, traditional is the wrong word, but leading [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=249.12s)]
*  companies, Google, when it first started, and Larry Page was very famous for really, really [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=253.20000000000002s)]
*  hammering this down, where speed of search, shaving milliseconds to search result really [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=258.72s)]
*  mattered. And that really mattered in terms of like drop rate that really mattered in terms of [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=264.32s)]
*  people sticking around and coming back and working on the product. And and sort of that became one of [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=268.08s)]
*  the mantra enough that they started building it into their search ranking. If the how fast the site [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=273.44s)]
*  loads became a factor in relevance, because it's relevant that it actually surprised at how much [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=280.96s)]
*  this impacted exactly. And they wrote this like, you know, blog that said like speed matters, [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=286.8s)]
*  as they think about the AI products. It's interesting, because, you know, we talk a [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=291.2s)]
*  lot about the improvement to an underlying foundational model and what that means what I [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=296.24s)]
*  will actually what that means that the results come to you faster, better, more relevant. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=300.24s)]
*  And there's an example of a AI native companionship product, where they actually did this test where [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=304.88s)]
*  they use GPT one GPT two GPT three, and they actually track the cohort of user retention [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=311.68s)]
*  using each of the models. And it's very clear as a model quality improved, which means you get [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=318.8s)]
*  response faster, the retention out to 90th day of user being activated kept on improving. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=324.64s)]
*  And one of the other sort of ways I think about this, and this is kudos to Arvin at perplexity, [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=331.68s)]
*  is that whenever the state of the art model comes out, he incorporates that into perplexity [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=336.88s)]
*  on the day of if not earlier. And, you know, I was thinking about this, I'm like, oh, that's like [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=343.12s)]
*  incredible velocity, and that that's great. But I actually think what it also does, it makes this [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=348.96s)]
*  product perform much better than anything out there and delivers faster, better, more relevant [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=353.84s)]
*  results. And I think that's part of how the speed to core product value is manifesting in these [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=360.32s)]
*  different types of AI native products. I love that they can see the difference between as you said, [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=366.32s)]
*  GPT one, two, three, four. Let's go to the next one feature gated onboarding. What do you mean [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=369.76s)]
*  about that? So as I said, onboarding matters a lot. Now you can have an onboarding where you gently [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=374.4s)]
*  nudge people like this is how you use the product, have fun, or you can actually really force feed [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=380.08s)]
*  them. And I think what we're seeing is that if you actually gate the usage of the product [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=384.64s)]
*  behind something that users need to do to unlock, I think that actually ends up leading to higher [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=391.68s)]
*  attention, you're exchanging lower conversion to actual product initiation, if you will, [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=398.88s)]
*  because some people will not be willing to go through that onboarding process. The thought [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=404.47999999999996s)]
*  process there is that they probably weren't going to stick around anyways. So you're actually like [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=408.72s)]
*  finding out early that they're not willing to do that. But if they do go through it, you actually [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=413.68s)]
*  see a much higher retention for people who are activated. So the example from prior non AI [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=419.04s)]
*  generation would be the company called Laps. It's a camera app that gives you the feel of the [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=425.52000000000004s)]
*  instant camera, if you will. And what's interesting is essentially a social product. Yeah. And what [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=430.48s)]
*  they actually gated the product usage behind is not only a pretty lengthy onboarding process of [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=436.56s)]
*  how the product works, but also you can't use it unless you invited five new friends. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=441.84s)]
*  Now, what does that do? It's famous for social products where if you have more than five friends [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=447.92s)]
*  on the product, your chances of sticking around is much, much higher. So what this product is doing [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=452.4s)]
*  is actually force building a friend graph that when you come onto the product, you already have [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=456.96s)]
*  value that you're going to find by looking at your friend's content, one out of five, two out of five [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=463.36s)]
*  out of five. So I think that's like a way of building in retention as you go in. I think one of [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=467.76s)]
*  the more recent AI examples would be Vigil.ai. This is a fun product where you get to put a picture of [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=474.8s)]
*  yourself and all you need is an image. And they have certain set of scenes. And one of the more [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=483.28s)]
*  famous scene was Lil Yachty dancing out in stage. And you can very easily overlay anybody's image on [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=489.36s)]
*  it. There have been very different viral moments of Jerem Powell doing a dance after announcing a [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=495.28000000000003s)]
*  rate cut. And those type of examples are so fun. Now, how do you create these? It's magical, [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=502.96000000000004s)]
*  right? You layer on your image. I actually put on my image on one of the famous Guardians of the [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=510.32s)]
*  Galaxy scene where Chris sings Ooh Child in front of his nemesis. Ooh child things will get brighter. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=516.08s)]
*  Yeah, bring it down hard. That's one of my favorite scenes. It's so funny. Now what Vigil does is only [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=524.64s)]
*  available in Discord to create. There are three steps you need to go through to be able to create [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=531.6s)]
*  a Vigil. That includes reading the rules. That also involves actually going through the mechanics [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=537.76s)]
*  of how to build the right sequence in the Discord chat so that you can get that result. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=543.6s)]
*  And only then after completing those steps can you use the product. Now what does that do? Well, [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=548.8000000000001s)]
*  that effectively taught you how to create this forcefully to some extent. And now you have created [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=554.5600000000001s)]
*  it. Voila, the magical moment happened. And now your propensity to come back to the product is a [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=560.88s)]
*  lot higher because it's not foreign to you anymore. And I think that's a very interesting use case of [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=566.96s)]
*  actually putting your core product creation behind sort of a fairly long use rules and [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=572.64s)]
*  understanding how to use the product and actually getting them to create an example. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=579.76s)]
*  A good one too. A good example because they've been trained. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=584.4s)]
*  Exactly. So it's been a very interesting thing to watch. And I think more and more companies with [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=587.1999999999999s)]
*  somewhat of a niche or specific creation flow would benefit from. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=593.6s)]
*  Yeah, I also like the frame of maybe how can you create a product that is so good [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=599.04s)]
*  that people are willing to sit through the friction, right? So the next one, designing [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=603.8399999999999s)]
*  reciprocity. So here, this is one of my favorite ones because this actually underpins probably the [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=608.64s)]
*  highest retention gain that you could get. And this is also one of the things that I don't have [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=614.9599999999999s)]
*  an AI example yet. The idea is give to get. I.e. if you have a product and you haven't contributed [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=620.0799999999999s)]
*  to the product, you don't get it. The example really would be B-real, which is a social product [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=627.84s)]
*  where you can check up on your friend's authentic moments. And it's a fair value exchange. Hey, [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=633.84s)]
*  you don't get to see your friend's authentic moment until you're willing to share yours. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=639.2s)]
*  And I think that's a powerful concept. And the reciprocity is very effective because what it does [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=643.6800000000001s)]
*  is now as a user, I have to create, I have to contribute, to consume. The other interesting [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=650.32s)]
*  thing is if I get any sort of reaction or positive reinforcement of people liking that content, [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=657.04s)]
*  whether it's a like button or comment button, what have you, I get a jolt of joy or dopamine. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=663.5999999999999s)]
*  And I'm more willing to do that on an ongoing basis, which leads to higher retention, which [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=669.5999999999999s)]
*  leads to richer content on the platform and so on and so forth. I think this can actually [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=674.16s)]
*  translate really well into certain AI products where it becomes important for the product to [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=679.28s)]
*  have a rich creation flow. I think we're trained to go to a platform hoping to see of content, [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=685.92s)]
*  feed, what have you. But what if you gated that behind creation? What if people needed to create [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=691.92s)]
*  and actually contribute to the dynamicness of that product before consuming? It won't work for every [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=699.5999999999999s)]
*  single product, but I think you can design it into different AI products or creation and this sort of [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=708.4s)]
*  maintaining a dynamic creation consumption flow within the product can really, really be helpful. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=715.68s)]
*  Yeah, I know. You've got my wheels spinning and maybe it's partially because creators get so much [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=720.32s)]
*  value from these AI tools that they don't actually need to consume as much as in the prior era. But [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=724.4s)]
*  looking forward, the next one is building smart notifications. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=729.36s)]
*  Notification is this one thing where it's tried and true. People know that notification can bring [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=733.52s)]
*  people back. It's a double edge knife, double edge sword, and that you send too much, people turn it [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=738.0s)]
*  off, you are not getting them back. I know this empirically that once you turn a notification off, [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=743.84s)]
*  the chance of something turning that back on is extremely low. Now, what's interesting on [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=749.2800000000001s)]
*  notification is this. When you think of notification, I think there are three different [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=754.1600000000001s)]
*  things to think about, which is who's sending it? Of course, the company is sending it, but who is [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=757.44s)]
*  the perceived sender to the user? That's one. Two is what is in the message? What is the payload? [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=763.0400000000001s)]
*  And then three is what is the frequency? And all three of these interact differently, [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=769.12s)]
*  but I'll give you one example where let's say Snapchat sends happy Earth Day message. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=773.36s)]
*  Well, don't pay me into villain, but I don't actually care much about Earth Day. I don't care [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=781.44s)]
*  why you're telling me this. And in that case, the payload is happy Earth Day. The frequency [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=785.92s)]
*  was this holiday, if you will. And the sender in this case is a company. It's not my friend, [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=791.36s)]
*  because if you snap me and I get a little purple or blue square, I'm not thinking, [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=798.0s)]
*  oh, Snap is sending me another notification. I'm thinking, Steph wants to talk to me. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=806.24s)]
*  This is great. So the perceived sender is very different. Another example would be [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=810.8s)]
*  Portable. If you think you're going to an event and you signed up for it, you RSVP'd, [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=814.8s)]
*  and you get a notification that the venue changed last minute, or it's raining and they're changing [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=819.84s)]
*  the time, or so and so is not going. You want to know that and you get a notification on your SMS [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=825.2s)]
*  that says, guys, instead of eight, we're going to seven. Instead of crowns, king, we're going to some [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=831.36s)]
*  other bar. That's really relevant. And the sender is not portable. The sender is the host. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=835.44s)]
*  Right. Yes. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=841.2s)]
*  So that's really interesting because the more you can move the user's mindset into, oh, this [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=842.24s)]
*  is really useful to me. Oh, the perceived sender isn't necessarily a company. This is actually [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=848.24s)]
*  really useful to me. That's sort of how you shift the mindset and therefore make it a lot less [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=854.24s)]
*  likely for someone to turn off. If you turn on notification on Perplexity, it actually delivers [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=858.88s)]
*  you very relevant news that you might care about. So during the OpenAI reshuffle or saga, [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=865.44s)]
*  a lot of different movements happened. And when you're able to get that news pushed to you really [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=873.04s)]
*  relevantly quickly, you no longer think, oh, why is this product bothering me with notification? [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=878.64s)]
*  I can't believe that just happened. I am so glad I learned it before I learned it on TikTok or [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=884.08s)]
*  Twitter or news. And I think that's sort of a way to build very smart notification that a lot of AI [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=889.1999999999999s)]
*  products can actually build in. What is your take on giving consumers the ability to customize their [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=895.68s)]
*  notifications? As in, is it generally best practice to design your own notifications [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=903.68s)]
*  and send those out as you see fit and also iterate? Or there are some products that will let you say, [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=909.1999999999999s)]
*  you know what, I only want notifications if I'm tagged here. Or maybe I want everything, [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=914.0s)]
*  everything in this kind of community. I think overall, most products won't need to actually go [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=918.8s)]
*  through the granular detail of what you want notification for. But of course, let's think [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=924.16s)]
*  about the commerce company or social products. The commerce company, do you want to notify when [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=930.24s)]
*  I have random sales? Do you want to notify new products? Do you want to get notified for returns [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=934.24s)]
*  or relevant to your order? Well, just my orders, please. Maybe that's the relevant way to think [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=939.04s)]
*  about it. Social products, same thing as you said, it depends how you're using it. Like Instagram, [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=944.8s)]
*  I want to be notified if someone comment on it. If I want to be notified if I have new friends, etc. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=950.8s)]
*  But that type of granular detail initially for AI products, I think is probably less relevant at [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=956.0s)]
*  this moment. And really probably think more about how do I actually deliver value through this [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=963.12s)]
*  notification? So one interesting thing that you asked, so let's actually use the example of [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=970.16s)]
*  character. Character AI has a notification toggle button where do you want to be notified by your [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=975.28s)]
*  companion? What does that even mean? I was just trying to process that. What that means is that [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=981.36s)]
*  I, you know, it's a two-way dialogue actually. But you know, it's a bot or companion that is [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=986.8000000000001s)]
*  governed by LLM. What does it mean for that to reach out to me first? That's so interesting. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=993.44s)]
*  So it's a friend, right? So it's like a very interesting emotional nudge of like, [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=999.84s)]
*  do you think of this being as truly your friend, in which case you would want to hear from them? [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=1006.16s)]
*  First and proactively versus do you want to engage on your own terms or you want to, [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=1012.32s)]
*  you know, engage with the sort of communication with a digital being? So those are the types [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=1017.84s)]
*  of notification where I do think is very nuanced and fun and impactful. That is so interesting. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=1023.04s)]
*  You're basically coding boundaries in a way. Okay, next one, keeping streaks alive. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=1028.56s)]
*  Streaks. This is a well-known example. One pet peeve I have on streaks though is that people think [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=1035.68s)]
*  of it as, oh, gamification. I understand streaks. Let's just put a fire emoji and [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=1041.2s)]
*  a number next to it and it'll be great. It's a, the well-done streaks are a little different. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=1045.76s)]
*  They're very, very effortful. What do you mean by that? Let's say you and I have a streak of [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=1050.72s)]
*  1000. What that meant on Snapchat is I sent you a video, not a text, not a chat, a video, a snap, [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=1057.1200000000001s)]
*  or image, image or video, and you sent me back something in a 24-hour period as well. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=1064.64s)]
*  And streak doesn't appear until three days of doing that. The fact that there is a fire emoji [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=1071.52s)]
*  and 1000 next to it is that we did that nonstop for nearly three years. That is not a like button. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=1077.92s)]
*  That is not a retweet. That is not a heart. That is really, really expensive friendship badge. And [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=1085.76s)]
*  you bet if you break that, I'm not talking to you. So there are ways to think about these streaks as [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=1092.0800000000002s)]
*  something that is very meaningful. That is not just some number behind it. And this is a way to [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=1100.16s)]
*  actually really encourage people to keep coming back to your product. One good example that I [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=1105.76s)]
*  think about is there's a lot of AI journal products like Rosebud or JOT, and it actually [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=1111.76s)]
*  has streak mechanism. And that's helpful. And another language learning app called Speak AI. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=1117.2s)]
*  And it's similar to Duolingo, but it's a language learning based on AI. These products are very [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=1122.4s)]
*  beneficial when they're habituated. Writing journals is proven to be a good thing for your [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=1129.2s)]
*  mental health. Language learning, we know that consistency matters. So when you bake into these [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=1135.6000000000001s)]
*  type of products, even if it's AI native product, if it's habituated, helpful to the users to be [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=1142.24s)]
*  habituated, I think these are the very, very interesting places to start seeing it. And [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=1148.4s)]
*  bonus points if founders can start thinking about streaks as digital signature or display [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=1153.04s)]
*  of something effortful and expensive, not a like button, not a retweet button, [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=1159.92s)]
*  which I tend to think of as cheaper digital signs. Yeah. I mean, I almost think it's identity based [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=1165.04s)]
*  in a way. There are some people, by the way, you can look this up, who have been doing the Duolingo [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=1170.16s)]
*  streak for like a decade. And so for those people, there has to be an identity piece of that where [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=1174.4s)]
*  they're like, yes, it is trying to keep up the streak, but it's also like, I'm a language [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=1180.0s)]
*  learner or I'm dedicated or as you said, I'm a good friend. I'm a good friend. Yeah, exactly. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=1183.6s)]
*  And he or she is a good friend of mine. Yeah. That is unbreakable. Yeah. Awesome. Okay. We've [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=1188.64s)]
*  got two more. The next one is the raps. This is fun. Raps popularized by Spotify year and rap. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=1193.52s)]
*  My number one musician is Hans Zimmer. And I was proud of that. You've got one you can share. Mine [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=1199.92s)]
*  are all embarrassing. I've shared that out quite widely. Raps is interesting because we know [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=1206.48s)]
*  AI or LLMs are good for a few things and they also include summarization. They're very good for that. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=1213.44s)]
*  So I think what we're seeing now is this unique technology that can actually sift through your [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=1221.2s)]
*  behavior, your engagement, what you consume, et cetera, and be able to tease out summarization. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=1227.2s)]
*  Excellent for that. And so I think we're starting to see very interesting behavior [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=1233.2800000000002s)]
*  because if I know if I'm going to have a rap, like I'm excited, I'm going to continue to do [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=1237.6000000000001s)]
*  whatever that thing is or whatever that product is so that I have a pretty cool summary. Or [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=1242.3200000000002s)]
*  that summarization really benefits me. And I think back to the old example when I got my first [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=1248.72s)]
*  American Express card. Year end, they sent like a 20 page document of like what you did, [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=1254.24s)]
*  all the spending that you did. That was not good. That was not helpful. But hey, in the era of LLM, [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=1258.8799999999999s)]
*  we have companies like Oops Finance, where you're able to actually tease out the themes of what's [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=1264.96s)]
*  happening. You could very easily say, hey, like you've been eating out a lot. You've been spending [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=1270.3999999999999s)]
*  a lot of entertainment. You spend a lot of trips or you should probably do XYZ. We want to invest [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=1275.6s)]
*  more. We want to save more. So I think this is one of the other methodologies that I can very easily [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=1281.84s)]
*  see being useful to a lot of new AI native products. Totally. And I think about the equivalent [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=1287.76s)]
*  in Spotify, they'll tell you, right? Like if you're a Hans Zimmer, like top 1% fan, [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=1293.92s)]
*  you feel really good about that. We need Hans Zimmer B-roll. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=1298.24s)]
*  But also you can imagine the same thing like for finance, right? You're in the top, you know, [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=1301.84s)]
*  5% of savers. You're in that you're the top 10% who buys from this brand. Like there's some cool [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=1306.08s)]
*  stuff you can do with that. And we're already seeing that in products like there was a product [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=1311.52s)]
*  called AirBuds and they sort of use the technology to figure out you're the top 1% listener of [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=1316.16s)]
*  Taylor Swift. Yeah, you're sharing that. Yeah, totally. And I guess as you're saying, [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=1321.28s)]
*  AI actually helps us enable that because we no longer need, you no longer need the Spotify [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=1326.88s)]
*  dataset. Exactly. That's really interesting. The final one is status for power users. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=1331.52s)]
*  I know we talked about retention as sort of a broad base, overall user base, you know, thing. But [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=1337.68s)]
*  if you actually go pretty granular, there usually is this like bulwark or extremely healthy users [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=1344.16s)]
*  in any given leading product. Power users, and I'll just give you one example. Let's say MAU, [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=1350.4s)]
*  monthly active user. Whether someone showed up every single day of 30 day period or showed up [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=1355.76s)]
*  once, they're both one Mao. But clearly, surely one is far more valuable than the other. And so [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=1361.3600000000001s)]
*  you start thinking through, how do I actually think about power users? How do I really build [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=1369.36s)]
*  that in? This is interesting and this is helpful to build retention because by giving people and [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=1373.36s)]
*  bestowing some kind of status, if you will, for power users, the more likely you're able to [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=1378.8799999999999s)]
*  incent them to continue that status. So old school examples, again, one way to do that on [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=1383.6799999999998s)]
*  Reddit type of the world is to be a moderator. That's an honor for the community, for the subreddit. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=1389.6799999999998s)]
*  It's an honor. Strava's local legend. That's an honor. You bet your ass like they would want to [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=1395.84s)]
*  stay there. And that's very important. And I think we're already seeing very cool AI examples as [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=1401.6s)]
*  well. One of the companies that sort of focuses on fine-tuned image models and acting as a hub [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=1408.3999999999999s)]
*  for that, there's a company called Sivet AI. It's important for them to have a large density of [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=1414.32s)]
*  fine-tuned image models. And so how do you actually engender that? How do you actually get [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=1421.04s)]
*  creators of these models to want to come back and do more? It's to start bestowing them status and [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=1426.3999999999999s)]
*  leaderboards. And I think we are seeing that type of activity really continue to encourage the power [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=1432.0s)]
*  users to keep coming back and keep contributing to the platform, therefore making it healthy. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=1438.08s)]
*  Another funny example, there's a product called Readwise where it sort of shows how many books [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=1443.28s)]
*  and how many sort of passages you read. And being on top of that list or being a top X percent user [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=1448.88s)]
*  on those tend to be a really important, almost as you said, identity for me. And I think those are [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=1455.5200000000002s)]
*  very interesting ways to keep people from coming back to the product. There's a famous article, [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=1462.4s)]
*  Status of the Service, that was written by Eugene Wei where he says, people are status-sinking [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=1468.4s)]
*  monkeys. And to some extent, that's true. And I think a lot of the AI product, especially [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=1473.2800000000002s)]
*  creativity and contribution matters a lot. It's a very unique thing to be able to bestow and share [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=1478.72s)]
*  with their most excited user base. Yeah. I mean, if you use many of these examples, [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=1486.4s)]
*  like the Strava Local Legends, they would rather be up there than be paid to do the things that [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=1491.1200000000001s)]
*  they're doing. And I think maybe if there's one key takeaway here is as I look down your list of [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=1495.1200000000001s)]
*  seven different mechanisms, they're all free. You need the cycles to actually implement this, but [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=1499.8400000000001s)]
*  this is not something that is rocket science either. And it's not something that you need [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=1505.68s)]
*  a huge budget to implement. These are really things that you can bake into almost any product. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=1510.0s)]
*  And hopefully we'll get an example of, it was designing reciprocity, right? [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=1514.64s)]
*  Reciprocity example. I'm excited to see one too. And I think as you said, these are [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=1517.92s)]
*  not expensive mechanisms, but I think what's interesting is you get to pick what actually [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=1523.1200000000001s)]
*  really boosts the attractiveness of your core product value and really serve that. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=1529.6s)]
*  Yep. Absolutely. Cool. Amazing. Thank you. Thanks for having me. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DisZWEb3bM&t=1535.04s)]
