# Civitai: Open Sourcing AI Art
**The a16z Podcast:** [August 01, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABn8Ti0sxBY)
*  It's a group of people who are putting effort and love into something that can very easily become [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABn8Ti0sxBY&t=0.0s)]
*  livelihoods for them if they had even the smallest way to monetize it based on the number of eyes [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABn8Ti0sxBY&t=5.28s)]
*  they're getting and uses they're getting. It's really about sharing the know-how on how to create [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABn8Ti0sxBY&t=8.72s)]
*  these amazing things and not just the know-how but also the tools themselves. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABn8Ti0sxBY&t=12.72s)]
*  My name is Maxville Holker. I am a COO at Civitie and co-founder. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABn8Ti0sxBY&t=24.560000000000002s)]
*  So I'm Justin Maier. I'm the CEO and co-founder of Civit as well. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABn8Ti0sxBY&t=28.24s)]
*  And CPO and CTO. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABn8Ti0sxBY&t=32.16s)]
*  Lots of things. The joys of a startup, I suppose. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABn8Ti0sxBY&t=33.839999999999996s)]
*  Max introduced me to Mid Journey in that August of 2022 and I fell in love. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABn8Ti0sxBY&t=36.8s)]
*  It was like, hey, it'd be cool to build something where people could use these custom models. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABn8Ti0sxBY&t=44.16s)]
*  People were posting them to Reddit and Discord and they just kind of vanished after that [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABn8Ti0sxBY&t=49.2s)]
*  because they're such ephemeral platforms. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABn8Ti0sxBY&t=54.160000000000004s)]
*  And so it seemed like there was a need for this place where people could [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABn8Ti0sxBY&t=56.0s)]
*  share these things they were making these tools. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABn8Ti0sxBY&t=59.760000000000005s)]
*  We thought maybe we'd get like what, like a thousand users, ten thousand users at most. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABn8Ti0sxBY&t=62.24s)]
*  Things took off from January to March. By March we hit a million users. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABn8Ti0sxBY&t=65.92s)]
*  There was a bunch of people exploring the tech in different pockets around the internet. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABn8Ti0sxBY&t=70.08s)]
*  There was a bunch of disparate Discord communities and people on Reddit. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABn8Ti0sxBY&t=73.52000000000001s)]
*  And we became kind of the center of all of this diverse development happening in this space [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABn8Ti0sxBY&t=77.44s)]
*  because everybody needed the latest and greatest model. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABn8Ti0sxBY&t=82.48s)]
*  And they wanted to be able to post and share it with other people. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABn8Ti0sxBY&t=84.96000000000001s)]
*  And so we kind of acted as this force that brought everybody together around kind of the cause of [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABn8Ti0sxBY&t=86.96000000000001s)]
*  pushing forward open source image tech. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABn8Ti0sxBY&t=92.08s)]
*  So since then we've we've aimed to make this space that's been very, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABn8Ti0sxBY&t=94.32000000000001s)]
*  I guess, niche and engineering kind of heavy, more and more approachable to more and more people. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABn8Ti0sxBY&t=98.48s)]
*  So this is the home page of Civit. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABn8Ti0sxBY&t=103.60000000000001s)]
*  And the first thing we have here are our featured images. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABn8Ti0sxBY&t=106.08000000000001s)]
*  So these are images that are created by people within our community. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABn8Ti0sxBY&t=109.2s)]
*  And these images get so many reactions. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABn8Ti0sxBY&t=112.64s)]
*  So we are a massive community of people making tons and tons of awesome AI creations [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABn8Ti0sxBY&t=115.68s)]
*  using community made models with community made patches to those models called LORIS. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABn8Ti0sxBY&t=121.44s)]
*  So for each of these images, we have all kinds of interesting details here too [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABn8Ti0sxBY&t=127.76s)]
*  about how to actually make this thing. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABn8Ti0sxBY&t=132.4s)]
*  So this one, for example, this person used Starlight Animated, the checkpoint. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABn8Ti0sxBY&t=135.04s)]
*  And this Laura called nuclear hazard style. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABn8Ti0sxBY&t=141.52s)]
*  So if we went to this Laura here, there's probably tons of other things made [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABn8Ti0sxBY&t=144.4s)]
*  to look like a nuclear hazard. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABn8Ti0sxBY&t=149.36s)]
*  Essentially what these things are, are machines to create things in a specific style. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABn8Ti0sxBY&t=150.88s)]
*  So here's what it would look like if a cup was a nuclear hazard or a motorcycle. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABn8Ti0sxBY&t=156.4s)]
*  So on and so forth. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABn8Ti0sxBY&t=162.48000000000002s)]
*  And each one of these has information about how they were made. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABn8Ti0sxBY&t=163.52s)]
*  And I can give these a thumbs up and participate in kind of this community creation. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABn8Ti0sxBY&t=166.16000000000003s)]
*  So here, for example, is the gallery of all of the things that people have made with this Laura. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABn8Ti0sxBY&t=172.16000000000003s)]
*  Stable diffusion allows you to make anything. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABn8Ti0sxBY&t=177.84s)]
*  And so when we launched, I wanted to make sure that we could continue to support that community. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABn8Ti0sxBY&t=180.16000000000003s)]
*  It was important for us to say, hey, we want to be able to support this tech as it develops. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABn8Ti0sxBY&t=185.76000000000002s)]
*  It means that we need to embrace all of it. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABn8Ti0sxBY&t=189.76000000000002s)]
*  And that's not easy. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABn8Ti0sxBY&t=192.0s)]
*  It's been incredibly difficult to set up policies that allow kind of the creation of all things [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABn8Ti0sxBY&t=193.28s)]
*  in a way that's not going to hurt people and to also do it in a way that makes it so that [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABn8Ti0sxBY&t=200.72s)]
*  people still have the level of control that they need to prevent the creation of content [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABn8Ti0sxBY&t=207.52s)]
*  that can't be there. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABn8Ti0sxBY&t=212.32s)]
*  So previously we had to basically audit prompts and try and catch things. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABn8Ti0sxBY&t=213.52s)]
*  And it was a constant cat and mouse game. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABn8Ti0sxBY&t=218.32s)]
*  With the introduction of the SPM, now we're able to actually prevent certain concepts from coming [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABn8Ti0sxBY&t=220.16s)]
*  out of the model. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABn8Ti0sxBY&t=224.72s)]
*  One of the things that drew me to AIR in the first place was the fact that it doesn't have any of [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABn8Ti0sxBY&t=225.52s)]
*  the same human preconceptions of what should be in an image and how an image should be composed [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABn8Ti0sxBY&t=229.6s)]
*  and what it should look like. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABn8Ti0sxBY&t=234.16s)]
*  And that's how you end up with these really beautiful things that are halfway between ethereal [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABn8Ti0sxBY&t=235.2s)]
*  and grotesque and these blending of form and function and monster. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABn8Ti0sxBY&t=239.52s)]
*  And that's like, this is absolutely crazy. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABn8Ti0sxBY&t=243.6s)]
*  And then you then add a year of people getting used to those images and training different [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABn8Ti0sxBY&t=246.4s)]
*  things on top of that. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABn8Ti0sxBY&t=250.79999999999998s)]
*  And then it becomes its own style that bleeds into everything else. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABn8Ti0sxBY&t=251.51999999999998s)]
*  And so the stuff that I've seen on our site, I can confidently say I've never seen anywhere [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABn8Ti0sxBY&t=256.08s)]
*  else on the internet. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABn8Ti0sxBY&t=260.71999999999997s)]
*  It is completely unique. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABn8Ti0sxBY&t=262.08s)]
*  One way that I've heard a creator describe it is they were in the shower and they're like, [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABn8Ti0sxBY&t=264.24s)]
*  well, you know, what would it look like if the whole world was made out of beer or what if it [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABn8Ti0sxBY&t=267.84s)]
*  was made out of bones or coffee or, you know, they're sitting there eating their breakfast [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABn8Ti0sxBY&t=272.72s)]
*  pastry. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABn8Ti0sxBY&t=276.96000000000004s)]
*  What if they were made out of pastries? [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABn8Ti0sxBY&t=277.28000000000003s)]
*  They'll generate some of those images with AI and then they'll take those images and then put [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABn8Ti0sxBY&t=279.20000000000005s)]
*  them into this thing called our trainer. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABn8Ti0sxBY&t=283.6s)]
*  So we make it really easy for people to take some training data. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABn8Ti0sxBY&t=285.84000000000003s)]
*  So they'll take some images they generate with AI and to make sure that anybody can create those [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABn8Ti0sxBY&t=289.44000000000005s)]
*  things and kind of really capture the essence of that. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABn8Ti0sxBY&t=293.92s)]
*  So here's, for example, a bunch of AI generated images of what if the world was grilled chicken, [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABn8Ti0sxBY&t=296.32s)]
*  right? [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABn8Ti0sxBY&t=303.68s)]
*  So they took this grilled chicken images and then they throw it into our trainer here. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABn8Ti0sxBY&t=303.92s)]
*  And then from here, you know, select a style, we'll call this our grilled chicken Laura here. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABn8Ti0sxBY&t=308.96s)]
*  And then from here, we can caption these to add additional details or we can use our auto [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABn8Ti0sxBY&t=318.24s)]
*  tagger to say, hey, automatically say what these are, or we can just go ahead and start it. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABn8Ti0sxBY&t=323.12s)]
*  And then from here, it's going to ask you for additional details. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABn8Ti0sxBY&t=329.68s)]
*  We give people the ability to either train on a few specific models. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABn8Ti0sxBY&t=332.24s)]
*  So a model focused on anime or a model focused on being semi-realistic, or they can select their own [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABn8Ti0sxBY&t=335.2s)]
*  custom model to train on top of. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABn8Ti0sxBY&t=341.12s)]
*  And this is the entire library. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABn8Ti0sxBY&t=342.8s)]
*  It's available on the sites. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABn8Ti0sxBY&t=344.56s)]
*  From the very beginning, we were very clear on that we were going to build things the community [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABn8Ti0sxBY&t=345.6s)]
*  wanted. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABn8Ti0sxBY&t=348.88s)]
*  So we did a lot of polls. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABn8Ti0sxBY&t=349.04s)]
*  We still do a lot of polls. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABn8Ti0sxBY&t=350.4s)]
*  We do a lot of like community outreach engagement being like, what do you want? [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABn8Ti0sxBY&t=351.2s)]
*  What do you need? [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABn8Ti0sxBY&t=353.44s)]
*  How are you using the platform right now so that we can better make it optimize for your use cases? [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABn8Ti0sxBY&t=353.84s)]
*  And then while we're implementing those things, we're also then thinking of, okay, well, [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABn8Ti0sxBY&t=358.0s)]
*  well, what is what's going to be like the next step beyond that? [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABn8Ti0sxBY&t=362.4s)]
*  Like, what are more going to be more, more intricate ways that people are going to use this in the [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABn8Ti0sxBY&t=365.36s)]
*  future? [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABn8Ti0sxBY&t=369.12s)]
*  So then we kind of build an iterative form of being like, okay, we're making these things that [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABn8Ti0sxBY&t=369.91999999999996s)]
*  people want now because they're demanding it now for how they're currently using the platform [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABn8Ti0sxBY&t=373.52s)]
*  while working on tools for how we think they're going to be using it in the future. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABn8Ti0sxBY&t=376.56s)]
*  I'd like to think of us, for example, as the home of the open source artists. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABn8Ti0sxBY&t=380.32s)]
*  And it's kind of like a new term. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABn8Ti0sxBY&t=384.64s)]
*  I mean, there's open source development, open source code, but it's really about sharing the [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABn8Ti0sxBY&t=385.76s)]
*  know-how on how to create these amazing things and not just the know-how, but also the tools [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABn8Ti0sxBY&t=390.88s)]
*  themselves. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABn8Ti0sxBY&t=395.28s)]
*  Look, this is almost like a whole new creator economy that come out of this because it's [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABn8Ti0sxBY&t=396.4s)]
*  a group of people who are putting effort and love into something that could very easily [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABn8Ti0sxBY&t=400.96s)]
*  become livelihoods for them if they had even the smallest way to monetize it based on the number of [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABn8Ti0sxBY&t=404.8s)]
*  eyes they're getting, uses they're getting. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABn8Ti0sxBY&t=408.4s)]
*  Like let's figure out how we can keep the creators monetized while maintaining the open [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABn8Ti0sxBY&t=409.67999999999995s)]
*  source ethos of making sure that it can still be available and accessible to everybody. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABn8Ti0sxBY&t=413.2s)]
