Video Description: What does it take to build a venture firm from scratch—and scale it across multiple waves of technological and cultural change?
In this special episode recorded at the a16z LP Summit, Marc Andreessen joins Erik Torenberg for a wide-ranging conversation on the origins and evolution of Andreessen Horowitz. From raising Fund I during the depths of the 2008 financial crisis to shaping the firm’s multistage, multi-sector strategy, Marc reflects on how the firm was built—and rebuilt—as the tech landscape shifted.
They discuss the rise of “Little Tech,” why policy now matters to startups, how scale became a strategic advantage in venture capital, and why the move from generalists to vertical specialists was inevitable.
Along the way, Marc shares behind-the-scenes stories on Facebook’s near-sale to Yahoo, the evolution of founder archetypes, the global talent arbitrage, and what too many people still misunderstand about tech’s role in society.
This is a masterclass in firm-building, investing, and long-term thinking.

# Marc Andreessen: What We Got Right—and Wrong—About the Future of Tech
**The a16z Podcast:** [June 02, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qObbK4SjZnk)
*  It's like a process of falling up the stairs. Just when you think you've got it and figured out some weird issue like you know basically pops up and you've got some new thing to prove. Every one of these companies that has been a global world beater always has one of these stories of the path not taken. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qObbK4SjZnk&t=0.0s)]
*  So the firm was started that we raised the first fund in 2009 which was in the height of the height of the stock market the depths of the stock market crash after the height of the financial crisis of 2008. And then yes we had the first LP meeting in 2010. So this is whatever it was number 15. Wow. Yeah first was folding shares about 20 LPs to start with. Wow folding shares in our office in our little office. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qObbK4SjZnk&t=13.04s)]
*  Our little conference area with our flat panel TV on the wall. And actually some of the same people we think people are still yes. But our original LPs are are still here. And then the others. Yes it's grown to be a somewhat larger production. And take us to some of the first LP. They must have been true believers at the time not just because of the strategy but because of the market timing. Take us a little bit back of what that was like. Yeah. So the thing to remember is so you know the dot com boom bubble was sort of you know. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qObbK4SjZnk&t=43.04s)]
*  90 sort of 95 to 2000 although it has its own ups and downs even during that period that got forgotten later. But in 2000 of course catastrophic crash and then you know kind of took like three or three or four years to dig out of the dot com crash. So it's like 2003 2004 before anything really started to happen. And then immediately what happened was any any sign of anything working in tech was immediately viewed by just screams in the press bubble bubble 2.0 bubble 2.0 was just like it's all happening again. These crazy idiots are back at it again. Then everything's going to come crashing down. You know there were two [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qObbK4SjZnk&t=73.04s)]
*  big M&A events in 2000 think 2005 two big M&A events. Yahoo bought. What was it. Flicker and delicious. So did Yahoo buy them both anchored that thing and they were like twenty five million dollar tickets each. And literally the press just like bananas. You know Facebook was getting started. Social media is a joke. What did your cat have for breakfast. Nobody cares. How are they going to make money. Are they going to make money. They'll never make money. And so it's just this like wall of negativity heading into 2008 and then into them and the financial crisis happens. And just like everything just gets like completely [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qObbK4SjZnk&t=103.04s)]
*  devastated. Everybody's flat on their back in the financial investment world. And so Ben and I in March 2009 decided it's perfect time to go start a venture capital firm which was a absolutely unique view at the time. There were only two venture capital funds [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qObbK4SjZnk&t=133.04s)]
*  raised in 2009. It was us and a new a new cultural ventures fund and a note of course was one of the legends of venture capital. So he was able to do that. But we were the only we were the only other literally venture fund raised that year. And at one point were you [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qObbK4SjZnk&t=145.64s)]
*  considering starting another company together. Are we like hey we really want to support entrepreneurs. This is the company. Yeah we were done. We had we had started multiple companies and so we were done. We were done. We completed that that that part of our life of life's journey. And so then we went. Yeah we decided to start a firm. And yeah look we met we met you know some people were really nice to us and really helped us kind of get underway. And then we started meeting the LPs. We'll get to the evolution of firm. But just because you mentioned it the Zuckerberg acquisition story. You of course have been on the board of Facebook for a long time. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qObbK4SjZnk&t=156.8s)]
*  Take us back to that memory in your conversations with Mark and what was your perspective at the time. Yeah so basically I mean this has been kind of chronicled over the years. But you know basically what happened was it wasn't negativity at that time of like you know this technology is evil and it's going to destroy the world. It was the negativity was this technology is absolutely useless. Absolutely useless has no point. It's a joke. It's a farce. It's you know basically and like it as you said never make any money. And that was just kind of the uniform kind of public conversation around at the time. And so Facebook took off and you know they had ad revenue early on but early on it was like remnant. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qObbK4SjZnk&t=186.8s)]
*  Ad revenue. They didn't have targeted ads yet. So it was literally the early ad revenue at Facebook literally was selling remnant banner ads from the Bing ad network. And so it was like the super low CPMs. And you know Mark always had this theory of how he could turn it into a big thing. But you know he just he just said his wall of negativity. And then he just at that time had a lot of people around him. I mean it had been a fast rush from 2004 to 2008 to get to the point where you know all of a sudden they're starting to get offers in the you know hundreds of millions of dollars. And was this after a down round or before the down round. I believe there [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qObbK4SjZnk&t=216.8s)]
*  was only one. The Microsoft down round was after that because that was like that was after the 15 billion dollar round. It was like a down right. So that was that was a couple of years later. But you know Yahoo at the time I remember Yahoo at the time Yahoo was doing a turnaround under under Terry Semmel at the time. And Terry Terry correctly figured out that you know Facebook was a property that they should buy. And so they actually struck a deal. I don't know if it got literally signed or verbally agreed to but they structured a deal. There's a billion dollar takeout. It was an agreement to do a billion dollar takeout. And then the financial crisis hit advertising immediately collapsed. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qObbK4SjZnk&t=246.8s)]
*  Because advertising is the first thing that gets cut in a recession. And Yahoo came back and essentially renegotiated the deal try to lower the price. Yeah. And that gave Mark basically the you know I don't know cover kind of wherewithal to be able to walk away from the deal. Wow. But you know look he was seriously he was seriously considered very least strongly considering it at the billion dollar level. And again it's just like at the time it was just like a spectacular you know spectacular home run for a company growing that fast started in a dorm four years earlier during a time when you know again this stuff was [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qObbK4SjZnk&t=276.8s)]
*  all just like viewed as a complete joke. The sort of ultimate kind of thing in the story is a few years later somehow I don't know how but somehow the internal Yahoo deck on the acquisition got leaked and got published. So Yahoo's internal analysis of Facebook at that time and Yahoo people were bullish on the company which is why they offered to buy it. But they they and everybody else radically underestimated the future great the company like it's just like it's like this incredible low bound. Yeah. You know kind of estimate. And then right. And then as you know you know not only did Facebook grow really fast but [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qObbK4SjZnk&t=306.8s)]
*  you know they figured out targeted advertising and then by the way they went through the exact same crisis again basically after they went after after they went public in 2012 which is that what public right is the transition from desktop to mobile was happening. Yeah. It was really when the iPhone was kind of hitting critical mass. Right. Fascinating. And there was just this wall again this wall of negativity which is I mean you read the articles the time there's like this is going to destroy Facebook because everybody knows that Internet ads are based on the amount of screen real estate that you can sell like the ad rates literally are the number of pixels on the screen and therefore logically because [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qObbK4SjZnk&t=336.8s)]
*  mobile screens are much smaller than desktop screens. You know they add that ad rates are going to shrink and that's going to be it. And the stock came out and like well shit the bat right out of the gate. And it was literally this argument of like the mobile ad opportunity was much less than the opportunity. And what we know now today right is that mobile mobile met people were going to use this stuff far more throughout that you know all day long use all day long usage went way up and then we learned that the targeting works right. And you know everybody knows they are sort of obvious that you know a company like Facebook is a trove of you know personal [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qObbK4SjZnk&t=366.8s)]
*  data that you can target as against. But at the time it was like it was not something that people believe would be the case. I often describe these companies as you know even the ones that come from the outside look that like they're just like up into the right the whole time I was describing it's like a process of falling up the stairs. Yeah. Right. It's just like because it's just like it's just when you think you've got it and figured out like some weird issue like you know basically pops up and you've got some new thing to prove and you've got some other thing. Yeah. And Mark you know Mark's one of the best one of the best who's ever lived and being able to work his way through every single thing in this company. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qObbK4SjZnk&t=396.8s)]
*  Come along. It's funny that we went from mobile ads won't work to organizations. You know Tristan Harris dedicated to you know stopping ads from working too well. Basically he has worked so well. We've been epidemic of of sort of you know people using it so much as a so far. I would even even even even heighten that it went from it went from within four years it went from the as not work at all to they are literally mind control. Right. They are literally mind control. Right. And you know this political ad specifically and they can literally like put the whammy on people to vote for Canada. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qObbK4SjZnk&t=426.8s)]
*  It's who nobody would ever vote for had they not been mind controlled. Exactly. Right. By the Facebook algorithm and the whole thing the whole time was so weird because it's like wow like if the mind control works so well like why don't we have like you know triple the ad rates on like toothpaste. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qObbK4SjZnk&t=456.8s)]
*  Like why does it only work for you know what does it only work for Trump. Yeah exactly. You hundred thousand dollars can ship the whole entire election. Yeah. And then the right and then the right. Exactly. That's the thing the Russians can spend. By the way I think the result of it was I think it was a result of eighty thousand dollars of ad spend by the Russians in the relevant period of the election. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qObbK4SjZnk&t=467.36s)]
*  It was like a total of like one hundred and forty thousand. But during the actual run of the election it was eighty thousand dollars. And so the theory was eighty thousand dollars of ad ads channeled into this magic mind control device. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qObbK4SjZnk&t=483.64000000000004s)]
*  Bang for the buck. Yeah yeah yeah. That literally swung an election that Hillary Clinton spent three billion dollars. Right. And the whole time we're just sitting there. I'm just sitting there just like I can't even believe like it doesn't make any sense. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qObbK4SjZnk&t=493.04s)]
*  You know and I went to I went to Hillary's big speech. I went to her first big speech after she lost at Stanford and she literally sat on stage. You know Donald Trump is only president today because Vladimir Putin had Facebook like Facebook. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qObbK4SjZnk&t=504.40000000000003s)]
*  You're talking about. Anyway and so literally it went from you know 2008 to if this is useless to 2012. This is still useless. However it does get some credit for the Arab Spring. Right. And for getting Obama elected and there were there were lots of headlines at that time. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qObbK4SjZnk&t=518.68s)]
*  A social media saves democracy. Yeah. Because of the Arab Spring and then to 2016 it's the evil you know it's the evil mind controlling death machine. It turned out that the method that was supposedly used by the Russians slash you know the Trump campaign to do the mind control. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qObbK4SjZnk&t=532.68s)]
*  You know basically like that method. I mean we now know basically it never worked like it did the whole psycho psycho psychometric thing that they were doing. The Cambridge the Cambridge Analytica was supposedly doing like it's not it's not something people do. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qObbK4SjZnk&t=545.3199999999999s)]
*  That like yeah like it was the other thing is they say this is the other part of the narrative you're forced to believe is is you're told to believe as it was magic mind control but only for that election. And then nobody ever tried it again. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qObbK4SjZnk&t=556.56s)]
*  Yeah exactly. Yeah it's fascinating to imagine sort of alternative tech history like what if Yahoo had actually been able to buy by Facebook. Obviously there would have been a massive blow for Facebook but sometimes it works the other way of you know maybe snap should have sold to Facebook. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qObbK4SjZnk&t=565.0s)]
*  Maybe it would have been better for everyone else. It's just endless stories like that's a nice game. We almost bought Yahoo. There was like a bit spread between like three million five million dollars. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qObbK4SjZnk&t=579.12s)]
*  Yahoo almost bought Google and there was a very low price deal at the time. Netflix almost sold a blockbuster early on. So there's all the every one of these companies that is end up being global world beater always has the always has this little always has one of these one of these stories of the path not taken. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qObbK4SjZnk&t=587.4s)]
*  And so Uber and Lyft almost merged at one point. Yeah exactly. Yeah there's all that. And so I mean look the forces means something like the smartphone was going to happen. There were going to be killer apps on the phone. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qObbK4SjZnk&t=603.36s)]
*  There was going to you know there was going to be there was going to be something like this. Somebody was going to do it and you know like had I don't know in the counterfactual Facebook sold Yahoo and Yahoo let it language. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qObbK4SjZnk&t=614.76s)]
*  You know somebody else probably would have figured it out. But you know so in a sense these things were kind of some of these things you know were kind of bound to happen. But the specific companies involved like it's just that there are so many kind of twists and turns. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qObbK4SjZnk&t=622.6s)]
*  Yeah. It's so contingent on very specific people doing very specific things at each point totally that I think it's just it's extremely sensitive to the micro level decisions that are made along the way. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qObbK4SjZnk&t=634.4s)]
*  Yeah. Speaking of twists and turns let's go back to the firm because the first fund is 300 million correct. And we didn't have a sense for how big it would become. You wrote software is in the world. You had a sort of hypothesis of that these companies were to get bigger. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qObbK4SjZnk&t=643.48s)]
*  There's going to be more of them. Take us through when you realized that scale was going to be a strategic asset for the venture and that the future venture was going to look like this barbell. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qObbK4SjZnk&t=656.4399999999999s)]
*  Remember actually actually a conversation with John Doerr in the mid 90s which is about just you know because KP was an investor in Netscape at the time and it's in those days in those days. You know when I was young basically the model was very straightforward at the time which was basically [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qObbK4SjZnk&t=665.64s)]
*  series a series B. So venture was series a series B. And then and there wasn't even really seed that much like in the mid 90s it was mostly just raised like a venture a round which would be like a three or four five million dollar round maybe six or seven if you were super ambitious. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qObbK4SjZnk&t=678.16s)]
*  And then there'd be like a B round of like 20 or 30. And then there was what's called the mezzanine round which is the C round. And that basically is the pre IPO round. And so you kind of raise a total of three rounds and maybe 30 or 40 million dollars. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qObbK4SjZnk&t=692.76s)]
*  And then you go public. And then if you needed money you would go public. There was basically there were no following rounds after the after the C round. And so you would go public and you could go public in those days at like it was sort of 50 million revenue and then a 10 X revenue [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qObbK4SjZnk&t=704.0s)]
*  and then a 50 million dollar market cap was kind of the the bar to go public. By the way as an example Amazon went public in 97 and I think it's 400 million dollar valuation. So you know it's kind of right right in line with that. But that model Netscape was kind of similar in 95. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qObbK4SjZnk&t=717.12s)]
*  And so venture had this very very specific role. But what was even what was becoming clear even the 90s that actually I think it was a conversation John I had about Cisco originally which is just like some of these companies are really going to rip like you know they're really going to run if they're going to run at the time. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qObbK4SjZnk&t=730.28s)]
*  It was like if they're going to run to 100 billion which at the time was like the big the big ceiling. It's just like all right like the vent all of a sudden the venture B round looks great. All of a sudden by the way the mezzanine round looks great. Like maybe the VCs should basically just kind of keep re-upping. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qObbK4SjZnk&t=743.0s)]
*  Is it a mistake. Like if you can make as much absolute money investing you know 50 million dollars in Cisco at their series C as you could five in their series A like right. In those days it was like a big statement to say maybe the venture firms should do that. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qObbK4SjZnk&t=755.84s)]
*  And then you know of course what's become clear since then is the ceiling isn't 100 billion is much larger than that. That's much much higher than that. And that's just a consequence of tech proliferating and becoming becoming more important. So anyway so we had that sense and Facebook actually was raising larger rounds by that point. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qObbK4SjZnk&t=768.16s)]
*  DST DST kind of redefines growth investing when they did the Facebook round. So basically this idea sort of venture growth growth investing was starting to really materialize. And so we did define the firm right up front. We said we want to be stage agnostic. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qObbK4SjZnk&t=782.1999999999999s)]
*  We want to be seed venture and growth. That was in the original pitch deck. You know it wasn't enough money to do a lot of growth investing but we could you know we could start to get underway. But we sort of made this busy. This is our argument to the LPs was look it's not it's not about being in a certain stage. It's about the total aggregate opportunity. If you're going to get into one of these world beating companies you can still do it at the BC or D and you'll still have venture scale returns. And so yeah we define that right up front. And when did we figure out because our approach is sort of specialized funds is different than some of these other partnerships that hey we're just all general. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qObbK4SjZnk&t=794.08s)]
*  We're a small team. We all do everything. When did that model originate. What was that journey like. Yeah. So we started that way. So we started as generalists and you know Ben and I had both worked in both sort of consumer and enterprise which are the two big categories at the time as basically consumer software VC enterprise software VC and then sort of bio health tech. The older venture firms actually did both what they call digital or you know kind of IT and bettering software investing. And then they also did biotech. And actually a lot of those firms have gotten they got like internal divorces and yeah and spun their groups off because those industries at the time are going in different directions. So we [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qObbK4SjZnk&t=824.08s)]
*  went in different directions. But Ben and I had done consumer enterprise and so we just said look we'll just be generalist firm you know sort of modeled after the benchmark model. And a big part of this is just industry evolution which is around the time we started the firm. It was also the time that I would say the tech industry fundamentally changed from being a primarily building tools to to actually going like directly in the industry. So we call it kind of full stack companies. I think the reason the generalist model worked well for as long as it did is because like fundamentally a database company a router company a word processor company [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qObbK4SjZnk&t=854.08s)]
*  a pretty systems company like they're all fundamentally tools. And so they're different if they sell the consumer enterprise. But you know a router is a piece of software in a box. You know chips are a little different but you know a database and an operating system are kind of similar. You know the technical challenges the form of the company the organizational model for the company is kind of similar. Word processors video games at the time were both you know both got 50 bucks both sold in a box on retail store shelves. You know kind of similar. And so the generalist model I think worked really well when the industry was that earlier model. And then you know 2010 20 [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qObbK4SjZnk&t=884.08s)]
*  2009 2010 was kind of the pivot we now know which was you know the rise of Uber and Lyft the rise of Airbnb the rise of Tesla the rise of SpaceX the world beating companies of the 2010s in many cases were companies that were full stack direct insertion and markets. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qObbK4SjZnk&t=914.08s)]
*  And then we therefore you know we leaned hard into that because we saw that happening. And so we started investing in the you know everything from the e-commerce marketplaces to you know these you know defense new kinds of defense companies. And then we decided to take on biotech because we thought you know we thought [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qObbK4SjZnk&t=929.6s)]
*  then and believe now that the convergence is happening. You know biotech is becoming much more based on software and IT and data and AI. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qObbK4SjZnk&t=943.88s)]
*  And then basically what we realized is like OK the generalist model doesn't work anymore because each of those things now is actually a very deep domain in itself. Right. With like very specific domain knowledge. And then the specific problem that a generalist has [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qObbK4SjZnk&t=950.48s)]
*  is that a generalist can sense heat but a generalist has a very hard time getting into the specifics. And the reason the specifics really matter [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qObbK4SjZnk&t=961.48s)]
*  is because so much adventure because the way venture works is if you invest in one company in space you can't invest in the others. If you pick the space correctly and invest in the wrong company. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qObbK4SjZnk&t=969.36s)]
*  You're screwed. Right. Because you can't you can't fix your mistake. You can't then invest in a successful company because of the conflict issue. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qObbK4SjZnk&t=977.72s)]
*  And so what we realized was the thing that was becoming very important in this new world was understanding deep in the vertical what was going on specifically for the purpose of being able to tell which which company was actually the one that was most likely to win. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qObbK4SjZnk&t=984.32s)]
*  Yeah. And that's just really hard to do if you don't have domain knowledge. Yeah. And so that that catalyzed us to verticalize. And then we did that in two steps. We did kind of a partial verticalization early. You know probably I don't know 2013 or something. And then by 2017 I think we did the full. Yeah. The other one we have now. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qObbK4SjZnk&t=995.5600000000001s)]
*  It's fascinating because you know 15 20 years ago is things like Y Combinator were getting off the ground. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qObbK4SjZnk&t=1010.92s)]
*  And you were this yourself. People said there was an arbitrage around young technical founders and this again. You could teach them the business elements and they could be successful. You don't need to go to NBA to be a successful founder. That's accurate. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qObbK4SjZnk&t=1017.08s)]
*  And yet today maybe there's a similar arbitrage around domain experts where you could serve the tech has gotten easier and it's easier to get sort of things off the ground and domain expertise values more and distribution values more is valued more maybe than it was 15 years ago. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qObbK4SjZnk&t=1032.52s)]
*  And maybe that's true on the founder side and on the investor side. Yeah. Although you know at least until now I think the question is you know whether A.I. is going to change this. But at least until now it still was the case the founders also needed to be very deep in the tech and even the founders that would go out. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qObbK4SjZnk&t=1046.9199999999998s)]
*  And I used to you know there's this wave like design founders. Right. And they're like OK. That's great. They're good design. It's great. It just turns out the successful design founders are also very strong technologists. Right. And they may be pretended sometimes that they weren't because they wanted the design cred. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qObbK4SjZnk&t=1060.24s)]
*  But it turned out they were actually very deep. That's interesting. Yeah. These these are Ben Silverman and Brian Chesney. These guys are like top and technical founders and I should have been good designers great designers. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qObbK4SjZnk&t=1072.12s)]
*  And so yeah like I would argue there's really no escape from kind of deep domain knowledge. To your point I think the question is OK if A.I. makes deep domain knowledge kind of instantly accessible to anybody you know if everybody's got if you have oh three deep researcher is equivalent at your fingertips. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qObbK4SjZnk&t=1080.9199999999998s)]
*  And if you're a generalist or you know kind of you know person wearing many hats like Kit can I give you the depth when you need it. And I don't know. I'm excited to see people. I'm excited to see people try that. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qObbK4SjZnk&t=1096.28s)]
*  Yeah. It's a little bit like it's a little bit like a debate happening on coding right now. This is like OK is by coding a substitute for like actually writing. Right. And you know like sitting here today you know like by coding is like super exciting for casual development. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qObbK4SjZnk&t=1110.3999999999999s)]
*  But like you know at least right now all of the really sharp like you know technologists I know don't think that you could like by code a top end right like software company today. But like the coding capabilities of these models are getting really good. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qObbK4SjZnk&t=1122.08s)]
*  And so you know the agents are starting to work and so you know the sort of famous not the famous. There's a famous Dilbert which is the Dilbert's boss pitches over it and they're going to go start a company together and the boss is like you know I'm going to I'm going to I'm going to bring the idea and be the manager and you're going to you're going to do the coding. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qObbK4SjZnk&t=1134.0s)]
*  And over it's like and so what you're saying is you're going to contribute nothing right. And so like you know like it does does the existence of like really state of the art coding actually change that to you know to do it's boss all of a sudden. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qObbK4SjZnk&t=1149.44s)]
*  Can I have a right to code. Yeah. And then you get these very entertaining thought experiments like you know are the agent or agents going to get really good writing code and then are you going to be able to have a non technical person supervising a thousand a coders. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qObbK4SjZnk&t=1162.48s)]
*  Yeah right and out racing a top and technical person who's supervising you know a hundred great coders. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qObbK4SjZnk&t=1174.8000000000002s)]
*  You know it's possible you know we'll see if it's the era of the ideas guy. Yeah yeah I want to talk about areas where we've chosen to play in areas where we haven't chosen to play. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qObbK4SjZnk&t=1180.3600000000001s)]
*  So let's look at internationally. We talked about how we you know you personally didn't enter China and ways that other firms did were a US firm with American dynamism. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qObbK4SjZnk&t=1189.4s)]
*  You know Europe when it's not shooting itself in the foot regulation regulation wise you know they're increasing their defense spend. You know could you imagine Europe dynamism or how we've thought about internationally historically and how do you think about it. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qObbK4SjZnk&t=1200.0s)]
*  Yes I mean the good news. So the good news that you know the good news is the world the world is globalizing. You know there is like there's incredible activity and interest all over all over the world like everywhere we go. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qObbK4SjZnk&t=1213.9199999999998s)]
*  You know people want to talk about tech they want to learn about tech. Ben saw this more than me but like when Ben wrote his book you know went on a tour it's like every it didn't matter what country went to thousands of kids show up and they want to learn how to do this. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qObbK4SjZnk&t=1223.6s)]
*  And the Internet had a big impact there which is you know every kid anywhere in the world now can watch you know computer teal talks and our podcast and everything else. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qObbK4SjZnk&t=1232.6s)]
*  And so you know that I would say global enthusiasm global knowledge is way up global enthusiasm is way up relevance you know to societies is way up. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qObbK4SjZnk&t=1239.6s)]
*  As you mentioned like defense Europe needs to rearm presumably they'd be better off for yamming with the new systems as opposed to the old systems drones forms instead of aircraft carriers that kind of thing. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qObbK4SjZnk&t=1246.08s)]
*  And then look there's just the reality there's just smart people all over the place. And so there's just there's human capital everywhere. Like I think historians will look back and they'll just say wow like you know the 20th century was a really 21st century is really primitive society. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qObbK4SjZnk&t=1255.9199999999998s)]
*  They had all these smart people all over the world and they never figured out you know they just they never figured out how to actually use utilize them right. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qObbK4SjZnk&t=1267.52s)]
*  They never figured out how to identify them use them and so the startup process is a way to kind of especially get smart young people. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qObbK4SjZnk&t=1272.96s)]
*  They kind of do ambitious things. So that's great. It's all fantastic against that. It's just this incredible drag by bad governments and bad policies. As you mentioned Europe Europe. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qObbK4SjZnk&t=1278.88s)]
*  Persist in shooting itself not just in the foot but in the other foot and the ankle and in the knee and in the gut. And they're just on this absolute frenzy to regulate and kill you know tech in Europe the UK. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qObbK4SjZnk&t=1290.08s)]
*  They're proud of it. They're proud of it. They're very proud of it. Yes. The famous European the actual European line now is we we quote we this is in the FT is an actual quote from a European senior politicians. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qObbK4SjZnk&t=1300.04s)]
*  We know we cannot be the global leader in tech innovation. So therefore we will be the global leader in tech regulation. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qObbK4SjZnk&t=1309.72s)]
*  Right. And so you just imagine being like a German or French tech founder and reading that just. Oh God. Yeah. To get to the U.S. Embassy and apply for a visa as fast as possible. Right. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qObbK4SjZnk&t=1314.3600000000001s)]
*  And in fact that's what's happened as a consequence. A lot of these really curious bright people basically end up moving to the U.S. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qObbK4SjZnk&t=1323.92s)]
*  And so we've been we've been an enormous beneficiary as a country and as a firm of that. And so that remains a really big challenge. It's interesting watching the UK right now because you know I thought under the previous government they [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qObbK4SjZnk&t=1330.48s)]
*  were going to become enlightened and you know right. And they did the opposite like they you know they tried to ban a. You know they said they were going to liberalize crypto and they never did. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qObbK4SjZnk&t=1341.3999999999999s)]
*  And so you know but the new government new government says they're going to open you know they say they're going to open up some of this stuff. They still want to keep all the regulations but they say they want to kind of grow. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qObbK4SjZnk&t=1350.6s)]
*  So we'll see the defense stuff. Yeah. I mean there's already a dispute. I've just this is just in the headlines. There's already a dispute if Europe cranks their defense spending up to 5 percent of GDP which they're supposed to. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qObbK4SjZnk&t=1358.6399999999999s)]
*  You know will they buy any of that for us. You know it would only be purchased from you know indigenous you know kind of European defense vendors. It's already becoming part of the whole trade war. I mean look I think most of the state of the world is you know very at least for what we do is high caliber people being held back by being a bad systems. Yeah. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qObbK4SjZnk&t=1369.9199999999998s)]
*  What is our criteria for opening up offices in other places more generally. Yeah. So basically there's there's two kinds of activities that you know make sense for a firm like us to do internationally I think. Maybe maybe three. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qObbK4SjZnk&t=1385.8799999999999s)]
*  One is just sales. You know the group term is we dress it up with fancy fancy whereas business development. Yeah. Go to market. A lot of the market is global. And so you know for every for all of our companies and so helping our companies succeed. Right. And build up businesses globally. And we've been doing that from the beginning. And that's always always an important thing to is investing. And look we've invested. We've always been as I say other than China. We generally we've been open investing in many places in the world and we have investments in a lot of places. Very recently Mr. Allen France. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qObbK4SjZnk&t=1396.4s)]
*  Yeah exactly. Yeah exactly. But you know we've we've made investments in the past and you know you know Vietnam and lots of other interesting places. You know having said that again just because of this kind of political dynamic it has just been striking over the last 30 years how many great founders who could have stayed in country X and started a company there had just moved to the U.S. instead. Yeah. And so we just from a practical standpoint have tended to emphasize U.S. investing because we figure we'll get most of the best of the global founders anyway. Yeah. Yeah. And then maybe the third thing we're not really active on this right now but you know we're very active now in U.S. policy. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qObbK4SjZnk&t=1426.4s)]
*  But you know there are these policy issues all over the world. You know and do we need to go get more insert ourselves more into you know God help us European politics or you know whatever. And then you know and then this question you know can we you know are we you know as Americans are we allowed to. Yeah. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qObbK4SjZnk&t=1456.4s)]
*  Well I know we've only done this sort of kicking and screaming. This is not our intent even on the on the U.S. side. But talk a little bit about how just the little tech concept is a sort of different from big tech sort of emerged in our thinking. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qObbK4SjZnk&t=1472.48s)]
*  Yeah. So basically this also goes goes right back to this thing of the tech industry kind of changing around 2010. So in the era between call it 1950 to 2010 you know when the industry was in what is called tool phase chips and were processors and routers and spreadsheets and things like that. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qObbK4SjZnk&t=1484.6000000000001s)]
*  Tech was just never really tech was really startup startup tech particularly was never really a salient political topic like really the only time I'd ever enter politics really was it was with antitrust. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qObbK4SjZnk&t=1499.52s)]
*  And so it was like a really big deal in the 90s like this one dug into Microsoft because it was because because it was a big deal. That case is a big deal but also because it was a very rare case of the government actually caring about tech and wanting to wanting to become involved. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qObbK4SjZnk&t=1509.36s)]
*  And so there was sort of a state of sort of I would say I don't know benign neglect or something you know kind of up until 2010. And by the way in both directions like the Valley companies never thought it was important to go to D.C. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qObbK4SjZnk&t=1521.8s)]
*  The D.C. companies didn't really think the Valley companies mattered. And then that that yeah that all started changing in around I don't know probably 2012 2013 you know kind of you know you had this sort of increasing political I would call I don't know enter energizing happening just you know in general. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qObbK4SjZnk&t=1530.9599999999998s)]
*  You started getting this anti-tech narrative started getting more political you know so you got wrapped up in the Occupy Wall Street 1 percent thing and you know these type of people just as bad as the finance people. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qObbK4SjZnk&t=1545.72s)]
*  The F.T. just ran a big story saying the tech people are now definitively worse than the finance people. And I read the story twice and I still don't understand it. But the gist of it was something like at least the finance people you could have dinner with and it's fun. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qObbK4SjZnk&t=1553.96s)]
*  Right. Whereas the tech people are just like all. Sometimes they say at least the finance people know that their money motivated or something where the tech people have the delusion that you know they're saying sanctimonious and insufferable which you know. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qObbK4SjZnk&t=1564.6s)]
*  Sometimes there is a little little little bit of truth to that. But yeah it started to kind of energize them and then and then really you know the takeoff was 2015 2016. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qObbK4SjZnk&t=1575.04s)]
*  It was really it was really Trump it was really Trump's nomination and election that really radicalized a pretty big block of political actors in the country kind of against tech. And then by the way you know I would say the way to describe the last decade is the left got like super angry at [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qObbK4SjZnk&t=1582.8799999999999s)]
*  tech because of Trump and because of inequality and all these other things. And then the right got super mad at tech because the right thought the tech were all on the left. Yeah right. And so we go talk to you know Republicans and they would basically say yeah we agree with you but like you're all Democrats. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qObbK4SjZnk&t=1594.84s)]
*  You know F off. They thought it was very entertaining. And it's just like you know that the social media social media was kind of the tip of the spear that for about five years. And then and then you know in the last five years crypto you know became incredibly politicized and the [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qObbK4SjZnk&t=1607.6s)]
*  government U.S. government basically launched a full on war against it. Tried to kill it. And then I got you know just like incredibly politicized you know starting you know basically right around 2021 2022. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qObbK4SjZnk&t=1621.28s)]
*  And the government like was was moving in very hard on on on AI. And it was it was for us it was the combination of crypto and AI that got us like extremely alarmed. And so you know we decided we had to become involved. But but like I said you know there were very [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qObbK4SjZnk&t=1632.44s)]
*  specific there's specific point issues in the both both of those domains. But there's just this general kind of thing which is like all right. You know we always wanted to build things that matter. Like it turns out these things matter. Right. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qObbK4SjZnk&t=1645.76s)]
*  You know as a consequence like we're either going to show up and explain ourselves or you know other people who hate us are going to you know describe us. And so so what we've done is we've generalized that idea out into what we call the little tech agenda. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qObbK4SjZnk&t=1657.44s)]
*  And the first part of that is the little tech and we say little tech specifically is differentiated from big tech. I like that creates a cleavage. Yes. Yeah that's right. And that and that was another thing we discovered that was a result of kind of our early interactions four or five years ago in D.C. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qObbK4SjZnk&t=1668.8s)]
*  Which is just they're just like well tech is tech. You know just meet with them on behalf of startups and they start yelling at us about Google or something. And it's like we're not here representing Google. And it's like well that's tech. And you know by the way it wasn't started 20 years ago. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qObbK4SjZnk&t=1680.3999999999999s)]
*  And we're just like well Google has its own Google. You know they have their own. They have 10,000 years and policy people and compliance people like they've got their own. Right. You know they can kind of carry their own water. That's not what we're here for. And in fact you know a lot of what the venture ecosystem does is it funds competitors to better. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qObbK4SjZnk&t=1690.32s)]
*  Google. Yeah. You were disrupting big tech. And this is this is the story I was telling you see which is 100 percent true which is the caricature of this sort of reckless reckless Silicon Valley is that we're starting companies that go disrupt you know whatever health care or something. [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qObbK4SjZnk&t=1707.88s)]
*  I said most of what we're trying most of what our founders are trying to disrupt is big tech. And I said frankly big tech companies like you know we they're sort of you know we have you know they would say they have a love hate. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qObbK4SjZnk&t=1718.44s)]
*  You know we like them but they have a love hate relationship with us because we're the we're the escape hatch if there's somebody at a big tech company that basically is gets frustrated they come to us to raise money to start a company to compete with a former employer. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qObbK4SjZnk&t=1727.28s)]
*  Right. And so you know that big tech is not always in favor of us. And then you know and then look big tech. They just have become very big companies and they have their own agendas. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qObbK4SjZnk&t=1738.3999999999999s)]
*  And you know a lot a lot of big companies over time try to do things that to prevent you know they try to form cartel like you know basically structures to prevent new competitors you know start up to start us from emerging. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qObbK4SjZnk&t=1747.1599999999999s)]
*  And so we just noticed in more and more cases there was a divergence of interests. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qObbK4SjZnk&t=1756.88s)]
*  That actually turned out to help a lot the minute we figure that out and then we sort of you know sort of going this little tech thing and kind of ran with it. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qObbK4SjZnk&t=1761.68s)]
*  It is basically like immediately that was like the icebreaker in the in the D.C. like because everybody in D.C. hates big tech like what they only agree on two things they only agree on big tech in China. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qObbK4SjZnk&t=1768.76s)]
*  See things they agree on but they really agree on those things and a big tech they just all hate big tech. So the minute we say we're not here on behalf of big tech we're on behalf of little tech and in fact our companies attack big tech. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qObbK4SjZnk&t=1777.24s)]
*  We get like these huge smiles. Really. They're like oh wow you know tech startups are actually good. Right. Actually this is actually exciting. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qObbK4SjZnk&t=1787.2s)]
*  And then and then so that's a little tax side. And then the agenda side is you know basically it's essentially freedom to innovate. Right. So ability for companies in new fields that are not completely yet well understood that lawmakers of the past did not anticipate [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qObbK4SjZnk&t=1793.64s)]
*  they should actually be able to operate. And then you know the other maybe important thing is we're not like lobbying for no regulation. Right. So sometimes we get tagged by you know we're these crazy libertarians and we want these companies to just run wild and like that fraud and do all this crazy stuff. [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qObbK4SjZnk&t=1806.72s)]
*  And that's not what we're pushing for clarity clarity clarity clarity clarity. We want clear guidelines. We want sensible rules. We always tell these people like consumer protection regulation go crazy like 100 percent. No problem. [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qObbK4SjZnk&t=1819.3999999999999s)]
*  Like that's all good. In fact we want that because we want we want our companies to be compliant. We certainly don't want our companies committing fraud. By the way the other thing we don't want is we don't want our compliant companies competing with noncompliant companies that aren't getting regulated or prosecuted. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qObbK4SjZnk&t=1831.8799999999999s)]
*  Yeah. We're advocating on behalf of regulation as often as we're doing anything else. So the it's funny because there was the on Twitter there was this sort of Paul Graham Palantir dust up the other week which I thought was just pretty symbolic or emblematic of kind of like [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qObbK4SjZnk&t=1843.3999999999999s)]
*  not to pick on Paul but it was sort of like older Silicon Valley versus newer Silicon Valley or just like how the space is changing. Palantir has to work with the government. They're building hard tech. It's not just sort of put something up and talk customers right away. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qObbK4SjZnk&t=1858.6799999999998s)]
*  And Paul Graham has been in England for quite a bit. You know YC is still innovating doing fantastic things. But I just thought that was such a fascinating sort of example of how Silicon Valley is evolving which is just new kinds of companies new kinds of go to markets new kinds of sort of ethos. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qObbK4SjZnk&t=1871.1599999999999s)]
*  Right. That's right. And so the specific dust up I think was over Palantir working with ICE. Yes. Immigration. Yeah. The U.S. government immigration agency. So yeah. So there's actually a deep there's kind of a deep. This is a generational change. I think it's a very deep and profound change. And there's a generational aspect of this which is basically so the U.S. tech industry and startup industry and Silicon Valley were basically deeply intertwined with the defense and intelligence basically. You know that are a deep state defense and intelligence agencies in particular the federal government really from like that if you go all the way back to Steve Blank has these incredible [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qObbK4SjZnk&t=1884.96s)]
*  videos essays where he goes through all this all the way back. Silicon Valley actually started in like the 1920s and it was like a defense tech in the 1920s. It was like radar. Right. And you know like early missile guidance systems and you know airplane you know avionics systems and things like that. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qObbK4SjZnk&t=1914.96s)]
*  In like the 20s and 30s and then you know kind of from that time through to like the 60s it was just assumed that there was this very deep relationship and you know the Cold War and of course industry and government have to work together to build all these systems to defeat the Soviets. [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qObbK4SjZnk&t=1929.72s)]
*  You know one of the first computers literally was called Sage. It was a U.S. government project a giant mainframe computer for missile early warning systems. So so so it was just assumed that this was all kind of hand in hand. And then really what happened was it was in Vietnam. So you know Vietnam was the first modern war where you have this massive protest movement. And then you know the college campuses you know kind of went went went wild. You know with this you know anti war anti war movement and all that stuff. And what happened if you talk to people who were involved back then basically what happened was the the leading [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qObbK4SjZnk&t=1941.96s)]
*  edge American universities that did know that did science and technology were doing military science and technology and many of them just stopped. So like Stanford like Spud is this thing called Stanford Research Institute. That's right. It's actually no longer associated with Stanford because it's like it's like the it's the remnants of what used to be Stanford's military R&D. [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qObbK4SjZnk&t=1971.96s)]
*  MIT had something similar with the Lincoln lab. And so and so that created a culture you know in the valley was always you know it's always been a mix of like right and left wing. But you know the sort of the hippie anti war movement you know was a lot of it was in California. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qObbK4SjZnk&t=1989.64s)]
*  Right. It's a lot of it was at Stanford and Berkeley specifically. And so there was just this you know mood mood shift where I guess we have a vibe shift now. So in those days it was like probably the group shift. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qObbK4SjZnk&t=2005.8s)]
*  Right. So called the group shift. So the group the group shift 50 years ago was no more work with the military no more. The U.S. government is evil. The U.S. government is an evil colonial oppressive power wreaking havoc overseas. And it would be better to have like disarmament and you know passive passive basically pacifism. [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qObbK4SjZnk&t=2019.6s)]
*  And the U.S. should you know sort of give up all these all these foreign engagements. And that was a very hot you know very hot political topic because the Soviet Union was still up and running. But anyway as a result like a lot of these universities and then as a result a lot of the companies just basically disengaged. [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qObbK4SjZnk&t=2036.0s)]
*  They just weren't willing to do that. Another topic became very hot at the time was our so-called ROTC recruiting. So the military used to just actively recruit for new officers. Campuses and a lot of these colleges kind of outlawed that 50 years ago. [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qObbK4SjZnk&t=2048.04s)]
*  Anyway so. So I would say you know Paul you know is very very bright guy. You know Paul is kind of from that era. Not the Vietnam era but like the arc that followed like in the 80s and 90s when it was just universally assumed. Right. But of course you don't try to enable the military industrial complex complex defense agencies. I never really felt that way. And I don't know maybe it's just I don't know. I don't know where I grew up or whatever but I never really felt that way. But I knew I was kind of swimming in those waters for a long time. My company Netscape was always very active with the pen. [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qObbK4SjZnk&t=2058.96s)]
*  And intelligence. We always lean hard into it. That's the only real thing that you're Alex Carpenter I think is a national hero. The one thing that he does is he's you know Palantir is the first company has ever done this. No no we were doing it 10 years earlier but that's OK. Yeah he gets he gets tons of credit. [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qObbK4SjZnk&t=2088.96s)]
*  And so anyway so I would say Paul kind of represents that you know call it I don't know you know kind of neo hippie you know 80s and 90s you know phase where it's just like clearly you don't do this. And then to your point now the vibe shift is like you know now more recently with with Palantir and Andrew. [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qObbK4SjZnk&t=2104.76s)]
*  And again to give Alex Carp huge credit give Ryan Schiff and Palmer Lucky huge credit. Peter you know these guys you know really really led the way on this. [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qObbK4SjZnk&t=2119.76s)]
*  And so yeah the new model is of course you of course you work of course you work with them because number one you're a business and their customer and you shouldn't be like sitting there is like moral judge for like every single customer. [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qObbK4SjZnk&t=2128.56s)]
*  Yeah. Like is how are you going to do business if like you're sitting there having these moral conversations all day long. [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qObbK4SjZnk&t=2137.56s)]
*  And then number two it's like all right. The national these national missions actually matter. Right. And you know the border one is very inflammatory but like you should say most people in the history of civilization have thought that borders are an important and valid thing. [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qObbK4SjZnk&t=2142.56s)]
*  Yeah I mean you know is the world a safer place because the US is in it versus not. And because the US military is strong versus weak. And do we want to protect ourselves against terror attacks. [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qObbK4SjZnk&t=2155.36s)]
*  And so you know I think there's a lot of us that are like oh clearly we want to do those things. I'm encouraged by it because I think things are headed in the right direction according to what I want. [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qObbK4SjZnk&t=2165.36s)]
*  But I also recognize that you know these are serious underlying moral philosophical ethical questions. And I don't like I don't question Paul's good. I don't question Paul's intent. [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qObbK4SjZnk&t=2171.36s)]
*  I think I think when he says those things he's operating out of out of like a very strong sense of ethics and morals. Right. Totally. Well it goes to your early years. I disagree with him. Yes. [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qObbK4SjZnk&t=2180.16s)]
*  Self-worshipping the world and it didn't stop at you know social networks or marketplaces right. You got it to marketplaces got it to everything. [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qObbK4SjZnk&t=2188.16s)]
*  Yeah. That's right. And in fact what happened if you go to DC and if you talk to people who were if you talk to people who run the defense intelligence agencies in DC almost every topic that they talk about or think about has a major tech component to it. [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qObbK4SjZnk&t=2194.16s)]
*  Yeah. Like almost every single one. Yeah. I mean I just say you know obviously Ukraine is just Ukrainian battlefield. Is it completely new kind of battlefield because of all this new drone technology. Right. And all these things. [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qObbK4SjZnk&t=2203.96s)]
*  And that's basically true for like every area of every area of like you know basically national geopolitical policy has a big tech component to it. Right. And of course you know my approach is obviously we should be in the middle of that and obviously we should be investing against that and trying to help those things happen. [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qObbK4SjZnk&t=2214.96s)]
*  But I understand what people get uncomfortable with it. Yeah. That's a perfect place to wrap our conversation. I hope you saw it. Mark thanks so much. Thank you Eric. [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qObbK4SjZnk&t=2224.76s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qObbK4SjZnk&t=2254.76s)]
