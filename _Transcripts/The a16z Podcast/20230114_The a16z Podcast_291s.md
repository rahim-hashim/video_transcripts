# Neal Stephenson explains: What is the metaverse?
**The a16z Podcast:** [January 14, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=txHn12rcuXo)
*  This idea of the metaverse and many people are using this term. I think there's a degree of [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=txHn12rcuXo&t=0.0s)]
*  disalignment in terms of what the hell that actually means. I mean, to give a couple examples, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=txHn12rcuXo&t=8.64s)]
*  are we in the metaverse as we're recording this conversation? If there's an online auction, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=txHn12rcuXo&t=13.76s)]
*  is that in the metaverse? If I'm staring at my phone for an hour intently watching TikTok, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=txHn12rcuXo&t=18.240000000000002s)]
*  am I in the metaverse? And so as someone who coined the term, and I know not everyone will agree [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=txHn12rcuXo&t=24.080000000000002s)]
*  with your definition or your perspective, but I am curious to hear from you. What do you think of [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=txHn12rcuXo&t=28.56s)]
*  as the metaverse per se? In general, to address the specific things that you mentioned, I think [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=txHn12rcuXo&t=33.839999999999996s)]
*  anything that's being used a lot today probably is not very metaverse-like because in general, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=txHn12rcuXo&t=40.96s)]
*  when people talk about the metaverse, they're talking about the next thing that's coming along. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=txHn12rcuXo&t=49.44s)]
*  If it exists today, that suggests that maybe it's largely a pre-metaverse thing. But there [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=txHn12rcuXo&t=54.720000000000006s)]
*  are some exceptions that we can talk about in certain kinds of games and other experiences [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=txHn12rcuXo&t=60.64s)]
*  that I think are kind of on ramps. One of the most basic ones is do we talk about the metaverse [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=txHn12rcuXo&t=66.64s)]
*  or metaverses, plural. And so my colleague, Tony Parisi, has got seven rules of the metaverse. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=txHn12rcuXo&t=75.04s)]
*  And rule number one is that there's only the metaverse. There's not a bunch of metaverses. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=txHn12rcuXo&t=84.72s)]
*  So that for me is a strong indicator. If I see someone talking about our metaverse or a metaverse, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=txHn12rcuXo&t=91.60000000000001s)]
*  I immediately begin to question whether they really got it. Whereas if somebody talks about [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=txHn12rcuXo&t=100.08s)]
*  arts, the thing what we're building in the metaverse, that gives me more of a warm feeling [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=txHn12rcuXo&t=105.84s)]
*  about what they're doing. And I think that's because a central idea of the metaverse, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=txHn12rcuXo&t=112.32000000000001s)]
*  at least in the book, is that there is just one of them. And that doesn't mean that it's all [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=txHn12rcuXo&t=118.0s)]
*  kind of the same thing everywhere. Far from it. It's an incredibly diverse range of experiences. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=txHn12rcuXo&t=122.72s)]
*  But you can always get from one to the other by moving around in a single unitary space. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=txHn12rcuXo&t=129.28s)]
*  Right. There's a degree of interoperability between one and another. I'm curious to hear [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=txHn12rcuXo&t=136.64000000000001s)]
*  your perspective on that, though, because I guess your point is that we haven't made it to [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=txHn12rcuXo&t=142.0s)]
*  the metaverse yet. But many of the on ramps, you could say now, whether it's gaming or social [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=txHn12rcuXo&t=146.8s)]
*  or degrees of immersion that we have online, don't really have these connections. Right. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=txHn12rcuXo&t=153.2s)]
*  So many of them are disparate from one another. And so do you think that will change? I know [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=txHn12rcuXo&t=159.11999999999998s)]
*  we're going to get into your company, Lamina One, and I know there's other efforts by parties in, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=txHn12rcuXo&t=164.0s)]
*  quote unquote, the metaverse space. I think there was a consortium of 37 companies recently [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=txHn12rcuXo&t=169.44s)]
*  that came together to discuss this. But to get back to the question, do you see this changing? [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=txHn12rcuXo&t=173.6s)]
*  Because this has not been the precedent in the last couple of decades. I do see it changing. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=txHn12rcuXo&t=179.76s)]
*  There's not going to be one top down big boss that says, here's how it's all going to work. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=txHn12rcuXo&t=186.0s)]
*  It's going to be some ad hoc arrangements of people trying to work together. I think that [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=txHn12rcuXo&t=191.04s)]
*  the closest things that we currently can see to metaverse like experiences are games like [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=txHn12rcuXo&t=196.16s)]
*  Fortnite, Roblox, Minecraft, where you've got a bunch of people running around in a space. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=txHn12rcuXo&t=202.32s)]
*  They're all experiencing the same space at the same time. I mean, there might be shards. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=txHn12rcuXo&t=208.08s)]
*  But the idea is there that you're going to a place and you're sharing it with other people. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=txHn12rcuXo&t=215.44000000000003s)]
*  They've got huge user bases. And because of the revenue that those generate and just the sheer [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=txHn12rcuXo&t=221.44s)]
*  amount of experience that those companies can rack up by running those operations from day to day, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=txHn12rcuXo&t=228.96s)]
*  they're the leading candidates for coming together to build metaverse type experiences. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=txHn12rcuXo&t=235.92s)]
*  And I know that they're all actively thinking about this and how to do it. And I suspect that [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=txHn12rcuXo&t=240.95999999999998s)]
*  they're talking to one another about how do we build a bridge from our game or our experience [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=txHn12rcuXo&t=246.23999999999998s)]
*  to your game so that a person could go from one to the other. It may take some years to really [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=txHn12rcuXo&t=252.72s)]
*  come together, but I think it will come together. And I'm excited to see it happen and maybe be part [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=txHn12rcuXo&t=260.4s)]
*  of it. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=txHn12rcuXo&t=269.2s)]
*  you [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=txHn12rcuXo&t=290.32s)]
