# When Regulation Becomes Code
**The a16z Podcast:** [December 16, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmCHfOBAnR4)
*  There are 50,000 different rules and regs across different agencies, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmCHfOBAnR4&t=0.0s)]
*  and that's up from 10,000 in 1970. The everyday person should really care about this. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmCHfOBAnR4&t=4.4s)]
*  In 2025, regulation is going to become code. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmCHfOBAnR4&t=12.32s)]
*  Regulation is one of the biggest costs to existing companies, banks and insurance companies, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmCHfOBAnR4&t=16.16s)]
*  and healthcare companies specifically, and a huge burden to new entrants coming in and to innovation. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmCHfOBAnR4&t=20.72s)]
*  And I think in this country, we have a system where we efficiently add regulation, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmCHfOBAnR4&t=26.96s)]
*  but we never take away regulation. And so this problem keeps getting worse. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmCHfOBAnR4&t=31.200000000000003s)]
*  And finally, with the advent of AI, technology can help solve this problem. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmCHfOBAnR4&t=34.8s)]
*  You mentioned the fact that we add regulation every year. Just how lofty are these regulations? [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmCHfOBAnR4&t=39.2s)]
*  If you look at just federal banking regulation, right now there are 50,000 different rules and [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmCHfOBAnR4&t=44.0s)]
*  regs across different agencies, and that's up from 10,000 in 1970. But if you just look at the chart, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmCHfOBAnR4&t=50.64s)]
*  it just keeps growing and growing and growing. And so this problem is going to get worse, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmCHfOBAnR4&t=56.32s)]
*  not better. That's just federal. Every state is following exactly the same trend line. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmCHfOBAnR4&t=59.92s)]
*  Has compliance always been this burdensome? Or what's actually driving that increase? [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmCHfOBAnR4&t=66.08s)]
*  Here's how it's done today. You've got a large, you know, thousand-page PDF documentation. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmCHfOBAnR4&t=70.8s)]
*  A software company will make a fairly brittle workflow tool, and then you will have to hire [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmCHfOBAnR4&t=77.6s)]
*  many people to work inside a brittle workflow tool and figure out, you know, is this compliant [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmCHfOBAnR4&t=84.16s)]
*  or not compliant. So for instance, anti-money laundering. You work in a compliance monitoring [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmCHfOBAnR4&t=88.47999999999999s)]
*  tool. It sends up alerts if they think, you know, Stephanie is laundering money. And then somebody [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmCHfOBAnR4&t=93.44s)]
*  who works in that compliance department is going to have to do a bunch of research across a bunch [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmCHfOBAnR4&t=97.84s)]
*  of web sources and other different databases and write up a small report. Yes, no. When that goes [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmCHfOBAnR4&t=101.12s)]
*  wrong, it goes really wrong. And most recently, big headline TD Bank was fined $3 billion for having [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmCHfOBAnR4&t=106.72s)]
*  a long backlog of these compliance alerts. If you actually break down what they were failing [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmCHfOBAnR4&t=113.84s)]
*  to monitor, tens of thousands of detection alerts, thousands of investigation cases, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmCHfOBAnR4&t=120.16s)]
*  these are really big numbers. And to your point, the kind of things that are really hard for [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmCHfOBAnR4&t=124.72s)]
*  startups to manage, how does that impact the economics? Whether it's the compliance officers [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmCHfOBAnR4&t=129.52s)]
*  they need to hire or just like dealing with these fines, how does this actually work out? [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmCHfOBAnR4&t=134.24s)]
*  So large banks right now, up to 15% of their staff is just in compliance. You run into the fourth [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmCHfOBAnR4&t=137.68s)]
*  fastest growing job in the United States in the last 20 years. Compliance officers. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmCHfOBAnR4&t=143.52s)]
*  Compliance. Surprise. I kind of led the witness there, right? So you can't hire enough people. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmCHfOBAnR4&t=148.0s)]
*  They're completely underwater, right? I'm sure the compliance team at TD was working very hard. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmCHfOBAnR4&t=152.48000000000002s)]
*  So we need a technology solution. So how is this going to happen? I believe that every white collar [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmCHfOBAnR4&t=156.88s)]
*  worker eventually is going to have a co-pilot. And some of those roles will be replaced by agents. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmCHfOBAnR4&t=162.96s)]
*  But right, we're talking regulation. So we're not just going to let LLMs out into the wild. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmCHfOBAnR4&t=167.52s)]
*  We're going to use them to turbocharge very hardworking compliance people. And that's exactly [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmCHfOBAnR4&t=171.84s)]
*  where some companies are entering. So for instance, you would get an alert. We think so and so is [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmCHfOBAnR4&t=176.32s)]
*  money laundering. They can go do the web searches. They can check the databases. They can bring all [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmCHfOBAnR4&t=182.0s)]
*  of this information together. And now instead of a compliance officer having to do hours of research, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmCHfOBAnR4&t=185.76s)]
*  they can look at this report generated by their friendly compliance co-pilot. Yes, no, that's a [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmCHfOBAnR4&t=191.52s)]
*  five-minute task versus a several-hour task. Why do you think LLMs in particular are uniquely [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmCHfOBAnR4&t=197.04s)]
*  suited for this? Because they're able to apply some form of judgment. And so let's take a very [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmCHfOBAnR4&t=201.92s)]
*  specific example near and dear to our hearts. Anytime we want to tweet something, we are a [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmCHfOBAnR4&t=209.44s)]
*  registered investment advisor. We have a great compliance team. We have to send our tweets over, [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmCHfOBAnR4&t=213.76s)]
*  and they will tell us if we are compliant with the SEC marketing rule. I imagine nobody listening [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmCHfOBAnR4&t=218.39999999999998s)]
*  has actually read that rule. It's 400 pages. So our choices are you can have a software that [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmCHfOBAnR4&t=223.28s)]
*  creates an if, then, this, that type decision tree. Or you can have a LLM ingest that rule, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmCHfOBAnR4&t=228.08s)]
*  and they'll be able to make those judgment calls based on what's in that document, if my tweet is [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmCHfOBAnR4&t=237.12s)]
*  compliant or not. And then it could come back with specific modifications. And there's companies, [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmCHfOBAnR4&t=241.92000000000002s)]
*  for instance, Norm AI is one that's doing exactly that. It is codifying specific regulation such [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmCHfOBAnR4&t=246.16s)]
*  that you can send it things, and it'll come back and tell you the answer. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmCHfOBAnR4&t=251.68s)]
*  Do you feel like from the types of products that you've seen that they are at the point [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmCHfOBAnR4&t=254.88s)]
*  where they can sufficiently interpret those gray areas that sometimes do exist in compliance? [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmCHfOBAnR4&t=259.76s)]
*  So LLMs hallucinating. For my consumer colleagues, that's a feature. It comes out with great [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmCHfOBAnR4&t=264.8s)]
*  creative, fun, and enhancing things in the world of compliance that is definitively a bug. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmCHfOBAnR4&t=270.64s)]
*  Smarter entrepreneurs are getting around this in two different ways. One, [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmCHfOBAnR4&t=275.76s)]
*  it's much more of a copilot versus a full angel versus a full agent. And then they're able to [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmCHfOBAnR4&t=279.84000000000003s)]
*  test enough edge cases around that the likelihood of hallucination is very, very, very low based on [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmCHfOBAnR4&t=286.48s)]
*  how they fine tune the model to that specific regulation. The other piece is a big part of [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmCHfOBAnR4&t=292.72s)]
*  compliance is being able to show that you've gone through all of the steps to be compliant. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmCHfOBAnR4&t=298.48s)]
*  And so versus a black box coming back with, yes, we've onboarded this business, [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmCHfOBAnR4&t=303.68s)]
*  we've onboarded this business in a specific way, it's going to show exactly all of the checks that [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmCHfOBAnR4&t=307.92s)]
*  you've done, all of the documents you've gotten, what you've pulled out of it. And so it's a very [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmCHfOBAnR4&t=312.32s)]
*  clear delineation of what's been done. But again, it saves the officer having to do all that work. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmCHfOBAnR4&t=317.04s)]
*  They can just check the box. That makes sense. And are you seeing these tools on the market? [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmCHfOBAnR4&t=321.92s)]
*  Give us some examples of what already exists. Notoriously, banks, insurance companies, [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmCHfOBAnR4&t=325.6s)]
*  even fintechs can be slow to sell into. I think there's a couple of things going on. One, [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmCHfOBAnR4&t=330.48s)]
*  this has become such a burdensome problem that buyers are very open minded to new tools. And two, [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmCHfOBAnR4&t=335.6s)]
*  companies of all sizes have woken up and said that AI can make a significant difference to our [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmCHfOBAnR4&t=341.6s)]
*  business. And so the sales cycles are moving much, much more quickly. And so they range from [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmCHfOBAnR4&t=345.52000000000004s)]
*  thinking of co-pilots that go along with your compliance officers. I mentioned a couple of [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmCHfOBAnR4&t=352.8s)]
*  examples there. The other thing that's happening is these older system of record tools, so take [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmCHfOBAnR4&t=357.92s)]
*  transaction monitoring, that are built pre-AI. They used to be seen as too risky to rip and replace. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmCHfOBAnR4&t=365.2s)]
*  And now what we're seeing is the new gen AI first tools are 10x better versus 2x better. So for [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmCHfOBAnR4&t=372.40000000000003s)]
*  instance, Sardin is a company that's got a much more modern transaction monitoring system. And [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmCHfOBAnR4&t=379.12s)]
*  they are seeing customers rip and replace, actimize. It's been around for 20 years. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmCHfOBAnR4&t=384.0s)]
*  And that's just not something that we would have seen five years ago, but it's because it's just [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmCHfOBAnR4&t=388.96s)]
*  that much better. I assume, as you said, many of these industries are a little slow to adopt [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmCHfOBAnR4&t=393.52s)]
*  technology. What stands out in terms of what may actually stop this adoption? [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmCHfOBAnR4&t=399.04s)]
*  It is moving a lot more quickly than I would have thought. I've been investing in and around the [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmCHfOBAnR4&t=403.6s)]
*  space for the last 10 years. And the momentum and even just the ACVs that some early companies are [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmCHfOBAnR4&t=407.92s)]
*  getting is quite fast. I think the two things that come up with the blockers where the smart [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmCHfOBAnR4&t=414.72s)]
*  founders have gotten around are one, how do I prevent this from hallucinating? And I think the [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmCHfOBAnR4&t=419.2s)]
*  two ways are one, showing the work, and then two, proving that you have fine-tuned your models close [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmCHfOBAnR4&t=423.76s)]
*  enough to this regulation that that actually doesn't happen. And a backup plan as a human does [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmCHfOBAnR4&t=428.24s)]
*  actually resolve it. But I think the most important can be wedging in at a pain point that is very [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmCHfOBAnR4&t=432.56s)]
*  acute with the right buyer. And personas that weren't sold into that often before have become [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmCHfOBAnR4&t=440.48s)]
*  very popular. Oh, like what? [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmCHfOBAnR4&t=445.84000000000003s)]
*  Chief compliance officers, like BSA officers. I imagine all of these potential buyers are now [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmCHfOBAnR4&t=447.6s)]
*  getting a lot of interest from very technical solutions. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmCHfOBAnR4&t=457.68s)]
*  That's great. And I mean, if we think maybe a little more long term about opportunity here, [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmCHfOBAnR4&t=461.12s)]
*  right? If we really are talking about these LLMs coming in and reshaping the compliance ecosystem, [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmCHfOBAnR4&t=465.76s)]
*  and this idea that you say, regulation becoming code, what does that enable? Or maybe you could [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmCHfOBAnR4&t=471.84000000000003s)]
*  actually kind of reframe that question to say, given the overhead that exists today, what are we [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmCHfOBAnR4&t=476.48s)]
*  unable to do because of all of that compliance? Yeah. So think of just a consumer's life in [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmCHfOBAnR4&t=482.08s)]
*  financial services and how much better some of these new entrants have made your life. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmCHfOBAnR4&t=489.04s)]
*  So trading now is free. I would argue that's in large part because Robinhood came along, [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmCHfOBAnR4&t=494.32s)]
*  made trading free and put pressure on all the large brokerages. For a large portion of the US [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmCHfOBAnR4&t=500.40000000000003s)]
*  population, it was very difficult to get a free checking account. Chime came along, enabled that [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmCHfOBAnR4&t=506.96000000000004s)]
*  to be possible and put pressure on the incumbents. And so it is good for everyone for new entrants [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmCHfOBAnR4&t=512.16s)]
*  to be able to come into this space. And one of the biggest barriers is just regulation. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmCHfOBAnR4&t=517.76s)]
*  And so the easier that we can make it for smart people of all resources to be able to start new [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmCHfOBAnR4&t=523.12s)]
*  companies, it's going to be better for consumers, it's going to be better for businesses. And as we [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmCHfOBAnR4&t=529.76s)]
*  looked at 2025, because this is your big idea for next year, what are you looking for in particular? [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmCHfOBAnR4&t=533.28s)]
*  Yeah, I love two categories. One are old systems of record that you can do just infinitely better, [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmCHfOBAnR4&t=538.4s)]
*  and especially ones that have an extreme economic impact. So I mentioned before small business [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmCHfOBAnR4&t=547.36s)]
*  lending, many businesses get loans from the SBA. It takes on average 90 days. Why? Part of that is [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmCHfOBAnR4&t=551.84s)]
*  there's a thousand plus page documentation about how do you make this loan compliance, right? So [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmCHfOBAnR4&t=560.08s)]
*  what is that LOS in that process? It's very much going to streamline that. And it is great for the [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmCHfOBAnR4&t=565.28s)]
*  economy for our small businesses to be able to get the credit that they need. So systems of record, [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmCHfOBAnR4&t=570.32s)]
*  point one. And then point two would be any area where a company needs to hire, you know, [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmCHfOBAnR4&t=574.8s)]
*  dozen plus people to do a task where those people would rather do something a little bit more [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmCHfOBAnR4&t=581.5999999999999s)]
*  strategic. That can be a very interesting wedge in for a co-pilot type opportunity. And then you can [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmCHfOBAnR4&t=585.8399999999999s)]
*  start expanding and doing my task from there. So as we look to these changes, it might be obvious [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmCHfOBAnR4&t=592.9599999999999s)]
