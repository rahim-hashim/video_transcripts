# ElevenLabs: Bringing Voice to Life
**The a16z Podcast:** [July 30, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hiYSyRmOqdk)
*  I think we've always had the dream of voice interactions with all our products. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hiYSyRmOqdk&t=0.0s)]
*  If you think about Star Trek and Knight Rider talking to his car kit, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hiYSyRmOqdk&t=4.32s)]
*  it's something that's been a part of pop culture history forever. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hiYSyRmOqdk&t=8.88s)]
*  I can't believe this. A car. It talks back to me. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hiYSyRmOqdk&t=13.120000000000001s)]
*  You had an idea and now you can imagine it, right? [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hiYSyRmOqdk&t=17.44s)]
*  You can imagine the image that you wanted and that was in your head and the dream you had. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hiYSyRmOqdk&t=20.400000000000002s)]
*  And now we're saying you can imagine the sound that you're probably hearing in your head [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hiYSyRmOqdk&t=24.080000000000002s)]
*  that no one else can hear yet. We want to flip it on its head and say, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hiYSyRmOqdk&t=27.28s)]
*  you should be able to imagine the perfect sound for the thing you're making, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hiYSyRmOqdk&t=30.48s)]
*  not retrofit it into what's available and out there. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hiYSyRmOqdk&t=33.68s)]
*  Hey, I'm Ammar. I'm the head of design at Lovin' Labs and I lead product and brand design across [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hiYSyRmOqdk&t=44.8s)]
*  company. We are in a 16Z office in New York and in a little cupboard right now recording this podcast. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hiYSyRmOqdk&t=49.760000000000005s)]
*  Was I not meant to reveal that? [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hiYSyRmOqdk&t=56.88s)]
*  I think we're getting to that point where the interactions between large language models using [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hiYSyRmOqdk&t=58.88s)]
*  voice interfaces is becoming incredibly natural and feels like talking to a person. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hiYSyRmOqdk&t=63.84s)]
*  You're seeing essentially the pieces that are all going to come together to allow you to create [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hiYSyRmOqdk&t=68.56s)]
*  anything with audio and eventually get to what we imagine will be like a general AI audio model. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hiYSyRmOqdk&t=73.03999999999999s)]
*  So yes, you have speech, but then just describe any sound you want and you'll be able to have it, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hiYSyRmOqdk&t=78.48s)]
*  with music and sound effects, we see them all combining together essentially. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hiYSyRmOqdk&t=83.76s)]
*  And so I think to give them that ability is what we're very excited about. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hiYSyRmOqdk&t=87.52s)]
*  Before you get there, you have to have all those foundational models and pieces to [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hiYSyRmOqdk&t=91.52s)]
*  kind of have that complete suite. VoiceOver Studio essentially allows you to take any video and then [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hiYSyRmOqdk&t=95.68s)]
*  layer on sound effects tracks or voice tracks directly within Lovin' Labs. So this is a great [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hiYSyRmOqdk&t=101.36s)]
*  way, for instance, to see what a sound effect might feel like with a video you're working with. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hiYSyRmOqdk&t=106.16s)]
*  I have this video I generated with Luma of the city on fire for the same sort of Superman short, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hiYSyRmOqdk&t=111.60000000000001s)]
*  but I'm like, okay, now it needs sound, it needs to be brought to life. So all I have to do is just [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hiYSyRmOqdk&t=116.8s)]
*  click on the track timeline here, drag it out a little bit, and I'll say police cars in the distance. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hiYSyRmOqdk&t=122.16s)]
*  Here's what we got. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hiYSyRmOqdk&t=132.48000000000002s)]
*  And you're starting to see, okay, it seems coming to life a bit, but maybe I also want [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hiYSyRmOqdk&t=133.52s)]
*  something for the buildings on fire. So you'll just say like, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hiYSyRmOqdk&t=138.48000000000002s)]
*  built city, you know, let's say city buildings on fire. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hiYSyRmOqdk&t=143.28s)]
*  And what's cool here is you're now seeing how the sound effects are being layered as well, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hiYSyRmOqdk&t=149.12s)]
*  and I can drag them to extend them, or I can shorten them as well. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hiYSyRmOqdk&t=152.88s)]
*  And so now we have the building on fire. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hiYSyRmOqdk&t=157.12s)]
*  And so you've kind of composed your shot and you've given it a lot more life, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hiYSyRmOqdk&t=169.12s)]
*  and then you can just export that. So I think this is going to be a great tool for creators, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hiYSyRmOqdk&t=172.48000000000002s)]
*  especially who are working with their videos and really want to experiment with the sounds that [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hiYSyRmOqdk&t=177.12s)]
*  they could layer on before they, you know, go into their full production workflow. We know there [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hiYSyRmOqdk&t=181.28s)]
*  are creators and enterprise companies who have their own pro studio tools. And so for us, it's [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hiYSyRmOqdk&t=186.96s)]
*  thinking about the things we build, how do they fit into those things? Because we don't want to [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hiYSyRmOqdk&t=192.48000000000002s)]
*  necessarily change their behavior entirely on like what they're using. We just want to be a part of [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hiYSyRmOqdk&t=197.04000000000002s)]
*  it. And then we know that there are creators who are actually agnostic to the tools that they're [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hiYSyRmOqdk&t=201.76000000000002s)]
*  using, and they just want to try the coolest new things. And so with that front, we continue to [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hiYSyRmOqdk&t=206.4s)]
*  build out our platform, but think about it in a way where it should also be easy to integrate [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hiYSyRmOqdk&t=211.76000000000002s)]
*  anywhere. The magic really comes from going through all the voices we have. And so you might [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hiYSyRmOqdk&t=216.32s)]
*  find a voice that even sparks your inspiration for something you might want to do. We have a ton of [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hiYSyRmOqdk&t=221.28s)]
*  multilingual voices. So we have one that we just added for Hindi and it sounds super authentic. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hiYSyRmOqdk&t=226.56s)]
*  So here it is. And so that like basically means that you can create content for a whole new audience [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hiYSyRmOqdk&t=231.6s)]
*  if you wanted to. I think the safety aspect is super important. And we have systems built to detect [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hiYSyRmOqdk&t=241.76s)]
*  voices that are maybe resembling an important public figure. We have an AI speech classifier to [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hiYSyRmOqdk&t=248.16s)]
*  check, hey, was this generated by 11 labs? We also obviously have content moderation in place. To [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hiYSyRmOqdk&t=254.16s)]
*  train people to actually ask those questions and think that way is going to be a big part of it, [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hiYSyRmOqdk&t=259.52s)]
*  as well as providing the tools. I do totally see a future where a lot of this physical interface [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hiYSyRmOqdk&t=264.64s)]
*  that you're tapping around with is going to just fade away and you're going to be able to ask the [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hiYSyRmOqdk&t=271.28s)]
*  questions you want to ask and have the conversations you want to have. I think where we fit in is, [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hiYSyRmOqdk&t=275.03999999999996s)]
*  you know, ideally being the voice of that experience and making it as natural and [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hiYSyRmOqdk&t=280.15999999999997s)]
*  giving people the most authentic experience with these voices. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hiYSyRmOqdk&t=286.79999999999995s)]
