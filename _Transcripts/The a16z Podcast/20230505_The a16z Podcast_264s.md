# Is Design Enough to Differentiate? Carl Pei Weighs In
**The a16z Podcast:** [May 05, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqHydbc9tbo)
*  And so when you ventured into this, how did you think about differentiating amongst the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqHydbc9tbo&t=0.0s)]
*  already existing products? [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqHydbc9tbo&t=9.9s)]
*  Like you mentioned that you wanted to create something cool. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqHydbc9tbo&t=11.66s)]
*  What does that mean? [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqHydbc9tbo&t=14.92s)]
*  Like what is the calculus in actually producing something that people resonate with? [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqHydbc9tbo&t=15.92s)]
*  I think as a startup company, you have no resources anywhere. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqHydbc9tbo&t=22.68s)]
*  Your capabilities are weak everywhere, so you just got to pick the lowest hanging fruit [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqHydbc9tbo&t=28.32s)]
*  or the easiest thing that might give you an opportunity to break through. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqHydbc9tbo&t=33.76s)]
*  So we started off with differentiating our products in terms of hardware design. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqHydbc9tbo&t=37.84s)]
*  And the way we approached it was first we looked at the entire industry and we saw that [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqHydbc9tbo&t=42.56s)]
*  there were very few brands that tried to build a family of devices that had a coherent design [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqHydbc9tbo&t=48.400000000000006s)]
*  language. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqHydbc9tbo&t=53.72s)]
*  I think Apple today is one of those companies that still do it. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqHydbc9tbo&t=54.72s)]
*  If you look at the Apple product design, they've started introducing a much sharper edges on [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqHydbc9tbo&t=57.6s)]
*  their products. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqHydbc9tbo&t=63.4s)]
*  So the iPhone is much boxier than before, but it also cascades into their other products, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqHydbc9tbo&t=64.4s)]
*  the iMac, the iPad, et cetera. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqHydbc9tbo&t=69.4s)]
*  So you can see that there's one coherent design vision being brought to life. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqHydbc9tbo&t=71.52s)]
*  And even if you don't see the Apple logo, you know it's an Apple product. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqHydbc9tbo&t=75.2s)]
*  It's very hard to find a second company like that today. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqHydbc9tbo&t=79.4s)]
*  But some of the most respected tech companies of the past stay true to this. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqHydbc9tbo&t=81.6s)]
*  So the Sony of the past or the Bang & Olufsen of the past, they all had very distinct design [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqHydbc9tbo&t=87.91999999999999s)]
*  languages. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqHydbc9tbo&t=93.83999999999999s)]
*  So that's one of the first principles we decided that we had to pursue. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqHydbc9tbo&t=94.83999999999999s)]
*  When we have more products on the market in different categories, even when the consumer [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqHydbc9tbo&t=98.36s)]
*  don't see our logo, they should still know it's a product made by nothing. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqHydbc9tbo&t=102.39999999999999s)]
*  And then we started just taking inspiration from different creative fields, from architecture [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqHydbc9tbo&t=107.52s)]
*  design to fashion design to movies to electronics, et cetera. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqHydbc9tbo&t=113.8s)]
*  And then we kind of landed on this concept of having all our products be transparent [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqHydbc9tbo&t=118.96s)]
*  in some way. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqHydbc9tbo&t=123.8s)]
*  Strategically, I think these big brands, they're not going to create a transparent product [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqHydbc9tbo&t=124.8s)]
*  anymore. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqHydbc9tbo&t=128.6s)]
*  Apple used to. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqHydbc9tbo&t=129.6s)]
*  A lot of the Apple iMacs of the past were transparent. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqHydbc9tbo&t=130.6s)]
*  Some of the Nintendo Gameboys were transparent. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqHydbc9tbo&t=135.67999999999998s)]
*  But I think when you're a niche player, you can be more differentiated in your hardware [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqHydbc9tbo&t=138.64s)]
*  design. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqHydbc9tbo&t=144.04s)]
*  But when you're a mass, you got to sell to everybody from the youngest person to the [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqHydbc9tbo&t=145.04s)]
*  oldest person, all types of different professions. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqHydbc9tbo&t=149.07999999999998s)]
*  So you cannot take a lot of risk with your design anymore. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqHydbc9tbo&t=151.6s)]
*  If you take too much risk, that's going to reduce your market share. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqHydbc9tbo&t=153.83999999999997s)]
*  But for us as a small company, that's exactly what we need to do. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqHydbc9tbo&t=157.27999999999997s)]
*  So Apple used to have this positioning on the design side that they abandoned because [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqHydbc9tbo&t=160.82s)]
*  they grew out of it. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqHydbc9tbo&t=166.7s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, every startup has to find their wedge. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqHydbc9tbo&t=168.42s)]
*  And to your point, Apple itself, the iPhone used to be a more niche phone catering to [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqHydbc9tbo&t=170.9s)]
*  a more niche audience. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqHydbc9tbo&t=175.94s)]
*  And now they have to cater to literally everyone. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqHydbc9tbo&t=177.1s)]
*  And so there are many ways that a company, let alone a hardware company, can differentiate. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqHydbc9tbo&t=179.88s)]
*  But what you've at least sounds like chosen to differentiate with is design. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqHydbc9tbo&t=185.5s)]
*  Yeah, I think in this stage of the company's development, we can only differentiate on [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqHydbc9tbo&t=190.3s)]
*  design. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqHydbc9tbo&t=194.7s)]
*  And the insight that we drew upon is very simply that all product categories start off [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqHydbc9tbo&t=196.46s)]
*  functional. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqHydbc9tbo&t=201.08s)]
*  Like even imagine when clothing was just invented as a concept, we just needed to keep ourselves [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqHydbc9tbo&t=203.3s)]
*  warm and shelter ourselves from the weather conditions. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqHydbc9tbo&t=209.5s)]
*  But now we want to express ourselves, our personality, our individuality through the [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqHydbc9tbo&t=213.18s)]
*  types of clothes that we wear. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqHydbc9tbo&t=218.06s)]
*  We knew there were people out there who just didn't want to have the same white wireless [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqHydbc9tbo&t=220.01999999999998s)]
*  earbuds as everybody else. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqHydbc9tbo&t=222.94s)]
*  And we thought there would be a market for that. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqHydbc9tbo&t=225.1s)]
*  But having said that, it's not a very strong moat, design differentiation. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqHydbc9tbo&t=227.78s)]
*  So as the company grows and we start generating more and more free cash flow, that needs to [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqHydbc9tbo&t=234.23999999999998s)]
*  be reinvested into technology. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqHydbc9tbo&t=240.78s)]
*  Technology is the only real moat for a tech company. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqHydbc9tbo&t=243.34s)]
