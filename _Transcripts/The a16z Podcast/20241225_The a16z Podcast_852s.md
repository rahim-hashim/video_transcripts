# Virtual Worlds Mean Real Business: How Games Power the Future
**The a16z Podcast:** [December 25, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y19hzwTGIss)
*  The 90s was about text on the internet. The 2000s was about images. The 2010s was about video. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y19hzwTGIss&t=0.0s)]
*  And we feel pretty strongly that the 2020s is going to be about interactive 3D and gaming [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y19hzwTGIss&t=6.32s)]
*  technology being used in the enterprise. Games are essentially virtual simulations. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y19hzwTGIss&t=11.52s)]
*  And those virtual simulations have been designed for fun over the last couple decades. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y19hzwTGIss&t=20.56s)]
*  Increasingly, we're going to be seeing them used in the real world for all kinds of use cases, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y19hzwTGIss&t=27.119999999999997s)]
*  whether it's training and learning and development or training grounds for robotics and other [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y19hzwTGIss&t=32.16s)]
*  autonomous systems or visualization to allow folks to see things come to life in real-time 3D. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y19hzwTGIss&t=39.44s)]
*  Maybe. And also, are there any that you think maybe are overlooked? Everyone references GPUs [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y19hzwTGIss&t=56.88s)]
*  today as maybe one example, but are there others? People forget that Nvidia was a gaming company. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y19hzwTGIss&t=67.68s)]
*  Almost all of the revenue in the early years was for gaming graphics cards, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y19hzwTGIss&t=73.44s)]
*  processing units for computationally intense and matrix multiplications, which were great for [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y19hzwTGIss&t=78.4s)]
*  rendering images and animations and videos. But then we soon found that it was useful for [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y19hzwTGIss&t=83.68s)]
*  things like cryptocurrency mining and of course now- [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y19hzwTGIss&t=89.12s)]
*  Feels like everything. Digital biology. The idea of this accelerated computing is now being used [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y19hzwTGIss&t=92.08000000000001s)]
*  just around everywhere. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y19hzwTGIss&t=97.52000000000001s)]
*  Totally. And I was looking back at some of Nvidia's earliest websites and the headline was, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y19hzwTGIss&t=98.56s)]
*  The Future is 3D. And it's so funny that 25 years later, while it's been slower than one would have [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y19hzwTGIss&t=104.96000000000001s)]
*  hoped for this real-time 3D to intersect with all these other industries. And we'll talk a little [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y19hzwTGIss&t=111.2s)]
*  bit about why we think now is the right time. But if we go back, the 90s was about text on the [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y19hzwTGIss&t=116.4s)]
*  internet. The 2000s was about images. The 2010s was about video. And we feel pretty strongly that [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y19hzwTGIss&t=123.68s)]
*  the 2020s is going to be about interactive 3D and gaming technology being used in the enterprise. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y19hzwTGIss&t=131.52s)]
*  And maybe just to take a step back, why is it that games or the gaming industry and the technologies [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y19hzwTGIss&t=137.6s)]
*  that are derived from that? Why is that a crucible for innovation? [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y19hzwTGIss&t=142.72s)]
*  I mean, Jensen said himself that he allowed consumer spend to fund the R&D to bring it to [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y19hzwTGIss&t=146.48s)]
*  what it is today. And I think that that's an interesting lens to think about gaming technology. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y19hzwTGIss&t=152.72s)]
*  In the gaming industry, technology innovations are celebrated. It's new technology, whether it's new [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y19hzwTGIss&t=157.84s)]
*  platforms or new features or evolutions that allow new game designs to emerge and flourish. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y19hzwTGIss&t=165.36s)]
*  The gaming community, both players and developers, it's a hacker mentality. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y19hzwTGIss&t=172.32000000000002s)]
*  Totally. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y19hzwTGIss&t=176.64000000000001s)]
*  And so it's no surprise that that's where big breakthroughs have emerged in the past and where [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y19hzwTGIss&t=177.12s)]
*  we're going to see them continue to emerge. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y19hzwTGIss&t=183.28000000000003s)]
*  Yeah. And some of those breakthroughs aren't always obvious as breakthroughs. A good example [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y19hzwTGIss&t=184.8s)]
*  is multiplayer. Multiplayer has existed forever in gaming. And then it took a while for that to [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y19hzwTGIss&t=188.8s)]
*  really penetrate or really companies were built off the idea of multiplayer. You take something [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y19hzwTGIss&t=194.08s)]
*  like Figma, right? So on that note, today in the gaming industry, there's still lots of innovation [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y19hzwTGIss&t=198.88000000000002s)]
*  happening that maybe again in a decade or so we'll see elsewhere. And so let's talk about those [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y19hzwTGIss&t=204.48000000000002s)]
*  tailwinds. You talk about three in your big idea. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y19hzwTGIss&t=209.20000000000002s)]
*  Yeah. And before A16Z, I was at Unity for close to five years and got a front row seat to seeing [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y19hzwTGIss&t=211.28s)]
*  how all these various industries were beginning to experiment with real-time 3D for some of the [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y19hzwTGIss&t=216.96s)]
*  things that I talked about before, whether it's visualization for architects to be able to walk [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y19hzwTGIss&t=224.4s)]
*  through their design before it's constructed and they can see if there's errors or other imperfections [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y19hzwTGIss&t=230.08s)]
*  that they wish they had known when they were designing or for automotive manufacturers, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y19hzwTGIss&t=236.96s)]
*  they use real-time 3D for also the design, but also virtual test driving. And now the sort of [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y19hzwTGIss&t=241.2s)]
*  heads up displays that you see in Rivian is powered by Unreal. BMWs is powered by Unity. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y19hzwTGIss&t=248.39999999999998s)]
*  There's the virtual training, whether it's for heavy machinery operations or other sort of [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y19hzwTGIss&t=254.32s)]
*  operations tasks. But some of the bottlenecks for a lot of these use cases that seem so obvious [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y19hzwTGIss&t=261.2s)]
*  are really some of the same constraints that the gaming, the game developers have faced. And so [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y19hzwTGIss&t=268.64s)]
*  it's bottlenecks on the content creation side. Within a game studio, more than half of the spend [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y19hzwTGIss&t=273.92s)]
*  goes towards creation of the assets and the arts and the content that goes into these virtual [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y19hzwTGIss&t=280.4s)]
*  simulations. And the same is true for these non-gaming use cases, except they don't have 3D [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y19hzwTGIss&t=286.88s)]
*  artists on staff to build those. And so now when we have AI for asset generation, whether it's [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y19hzwTGIss&t=292.56s)]
*  images or audio or now 3D assets, it makes that so much easier. So that's one. The second is [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y19hzwTGIss&t=300.96s)]
*  for 3D capture techniques. So for a lot of these non-gaming use cases, they want to capture the [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y19hzwTGIss&t=308.56s)]
*  physical world as it's built and as it's seen. Like there is a correct version in a way. Yes. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y19hzwTGIss&t=314.72s)]
*  And there's been technologies in the past that have allowed this, things like photogrammetry, [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y19hzwTGIss&t=321.52s)]
*  or in the case of Matterport, for instance, where it's basically just a 360-degree image, [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y19hzwTGIss&t=326.24s)]
*  but you can't actually interact with the environment the same way you can with a video game. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y19hzwTGIss&t=331.76s)]
*  Well, now with newer technologies, nerve or neural radiance fields of a couple years ago, [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y19hzwTGIss&t=336.88s)]
*  and more recently, other radiance fields technologies like Gaussian splatting, [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y19hzwTGIss&t=342.88s)]
*  which allow consumers to capture in a much more efficient manner. And it's photorealistic, [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y19hzwTGIss&t=347.44s)]
*  lifelike. And it's immediate, right? Yes. In terms of the capture? Exactly. And then the third is [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y19hzwTGIss&t=355.28s)]
*  for some of these non-gaming use cases, this is where we're going to see the prevalence of XR [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y19hzwTGIss&t=360.72s)]
*  and being able to put on a headset and see how the BIM model overlays on the construction site [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y19hzwTGIss&t=367.68s)]
*  or for medical surgery simulation or other use cases like this. And as we have better headsets [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y19hzwTGIss&t=375.12s)]
*  later with eye tracking and other amazing technologies, there's still lots to come in [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y19hzwTGIss&t=386.47999999999996s)]
*  terms of development there, but I think that's going to unlock some of these. Absolutely. And [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y19hzwTGIss&t=392.15999999999997s)]
*  as we talk about all three of those tailwinds, so again, the content creation, the capture that [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y19hzwTGIss&t=396.8s)]
*  you mentioned, and then the devices, it feels like each one of those has their own cost curve. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y19hzwTGIss&t=400.88s)]
*  And we're traversing down that cost curve pretty quickly across all three. Can you speak to the [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y19hzwTGIss&t=406.4s)]
*  economics there? I mean, you touched on it a little bit in terms of even games, you said 50% [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y19hzwTGIss&t=411.2s)]
*  goes toward content creation. Yeah. So how quickly is that dropping? And then same thing for the [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y19hzwTGIss&t=416.4s)]
*  devices. Particularly for these non-gaming use cases, some of which photorealism is everything. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y19hzwTGIss&t=420.8s)]
*  And that's why as Unreal and other 3D engines have progressed towards photorealistics, these [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y19hzwTGIss&t=428.32s)]
*  use cases have been unlocked. But for other use cases, actually, you don't really care [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y19hzwTGIss&t=434.56s)]
*  what the BIM model looks like so long as it has utility for you. And so as some of these asset [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y19hzwTGIss&t=441.2s)]
*  classes are up to par with what they would expect to use for these, the cost dropped dramatically. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y19hzwTGIss&t=448.56s)]
*  But more importantly, I think, particularly if you think about virtual training use cases where [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y19hzwTGIss&t=455.44s)]
*  let's say we wanted to train our workforce on maintenance and repairs for a robot, well, [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y19hzwTGIss&t=460.56s)]
*  you would build this experience and you would find the development of this virtual simulation. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y19hzwTGIss&t=468.24s)]
*  But then after the fact, if the team wanted to update it or add content to it, they'd have to [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y19hzwTGIss&t=473.76s)]
*  go back to the outsourced agency who built them the original digital twin. And now they'll be [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y19hzwTGIss&t=480.08s)]
*  empowered to do that themselves internally. So what you're pointing out is it's not just a [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y19hzwTGIss&t=487.28s)]
*  one-to-one how is the economics of creating one thing, how is that changing, but also how it's [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y19hzwTGIss&t=490.96s)]
*  integrated into the entire system. That's really interesting. Let's talk about applications. You've [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y19hzwTGIss&t=495.91999999999996s)]
*  already touched on a bunch, but you've mentioned several companies which are very different, [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y19hzwTGIss&t=500.79999999999995s)]
*  right? Andro, Tesla, BMW. And then you've also talked about workforce training, [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y19hzwTGIss&t=504.71999999999997s)]
*  tell me a little bit more about those applications and where does it end or is it really, [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y19hzwTGIss&t=509.84s)]
*  we're seeing it everywhere. Autonomy is deeply rooted with these virtual simulations. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y19hzwTGIss&t=514.4s)]
*  Yeah. Andro as a great example. Funny enough, Andro's first acquisition was a game studio. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y19hzwTGIss&t=519.1999999999999s)]
*  Really? Which would be surprising for a defense tech company. I guess if you take Palmer's past. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y19hzwTGIss&t=526.4s)]
*  Yeah, they were interested in acquiring it for the game engine that this studio had developed [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y19hzwTGIss&t=531.04s)]
*  and they use that technology for strategy simulation and other autonomy workflows. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y19hzwTGIss&t=536.48s)]
*  And then with other companies, Applied Intuition as an example, it's just impractical with the [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y19hzwTGIss&t=543.28s)]
*  scale of training data that you need to capture this in the real world. And so when you have these [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y19hzwTGIss&t=548.5600000000001s)]
*  virtual simulations, you can not only scale the amount of data, but also the fringe and edge [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y19hzwTGIss&t=553.9200000000001s)]
*  cases that you would never be able to experience or capture in the real world, whether it's like [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y19hzwTGIss&t=561.04s)]
*  extreme weather or human intervention that is one in a thousand situations. But of course, [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y19hzwTGIss&t=568.8s)]
*  for these things to be deployed, they need to take into account all of these edge cases. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y19hzwTGIss&t=575.4399999999999s)]
*  One way to put what you just said around Applied Intuition is that you can actually do something [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y19hzwTGIss&t=579.5999999999999s)]
*  new that you couldn't do before with the ability to simulate at scale. Are there other downstream [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y19hzwTGIss&t=584.0s)]
*  opportunities or like second, third order effects that you can think of that we get from these [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y19hzwTGIss&t=589.12s)]
*  virtual environments? While in the past, we had the ability to use these virtual simulations for [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y19hzwTGIss&t=593.68s)]
*  physics training environments or the learning and workforce development that we talked about. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y19hzwTGIss&t=600.4s)]
*  But these were mostly other physics simulations or hard skills. But now with, we call them AI [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y19hzwTGIss&t=606.64s)]
*  NPCs in the gaming context, whereas before NPCs were scripted. But now these agents can take on [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y19hzwTGIss&t=614.32s)]
*  a life of their own. They can observe the environment, they can reason and plan, [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y19hzwTGIss&t=623.6800000000001s)]
*  and then they can act. Well, when you have a multi-agent simulation, when we think about [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y19hzwTGIss&t=628.8000000000001s)]
*  the next pandemic response or immigration policies and how those impact a civilization, [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y19hzwTGIss&t=635.36s)]
*  we're going to be testing these in a virtual environment with these agents who can interact [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y19hzwTGIss&t=641.84s)]
*  with each other. A lot of the applications you've mentioned have been more enterprise [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y19hzwTGIss&t=646.32s)]
*  focused, right? A company like Android or Tesla. Gaming obviously existed to begin with in the [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y19hzwTGIss&t=650.1600000000001s)]
*  consumer sphere. And so do you see more consumer applications already also coming up? So one of the [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y19hzwTGIss&t=656.72s)]
*  ones that I've just been so excited for and looking out for is, I just moved into a new [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y19hzwTGIss&t=662.88s)]
*  apartment. And as I wanted to plan out the space, I was still using grid paper and pen. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y19hzwTGIss&t=670.6400000000001s)]
*  Same. Despite the fact that we've had the Sims for 25 years, where we can in a 3D environment, [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y19hzwTGIss&t=677.84s)]
*  drag and drop furniture and see how it fits. And all the technology exists today to have that [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y19hzwTGIss&t=684.72s)]
*  experience in an amazing intuitive way. And yet it doesn't exist. But we should be able to, [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y19hzwTGIss&t=691.6s)]
*  and we can scan our space and develop a digital twin of the 3D environment. We should be able to [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y19hzwTGIss&t=699.36s)]
*  show it, design inspiration that I find from Pinterest, have it find the pieces of furniture [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y19hzwTGIss&t=705.68s)]
*  or the artwork that closest matches my inspiration, fill the scene, and then either be able to walk [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y19hzwTGIss&t=712.16s)]
*  through it in a virtual world or use augmented reality and see how it fits into your space with [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y19hzwTGIss&t=718.64s)]
*  your dimensions. Kind of like a 3D wayfarer, if you will, where there's the end consumer [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y19hzwTGIss&t=724.32s)]
*  has a lifelike digital twin visualization of their space. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y19hzwTGIss&t=730.96s)]
*  All right. So looking to 2025, so far, we've talked mostly about technologies that have been [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y19hzwTGIss&t=735.0400000000001s)]
*  invented over the last few decades. But there's obviously this wave of new technologies that are [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y19hzwTGIss&t=739.6800000000001s)]
*  really exciting, haven't really found their footing necessarily in terms of applications. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y19hzwTGIss&t=743.44s)]
*  Is there anything you're paying attention to there and maybe how that intersects with gaming? [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y19hzwTGIss&t=748.08s)]
*  Yeah, there's some really interesting research and work being done in the HMI human machine [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y19hzwTGIss&t=752.48s)]
*  interaction space. You can imagine all kinds of different use cases. But as with most emerging [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y19hzwTGIss&t=758.72s)]
*  tech, there's probably going to be initial use cases in gaming that are the wedge for these [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y19hzwTGIss&t=764.32s)]
*  companies to use consumer spend to fund their R&D similar to Nvidia. So obviously, Apple Vision Pro [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y19hzwTGIss&t=771.12s)]
*  made huge progress this year with eye tracking, but we're going to see BCI type technology that [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y19hzwTGIss&t=777.68s)]
*  reads energy signals from your brain to actually control and interact with the computer in the [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y19hzwTGIss&t=783.5999999999999s)]
*  virtual environment. So we can think about VR use cases where I can use strictly my brainwaves [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y19hzwTGIss&t=789.28s)]
*  to interact with the scene, which is amazing. And then the inverse is true too. And we've seen [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y19hzwTGIss&t=797.3599999999999s)]
*  technologies that allow sort of sensory or digital touch based on solely wearing a ring [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y19hzwTGIss&t=803.28s)]
*  on your finger for increased immersion in the virtual world, which is sort of like the dream [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y19hzwTGIss&t=809.92s)]
*  of every gamer to be able to be fully immersed with that haptic feedback, not just in the game [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y19hzwTGIss&t=817.6s)]
*  controller, but actually throughout your body. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y19hzwTGIss&t=824.48s)]
