# How Does AI Impact Online Identity?
**The a16z Podcast:** [May 12, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnrKXZWz3M0)
*  So you have this AI model. This person doesn't exist. In fact, you did create one of these. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnrKXZWz3M0&t=0.0s)]
*  Her name is Alice. And people can find this model at thismodeldoesnotexist.co, I believe, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnrKXZWz3M0&t=8.88s)]
*  and we'll link that in the show notes. Let's just use that as an example. If you wanted [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnrKXZWz3M0&t=15.46s)]
*  to do a photo shoot with Alice, how much would that cost? And let's break that down between [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnrKXZWz3M0&t=19.1s)]
*  like actually training the initial dataset or the initial face, and then actually generating [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnrKXZWz3M0&t=24.4s)]
*  a bunch of images. Let's just give the audience a sense of what that takes. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnrKXZWz3M0&t=30.56s)]
*  So currently to deep train a model on someone's face to be able to generate photos after that, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnrKXZWz3M0&t=35.28s)]
*  it costs 60 cents to generate this. Okay. Yeah. So not even a dollar. And then I think [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnrKXZWz3M0&t=42.84s)]
*  per photo you're at a fraction of a cent right now. So you could generate hundreds [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnrKXZWz3M0&t=48.72s)]
*  of thousands of photos for less than a hundred bucks. So technology is pretty cheap already [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnrKXZWz3M0&t=53.88s)]
*  in that sense. So I believe this is from what I've seen talking to customers, people. The [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnrKXZWz3M0&t=59.28s)]
*  number one question in my live chat is from mom and pop shops with clothing brands who [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnrKXZWz3M0&t=66.76s)]
*  do not have the funds to hire models, to put on clothing for the web shops, who I think [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnrKXZWz3M0&t=72.52000000000001s)]
*  wouldn't even ever be able to hire a model to do the photo shoots for them. So I see [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnrKXZWz3M0&t=79.05999999999999s)]
*  this as a, it's like democratizing for the lower spectrum of the small business, enabling [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnrKXZWz3M0&t=84.1s)]
*  them to do the fashion shoots. And yeah, I think it's mostly for those kinds of consumers [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnrKXZWz3M0&t=90.86s)]
*  that this is interesting to do. Yeah. And there's other applications of that. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnrKXZWz3M0&t=96.82s)]
*  Like I did a presentation recently and I use mid journey for all of my images within that [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnrKXZWz3M0&t=100.1s)]
*  presentation. And I probably would not have had those images. I wouldn't have hired someone [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnrKXZWz3M0&t=105.22s)]
*  at the very least to go create them. And so there is, as you said, this democratizing [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnrKXZWz3M0&t=111.94s)]
*  force, this ability for folks that didn't have access to a specific technology to use [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnrKXZWz3M0&t=115.7s)]
*  it in these new ways. Sinead, let's hear the other side of that. Like maybe perhaps some [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnrKXZWz3M0&t=120.9s)]
*  of these folks who are models may not be hired for the same roles or maybe they will still [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnrKXZWz3M0&t=126.53999999999999s)]
*  be. And in the case where they are, what are the benefits of all this? Like, can you [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnrKXZWz3M0&t=132.74s)]
*  do a bunch of shoots where, you know, your avatar is quote unquote attending those shoots [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnrKXZWz3M0&t=137.70000000000002s)]
*  without you actually physically being there? Can you save a bunch of money, fuel and not [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnrKXZWz3M0&t=144.66s)]
*  traveling? Can you actually like upgrade yourself in some way? I'm just kind of throwing ideas [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnrKXZWz3M0&t=150.34s)]
*  out there, but how might this actually change the industry for the better? [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnrKXZWz3M0&t=155.02s)]
*  Is there a world in which a model can be in multiple places at one time and therefore [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnrKXZWz3M0&t=159.16s)]
*  increase their income stream and have more assets of themselves to be out in the market? [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnrKXZWz3M0&t=164.28s)]
*  Absolutely. That could be quite profitable, quite lucrative if the industry does evolve [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnrKXZWz3M0&t=170.07999999999998s)]
*  that way in a world where we want to see the same influencers and people we look to in [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnrKXZWz3M0&t=176.04s)]
*  fashion to continue to be the face of brands and the clothing. But if you look at the history [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnrKXZWz3M0&t=183.32s)]
*  of technology, technology is often quite deflationary over time, especially when it comes to wages. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnrKXZWz3M0&t=188.56s)]
*  So in a world where a model can be in multiple places at one time, yes, they may be able [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnrKXZWz3M0&t=195.44s)]
*  to have more revenue streams coming in, but do we see downward pressure on prices? Because [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnrKXZWz3M0&t=199.95999999999998s)]
*  a lot of it's created digitally and there's an increase in supply of identities that could [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnrKXZWz3M0&t=205.88s)]
*  pass for being human. And so that's where things get a little bit gray and a little [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnrKXZWz3M0&t=212.54s)]
*  bit ethically red flags and kind of caution takes. And I will say again, it's not that [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnrKXZWz3M0&t=217.62s)]
*  this is unique to modeling. We're going to see this across the board with AI. It's going [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnrKXZWz3M0&t=222.26s)]
*  to put downward pressure on a lot of different wages from modeling to programming, but that's [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnrKXZWz3M0&t=225.98000000000002s)]
*  where it becomes a little bit challenging. And then what is uniquely applicable to modeling [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnrKXZWz3M0&t=230.42000000000002s)]
*  and maybe acting is that not only are people getting automated, but their likeness and [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnrKXZWz3M0&t=236.34s)]
*  the communities they represent are also getting automated, but someone is still benefiting [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnrKXZWz3M0&t=243.34s)]
*  off of that very specific identity. So that's where it starts to become a little bit gray. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnrKXZWz3M0&t=248.96s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, it's going to be interesting to see how that all evolves if you, you know, [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnrKXZWz3M0&t=255.96s)]
*  like what regulation gets put in place, what IP people own or do not own that goes into [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnrKXZWz3M0&t=261.88s)]
*  these models on the topic that this really does expand past modeling. I think what's [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnrKXZWz3M0&t=267.6s)]
*  fascinating, Danny, is you've really went on this sprint over the last few months you've [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnrKXZWz3M0&t=272.3s)]
*  created. I mean, I'm just going to name some of the projects you did. Tattoos AI, which [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnrKXZWz3M0&t=276.1s)]
*  is, you know, an AI powered tattoo artist. We mentioned Alice, this model that does not [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnrKXZWz3M0&t=280.7s)]
*  exist that you created. You started, I think, or one of your early projects was profile [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnrKXZWz3M0&t=284.86s)]
*  picture AI, which is similar to lens, which most people would recognize. We talked about [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnrKXZWz3M0&t=288.94s)]
*  deep agency, meme morph, people can morph themselves into their favorite meme. And then [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnrKXZWz3M0&t=292.88s)]
*  most recently you're working on headshot pro, which is basically people can create their [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnrKXZWz3M0&t=298.36s)]
*  next corporate headshot or a company can create a kind of wave of headshots for their entire [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnrKXZWz3M0&t=302.96000000000004s)]
*  staff. And so among those projects, first, just kind of tell me what you're seeing as [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnrKXZWz3M0&t=309.56s)]
*  you've launched these projects, what people are getting excited about, what you're getting [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnrKXZWz3M0&t=315.40000000000003s)]
*  a lot of traction with right away without maybe perhaps even trying and where actually, [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnrKXZWz3M0&t=320.84000000000003s)]
*  this technology may be interesting, but it feels more like a trek uphill, if that makes [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnrKXZWz3M0&t=326.66s)]
*  sense. Yeah. So first of all, the whole reason this scales really fast for me, this gets a [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnrKXZWz3M0&t=332.70000000000005s)]
*  lot of tension because it's indistinguishable from magic at the moment. You upload a few [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnrKXZWz3M0&t=338.78000000000003s)]
*  photos and suddenly you get hundreds and hundreds of profile pictures out for it. So this is [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnrKXZWz3M0&t=342.42s)]
*  why people keep sharing it on Instagram, on TikTok, it goes viral really fast. The second, [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnrKXZWz3M0&t=346.58000000000004s)]
*  like, I think what mostly gets solved at the moment is I get a lot of messages from folks [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnrKXZWz3M0&t=351.46000000000004s)]
*  who say, I don't have any profile pictures, I don't have any photos. And suddenly I can [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnrKXZWz3M0&t=356.22s)]
*  look really well online. And this is one of the major selling points for headshot, for [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnrKXZWz3M0&t=360.44000000000005s)]
*  example. Well, like me, for example, I hate going to photo shoots because I always look [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnrKXZWz3M0&t=365.08000000000004s)]
*  super awkward. I don't smile. So for them, this solves an actual issue that they can look [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnrKXZWz3M0&t=369.28000000000003s)]
*  good on their LinkedIn. Same with profile picture, you can turn yourself into whatever [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnrKXZWz3M0&t=375.20000000000005s)]
*  you want. Lancer showed how popular that could be. I believe Lancer did $40 million with [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnrKXZWz3M0&t=378.88000000000005s)]
*  that. I like this as an art. I like to dabble with it. I like to try things out. I get an [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnrKXZWz3M0&t=384.14s)]
*  idea. I have to work it out. Gets easier and easier because it uses the same technology. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnrKXZWz3M0&t=388.41999999999996s)]
*  And headshot has been the biggest success, traffic wise, financial wise at the moment, [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnrKXZWz3M0&t=392.9s)]
*  for remote teams, which it branded at the moment. Like good luck trying to get a photographer. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnrKXZWz3M0&t=398.41999999999996s)]
*  If your team is remotely and you have people in Asia, America, Europe, and you want to [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnrKXZWz3M0&t=402.86s)]
*  get the same photo style, like you cannot send a photographer all around the world to [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnrKXZWz3M0&t=406.86s)]
*  get the same cell, but everyone can upload a photo, train an AI model on them, use the [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnrKXZWz3M0&t=411.32s)]
*  same styles to generate it. And basically everyone gets the same headshot for their [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnrKXZWz3M0&t=417.12s)]
*  team. If you're creative enough in it, you try enough. There are use cases that people [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnrKXZWz3M0&t=420.2s)]
*  think it's going to take away the photographer, but I think it's going to enable different [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnrKXZWz3M0&t=425.40000000000003s)]
*  kinds of things that weren't possible before with this technology. Like having a photographer [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnrKXZWz3M0&t=430.0s)]
*  everywhere in the world, trying out different hairstyles, for example, things that weren't [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnrKXZWz3M0&t=435.0s)]
*  enabled before that are enabled now by this technology. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnrKXZWz3M0&t=440.14s)]
*  Yeah, it's kind of crazy. If you go to Headshot Pro, I think you have this live counter. And [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnrKXZWz3M0&t=443.3s)]
*  last time I checked it said 450,000 plus headshots were created. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnrKXZWz3M0&t=449.54s)]
*  I think it's a million now because I have to manually update it and it's two weeks live [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnrKXZWz3M0&t=454.94s)]
*  now. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnrKXZWz3M0&t=458.94s)]
*  I was going to say, I just checked it last night. You kind of alluded to this, but there's [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnrKXZWz3M0&t=459.94s)]
*  ways that people are using this product. Like you're creating these projects and you're [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnrKXZWz3M0&t=463.7s)]
*  releasing them into the world and you're kind of tinkering and thinking, oh, maybe people [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnrKXZWz3M0&t=468.28s)]
*  will use it in this way. But I've seen you tweet about the fact that you've actually [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnrKXZWz3M0&t=472.56s)]
*  been surprised that as you released this tool, people are using the tool in ways that you [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnrKXZWz3M0&t=475.84s)]
*  didn't even expect as the creator. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnrKXZWz3M0&t=481.2s)]
*  Well, that's like with ProvoPicture, I learned from the headshots and de-map shots because [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnrKXZWz3M0&t=482.84s)]
*  we used to do only these artsy styles and people kept requesting, hey, can I get a LinkedIn [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnrKXZWz3M0&t=487.03999999999996s)]
*  photo for myself? So we kept tinkering with that way. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnrKXZWz3M0&t=492.44s)]
*  Yeah, and just on the note of what people are being drawn to, I think maybe one way [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnrKXZWz3M0&t=495.06s)]
*  to have a pulse on that is what people are willing to pay for. And so among your projects, [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnrKXZWz3M0&t=500.34000000000003s)]
*  have you noticed any trends there in terms of things that people almost seem allergic [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnrKXZWz3M0&t=506.26000000000005s)]
*  to like, oh, this is cool. This is novel, but like, I'm not going to pay you $30 for [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnrKXZWz3M0&t=509.70000000000005s)]
*  that versus maybe the headshot example is something that people have ingrained in their [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnrKXZWz3M0&t=514.46s)]
*  mind. Like, oh, a headshot is worth X dollars. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnrKXZWz3M0&t=519.58s)]
*  So with ProvoPicture, we started pretty expensive at the time and I've been lowering the price, [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnrKXZWz3M0&t=523.38s)]
*  lower, lower, lower. And I think we're almost around cost price at the moment, $5 to generate [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnrKXZWz3M0&t=527.24s)]
*  them. So yeah, Lensa basically killed the whole market after they went live. So yeah, [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnrKXZWz3M0&t=531.84s)]
*  I think mostly now it's the high quality output. And I really wonder where we're going to go [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnrKXZWz3M0&t=538.88s)]
*  in the next few months because these models keep releasing, keep releasing. Like I barely [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnrKXZWz3M0&t=543.36s)]
*  sleep at night because every time I wake up the next morning, there's something new that's [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnrKXZWz3M0&t=549.84s)]
*  launched that already makes the whole technology obsolete. It's going so fast. So I don't know [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnrKXZWz3M0&t=553.12s)]
*  where it's going to end up. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnrKXZWz3M0&t=559.76s)]
