# The Top 100 GenAI Consumer Apps
**The a16z Podcast:** [June 04, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79rc9thqv6w)
*  As AI matures, these mafias of talent or hubs of talent are spinning out of different research labs, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79rc9thqv6w&t=0.0s)]
*  different universities, and kind of building these different communities of founders around the globe, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79rc9thqv6w&t=7.2s)]
*  which is very cool. You and the consumer team posted this generative AI 100 list. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79rc9thqv6w&t=12.4s)]
*  It was a really fun one to work on, actually, and something that we'll be putting out probably at [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79rc9thqv6w&t=21.92s)]
*  least every six months, given how fast the space is changing. Maybe three months. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79rc9thqv6w&t=26.16s)]
*  I know. We might need to accelerate it even further. Essentially, the question we were [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79rc9thqv6w&t=29.84s)]
*  trying to answer was like, yes, there are these AI names that everyone knows and a lot of people [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79rc9thqv6w&t=33.68s)]
*  use, like ChatGPT and MidJourney, but beyond that, what are the other products that normal people [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79rc9thqv6w&t=38.4s)]
*  might be using every day for art, for creativity, for work, for education? We were really interested [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79rc9thqv6w&t=44.16s)]
*  to see if there was going to be any surprising names in there or what trends would pop out. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79rc9thqv6w&t=51.36s)]
*  So we kind of, I don't want to say boiled the ocean on this, but we literally screened every [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79rc9thqv6w&t=55.2s)]
*  single global website, which means how many are being pulled into the spreadsheet? [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79rc9thqv6w&t=60.32s)]
*  Tens of thousands, if not more. So we have a data provider called SimilarWeb where you can sort [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79rc9thqv6w&t=64.32s)]
*  every website in existence by number of monthly visits. And so then we kind of manually filtered [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79rc9thqv6w&t=69.04s)]
*  that into what are the first 50 of these that are AI companies. And then we did the same on mobile [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79rc9thqv6w&t=74.56s)]
*  with Sensor Tower, which gives us App Store data globally, who has the most monthly active users on [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79rc9thqv6w&t=80.48s)]
*  an app. Found the top 50 and then we had our distinct web and mobile lists. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79rc9thqv6w&t=86.16s)]
*  Amazing. And so you actually pulled a similar list, maybe just for web in September. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79rc9thqv6w&t=90.4s)]
*  So between these two lists, what did you notice? And were there any newcomers that [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79rc9thqv6w&t=95.76s)]
*  really caught your eye? Absolutely. Yeah, we actually [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79rc9thqv6w&t=100.08000000000001s)]
*  decided to pull a separate mobile list because there was not a lot of overlap, which the products [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79rc9thqv6w&t=102.64s)]
*  that are succeeding on web for AI, I think are distinctly different. I think there was only five [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79rc9thqv6w&t=108.88s)]
*  or six companies that made both lists. Really? [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79rc9thqv6w&t=113.36s)]
*  If that. Yeah. Okay. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79rc9thqv6w&t=115.83999999999999s)]
*  So some pretty big differences there. I would say, so all the mobile companies were brand new [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79rc9thqv6w&t=117.03999999999999s)]
*  to the list. A couple categories really popped on mobile that we didn't see as much on web, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79rc9thqv6w&t=121.28s)]
*  but it makes sense because they kind of take advantage of mobile as a platform in a unique [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79rc9thqv6w&t=126.56s)]
*  way. So EdTech is a great example. There are companies like Elsa that are kind of a language [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79rc9thqv6w&t=131.51999999999998s)]
*  learning. They take advantage of the fact that you can talk into your phone much more easily than [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79rc9thqv6w&t=137.36s)]
*  you can talk into a computer and get real-time feedback on pronunciation, things like that. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79rc9thqv6w&t=142.48000000000002s)]
*  Lots of homework helper apps where you just take a picture and get an answer as well. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79rc9thqv6w&t=148.24s)]
*  Which is also fascinating because you're talking about the device, right? [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79rc9thqv6w&t=154.72000000000003s)]
*  Exactly. So mobile, I think what works really well on mobile is kind of audio capture and then image [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79rc9thqv6w&t=157.20000000000002s)]
*  capture and availability. So exactly to that point about image capture, you probably have tried [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79rc9thqv6w&t=163.12s)]
*  Lenza or Epic or Remini was another one that popped up. All of these avatar companies that [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79rc9thqv6w&t=168.96s)]
*  take advantage of the fact that we have dozens of selfies stored. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79rc9thqv6w&t=174.64000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, on our camera roll. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79rc9thqv6w&t=178.48000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, and are willing to pay literally like $20 for some cool looking avatars. Those are the types [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79rc9thqv6w&t=179.6s)]
*  of products that have worked on mobile. Keyboards as well. There's some fun niche products where [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79rc9thqv6w&t=184.88s)]
*  it's like upload a screenshot of your dating app conversations and then we'll plug into your [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79rc9thqv6w&t=191.36s)]
*  keyboard and tell you what to say next to have more charisma or something like that. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79rc9thqv6w&t=196.4s)]
*  Fascinating. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79rc9thqv6w&t=200.0s)]
*  Yes. They go very viral on TikTok as you can probably imagine. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79rc9thqv6w&t=201.20000000000002s)]
*  The one other interesting thing about mobile was chat GBT was so slow to launch an app. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79rc9thqv6w&t=207.12s)]
*  They lost a little bit of ground just from an app store keyword and optimization perspective. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79rc9thqv6w&t=213.44000000000003s)]
*  There are quite a few apps on our mobile app list that are essentially copycat products and using [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79rc9thqv6w&t=219.44s)]
*  OpenAI's own model, but are named slightly differently and are just kind of playing this [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79rc9thqv6w&t=226.16s)]
*  maybe short to medium term arbitrage on app store optimization. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79rc9thqv6w&t=232.24s)]
*  They're just a layer in between. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79rc9thqv6w&t=236.48s)]
*  Yes, and a very, very thin layer and often using maybe a weaker version of the model, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79rc9thqv6w&t=238.56s)]
*  but still charging people for it. There's been a lot of controversy around this topic and I think [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79rc9thqv6w&t=243.44s)]
*  the app store has been kind of clamping down on it a little bit. That might be a change that we see [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79rc9thqv6w&t=248.08s)]
*  for the next version of the mobile list. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79rc9thqv6w&t=255.28s)]
*  Well, that's actually fascinating because the models do differ in performance, but for the [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79rc9thqv6w&t=257.2s)]
*  average consumer, can you actually tell if it's 3.5 or 4? [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79rc9thqv6w&t=263.6s)]
*  The average person won't know, for example, that if you pay $20 to chat GBT, [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79rc9thqv6w&t=268.08000000000004s)]
*  you're getting GBT-4, you can access the internet, you can get vision, upload pictures. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79rc9thqv6w&t=273.12s)]
*  If you're a normal person who doesn't know the names of these models, you might not understand [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79rc9thqv6w&t=278.48s)]
*  that on this other app, you're paying for access to the free version of the OpenAI model [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79rc9thqv6w&t=282.88s)]
*  that you would get on chat GBT. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79rc9thqv6w&t=288.8s)]
*  So interesting. So we talked about the mobile web split. Let's jump back to some of those newcomers. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79rc9thqv6w&t=290.40000000000003s)]
*  Were there any other companies that you were perhaps surprised to see or maybe you hadn't [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79rc9thqv6w&t=294.72s)]
*  even seen the work that you do that showed up and you're like, wow, this is really big? [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79rc9thqv6w&t=299.52000000000004s)]
*  Totally. Yeah, I think we saw a couple of companies kind of make the biggest jumps up the list. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79rc9thqv6w&t=303.6s)]
*  Eleven Labs was one. They were on the first version. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79rc9thqv6w&t=309.04s)]
*  Gamma was another one, which is an AI presentation document slide deck builder [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79rc9thqv6w&t=311.84000000000003s)]
*  that I think is another example of one that kind of went consumer viral and now getting [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79rc9thqv6w&t=317.6s)]
*  pulled into workspaces. So productivity as a whole was kind of a big new category on web as [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79rc9thqv6w&t=322.40000000000003s)]
*  those products mature. The other big new trend on web in particular was companion apps. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79rc9thqv6w&t=327.44s)]
*  I think on the first list, there were two companion products and I think there were eight [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79rc9thqv6w&t=333.6s)]
*  on the most recent one. Most of them were actually uncensored models. So not to say they were all [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79rc9thqv6w&t=338.64000000000004s)]
*  NSFW because that isn't necessarily the use case, but they allow you more freedom to talk about [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79rc9thqv6w&t=345.84000000000003s)]
*  different topics, do different things than you can do if you were just trying to use chat GBT [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79rc9thqv6w&t=351.92s)]
*  as a companion because OpenAI is somewhat restrictive in how you can kind of interact [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79rc9thqv6w&t=357.44s)]
*  with the product there. Right. And if Character AI is one that a lot of people are familiar with, [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79rc9thqv6w&t=362.72s)]
*  they build their own model. These other ones where you're talking about this lack of construction, [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79rc9thqv6w&t=367.52000000000004s)]
*  are they using Llama or how are they getting to... Yeah, it's a good question. It depends. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79rc9thqv6w&t=373.12s)]
*  A lot of them have maybe tuned their own models, but many of them maybe have not trained a full [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79rc9thqv6w&t=378.56s)]
*  foundation model in the way that Character AI has. I would say a lot of them are also exploring maybe [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79rc9thqv6w&t=384.88000000000005s)]
*  new modalities. There's a company called Taki that's almost appealing to the gamer-trader [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79rc9thqv6w&t=390.64s)]
*  mindset when it comes to companions, where you actually unlock trading cards as you talk with [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79rc9thqv6w&t=397.2s)]
*  companions for different amounts of time and then you can kind of sell them in this in-app [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79rc9thqv6w&t=402.56s)]
*  marketplace almost. Really? Yeah. So it gets back to this question of how do companions go mainstream? [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79rc9thqv6w&t=406.96s)]
*  And I think the answer is there's different versions of what a companion looks like that probably [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79rc9thqv6w&t=413.59999999999997s)]
*  attract and hook in different types of users. And it's not always like a completely free-form [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79rc9thqv6w&t=418.96000000000004s)]
*  conversation. Maybe it looks like a game, maybe it looks like a coach, maybe it looks like something [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79rc9thqv6w&t=424.32s)]
*  else. And are you seeing those companion apps show up for the things that you just mentioned [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79rc9thqv6w&t=428.88s)]
*  for the coach, the therapist, et cetera? I would say most of the use cases so far are pure consumer [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79rc9thqv6w&t=433.52000000000004s)]
*  and uncensored. We are expecting to see some of the other categories, but honestly, they're less [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79rc9thqv6w&t=439.12s)]
*  viral in these early days. Makes sense. And so they're not popping up the list as quickly, [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79rc9thqv6w&t=445.36s)]
*  but we talked to lots of these companies. They're growing, but maybe not the zero to 20 million [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79rc9thqv6w&t=449.76s)]
*  monthly web visits that some of these uncensored companion apps can get. And maybe we can just [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79rc9thqv6w&t=455.2s)]
*  quickly speak to that. I mean, I think I've seen some data that you've all shared on just how many [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79rc9thqv6w&t=460.0s)]
*  visits or interactions some people are having. Maybe we just talk about that because it's kind [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79rc9thqv6w&t=465.6s)]
*  of shocking in a way, but also not surprising in a way. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79rc9thqv6w&t=469.84s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. So for the mobile products, as well as the web products, but especially [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79rc9thqv6w&t=472.4s)]
*  interesting on mobile because you can really granularly track a user and say how much time [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79rc9thqv6w&t=477.28s)]
*  are they spending per day, per month, how often are they coming back? And the insight there that [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79rc9thqv6w&t=482.96s)]
*  I was shocked by, and I say this as a big fan of the company, but Character AI has the average user [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79rc9thqv6w&t=487.35999999999996s)]
*  up close to 300 sessions per month, which again is like 10 sessions per day. This is like [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79rc9thqv6w&t=494.88s)]
*  iMessage usage, Snapchat usage, Instagram usage. So I think we're starting to see like, yes, [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79rc9thqv6w&t=501.6s)]
*  maybe the product isn't for everyone right now. Maybe it hasn't reached the true, true mainstream, [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79rc9thqv6w&t=508.16s)]
*  but it's getting there and the people who are using it are really using it and clearly finding [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79rc9thqv6w&t=515.12s)]
*  deep, deep value from it. Yeah. And just to clarify for listeners, [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79rc9thqv6w&t=520.4s)]
*  when you're seeing a session, is that one message or that's actually one conversation? [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79rc9thqv6w&t=523.84s)]
*  That's a session on the app. Yeah. There's some filtering they do around it where if you just [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79rc9thqv6w&t=527.0400000000001s)]
*  accidentally open or close the app, they won't count it. So this is like an average session [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79rc9thqv6w&t=532.24s)]
*  for a company like Character is probably going to be upwards of five minutes long. It's like a real [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79rc9thqv6w&t=536.08s)]
*  kind of deeper conversation. Wow. You know, another trend you call out in the report is this idea that [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79rc9thqv6w&t=540.5600000000001s)]
*  AI is a global pursuit. We're currently actually recording this in San Francisco where a lot of [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79rc9thqv6w&t=546.96s)]
*  tech has been built, but we're seeing, you know, like Mistral from France and like, what else are [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79rc9thqv6w&t=552.16s)]
*  you seeing in those global dynamics? Yeah. It's been really exciting actually. And this was a big [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79rc9thqv6w&t=556.0799999999999s)]
*  change even from V1 of this list to the most recent version, a lot more global pursuits. And I think [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79rc9thqv6w&t=560.16s)]
*  that's a function of, to your point, many of these models are opening up a little bit, whether they're [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79rc9thqv6w&t=566.48s)]
*  available via API or whether they're open source. And it allows anyone anywhere to build a really [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79rc9thqv6w&t=571.6s)]
*  cool AI product. You don't have to be in San Francisco having raised, you know, $50 million, [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79rc9thqv6w&t=578.72s)]
*  although we love those companies as well. We have funded many of those companies also, [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79rc9thqv6w&t=584.0s)]
*  but you could be a solo developer in China, in Russia, anywhere. Mistral is a great example. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79rc9thqv6w&t=589.2s)]
*  Photoroom is another one on the list that made both the web and the mobile ranks there in France. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79rc9thqv6w&t=595.52s)]
*  As AI matures, these mafias of talent or hubs of talent are spinning out of different research labs, [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79rc9thqv6w&t=601.0400000000001s)]
*  different universities, and kind of building these different communities of founders around [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79rc9thqv6w&t=608.24s)]
*  the globe, which is very cool. I think it's the coolest thing to see all these different founders [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79rc9thqv6w&t=612.96s)]
*  everywhere. Is there anything else you wanted to call out on the list in terms of new categories [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79rc9thqv6w&t=616.96s)]
*  that you're seeing pop up? Yeah. I would say a big leading indicator for the list. Like if you wanted [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79rc9thqv6w&t=621.28s)]
*  to predict what's going to be on the list in six months, looking at the Discord data, you can even [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79rc9thqv6w&t=626.72s)]
*  track like which Discord pages are getting the most invite traffic or things like that as a proxy [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79rc9thqv6w&t=631.92s)]
*  for interest. And many of those companies that get really big on Discord, like Mid Journey, [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79rc9thqv6w&t=637.04s)]
*  like Pica, like Suno, will then go and launch an independent web app that does really well. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79rc9thqv6w&t=642.0799999999999s)]
*  And we've seen that be fairly predictive now of Suno was one of the highest ranking new companies [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79rc9thqv6w&t=647.4399999999999s)]
*  that we saw on the list this time, and they just sprouted out of a successful Discord. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79rc9thqv6w&t=652.7199999999999s)]
*  It's such an advantage because then you can build up a base of hundreds of thousands or millions of [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79rc9thqv6w&t=656.88s)]
*  users. And so you're not quite cold starting the website as you would be if you kind of didn't have [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79rc9thqv6w&t=661.28s)]
*  that base of users before. Totally. And how would you go about doing that? So the same website [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79rc9thqv6w&t=667.68s)]
*  provider that we use, similar web, you can, this is crazy, but you can get so granular as to see [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79rc9thqv6w&t=673.4399999999999s)]
*  the most popular websites on each domain. And so you can filter by like discord.com slash invite. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79rc9thqv6w&t=679.12s)]
*  And then kind of click on each, I've seen a lot of interesting stuff. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79rc9thqv6w&t=687.6800000000001s)]
*  It's often some like weird string of letters and numbers. Same thing with Reddit. And then you click [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79rc9thqv6w&t=695.12s)]
*  on it and you see like, okay, is this an AI product? We put some of the data on this in the list, [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79rc9thqv6w&t=701.0400000000001s)]
*  but actually now many of the biggest Discords by growth are AI products, like Mid Journey and Pica [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79rc9thqv6w&t=705.6800000000001s)]
*  and Suno. Mid Journey itself is driving close to a percent of all kind of Discord invite traffic, [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79rc9thqv6w&t=712.88s)]
*  which is very cool. And that's a product that's been around for probably 18 plus months now and [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79rc9thqv6w&t=718.88s)]
*  still millions of people are using it on Discord every month. I mean, I'm one of those. Yeah, [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79rc9thqv6w&t=724.64s)]
*  I love it. Me too. Amazing. Yeah. Is there anything else you call out about what you would like to see [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79rc9thqv6w&t=730.24s)]
*  in the next six months? Let's say it sounds like you're going to keep repulling this list. And at [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79rc9thqv6w&t=736.16s)]
*  the pace that we've been moving, it feels like maybe this list will be completely rerun and it'll [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79rc9thqv6w&t=740.72s)]
*  be all new companies. But then on the other hand, there are companies like Mid Journey that for the [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79rc9thqv6w&t=746.72s)]
*  last 18 months have held strong. Yeah. I'm very interested to see, especially now that kind of [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79rc9thqv6w&t=750.48s)]
*  mobile is happening more, what founders can do with audio as an input mechanism. We talk a lot [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79rc9thqv6w&t=755.6s)]
*  about AI generated content and like images, video, songs, all of that is amazing. But if you think [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79rc9thqv6w&t=762.24s)]
*  about how much content or media you're creating daily, it's probably speaking. And there's a lot [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79rc9thqv6w&t=769.92s)]
*  of value in what you're saying in a conversation that is not getting captured right now because [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79rc9thqv6w&t=775.76s)]
*  there's nothing listening to you, transcribing it, formatting it, all of that. If you look at kind of [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79rc9thqv6w&t=781.92s)]
*  productivity hyper enthusiasts, a lot of them are using these like old school voice dictation devices. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79rc9thqv6w&t=788.0799999999999s)]
*  And I think that's finally coming to software now due to AI. It's not just a direct transcript [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79rc9thqv6w&t=794.48s)]
*  of every like um and ah that you said, but it can take a ramble and turn it into a beautiful email. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79rc9thqv6w&t=801.04s)]
*  Totally. Did you see that video? It went viral at one point of some girl just talking to her [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79rc9thqv6w&t=806.96s)]
*  into chat GBT, talking about currency exchanges. Did you see this? And it was the most convoluted. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79rc9thqv6w&t=811.36s)]
*  And then people were just shocked. They're like, how did chat GBT understand? [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79rc9thqv6w&t=817.36s)]
*  It's absolutely amazing. And I think yeah, chat GBT voice is like an incredible product. And [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79rc9thqv6w&t=821.12s)]
*  there will be more products like that and more kind of tailored and vertical products. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79rc9thqv6w&t=827.36s)]
*  Another example is a lot of older people are using chat GBT voice as kind of a companion [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79rc9thqv6w&t=831.76s)]
*  throughout their day to tell stories to to ask questions about things like that. It's a really [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79rc9thqv6w&t=837.36s)]
*  interesting use case. Or language translation. There's a lot of people in other countries that [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79rc9thqv6w&t=842.08s)]
*  are using chat GBT as their quote unquote like American friend that they talk about trends, [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79rc9thqv6w&t=847.6s)]
*  they practice English, things like that. I love all of it. And I think there will be purpose built [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79rc9thqv6w&t=852.96s)]
*  products and companies for some of that that can do it even better. And so on the next mobile list, [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79rc9thqv6w&t=858.88s)]
*  I'm hoping to see some more things around audio emerge. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79rc9thqv6w&t=864.0s)]
*  Well, as a podcaster, I am too. If you actually look at the history of the web, you can see like [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79rc9thqv6w&t=867.84s)]
*  blogs start to form in the early 2000s. And then it took basically a decade for podcast apps and [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79rc9thqv6w&t=873.52s)]
*  things of the sort. So I feel like we've always been just a little further behind in infrastructure [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79rc9thqv6w&t=878.48s)]
*  and ecosystem. So I'm also really excited. Yeah. As a reminder, content here is for informational [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79rc9thqv6w&t=883.84s)]
