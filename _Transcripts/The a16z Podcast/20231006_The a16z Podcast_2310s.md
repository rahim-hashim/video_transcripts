# The Evolution of the Satellite Economy
**The a16z Podcast:** [October 06, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE)
*  It is on us in the space industry to solve this problem. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=0.0s)]
*  Getting people connected is just of such enormous value. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=4.0s)]
*  Why is in-flight Wi-Fi so bad today? [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=7.5s)]
*  It's a very good question. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=9.700000000000001s)]
*  The problem actually got worse. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=10.700000000000001s)]
*  How is that possible? [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=12.0s)]
*  When you get access to the internet, you are getting access to the sum total of the world's knowledge. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=13.8s)]
*  Yes, a lot of problems to solve. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=19.2s)]
*  It's like adding an extra lane on the highway, right? [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=20.6s)]
*  Oh, yes. That's a great analogy. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=22.7s)]
*  Yes, I think I'm going to steal that. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=25.0s)]
*  The biggest thing to be concerned about is orbital debris. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=26.400000000000002s)]
*  Building in space is just inherently hard. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=28.9s)]
*  It is a new golden age of space, for sure. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=31.299999999999997s)]
*  2022 was a record year for the space sector with 186 successful rocket launches. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=34.5s)]
*  That is 41 more than in 2021. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=42.7s)]
*  So what are all these rockets bringing to orbit? [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=45.5s)]
*  And who, whether public or private, is on the other side of that market? [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=48.3s)]
*  Listen in as we talk to John Gedmark today, co-founder of Astronis, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=53.2s)]
*  as we discuss this new golden era of space. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=57.6s)]
*  John himself has been in the industry for decades, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=60.9s)]
*  co-founding the Commercial Spaceflight Federation in 2006. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=63.9s)]
*  And as of May, Astronis sent its first commercial satellite into orbit. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=67.8s)]
*  And as John now builds his own satellites, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=73.3s)]
*  he reflects on the transition from the government shuttle era, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=76.0s)]
*  where satellites were literally the size of school buses and lasted for decades, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=79.3s)]
*  to something much different. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=83.6s)]
*  Plus, Astronis has a full Falcon 9 booked for later this year, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=85.69999999999999s)]
*  as they hope to bring more connectivity to the mind-boggling 4 billion people [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=89.89999999999999s)]
*  that still do not have internet access. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=94.8s)]
*  That is 4 billion people who cannot watch this video. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=97.6s)]
*  Alright, prepare for liftoff. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=100.6s)]

*  John, welcome to the show. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=132.9s)]
*  Ah, thank you for having me. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=134.9s)]
*  So you've been in space for a while. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=136.2s)]
*  I think what was it in 2006, you helped found the Commercial Spaceflight Federation. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=137.8s)]
*  Why did we start there? [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=143.5s)]
*  What caused you to want to be a part of that way back then? [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=144.5s)]
*  Like, what did you see at the time? [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=147.0s)]
*  Oh, sure. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=149.3s)]
*  I mean, that was back when this new industry was just getting off the ground, right? [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=150.5s)]
*  People were figuring out that they could, with private dollars, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=155.3s)]
*  go and start a new space company and actually do something useful. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=158.5s)]
*  It's sort of a, you know, a non-giant government blank check, you know, amount of money. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=162.0s)]
*  So I wanted to find, you know, basically the place where the action was happening. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=168.7s)]
*  And I was very lucky. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=174.2s)]
*  I actually found it. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=175.7s)]
*  You know, I went and looked around and I started as an intern at the X-Prize Foundation. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=176.89999999999998s)]
*  You know, X-Prize at the time, it's this nonprofit organization [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=183.2s)]
*  that develops these prizes for technological breakthroughs. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=187.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=191.39999999999998s)]
*  And at the time, you know, the big prize was this $10 million prize [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=192.0s)]
*  for a private company to launch people into space. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=197.4s)]
*  Yep. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=200.1s)]
*  And the company ended up winning that. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=200.5s)]
*  That group and that technology ended up becoming what is now Virgin Galactic still today, right? [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=203.70000000000002s)]
*  So like that really kicked off this, you know, this new wave of activity in the space industry. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=208.9s)]
*  But, you know, one of the projects that I worked on was this new industry group, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=214.4s)]
*  the Commercial Space Flight Federation, and that tried to decide as an industry, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=220.4s)]
*  what are the important policies? [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=224.6s)]
*  What are the things we want? [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=226.7s)]
*  You know, whether it's industry standards that cut across, you know, all these companies [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=228.5s)]
*  or it's public policy. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=232.9s)]
*  And all the organizations at the time were basically run by the major aerospace and defense companies. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=234.6s)]
*  So it was really, really the basic idea was just like, let's have our own organization, [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=242.29999999999998s)]
*  you know, no big defense contractors allowed and figure out what policies make the most sense [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=249.0s)]
*  for this new, you know, really emerging set of companies. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=255.0s)]
*  This new world, right? [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=258.6s)]
*  I mean, maybe you can speak to that transition because really for a few decades, [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=259.5s)]
*  it really was the government that was the primary home. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=264.2s)]
*  And you also mentioned this with these large contractors, [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=267.7s)]
*  but those were the entities driving space forward, right? [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=270.8s)]
*  And this is now in 2023. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=275.0s)]
*  Things look pretty different. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=276.7s)]
*  We've gone from the shuttle model to something with a lot more startups, [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=277.8s)]
*  a lot more grittiness, innovation, probably more failures along the way. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=281.7s)]
*  But also it's just a totally different environment that went from the government now also to something, [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=286.40000000000003s)]
*  you know, these private companies. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=291.7s)]
*  Yeah, it really is. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=293.40000000000003s)]
*  I mean, I like to think of it as there were basically three eras of spaceflight, right? [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=296.5s)]
*  There was the initial Apollo era where we were in. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=304.5s)]
*  It was this massive, almost monolithic government program. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=308.4s)]
*  And everything was huge and epic in scale by design because we were trying to compete against the Soviet Union. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=313.09999999999997s)]
*  Then we entered into this era in the 80s, basically with the space shuttle. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=321.59999999999997s)]
*  Things got very entrenched with these cosplays contracts. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=326.0s)]
*  And the major aerospace defense contractors were basically able to lock in these programs at a cost of billions of dollars. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=329.3s)]
*  And they were just not going anywhere. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=339.90000000000003s)]
*  It was like the space shuttle flew for almost three decades. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=341.90000000000003s)]
*  And the crazy thing about the space shuttle is that it was basically a government ride to space that was totally owned and operated by the government. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=347.90000000000003s)]
*  But private companies sometimes had no choice but to fly their satellites up on a space shuttle to get into space. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=356.9s)]
*  And so it'd be like if there were some government owned and operated fleet of cargo container ships that would take your cargo that you wanted to point to. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=364.5s)]
*  Yes, there were certainly companies that tried over the course of those decades to come up with new private vehicles, [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=377.90000000000003s)]
*  including in the 90s there was actually a huge number of startups that tried to do new rockets, basically. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=387.40000000000003s)]
*  But they were in effect competing with this government monopoly. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=394.8s)]
*  It's just like a weird, you know, that's just a very weird place to be. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=398.6s)]
*  So I'm not sure that the conditions were really right until we got the end of that era, [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=401.8s)]
*  which I would demark it as like the retirement of the space shuttle. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=409.40000000000003s)]
*  And that retirement, it took many years for the retirement to actually happen. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=413.90000000000003s)]
*  It started with the Columbia disaster. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=418.90000000000003s)]
*  And that was finally when people said, OK, you know, we've been flying this thing for almost 25 years. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=421.40000000000003s)]
*  It's time to retire it. And then it took several more years after that. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=427.40000000000003s)]
*  So you really had all these ingredients of basically private individuals who have made enough money in the dot com boom [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=430.3s)]
*  and have this passion for space to go and take a run at it. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=437.7s)]
*  On the government side, you had the retirement of the space shuttle coming up on the horizon as this basically this huge opportunity [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=440.90000000000003s)]
*  that those companies could then step into. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=447.2s)]
*  Yeah. So you're kind of calling out a few things. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=449.3s)]
*  Sounds like the retirement of the government programs, but also a wave of dollars coming in from another industry. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=451.2s)]
*  Were there any other changes that have really brought us to what feels like a golden age of space innovation? [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=458.3s)]
*  Is it like regulatory changes? Is it technological innovation that's unlocked? [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=465.1s)]
*  Anything else? Like anything you call out there is like, wow, maybe people don't realize that all of these kind of different inflection points, [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=471.1s)]
*  different waves coming together have resulted in what was it last year the most the most satellites being launched on record? [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=477.90000000000003s)]
*  And just a lot of things are happening. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=485.3s)]
*  Yes. So the other one was just the technologies that were available, that were starting to become available. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=488.0s)]
*  Right. So for small satellites to be possible, you really needed this combination of technologies to all come together. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=494.0s)]
*  One of them was actually just lithium ion batteries. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=501.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=505.0s)]
*  And so the old satellites used to have lead acid batteries. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=505.7s)]
*  There were absolutely these massive heavy things. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=509.6s)]
*  Right. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=512.9s)]
*  We all know about the benefits of that here on Earth because we have one of those in every now every device that we carry. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=514.0s)]
*  But it actually also made a huge deal in us being able to shrink the size of satellites. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=521.1s)]
*  And then there's also new chips that became available at a lower cost. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=527.5s)]
*  It was just Moore's Law in action. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=532.8s)]
*  There were some things that just got to the point where there was enough compute for a low enough price that it made sense. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=535.0s)]
*  And then also some advances on the propulsion side. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=539.6999999999999s)]
*  So there's really like a whole basket of technologies that started to come together and let companies like one of the first ones was Skybox go and say, [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=541.8s)]
*  hey, we can actually surprisingly low cost build a small satellite that will do this very useful thing, have a lot of capability in a small package in a way that just would have never been capable before, [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=552.5999999999999s)]
*  before it would have taken a huge satellite the size of a school bus. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=566.5999999999999s)]
*  And and be able to raise venture capital dollars on that. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=571.4s)]
*  Right. And so that was a that was a pretty you know, that was a pretty big change. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=576.0s)]
*  Can you just kind of help us get a sense of size here? [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=581.1999999999999s)]
*  So you said like the old satellites were maybe as big as a school bus. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=584.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=588.3s)]
*  We're talking about these smaller satellites. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=588.6s)]
*  Like how how big of a difference are we talking about? [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=590.1s)]
*  Yeah. So when we talk about small satellites, you know, it could be anything from a CubeSat, [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=592.4s)]
*  which is like a bread box up to, you know, something the size of a large home appliance. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=598.1s)]
*  Right. So like a kitchen range, you know, or a mini fridge. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=604.1s)]
*  Right. Skybox satellites are about the size of a mini fridge. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=608.0s)]
*  Our satellites, those astronauts are a little bit larger than that. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=611.0s)]
*  Similar class. You know, what we call micro satellites. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=613.7s)]
*  The big satellites that historically cost several hundred million dollars each. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=617.9s)]
*  You know, they are the size of a school bus, if not like a double decker, you know, [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=625.9s)]
*  big big red London double decker bus. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=630.0s)]
*  Yeah. So it's a huge difference. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=633.1s)]
*  You decided in 2015 to found Astronis. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=635.4s)]
*  And so you by that point have been in this industry for at least a decade [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=639.0s)]
*  and gotten to see how this is evolving all of the exciting opportunities. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=643.0s)]
*  And so tell us a little bit about why specifically you've chosen to tackle the unique domain [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=647.4s)]
*  and land that you have on these like smaller geostationary orbit satellites. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=653.8000000000001s)]
*  Like why that of all the different things you could have chosen to do. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=658.8000000000001s)]
*  Totally. Yeah. I mean, I knew that I wanted to go and, you know, do something really disruptive. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=662.9000000000001s)]
*  I mean, I knew that there was and there still is just massive amounts of value to be had [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=670.5s)]
*  in doing things with these new approaches, small satellites [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=676.4000000000001s)]
*  and doing them at a much, much lower cost than these, you know, historic big satellites, [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=680.3s)]
*  which were mostly done these government, you know, big costless contracts billion dollar contracts. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=685.9s)]
*  The thing about GEO and so these other higher orbits is they they are hard. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=690.9s)]
*  You know, they're they're hard to operate in and they're harder to get to. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=698.0s)]
*  So it makes sense that when all those those basket, you know, all those different technologies [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=701.5s)]
*  came together that allowed people to build small satellites early for the first time [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=707.8s)]
*  that they would start in in lower orbit in LEO, right? [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=712.5999999999999s)]
*  That that perfectly makes sense. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=715.5s)]
*  But historically, GEO is actually the most valuable orbit. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=717.8s)]
*  That is where the bulk of money has been spent to put satellites into orbit. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=723.5999999999999s)]
*  I mean, it's hard to know the exact numbers because a lot of it is classified. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=729.8s)]
*  So these are like multi-billion dollar classified programs. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=733.0999999999999s)]
*  I mean, multiple billions of dollars per satellite for some of these classified satellites, right? [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=736.4s)]
*  So, you know, it could be in the hundreds of billions of dollars. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=741.6999999999999s)]
*  No one knows the exact number, but it is a big number that has been spent putting satellites up in a GEO. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=745.8s)]
*  And it's been to enormous economic benefit. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=752.5s)]
*  One of the biggest moneymakers in in the history of all of space was broadcast satellite TV. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=756.9s)]
*  And that is that was all done with these large, very expensive GEO satellites, right? [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=764.3s)]
*  So, you know, there's enormous amount of value up there in this real estate, [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=770.0999999999999s)]
*  which is this belt that surrounds the Earth at GEO. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=774.5s)]
*  And, you know, we just figured, OK, there's got to be a way to do this better. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=780.0s)]
*  And nobody else was doing it. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=784.3s)]
*  You know, then it's also sort of an important thing. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=785.4s)]
*  It's like when you see that magnitude of opportunity and no one is doing it, [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=789.4s)]
*  figure out why, figure out why no one else is doing it and take a stab at it. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=793.2s)]
*  But I mean, to that point, I guess kind of two questions there. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=796.9000000000001s)]
*  One, why was no one doing this and probably related to this? [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=800.0s)]
*  Like, tell us a little bit more about the difference between low orbit, [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=803.4000000000001s)]
*  which is where a lot of different companies are now launching satellites into and GEO, [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=807.4000000000001s)]
*  which is where you've chosen to go. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=813.9000000000001s)]
*  Like, what is the difference there? [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=815.7s)]
*  And again, like, why was no one else doing this? [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=816.8000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, totally. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=819.2s)]
*  So the reason no one else was doing it is that it is hard, right? [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=820.2s)]
*  And it is up at this high orbit where you're actually right in the thick of what we call the Van Allen radiation belts. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=824.5s)]
*  So the satellites are just swimming in this sea of radiation all the time. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=835.3000000000001s)]
*  These belts have basically trapped all of this radiation that's come in from space. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=843.2s)]
*  This is actually why Earth is such a pleasant place to live, [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=847.7s)]
*  because we have this magnetic field that then ends up basically being Earth's deflector shields. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=850.5s)]
*  So that's very beneficial for all of us on Earth, very convenient, thankfully. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=857.5s)]
*  But it traps a lot of these particles, you know, any of these particles that are ionized, [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=864.4000000000001s)]
*  they get trapped there like a magnetic bottle, right? [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=870.2s)]
*  And so there's just this soup of radiation and these ionized particles that satellites up in these high orbits are swimming in. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=873.9s)]
*  So it is hard. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=883.6999999999999s)]
*  I mean, it is the radiation effects that we have to design to, [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=884.6999999999999s)]
*  and they may have to design all our electronics to qualify them, [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=889.3s)]
*  you know, really make sure that they're going to work in this radiation environment. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=892.6999999999999s)]
*  It's just a massive additional challenge on top of building, you know, [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=897.0s)]
*  all the normal challenges of building small satellites and building something that will work in space, [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=901.8000000000001s)]
*  which is already, you know, that's already hard. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=906.6s)]
*  Like anything in space is really not for the faint of heart. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=908.6s)]
*  But, you know, clearly it just is worth it. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=912.7s)]
*  Once you're up, any asset you can get up in that high orbit is just becomes this incredibly valuable thing [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=916.0s)]
*  because you can park it over a country or part of the world and provide, you know, a service with just that one satellite. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=922.1s)]
*  So it ends up being this like structurally very low cost approach covering an area like an entire country with broadband Internet. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=929.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=939.5s)]
*  But there is just clearly this massive value to be had up in these higher orbits and geostation orbit. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=940.2s)]
*  And so, you know, so many should go after it. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=948.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=952.2s)]
*  What gave you the confidence that the technology was there? [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=953.2s)]
*  Because you said space was hard already. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=955.9s)]
*  And then now you're taking it to this, you know, M squared, let's say. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=958.4s)]
*  And so was there any evidence per se that you were like, oh, I do see how certain technologies are advancing even further. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=962.3s)]
*  Or what gave you the confidence to say we can actually make the smaller, cheaper, more iterative? [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=969.8s)]
*  Oh, for sure. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=975.8s)]
*  Well, I would say there was a little bit maybe of hubris there. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=977.4s)]
*  I would say this is sort of a classic case. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=983.4s)]
*  We, you know, we didn't know what we didn't know when we started coming back in 2015. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=986.0s)]
*  And yeah, and in my apartment, myself and my co-founder Ryan, [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=992.0999999999999s)]
*  we basically looked at how quickly and, you know, sort of simply could we pull together all the right pieces for, you know, one of these satellites. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=999.3s)]
*  And certainly at first blush, you know, you could go and go out to this great space economy that we have now. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=1009.9s)]
*  We've got three different vendors we could buy this component from. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=1018.1s)]
*  We've got this, you know, we could go get this. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=1021.0s)]
*  I think that, you know, what we didn't realize was really the magnitude of that gap between Leo and Geo, especially on the radiation environment. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=1024.1s)]
*  A lot of the components that you could buy were really designed for Leo satellites. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=1034.1s)]
*  And once we dug into it would just not work for us in Geo, you know, and that's, you know, that's not through any fault of the vendors. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=1039.4s)]
*  It's just designed for a different thing. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=1049.6000000000001s)]
*  So we ended up it ended up being a lot more work to find, you know, really like and sometimes it was like a kneel and a haystack to find either the right component that we could use. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=1051.6000000000001s)]
*  Or we ended up having to design our own, you know, and run with that because we just there's nothing out there that would work. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=1063.6s)]
*  OK, so let's talk about some of those satellites, including the one that's already up there. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=1072.6s)]
*  You've chosen specifically again to be in Geo and have these smaller satellites that target Internet. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=1077.6s)]
*  Yes. Or provide Internet to folks in specific regions. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=1085.1999999999998s)]
*  Yes. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=1089.3s)]
*  Why why that of all the different functionalities that satellites can offer? [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=1089.9s)]
*  And then also you just like tell me a little bit more about this question of just how many people on Earth actually don't have access to Internet. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=1094.0s)]
*  To be clear, I think this is the most valuable thing that we can do in space. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=1101.3000000000002s)]
*  There are a lot of things you can only do in space just from having this vantage point being that high and looking down and seeing, you know, a good chunk of the Earth or, you know, basically this this whole Earth view. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=1107.5s)]
*  But getting people connected is just of such enormous value, right? [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=1118.7s)]
*  It's like it really changes people's lives. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=1123.6000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, they don't have access to health care information and being able to get education, educate themselves. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=1125.9s)]
*  When you get access to Internet, you're getting access to the sum total of the world's knowledge. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=1132.3s)]
*  Yeah, in one. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=1137.7s)]
*  We forget that. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=1138.8s)]
*  We do forget that. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=1140.2s)]
*  Yes. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=1141.3s)]
*  Yes, we did. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=1142.3s)]
*  It doesn't get lost now in the Instagram era. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=1143.2s)]
*  But if you had nothing and no access to Internet, having then that door opened, you know, to the entire, you know, suddenly having access to the entire world's knowledge on any topic you could imagine, right? [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=1146.4s)]
*  I mean, talk about a massive enabler for people to improve their lives, you know, economic growth, all the rest. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=1161.8s)]
*  It's a huge deal. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=1169.5s)]
*  So, you know, that combines with, I think, the place we're at with connectivity today around the world. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=1171.1s)]
*  I think we have essentially reached the people we're going to reach with fiber. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=1178.3s)]
*  Fiber, laying fiber is enormously expensive and difficult, right? [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=1183.5s)]
*  In a lot of countries, it's done by trenching. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=1189.1s)]
*  And then there's all these other, you know, complicating factors, rates of way, like someone's you're going through someone's land. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=1193.6999999999998s)]
*  And especially in a world where people are mobile first, it's even more challenging because what you really want is you want cell towers just everywhere. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=1199.2s)]
*  Building the cell tower is relatively cheap compared to the value it's going to create of getting those people in that area connected, right? [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=1207.3s)]
*  Very cheap. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=1213.6000000000001s)]
*  Really, all of the problem to be solved is in this connecting that cell tower to the Internet. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=1215.4s)]
*  That's what we call the backhaul problem. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=1221.5s)]
*  And so that is that is what we realized was this key problem to go and solve. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=1225.0s)]
*  And so we have found a set of customers in countries around the world that are either telcos or service providers for those telcos who, you know, help them manage their cell towers that basically are buying this capacity in large quantities. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=1232.5s)]
*  And once we've got a satellite up, there's a number of other customers that all spring up at one time. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=1251.2s)]
*  It's like having a new user lane on the highway, right? [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=1256.2s)]
*  It ends up the demand for it ends up falling out. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=1257.7s)]
*  Oh, yes. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=1261.2s)]
*  That's a great analogy. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=1262.3s)]
*  Yes, I think I'm going to steal that. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=1263.5s)]
*  Listen to all the people who are calling fast. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=1266.6000000000001s)]
*  I can't help laughing. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=1268.7s)]
*  As soon as you add that extra lane, yes, people just immediately fill it up. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=1270.4s)]
*  So, you know, what we've seen is so it's not just the cell towers, right? [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=1274.9s)]
*  It's also enterprise customers who need connectivity for, you know, again, large pipes for anything from that could be like hospitals and schools to mining installations or, you know, things like oil and gas or, you know, there's sort of a whole gamut there. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=1278.8s)]
*  The key is just getting getting that extra lane on the highway open at the right price. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=1296.7s)]
*  Yes. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=1304.1s)]
*  It has to obviously if you could, you know, you put up a bunch of capacity, but you're charging these very high prices where it just doesn't make any sense, then no one's going to buy it. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=1304.6s)]
*  On the other end of the spectrum, if you put it up at a low enough price, then the demand becomes almost effectively unlimited. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=1316.6s)]
*  I mean, people will at a low enough price point, people will consume all the Internet bandwidth that is available and then, you know, come back asking for more. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=1325.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=1334.6s)]
*  And I think we are there. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=1335.0s)]
*  You think the economics are there? [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=1337.1s)]
*  Correct. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=1339.4s)]
*  Yes. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=1340.3s)]
*  With the satellites that we have designed and begun building, I think we are at that inflection point, right? [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=1340.7s)]
*  Mm hmm. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=1349.6s)]
*  And, you know, I think we'll continue to get the price down and even get, you know, that that will get some number percentage of the unconnected population of the world online. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=1351.1s)]
*  And we'll, you know, as we get up to scale because we're going to massively scale what we're doing and build, you know, many of these satellites, hundreds of these satellites, then we'll see, you know, we'll be able to get that economies of scale and get those prices down even lower and get even more people. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=1362.3s)]
*  And you're not necessarily in some of these cases competing directly with, oh, there's all these other satellites or this is fiber that's already been laid that we're now trying to, you know, be more cost efficient than in many of these cases. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=1377.8s)]
*  These people just don't have any Internet, right? [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=1390.5s)]
*  You're there's no competition at least. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=1393.1s)]
*  You know, I watched your video about the Philippines. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=1395.5s)]
*  I felt like that one in particular really drilled that notion where I think it was like, you know, the Philippines have 7000 islands. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=1397.6s)]
*  Yes. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=1405.7s)]
*  Imagine laying fiber to all of those different remote locations. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=1406.1s)]
*  Maybe you can just speak to that. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=1409.9s)]
*  And I think you said I think one time in an interview said just like, how is it that 4 billion people still don't have access to Internet? [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=1411.1s)]
*  And that also is like true. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=1418.9s)]
*  You know, how does that many how do that many humans not have that access? [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=1421.4s)]
*  So people used to talk about the other 3 billion that don't have access to the Internet. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=1425.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=1431.5s)]
*  When you know, the Internet was first really taking off. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=1432.0s)]
*  Now is the other 4 billion. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=1434.7s)]
*  The problem actually got worse. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=1436.7s)]
*  I know. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=1440.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=1440.8s)]
*  How is that possible? [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=1441.7s)]
*  It doesn't seem right. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=1442.9s)]
*  It seems actually quite it's quite astounding that somehow we not only failed to solve the problem, the problem actually got worse over time, not better. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=1443.7s)]
*  It just there's a limit to where it makes sense to run fiber or it's even physically possible to run fiber. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=1452.8s)]
*  You know, talk about people out on very remote places or out on islands, places that have very rough terrain around, you know, whether it's mountains or jungles or deserts. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=1458.0s)]
*  Those populations have been growing over time, but we have failed to, you know, expand the reach of our fiber networks to to meet that. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=1469.7s)]
*  So it is on us in the space industry to solve this problem. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=1478.7s)]
*  I do not see any other means solving it. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=1484.3000000000002s)]
*  I mean, you know, people looked at like balloons and, you know, drones that are stay up for days at a time and are trying to beam down the Internet. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=1487.1s)]
*  Those things are that's pretty tough. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=1496.0s)]
*  There's high operations costs of, you know, these things that, you know, you have to like deal with the weather and they have to be refueled and you bring them down. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=1497.8s)]
*  And that is a, you know, there's a there's possibly some solution there that could work. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=1505.0s)]
*  I would love to see it, but I really do think it's on us in the space business to solve this problem. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=1511.1s)]
*  And we have to figure out how to do that. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=1515.9s)]
*  You know, we're talking about one of the world's most epic problems here. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=1518.9s)]
*  So it's on the order of scale of solving the world's energy problems, solving the world's food problems. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=1522.1000000000001s)]
*  You know, it's just going to take a basket of solutions to be able to solve solve this connectivity problem everywhere that people want. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=1529.6000000000001s)]
*  So you've kind of talked about the Internet connectivity side of things, but there's also some government buyers, right? [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=1537.7s)]
*  Of these satellites and their functionality. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=1543.2s)]
*  So what is the government looking for in those cases where they are the person or the entity buying the solution? [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=1546.8s)]
*  You know, anyone in our position, a company doing new technology for space, for aerospace, you know, there's a by almost by definition, there are national security implications of what we do. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=1555.7s)]
*  So there is almost always, you know, I think if you're doing things right, there's almost always going to be this point where the US government comes in, you know, sort of knocks on your door and is like, hey, what are you doing over there? [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=1570.6s)]
*  Is this like a hypothetical knock on the door? [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=1583.0s)]
*  Yeah, no, we haven't had no, no, they use email. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=1586.0s)]
*  They, you know, they don't literally just show up in your show up at your office. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=1592.4s)]
*  But for us in Space Force, right? [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=1599.2s)]
*  So this is the US military saying, hey, there's real applications here for US national security. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=1602.4s)]
*  What they're looking for is the same as I think anybody else. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=1609.9s)]
*  They need reliable communications. [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=1612.5s)]
*  There's many different flavors of that. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=1615.9s)]
*  And so if they're out operating in remote places, and then, you know, that includes in the case of a conflict, that's also just the Navy when they're out at sea, that's, you know, it's really across the board. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=1618.8s)]
*  They need they need broadband comps, right? [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=1630.3999999999999s)]
*  And they need they need as much as they can get. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=1634.2s)]
*  It's like it's never enough. [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=1637.2s)]
*  And to make sure they have that reliably, they want that through multiple, you know, multiple channels, multiple paths. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=1639.6s)]
*  And ideally, you know, in a get everything set up so that they could just seamlessly switch between different things, you know, no different than your cell phone, switching between your your home Wi Fi and then switching the cell tower when you leave your house. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=1646.1s)]
*  Right. I mean, they just want many, many different options. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=1659.3999999999999s)]
*  You know, we are more than happy to do our part and get some extra capability, extra bandwidth up in Geo. [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=1662.6999999999998s)]
*  And I think what's different in our cases, we can, you know, we can we can do this with small satellites that are that are, you know, it's more of the swarm approach. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=1670.5s)]
*  So with the traditional big Geo satellites cost a billion dollars each, you know, for each geostationary, you know, you can divide up the world by region and over, you know, a given region that we might care about. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=1680.4s)]
*  Asia, for example, there might only be a handful of these satellites that were totally dependent on where it would be devastating if the satellites were were all taken out at the start of a conflict. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=1696.1s)]
*  The military communication satellites, I think there's roughly a dozen that cover the whole world, so they are spread around the whole world. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=1708.3999999999999s)]
*  So, you know, over like over Asia, there's just there's just a couple. [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=1715.3s)]
*  So where Space Force got excited about, I think, our ability to add value here is in taking this swarm approach up into that higher orbit, you know, deploying a large number of small satellites that can provide all kinds of communications capability and be, you know, more scattered around, be more maneuverable. [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=1719.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=1743.0s)]
*  And, you know, it's just a much harder, you know, it's just more, it'd be much harder thing to take out each one. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=1744.1000000000001s)]
*  The invasion of Ukraine by Russia was a big moment for, I think, all of US national security. [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=1749.8000000000002s)]
*  But it was a huge deal for on the on the space side of things, because Ukraine was using a large Geo satellite for a lot of its communications. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=1758.3000000000002s)]
*  It's a satellite called K-8SAT over Europe. [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=1771.3s)]
*  It's commercial satellite. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=1775.6s)]
*  It's being managed by a US US based commercial company. [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=1776.8999999999999s)]
*  And the Russians took out that satellite on day one of the invasion with a massive cyber attack and just in one fell swoop cut off comms across, you know, almost all of Ukraine. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=1783.8999999999999s)]
*  Because they've been very heavily reliant on just this one satellite. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=1798.3s)]
*  And so the Russians, I mean, they really had this planned out, you know, to a T. [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=1801.8s)]
*  I mean, they had it. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=1807.1s)]
*  Everything was ready to go very clearly. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=1807.7s)]
*  They just, you know, it's like they just press one button and unleash these, you know, viruses and they basically crippled the satellite. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=1812.6s)]
*  So this is, you know, it's no longer this theoretical thing of like, well, you know, are these satellites important? [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=1821.0s)]
*  Will our adversaries see them as targets or take action against them? [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=1827.6000000000001s)]
*  It's like, no, we just had a we just had it. [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=1832.0s)]
*  You know, we just saw a conflict and that's exactly what they did on day one was take out one of the satellites. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=1835.3s)]
*  You know, when you think about a lot of what matters in a conflict of that type, it's like just it's about speed and what happens in just the first few days, first few hours. [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=1840.5s)]
*  The thing to remember about a lot of these large geo assets is they're built to last for decades. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=1851.4s)]
*  And so some of them have been up there that we're still up, you know, we're still using them that were built with 20 year old technology. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=1858.3s)]
*  And so they may have all kinds of vulnerabilities, right? [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=1866.6s)]
*  That have since but we've since figured out fixes on new satellites. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=1871.5s)]
*  But, you know, it's just this this old model of putting up a satellite that's going to last for 20 years. [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=1875.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=1879.5s)]
*  You know, it just it's very concerning. [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=1880.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's almost like you're saying the lack of iteration is a national security threat. [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=1883.1s)]
*  Like, oh, yes, 100%. [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=1890.1s)]
*  Yes. [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=1892.3s)]
*  The this this lack of refresh. [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=1892.7s)]
*  Yes. [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=1895.6s)]
*  Of new technology and taking into account all the advances. [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=1896.1s)]
*  You know, it's a real issue. [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=1900.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=1901.8s)]
*  You know, in some ways satellite technology is just one of these last, especially in geo, is just one of these last places where we did not move to smaller hardware that you could build faster and iterate on more quickly and do a faster refresh of technology, right? [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=1902.3s)]
*  Every everything else that we use today across, you know, our lives, but, you know, in business and at home has gotten smaller and smaller and, you know, faster and faster refresh of technology, right? [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=1921.4s)]
*  It's kind of a great point because you imagine around the same time as some of these satellites went out, that's when you had computers the size of a room. [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=1935.7s)]
*  And now we have computers the size of our phones that fit in our pocket. [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=1942.3000000000002s)]
*  But you're saying basically the satellites going up are still the size. [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=1945.8000000000002s)]
*  Oh, yes. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=1949.6000000000001s)]
*  I mean, if anything, it's actually even crazier than that. [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=1950.2s)]
*  If anything, they've gotten bigger and bigger over time instead of smaller and smaller. [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=1954.1000000000001s)]
*  They somehow, you know, got found themselves in this, you know, part of part of the design space where they got they fell into this, you know, local Optima descending down this down this plane. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=1958.5s)]
*  And that's driving them to go bigger and bigger and bigger as time goes on, which and then, yeah, then we find out actually that has all kinds of problems. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=1973.6s)]
*  Satellites are getting bigger. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=1982.8s)]
*  We're actually having more people with no internet. [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=1984.6s)]
*  It's an interesting phenomenon happening over this period. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=1989.0s)]
*  Yes, a lot of problems to solve. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=1992.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=1993.5s)]
*  On that note, maybe we can talk just zoom out a little bit in terms of the satellite economy, but really just all of the infrastructure being built for space. [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=1994.1s)]
*  And maybe you could just share a little bit more about what you're excited about when it comes to like, let's say the next five, 10, 20 years. [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=2003.9s)]
*  What gets you excited? [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=2010.8s)]
*  And what do you think maybe people are overlooking as potential in this industry? [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=2012.3s)]
*  I would say that, you know, we we don't know yet where these other sources of value are going to are going to be. [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=2017.3999999999999s)]
*  You know, is Asteroid mining going to be a massive business opportunity? [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=2026.6999999999998s)]
*  I think we're still figuring that out. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=2031.5s)]
*  There's definitely enough things there that I think clearly where it's just going to it is going to drive us further and further out into space. [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=2033.8s)]
*  And what I think is really exciting is, you know, you just continue to see the space economy just absolutely blossoming with larger, larger and larger numbers of companies trying to, you know, fill in all of the fill in these different pieces. [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=2043.1s)]
*  There's talk of both government programs and private programs to put people back on the moon. [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=2062.9s)]
*  Well, all if we're going to do that, whether it's government or private, any kind of expedition of that type or setting up a lunar base is just going to need all kinds of other pieces of the sort of overall economy and infrastructure, right? [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=2068.5s)]
*  People are going to be operating on the lunar surface. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=2085.7s)]
*  You're going to need communications infrastructure. [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=2087.8999999999996s)]
*  That's something we've thought about and looked at a little bit. [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=2090.8999999999996s)]
*  The moon will need its own GPS system. [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=2094.7s)]
*  You're on the lunar surface. [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=2096.8s)]
*  You want to know where you are. [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=2097.7000000000003s)]
*  Same thing as on the earth. [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=2098.5s)]
*  You want to be able to just pull up, you know, Google Maps, navigate back to your lunar base, right? [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=2100.6000000000004s)]
*  And then have that position be, you know, very precise thanks to a lunar GPS. [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=2106.8s)]
*  We're going to need all kinds of transport of cargo, you know, fuel, food, water, all of these things. [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=2114.7000000000003s)]
*  We're going to need cargo ships, probably a variety of sizes and types that can take things either, you know, to lunar orbit or up and down from the lunar surface. [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=2122.5s)]
*  There's a huge amount there. [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=2133.4s)]
*  There's just, you know, to me, there's no question. [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=2134.5s)]
*  There's a ton of opportunity for companies to go in and sort of, you know, carve out a specific part of that ecosystem and be really, really good at, you know, doing that specific thing as a service or building that, building that. [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=2136.2s)]
*  That component. [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=2152.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=2153.9s)]
*  Well, it sounds like there's a lot of opportunity and maybe to close things off because we do have a lot of people who are current founders or maybe some of these future founders carving out some slice of that market. [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=2154.3s)]
*  Like you have to some extent made it to the other side. [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=2164.8s)]
*  You had your first launch earlier this year and you have another one coming later this year. [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=2167.0s)]
*  I just want to ask you. [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=2173.3s)]
*  Four satellites on it. [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=2174.1s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=2175.0s)]
*  So even bigger, you have your dedicated Falcon 9 launch. [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=2175.5s)]
*  Like that's, that's pretty awesome. [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=2178.6s)]
*  Like, does it feel that way? [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=2180.2s)]
*  I just want, you know, as a person who spent the last eight years on this with maybe not full certainty that it would work out. [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=2181.2s)]
*  How did it feel? [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=2191.3999999999996s)]
*  Like I watched that YouTube video that will link, you know, in the show notes of that first launch and your team watching this go up. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=2192.2s)]
*  And I was like getting emotional during it because I was like, and I read the comments and other people are like, why am I tearing up? [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=2199.1s)]
*  And it's like, I guess it's because it is like quite the feat. [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=2204.3999999999996s)]
*  Does it feel that way on your end as well? [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=2208.1s)]
*  Yes. [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=2211.3999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, no, there's no question. [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=2213.7999999999997s)]
*  You know, had single rocket go up that has, you know, satellite on it, especially, you know, you've spent years getting to that point as something special. [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=2215.6s)]
*  The next one will be, and then take it to the next level because, you know, with the dedicated launch, it'll be our, you know, it'll be the Astronis logo on that rocket, right? [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=2225.6s)]
*  Yes. [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=2237.6s)]
*  And just knowing that that rocket is going up just for us. [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=2238.4s)]
*  So that's a pretty big, yeah, that's going to be a pretty big moment. [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=2243.0s)]
*  Pretty big moment. [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=2246.5s)]
*  We should be celebrating this stuff. [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=2247.8s)]
*  Like these are like monumentous moments, not just the Astronis, but just sending this stuff up to orbit so far away and doing it regularly now and doing it in a way where we're getting new functionality. [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=2249.4s)]
*  It's exciting. [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=2260.8s)]
*  It does feel like this new golden era, maybe 50 years after the first. [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=2261.5s)]
*  It really is. [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=2265.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=2266.3s)]
*  It is a new golden age of space for sure. [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=2266.6s)]
*  Amazing. [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=2269.4s)]
*  Well, thank you, John. [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=2270.0s)]
*  Yeah, thanks for having me. [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=2270.9s)]
*  Appreciate it. [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=2272.2s)]
*  All right. [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=2273.1s)]
*  That is all for today's video. [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=2273.7999999999997s)]
*  However, if you enjoyed it, we have a lot more where that came from. [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=2275.4s)]
*  In fact, we just released a full length episode with this guest on the A16Z podcast. [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=2279.4s)]
*  So if you'd like to listen, go check it out on your favorite podcast app of choice, or we'll link it in the description below. [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=2285.2999999999997s)]
*  Thank you so much for listening and we'll see you next time. [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAKjzjUCppE&t=2293.0s)]
