# From Cloud to Edge: AI Gets Personal
**The a16z Podcast:** [January 01, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0Bdbpy03yk)
*  The generative models that are creating image, voice, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0Bdbpy03yk&t=0.0s)]
*  video will become more prevalent on the infrastructure side [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0Bdbpy03yk&t=3.2s)]
*  and also on the device compute power side. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0Bdbpy03yk&t=6.5200000000000005s)]
*  It's a perfect setup for [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0Bdbpy03yk&t=8.76s)]
*  the smaller models to be more popular. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0Bdbpy03yk&t=10.4s)]
*  My big idea is on-device and [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0Bdbpy03yk&t=12.44s)]
*  smaller generative AI models [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0Bdbpy03yk&t=18.0s)]
*  will become more popular in the next year. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0Bdbpy03yk&t=19.84s)]
*  If you're a frequent user of [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0Bdbpy03yk&t=21.78s)]
*  Uber, Instacart, Lyft, Airbnb applications, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0Bdbpy03yk&t=23.22s)]
*  I'm sure there are many, many machine learning models [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0Bdbpy03yk&t=26.740000000000002s)]
*  that are already running on your device. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0Bdbpy03yk&t=28.84s)]
*  What I'm more referring to is [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0Bdbpy03yk&t=30.32s)]
*  the generative models that are creating image, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0Bdbpy03yk&t=32.48s)]
*  voice, video will become more prevalent in [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0Bdbpy03yk&t=35.12s)]
*  the same way to run on device and within your applications, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0Bdbpy03yk&t=37.8s)]
*  similar to these other traditional machine learning models. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0Bdbpy03yk&t=41.84s)]
*  The models that we've seen in [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0Bdbpy03yk&t=44.6s)]
*  the last few years do take a lot of compute. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0Bdbpy03yk&t=46.0s)]
*  Can you square that with how much compute we can get from [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0Bdbpy03yk&t=48.0s)]
*  something like a smartphone and also these models, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0Bdbpy03yk&t=51.120000000000005s)]
*  whether they're getting smaller or how [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0Bdbpy03yk&t=53.400000000000006s)]
*  this comes together? [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0Bdbpy03yk&t=54.68s)]
*  First, never underestimate the compute power on [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0Bdbpy03yk&t=56.16s)]
*  our smartphone is probably as powerful [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0Bdbpy03yk&t=59.16s)]
*  as a computer 10 or 20 years ago, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0Bdbpy03yk&t=61.559999999999995s)]
*  thanks to Moore's law, smaller sizes of 2 billion, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0Bdbpy03yk&t=63.54s)]
*  8 billion parameter models. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0Bdbpy03yk&t=66.39999999999999s)]
*  That's enough compute for them to run on device. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0Bdbpy03yk&t=68.0s)]
*  It can generate and create very robust experience already, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0Bdbpy03yk&t=71.6s)]
*  be it text or image or audio. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0Bdbpy03yk&t=75.6s)]
*  Some of these models, if they're diffusing models, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0Bdbpy03yk&t=77.56s)]
*  they're intrinsically smaller than [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0Bdbpy03yk&t=79.92s)]
*  large text models to be very capable. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0Bdbpy03yk&t=81.53999999999999s)]
*  Another new set of tooling and also [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0Bdbpy03yk&t=83.7s)]
*  technology developed around distillation is if you have [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0Bdbpy03yk&t=86.26s)]
*  a very powerful large model can be distilled to [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0Bdbpy03yk&t=89.14s)]
*  a smaller parameter size model and still [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0Bdbpy03yk&t=91.98s)]
*  maintain a lot of capabilities that large model contains. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0Bdbpy03yk&t=94.78s)]
*  Both on the infrastructure side and [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0Bdbpy03yk&t=98.74000000000001s)]
*  also on the device compute power side, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0Bdbpy03yk&t=101.06s)]
*  it's a perfect setup for, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0Bdbpy03yk&t=103.38s)]
*  in my opinion, for the smaller models to be more popular. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0Bdbpy03yk&t=105.7s)]
*  Totally. I'm hearing a few things. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0Bdbpy03yk&t=109.54s)]
*  I'm hearing that the smartphones are becoming [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0Bdbpy03yk&t=111.14s)]
*  more powerful, some of these models are becoming more efficient, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0Bdbpy03yk&t=113.54s)]
*  but that brings us to the question of why. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0Bdbpy03yk&t=116.78s)]
*  Why would we want to run these models on device? [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0Bdbpy03yk&t=119.26s)]
*  What are the advantages of that and also the disadvantages? [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0Bdbpy03yk&t=121.74000000000001s)]
*  As consumers and day-to-day users, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0Bdbpy03yk&t=124.22s)]
*  we're already spoiled by real-time and very performant, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0Bdbpy03yk&t=126.24000000000001s)]
*  very sleek and real-time applications. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0Bdbpy03yk&t=130.9s)]
*  If you're talking to a chatbot, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0Bdbpy03yk&t=133.38s)]
*  if you're talking to a conversational AI, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0Bdbpy03yk&t=134.92000000000002s)]
*  if you're adding filters to [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0Bdbpy03yk&t=137.1s)]
*  your video and images on Instagram or TikTok, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0Bdbpy03yk&t=138.96s)]
*  you don't want to wait for multiple seconds to load a new filter. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0Bdbpy03yk&t=142.06s)]
*  You don't want to wait for multiple seconds [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0Bdbpy03yk&t=145.34s)]
*  for the chatbot to respond to you. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0Bdbpy03yk&t=147.34s)]
*  Those are many real use cases that can really [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0Bdbpy03yk&t=149.82s)]
*  delight and improve user experience. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0Bdbpy03yk&t=152.26s)]
*  At the same time, it's also optimization for compute. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0Bdbpy03yk&t=155.34s)]
*  There are a lot of more complex questions or [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0Bdbpy03yk&t=158.96s)]
*  video processing that requires going into the Cloud. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0Bdbpy03yk&t=161.58s)]
*  But largely, if it's, again, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0Bdbpy03yk&t=164.38s)]
*  changing user experiences and improving [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0Bdbpy03yk&t=167.36s)]
*  the visual and sound effect of things, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0Bdbpy03yk&t=170.34s)]
*  it doesn't have to route [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0Bdbpy03yk&t=173.38000000000002s)]
*  through multiple servers going through a network. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0Bdbpy03yk&t=175.02s)]
*  Both from a user experience and efficiency perspective, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0Bdbpy03yk&t=178.66000000000003s)]
*  it's a much better design to run some of the models on device. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0Bdbpy03yk&t=181.98000000000002s)]
*  Then the last part is just privacy. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0Bdbpy03yk&t=186.5s)]
*  Users do care about if my meeting notes is taken locally, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0Bdbpy03yk&t=188.70000000000002s)]
*  I probably will use this meeting note ticker much more often [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0Bdbpy03yk&t=192.66000000000003s)]
*  than knowing some of the data is being sent to a server [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0Bdbpy03yk&t=196.57999999999998s)]
*  and they're processing in a lot of my private conversations. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0Bdbpy03yk&t=200.34s)]
*  So depends on the use case, again, for the application. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0Bdbpy03yk&t=203.9s)]
*  I think that also improves the adoption. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0Bdbpy03yk&t=207.06s)]
*  Absolutely. That has my wheel spinning for sure [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0Bdbpy03yk&t=209.14s)]
*  in terms of maybe this unlocks new applications. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0Bdbpy03yk&t=211.46s)]
*  On that note, you mentioned a few already, [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0Bdbpy03yk&t=213.98s)]
*  but where might we see applications pop up or where, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0Bdbpy03yk&t=215.94s)]
*  perhaps, are we already seeing applications [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0Bdbpy03yk&t=218.82s)]
*  pop up with these on-device models? [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0Bdbpy03yk&t=220.7s)]
*  First come to mind is real-time voice agents. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0Bdbpy03yk&t=223.01999999999998s)]
*  It's a very popular topic [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0Bdbpy03yk&t=226.06s)]
*  and it's something I'm very excited about. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0Bdbpy03yk&t=228.14s)]
*  We invested in and worked very closely [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0Bdbpy03yk&t=230.42s)]
*  with this company called Eleven Labs, [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0Bdbpy03yk&t=231.85999999999999s)]
*  and that's one of the areas they're spending also a lot of efforts on [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0Bdbpy03yk&t=233.38s)]
*  is not just having the human-like synthetic voice, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0Bdbpy03yk&t=236.73999999999998s)]
*  but being able to handle conversations fluidly with end users [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0Bdbpy03yk&t=240.14s)]
*  and to get the latency down and also to think about [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0Bdbpy03yk&t=244.42s)]
*  what type of real-time exchanges you want to have with your AI companion, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0Bdbpy03yk&t=247.29999999999998s)]
*  your support agents, or any sort of life coach. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0Bdbpy03yk&t=252.18s)]
*  I think we do need to think about the modality and the latency [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0Bdbpy03yk&t=256.34000000000003s)]
*  in a much more improved fashion. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0Bdbpy03yk&t=260.38s)]
*  So I won't be surprised if some of those inference workloads [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0Bdbpy03yk&t=262.94s)]
*  are running locally coming into the next 12, 18 months. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0Bdbpy03yk&t=267.82s)]
*  And as we think about how maybe these different models [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0Bdbpy03yk&t=271.82s)]
*  also interact with other parts of a smartphone, [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0Bdbpy03yk&t=274.02s)]
*  let's say the camera, do you expect this to also maybe change user behaviour [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0Bdbpy03yk&t=276.18s)]
*  and what we can do? [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0Bdbpy03yk&t=280.14s)]
*  100%, you can actually reimagine the AR experience [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0Bdbpy03yk&t=281.66s)]
*  of if I point a camera to this room [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0Bdbpy03yk&t=285.54s)]
*  and I want to see a new surface and wallpaper and furnitures, [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0Bdbpy03yk&t=289.14s)]
*  the technology is already there. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0Bdbpy03yk&t=294.22s)]
*  Like we can actually leverage both generative AI and the camera [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0Bdbpy03yk&t=296.22s)]
*  and also prompting interaction to create new experiences already [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0Bdbpy03yk&t=301.46s)]
*  of how we interact with the real physical life. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0Bdbpy03yk&t=305.74s)]
*  And that's where I also think a lot of on-device models [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0Bdbpy03yk&t=309.22s)]
*  will play a big role of how to interact with the 3D world, [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0Bdbpy03yk&t=313.54s)]
*  how to interact with the physical world, [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0Bdbpy03yk&t=316.90000000000003s)]
*  and not just using the camera for capture, [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0Bdbpy03yk&t=319.06s)]
*  but also using it as a projector. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0Bdbpy03yk&t=320.82000000000005s)]
*  Definitely. And let me ask you about economics then, [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0Bdbpy03yk&t=322.90000000000003s)]
*  because a lot of the models that exist today do rely on inference [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0Bdbpy03yk&t=325.34000000000003s)]
*  and sending that inference up to the cloud and that costs money. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0Bdbpy03yk&t=330.02000000000004s)]
*  Do the economics change if you all of a sudden have these models [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0Bdbpy03yk&t=333.90000000000003s)]
*  running on-device on the smartphone compute that already exists? [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0Bdbpy03yk&t=336.86s)]
*  Do the economics actually shift or can we come up with new ways [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0Bdbpy03yk&t=341.3s)]
*  of monetizing in this new world? [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0Bdbpy03yk&t=344.34s)]
*  It's a great question and I honestly don't really have the answer [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0Bdbpy03yk&t=345.9s)]
*  because even for larger models, [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0Bdbpy03yk&t=350.1s)]
*  the inference price has been dropping really significantly. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0Bdbpy03yk&t=351.78s)]
*  Further optimizations to be done, [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0Bdbpy03yk&t=354.78s)]
*  if it's a very workload-intensive sort of compute, [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0Bdbpy03yk&t=356.14s)]
*  let's say using your computer or phone, [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0Bdbpy03yk&t=359.14s)]
*  I think it will still have economics benefits, [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0Bdbpy03yk&t=361.02s)]
*  but I don't think it's going to substantially reduce [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0Bdbpy03yk&t=363.06s)]
*  infrastructure costs for some of these applications. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0Bdbpy03yk&t=366.3s)]
*  But architecting and structuring, sort of the whole tool chain, [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0Bdbpy03yk&t=369.02000000000004s)]
*  it does change economics on the developer efficiency [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0Bdbpy03yk&t=373.18s)]
*  and iteration speed. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0Bdbpy03yk&t=376.98s)]
*  There is pros and cons when shipping in the cloud [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0Bdbpy03yk&t=379.1s)]
*  where it can launch more continuously on-device [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0Bdbpy03yk&t=381.94s)]
*  as its own challenges because you kind of have to go [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0Bdbpy03yk&t=385.5s)]
*  with the updates with the application and updates with hardware. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0Bdbpy03yk&t=387.86s)]
*  So there is that side of economics that I think will have impact [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0Bdbpy03yk&t=391.46000000000004s)]
*  from how teams are being structured in launching models in a hybrid mode. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0Bdbpy03yk&t=395.34s)]
*  So I would encourage teams who are thinking of leveraging [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0Bdbpy03yk&t=400.09999999999997s)]
*  this technology, sort of consider it more holistically. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0Bdbpy03yk&t=403.38s)]
*  Super interesting. And as we think about that world, [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0Bdbpy03yk&t=406.5s)]
*  are there any players that you think really succeed here? [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0Bdbpy03yk&t=408.97999999999996s)]
*  Like in one sense, I could see maybe the phone manufacturers. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0Bdbpy03yk&t=411.17999999999995s)]
*  I could also see maybe the manufacturers of wearables [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0Bdbpy03yk&t=414.82s)]
*  being able to introduce all kinds of new applications. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0Bdbpy03yk&t=418.26s)]
*  Think of like wearing an Apple Watch, Fitbit, Whoop, things like that. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0Bdbpy03yk&t=420.7s)]
*  Is it Nvidia that benefits in some way? [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0Bdbpy03yk&t=424.78000000000003s)]
*  Like who do you think actually benefits from this idea of the models [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0Bdbpy03yk&t=426.82s)]
*  becoming more efficient and these on-device models becoming a thing? [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0Bdbpy03yk&t=430.34000000000003s)]
*  Right now, I've seen more interest and enthusiasm [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0Bdbpy03yk&t=435.1s)]
*  from the hardware development side, whether it's chips, [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0Bdbpy03yk&t=439.94s)]
*  it's the phone makers. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0Bdbpy03yk&t=444.1s)]
*  I do think there is also a lot of interest from the model developers as well, [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0Bdbpy03yk&t=446.14s)]
*  just like proliferating the model adoption across different setups and devices. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0Bdbpy03yk&t=450.18s)]
*  But I think over the long run, it's probably going to impact the whole supply chain. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0Bdbpy03yk&t=457.5s)]
*  We talked about some of these macro trends throughout. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0Bdbpy03yk&t=461.5s)]
*  How do you specifically see those trends shaping up in 2025? [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0Bdbpy03yk&t=463.98s)]
*  And is there anything in particular that you're kind of putting your eye toward? [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0Bdbpy03yk&t=466.94s)]
*  This will sound more like a consumer investor. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0Bdbpy03yk&t=470.58000000000004s)]
*  I've been like a hardcore investor, but I am very excited about the mixed reality [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0Bdbpy03yk&t=474.1s)]
*  where generative models, 3D models, video models that really, again, [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0Bdbpy03yk&t=478.06s)]
*  makes the reality of what we're seeing today and through the camera lens, [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0Bdbpy03yk&t=482.74s)]
*  through the microphones, much more creative world, [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0Bdbpy03yk&t=486.22s)]
*  even when sitting at home or when going on a ride. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0Bdbpy03yk&t=489.9s)]
*  That's the type of experience I'm very much looking forward to. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0Bdbpy03yk&t=493.74s)]
*  I think the foundation model technology is pretty mature. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0Bdbpy03yk&t=496.34000000000003s)]
*  The infrastructure is getting ready. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0Bdbpy03yk&t=499.1s)]
*  So I'm personally very excited about that sort of the new consumer experience. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0Bdbpy03yk&t=501.06s)]
