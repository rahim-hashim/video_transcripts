# Udio: From Text to Tune
**The a16z Podcast:** [August 13, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYB1l3ML1v0)
*  There's a threshold often happens with a lot of generative models where it goes from interesting to say researchers to interesting to kind of people around the field. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYB1l3ML1v0&t=0.0s)]
*  And then at some point it breaks through the kind of public consciousness. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYB1l3ML1v0&t=7.08s)]
*  And I think in the last in the last year or even the last six months, similar things happened with music. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYB1l3ML1v0&t=9.76s)]
*  I'm Connor. I'm a co-founder at Udio. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYB1l3ML1v0&t=23.28s)]
*  Udio is a music generation service where users can use generative AI as part of like a music creation workflow. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYB1l3ML1v0&t=26.28s)]
*  I think people have a really special relationship with music. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYB1l3ML1v0&t=32.28s)]
*  It's everywhere at all times. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYB1l3ML1v0&t=34.88s)]
*  Like it's in the background when you're at a restaurant or cafe, you're listening to your headphones, when you go to work in the morning. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYB1l3ML1v0&t=36.28s)]
*  It's a mood thing. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYB1l3ML1v0&t=42.28s)]
*  It really has like an emotional resonance with people. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYB1l3ML1v0&t=43.28s)]
*  The promise of generative modeling is that a lot of this can be far more abundant than it ever was before. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYB1l3ML1v0&t=46.44s)]
*  It's a more engaging, creative thing. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYB1l3ML1v0&t=52.32s)]
*  It's a super visceral thing to create something that like a holistic piece of music, listen to it and go, wow, that's incredible. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYB1l3ML1v0&t=54.0s)]
*  Like I can, you know, it's a lot easier for me to curate and express my taste. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYB1l3ML1v0&t=60.68s)]
*  That's something I personally find compelling. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYB1l3ML1v0&t=64.64s)]
*  And I think I believe that other people do as well. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYB1l3ML1v0&t=66.16s)]
*  We kind of want to bring that ease of creation just as a super fun, creative thing as part of a workflow for people. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYB1l3ML1v0&t=68.88s)]
*  So I think, yeah, that's why specifically music. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYB1l3ML1v0&t=76.44s)]
*  There's a threshold often happens with a lot of generative models where it goes from interesting to say researchers to people around the field. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYB1l3ML1v0&t=78.92s)]
*  And then at some point it breaks through the kind of public consciousness. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYB1l3ML1v0&t=84.12s)]
*  We saw a similar thing happen with language models and image models for the last couple of years. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYB1l3ML1v0&t=86.76s)]
*  And I think in the last year or so, or even the last six months, similar thing has happened with music. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYB1l3ML1v0&t=90.92s)]
*  You can kind of listen to something and say, does this give me the same feeling that listening to music does? [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYB1l3ML1v0&t=96.04s)]
*  Or does this sound like a novelty? [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYB1l3ML1v0&t=101.2s)]
*  You know, does this sound like something which I think, oh, that's nice, but you know, it's not quite there yet. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYB1l3ML1v0&t=102.68s)]
*  Is it something that I could take some of these tracks and actually create something that's like a novel? [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYB1l3ML1v0&t=108.12s)]
*  And actually, I'd be interested in using them in a professional production, using parts of them or just something I'd like to listen to, you know, in and of its own kind of right. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYB1l3ML1v0&t=113.16s)]
*  The ultimate test for a lot of these models is, do people actually find them useful? [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYB1l3ML1v0&t=120.64s)]
*  Like in whatever capacity it is, do I genuinely find this kind of engaging or compelling? [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYB1l3ML1v0&t=125.28s)]
*  And that's the ultimate test of, I think, any generative model is like, does it actually meet the threshold? [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYB1l3ML1v0&t=130.24s)]
*  And you can it's quite a nebulous thing, but it's also quite concrete in that it's there or it's not, you know what I mean? [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYB1l3ML1v0&t=135.28s)]
*  It's of a certain threshold or it's not. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYB1l3ML1v0&t=140.48s)]
*  And so for some reason, the thing that I have or that I've done for, I don't know, a very long time now ends up being a song about socks. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYB1l3ML1v0&t=142.6s)]
*  So, you know, I end up doing a song about socks and I actually, I end up just doing everything auto generated to see how it kind of ends up. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYB1l3ML1v0&t=150.44s)]
*  That can be a useful, basically grounding tool for me. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYB1l3ML1v0&t=157.72s)]
*  So I end up just doing this and seeing what genres and the model ends up suggesting. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYB1l3ML1v0&t=160.32s)]
*  And additionally, you know, kind of what lyrics it decides to choose, how it arranges them, et cetera. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYB1l3ML1v0&t=165.95999999999998s)]
*  So that's what I go with here. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYB1l3ML1v0&t=172.2s)]
*  Select 32 second clip, auto generated lyrics and manual mode off. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYB1l3ML1v0&t=174.28s)]
*  And then we just hit enter and those tracks are creating. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYB1l3ML1v0&t=179.76s)]
*  Live demos can be fun. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYB1l3ML1v0&t=184.32s)]
*  So let's see what happens. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYB1l3ML1v0&t=185.39999999999998s)]
*  And so that to me, that sounds like the tags that generated for that is rock, psychedelic rock, progressive rock. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYB1l3ML1v0&t=202.04s)]
*  That's roughly within genre. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYB1l3ML1v0&t=209.84s)]
*  And it sounds like a 70s or kind of 80s vibe. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYB1l3ML1v0&t=211.23999999999998s)]
*  And yeah, it's about socks, you know, and so to me, like this is a this is a good check that like systems are working, everything is kind of put together. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYB1l3ML1v0&t=214.16s)]
*  If I'm using it kind of more personally, I can drill down more deeply. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYB1l3ML1v0&t=221.72s)]
*  But like this this kind of sets the tone for where I think we're at. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYB1l3ML1v0&t=225.35999999999999s)]
*  If everything is kind of working correctly, it can also be nice. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYB1l3ML1v0&t=228.51999999999998s)]
*  It's a starting point because you're like, I go on and I'm sure exactly what genres I want to focus on. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYB1l3ML1v0&t=230.88s)]
*  And, you know, just kind of purely coincidentally, both of these kind of are the person is psychedelic rock. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYB1l3ML1v0&t=235.0s)]
*  This is going as neo-psychedelic, psychedelic, psychedelic pop. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYB1l3ML1v0&t=239.92s)]
*  These can be good starting points as well, because you hear a sound and you're like, oh, I want to explore this more. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYB1l3ML1v0&t=243.35999999999999s)]
*  But now I want to, you know, change my lyrics. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYB1l3ML1v0&t=247.72s)]
*  I want to more expand the thing. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYB1l3ML1v0&t=249.48s)]
*  I want to explore this a bit more. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYB1l3ML1v0&t=250.72s)]
*  But even, you know, kind of silly prompt like this is a really good starting point. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYB1l3ML1v0&t=252.07999999999998s)]
*  The audio cue, you know, in hip hop, there's a whole Kendrick Drake thing that's going on. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYB1l3ML1v0&t=256.48s)]
*  And I logged onto Twitter one day and there's this BBL Drizzy song that was kind of everywhere, [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYB1l3ML1v0&t=261.04s)]
*  did some digging within an hour, had figured out it actually had originated with us. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYB1l3ML1v0&t=265.56s)]
*  That was a real instance of complete validation because it was the original clip itself had gone [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYB1l3ML1v0&t=269.08s)]
*  kind of so viral, it had been sampled by Metro Boomer, like top producer in the world. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYB1l3ML1v0&t=276.15999999999997s)]
*  So he heard that and thought, OK, there's something here to work with. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYB1l3ML1v0&t=280.15999999999997s)]
*  And then from from that point onwards, there was this kind of creative explosion, basically, of people remixing it, [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYB1l3ML1v0&t=282.92s)]
*  people like doing verses over it, you know, instrumental versions like sax solos, guitar solos on top. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYB1l3ML1v0&t=288.68s)]
*  And since actually that song has actually appeared on an album on Sexy Red's latest album [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYB1l3ML1v0&t=295.8s)]
*  as a sample on a track and Drake actually has a verse on top of that. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYB1l3ML1v0&t=300.8s)]
*  It's crazy, right? Like this is this is a really insane thing. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYB1l3ML1v0&t=304.40000000000003s)]
*  And I think it's it's kind of total validation that the model can actually provide that level of kind of creative output [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYB1l3ML1v0&t=306.88s)]
*  and just enable moments like that. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYB1l3ML1v0&t=312.56s)]
*  And I think that's super validating for us. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYB1l3ML1v0&t=314.8s)]
*  I think what we acknowledge is that we probably have different types of users, like distinctly different types of users [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYB1l3ML1v0&t=316.32s)]
*  at the very top being does someone in a studio who's making an album like at the very top level, [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYB1l3ML1v0&t=322.88s)]
*  do they find it useful to use our tool at the end of the scale, should I say, is maybe someone on their phone [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYB1l3ML1v0&t=329.0s)]
*  who wants, you know, in a minute, they want just a funny song to send to their friend. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYB1l3ML1v0&t=334.84s)]
*  And those are two very different experiences and kind of somewhat similar to, [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYB1l3ML1v0&t=340.08s)]
*  you know, the kind of output you can get from just an instrument in general. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYB1l3ML1v0&t=345.84s)]
*  Like someone can have a guitar at home that they play, you know, just to have fun from time to time. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYB1l3ML1v0&t=350.32s)]
*  It's like a totally personal thing. It's not anything necessarily serious. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYB1l3ML1v0&t=355.0s)]
*  It's just it's just a way to express yourself with kind of musically. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYB1l3ML1v0&t=358.08s)]
*  And the same way someone can take that same guitar and a professional can take it into a studio [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYB1l3ML1v0&t=362.56s)]
*  and make it part of, you know, something fantastic. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYB1l3ML1v0&t=367.12s)]
*  We like the, you know, we'd like the technology to basically enable all all ends of the world, parts of that spectrum. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYB1l3ML1v0&t=370.08s)]
*  We do actually want to serve like we acknowledge that we have these different kind of types of users [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYB1l3ML1v0&t=376.32s)]
*  and we would actually like to serve all of them if possible. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYB1l3ML1v0&t=380.12s)]
