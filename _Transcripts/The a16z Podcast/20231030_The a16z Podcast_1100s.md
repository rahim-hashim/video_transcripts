# The Unanswered Questions of Space: Quantum Entanglement, Dark Matter, and Dark Energy
**The a16z Podcast:** [October 30, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO4KKjNaxdg)
*  Few questions are as universal as, are we alone? And if our celestial neighbors are out there, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO4KKjNaxdg&t=0.0s)]
*  who are they? Where are they? And should we fear them? These questions are just the tip of the [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO4KKjNaxdg&t=7.6000000000000005s)]
*  iceberg, and just a few of the questions I got to explore with astrophysicist John Mather, who is [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO4KKjNaxdg&t=13.68s)]
*  also the senior project scientist on the James Webb Space Telescope, plus the first NASA scientist [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO4KKjNaxdg&t=20.64s)]
*  to win a Nobel Prize. In this video, we get to explore the mystifying secrets of space, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO4KKjNaxdg&t=27.2s)]
*  where John takes us back billions of years to a time before the Big Bang, and also catapults us [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO4KKjNaxdg&t=33.12s)]
*  many moons into the future, one where evidence of our universe's origin may actually no longer exist. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO4KKjNaxdg&t=39.04s)]
*  If you were to come back in another, say, 100 billion years, most of the galaxies that we know [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO4KKjNaxdg&t=45.519999999999996s)]
*  about would have receded from us so far away that we couldn't see them anymore. So the universe will [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO4KKjNaxdg&t=50.56s)]
*  be in the process of appearing to empty itself out. And if you imagine going far enough into the [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO4KKjNaxdg&t=55.84s)]
*  future with just one Milky Way left, all the other galaxies are gone, the evidence of the history of [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO4KKjNaxdg&t=60.800000000000004s)]
*  the universe might have disappeared. So I'd like to invite you on this cosmic journey as we venture [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO4KKjNaxdg&t=68.08s)]
*  through wormholes, quantum entanglement, dark matter and dark energy, and the abyss of unanswered [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO4KKjNaxdg&t=72.96000000000001s)]
*  questions that scientists like John are trying to answer through technology. As a reminder, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO4KKjNaxdg&t=78.88s)]
*  the content here is for informational purposes only, should not be taken as legal business tax [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO4KKjNaxdg&t=84.4s)]

*  a16z.com slash disclosures. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO4KKjNaxdg&t=99.92s)]
*  Why don't we actually kind of look at some of these images from James Webb and maybe you could [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO4KKjNaxdg&t=111.2s)]
*  just speak to, okay, maybe even is there one that really you think shows us new features of [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO4KKjNaxdg&t=116.56s)]
*  understanding? [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO4KKjNaxdg&t=124.0s)]
*  Yeah. So we have something that Joe Biden released at the White House on July 11th last year, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO4KKjNaxdg&t=124.56s)]
*  and it shows quite a few remarkable things. There's some stars with six legs sticking out, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO4KKjNaxdg&t=132.88s)]
*  and that's just due to the wave nature of light, because light sort of bends around the hexagonal [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO4KKjNaxdg&t=140.48s)]
*  edges of our mirrors. So we knew about that. So stars are not that exciting right now. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO4KKjNaxdg&t=146.4s)]
*  Then in the middle of the picture are some giant fuzzy galaxies, enormously massive, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO4KKjNaxdg&t=152.32s)]
*  and we sort of knew they were there already. And so that wasn't so exciting, but we wanted to know [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO4KKjNaxdg&t=157.76s)]
*  exactly how massive and exactly where all that stuff is. And then in the background are little [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO4KKjNaxdg&t=162.64s)]
*  pink arcs, curved things that do not look like galaxies, but they really are. And so they are [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO4KKjNaxdg&t=168.79999999999998s)]
*  highly magnified and distorted images of very, very distant objects. And nature has given us [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO4KKjNaxdg&t=176.88000000000002s)]
*  lenses, extra lenses in space to magnify the more distant universe. And this is something that [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO4KKjNaxdg&t=184.4s)]
*  Einstein predicted, and we never thought it would be useful, except in the most abstract way. But [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO4KKjNaxdg&t=190.4s)]
*  so now what we see is sometimes two or three or four or five images of the same distant object, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO4KKjNaxdg&t=196.96s)]
*  all stretched out and magnified. So this is a way to look farther back in time to see the [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO4KKjNaxdg&t=203.76s)]
*  details of the various first galaxies. So that's the coolest thing for the astronomer in that picture. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO4KKjNaxdg&t=209.04s)]
*  So sometimes we even see that the early galaxy is filled up with a little sparkly things. We call [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO4KKjNaxdg&t=216.72s)]
*  them globular clusters of like a hundred thousand stars that were presumably formed together. And [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO4KKjNaxdg&t=224.07999999999998s)]
*  now our big question is, well, which came first, galaxies or globular clusters? Did the universe [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO4KKjNaxdg&t=230.24s)]
*  make the little clusters first and then they joined together? Or did the galaxy form first [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO4KKjNaxdg&t=236.0s)]
*  and then break up into little clusters? So this is one of our generic questions of which came first, [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO4KKjNaxdg&t=241.36s)]
*  chickens or eggs or breadfruit? I don't know. So which brings me to another question about [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO4KKjNaxdg&t=247.04000000000002s)]
*  early galaxies. There's a black hole, giant black hole in every galaxy, just about. And so [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO4KKjNaxdg&t=255.20000000000002s)]
*  we know they're there because we see things orbiting around them. So we calculate that [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO4KKjNaxdg&t=261.6s)]
*  there's something immensely massive object in the middle. Sometimes they're very bright because [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO4KKjNaxdg&t=266.32s)]
*  material is falling in and getting compressed to enormous temperatures and we can see that part. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO4KKjNaxdg&t=271.44s)]
*  And now we want to know, well, which came first, the galaxy or the black hole? [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO4KKjNaxdg&t=276.64s)]
*  Did the universe start off with black holes all over the place? [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO4KKjNaxdg&t=281.35999999999996s)]
*  Or did it make galaxies first and then they made black holes? So we've begun to observe black holes [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO4KKjNaxdg&t=286.56s)]
*  out there. We've even seen a few years ago black holes colliding with each other and joining [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO4KKjNaxdg&t=293.28s)]
*  together to make bigger black holes. This is with the James Webb? That was done with the LIGO [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO4KKjNaxdg&t=298.15999999999997s)]
*  Observatory, which is here on the ground. And we've even more remarkably seen neutron stars [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO4KKjNaxdg&t=302.08s)]
*  colliding and making a bigger neutron star. And that has its own story to tell because, [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO4KKjNaxdg&t=309.12s)]
*  for instance, when you look at your ring, if you have a wedding ring of gold, then we know that [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO4KKjNaxdg&t=316.24s)]
*  most of the gold in that wedding ring came from neutron stars that collided and blew up and [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO4KKjNaxdg&t=321.44s)]
*  material came back out into space and was recycled. So this is a part of the most astonishing story [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO4KKjNaxdg&t=327.04s)]
*  about our own origins that we're made out of not only recycled stars, but neutron stars that [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO4KKjNaxdg&t=332.8s)]
*  collided and blew up. And so our own personal story has got the most remarkable threads in it. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO4KKjNaxdg&t=339.12s)]
*  And I just want to ask you about this particular image, which has been referenced a lot in terms [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO4KKjNaxdg&t=346.40000000000003s)]
*  of understanding exoplanets and the composition of them. And perhaps you could speak to maybe what [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO4KKjNaxdg&t=351.44s)]
*  we've learned there and also what it may indicate in terms of life that we have maybe come across, [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO4KKjNaxdg&t=356.8s)]
*  not come across. I think the answer is the latter, but also what that maybe opens up for the future. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO4KKjNaxdg&t=363.68s)]
*  Yeah, sure. So yeah, everybody wants to know, are we alone? And if we're not alone, where are [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO4KKjNaxdg&t=367.84000000000003s)]
*  the neighbors? So I'll give you my, I'll jump ahead to that. But I think the answer is, I think the [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO4KKjNaxdg&t=373.6s)]
*  answer is no, we're not alone. And I think life will occur quite frequently, but it will mostly [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO4KKjNaxdg&t=378.8s)]
*  be rather elementary. And when you look at the history of Earth, you see the history of the [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO4KKjNaxdg&t=385.04s)]
*  different forms of life growing, it's taken all of the entire history of the universe for us to turn [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO4KKjNaxdg&t=390.8s)]
*  up. So that does tell us that we're kind of rare in history. So probably life is everywhere that [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO4KKjNaxdg&t=396.16s)]
*  it could be, which is perhaps in conditions like ours, where there's liquid water at about the [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO4KKjNaxdg&t=404.32000000000005s)]
*  right temperature. So, but probably we're not going to find the neighbors. Similarly, that we're [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO4KKjNaxdg&t=410.24s)]
*  not in danger from the neighbors. So maybe we've got lots of unexplained things here on planet [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO4KKjNaxdg&t=416.88s)]
*  Earth, but it's not very likely to be space aliens. Something else that we don't understand instead. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO4KKjNaxdg&t=421.92s)]
*  So what are we going to do about measuring? Well, of course, here in the solar system, [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO4KKjNaxdg&t=427.36s)]
*  we're sending out probes to land on Mars and visit other places where there could be life [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO4KKjNaxdg&t=432.32s)]
*  and sea. So on Mars, we're working to bring back little rocks that have the chance of having [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO4KKjNaxdg&t=438.8s)]
*  fossils in them. So that's really hard, but we're working on it. We're already putting the rocks in [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO4KKjNaxdg&t=444.64s)]
*  little caches to get ready to bring them home. We are sending probes out to orbit around satellites [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO4KKjNaxdg&t=449.6s)]
*  of Jupiter and Saturn, where water is coming out. There are places where there's a liquid water ocean [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO4KKjNaxdg&t=456.8s)]
*  covered with ice, and there are cracks in the ice and the water comes out and you can see something. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO4KKjNaxdg&t=466.4s)]
*  And so if we're lucky, we might find out there are organic molecules in those oceans. Fascinating. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO4KKjNaxdg&t=471.2s)]
*  I would say maybe there's life under there. And so it gives us impetus to track it down and find out [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO4KKjNaxdg&t=476.96s)]
*  more. So then we get to what can we do about other planets around other stars? Can we find places [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO4KKjNaxdg&t=483.03999999999996s)]
*  that are like home? Little Earths orbiting stars like the sun. So far, we don't know of any like [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO4KKjNaxdg&t=491.04s)]
*  that because it's a really hard observational problem. What we're doing at the web, we are [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO4KKjNaxdg&t=497.6s)]
*  looking at planets orbiting smaller stars that are called M stars. So these are very weak little [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO4KKjNaxdg&t=504.56s)]
*  stars, they're hardly as big as Jupiter, but they're warm enough to... Hardly as big as Jupiter. It's [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO4KKjNaxdg&t=512.64s)]
*  just funny with our sizes. Yeah. Tiny little humans. Well, just as a matter of scale, Earth is 8,000 [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO4KKjNaxdg&t=517.52s)]
*  miles across, Jupiter's 88,000 miles across, and the sun is about a million miles across. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO4KKjNaxdg&t=523.36s)]
*  It's good for you. Good reference. Roughly each one is 10 times bigger than the other. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO4KKjNaxdg&t=528.8s)]
*  So yes, we're able to study planets around small stars because some of the time the little planet [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO4KKjNaxdg&t=533.1999999999999s)]
*  will go in front of the star and it'll block some starlight. So okay, now we know it's there. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO4KKjNaxdg&t=543.36s)]
*  We can calculate its temperature and its size and whether it might possibly host an ocean. Okay, [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO4KKjNaxdg&t=548.48s)]
*  now does it have an atmosphere? So yes, maybe. So look to see if any of the starlights going [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO4KKjNaxdg&t=555.12s)]
*  through the atmosphere of the planet on its way to the telescope. And yeah, we can do this. And we have [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO4KKjNaxdg&t=561.28s)]
*  a pretty large catalog of large planets that do have an atmosphere with interesting molecules in [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO4KKjNaxdg&t=567.9200000000001s)]
*  them. And so the technique works. And now we're just now busy analyzing the small stars that have [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO4KKjNaxdg&t=572.64s)]
*  potentially small Earth-like planets. And I can't say that we're really surprised, but so far the [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO4KKjNaxdg&t=579.76s)]
*  little ones do not have atmospheres that we can tell. So we shouldn't be too disappointed because [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO4KKjNaxdg&t=586.4s)]
*  we didn't really expect it. But we still do really want to know. So what's next in this subject? [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO4KKjNaxdg&t=591.84s)]
*  Well, we need to build different telescopes. Tell me more about that. We are finishing up one now called the [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO4KKjNaxdg&t=599.12s)]
*  Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope and it will have equipment to look for planets as direct images, [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO4KKjNaxdg&t=603.76s)]
*  a device called a coronagraph. So if we can get that to work, you never know. We might see some [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO4KKjNaxdg&t=610.88s)]
*  signs of a more or less Earth-like planet. And the next one we're going to build is called Habitable [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO4KKjNaxdg&t=616.72s)]
*  Worlds Observatory. And so when we do that, we'll be able to see an image with a little dot next to [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO4KKjNaxdg&t=621.76s)]
*  the other big dot. And it'll be an Earth-like object around a star like the sun, which is a much more [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO4KKjNaxdg&t=628.72s)]
*  likely place to find signs of life. Because of course, we've got one observation, which is us. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO4KKjNaxdg&t=634.1600000000001s)]
*  Here we are. So please look for another place like us. So we're building that, or I should say we will [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO4KKjNaxdg&t=640.48s)]
*  be building that because that's what NASA wants to build. Congress wants to build it. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO4KKjNaxdg&t=646.48s)]
*  The National Academy of Sciences said to build it. Astronomers want us to build it. And I think the [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO4KKjNaxdg&t=652.0s)]
*  public wants us to build this because, oh, I sure want to know. We all want to know, are we alone? [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO4KKjNaxdg&t=656.16s)]
*  We want to know. I mean, let me ask you a tangential question, which is just, there's just still so [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO4KKjNaxdg&t=661.1999999999999s)]
*  many question marks about this universe around us. Is there a specific question mark that, you know, [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO4KKjNaxdg&t=666.3199999999999s)]
*  you would just love to see solved in your lifetime? You would love that answer, just even out of [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO4KKjNaxdg&t=672.9599999999999s)]
*  personal interest. There's something gnawing at you. I guess the ones that are obvious, that [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO4KKjNaxdg&t=678.0799999999999s)]
*  already are recognized by thousands of scientists, the cosmic dark energy, cosmic dark matter, [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO4KKjNaxdg&t=683.76s)]
*  they seem to be there. We can describe them mathematically. They seem to fit practically [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO4KKjNaxdg&t=690.08s)]
*  everything that we know. And we did not expect them. There was no sort of basic understanding [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO4KKjNaxdg&t=696.16s)]
*  of anything that said they should be there. Maybe just for the listeners, could you explain what [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO4KKjNaxdg&t=704.88s)]
*  both of those are, dark energy and dark matter? So cosmic dark matter appears to be [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO4KKjNaxdg&t=708.96s)]
*  transparent. We shouldn't call it dark. We should call it transparent. There's a lot more of it [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO4KKjNaxdg&t=715.92s)]
*  than there is of ordinary matter, the protons, the neutrons and atoms that you all see every day. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO4KKjNaxdg&t=721.04s)]
*  So it's out there. It has been detected by its gravity. So back in the 1930s, we already had a [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO4KKjNaxdg&t=727.28s)]
*  hint that galaxies were spinning too fast, which means they're being held together by more gravity [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO4KKjNaxdg&t=734.08s)]
*  than you can find. You cannot find the stars to explain that amount of gravity. So something is [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO4KKjNaxdg&t=739.76s)]
*  weird. So it took from then until about 1980 something before we had a lot more evidence. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO4KKjNaxdg&t=745.9200000000001s)]
*  We could say, yeah, there's really there. Do we know what it is? No. We have been hunting in [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO4KKjNaxdg&t=752.64s)]
*  laboratories for decades and darn it, there isn't a single thing that's ever said this is a good [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO4KKjNaxdg&t=759.28s)]
*  promising candidate. So that means it's a wide open mystery. Then we have the cosmic dark energy, [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO4KKjNaxdg&t=765.52s)]
*  which is something that in principle Einstein imagined. There's a place in his equations of [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO4KKjNaxdg&t=773.52s)]
*  the universe that could be called dark energy. But we thought generally, astronomers thought that, [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO4KKjNaxdg&t=779.8399999999999s)]
*  well, that would never happen. So we imagined and believed that the universe expansion will be [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO4KKjNaxdg&t=786.88s)]
*  slowing down because gravity is pulling on things and it'll slow the expansion, which seems to be [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO4KKjNaxdg&t=791.92s)]
*  true up for the first roughly 10 billion years of the expanding universe or 9 billion. And then [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO4KKjNaxdg&t=798.0799999999999s)]
*  it seems to be accelerating. So who asked for that? Well, it was discovered by people who were [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO4KKjNaxdg&t=804.3199999999999s)]
*  planning to measure the deceleration and there's something wrong here. So they got a Nobel Prize [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO4KKjNaxdg&t=810.96s)]
*  for discovering the acceleration. It's going faster and faster every year, which means that [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO4KKjNaxdg&t=817.0400000000001s)]
*  if you were to come back in another say 100 billion years, most of the galaxies that we know about [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO4KKjNaxdg&t=822.48s)]
*  would have receded from us so far away that we couldn't see them anymore. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO4KKjNaxdg&t=828.4000000000001s)]
*  So the universe will be in a process of appearing to empty itself out. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO4KKjNaxdg&t=832.72s)]
*  And if you imagine going far enough into the future with just one Milky Way left, [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO4KKjNaxdg&t=837.36s)]
*  all the other galaxies are gone. The evidence of the history of the universe might have disappeared [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO4KKjNaxdg&t=842.88s)]
*  from science. Oh, that's fascinating. Just to confirm though, you're saying it still exists, [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO4KKjNaxdg&t=848.48s)]
*  it would just be so far away that we can't detect it. Yeah, too far away to see it. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO4KKjNaxdg&t=853.28s)]
*  So anyway, we are here at this particularly interesting time where we still have evidence [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO4KKjNaxdg&t=858.16s)]
*  and control, write the story and tell ourselves how did we get here from something. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO4KKjNaxdg&t=862.88s)]
*  What comes before the Big Bang? That's kind of like what our, at least my brain was coming to [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO4KKjNaxdg&t=868.32s)]
*  as well, right? There's, there is the Big Bang and then you have all of this matter expanding, [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO4KKjNaxdg&t=872.48s)]
*  creating galaxies, et cetera. But like, I don't, it's hard for me to wrap my brain around this idea [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO4KKjNaxdg&t=879.36s)]
*  of what comes before it. Yeah, well, maybe that's because maybe there isn't anything before it. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO4KKjNaxdg&t=884.1600000000001s)]
*  So the way I think about it is sort of from the observer's perspective, [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO4KKjNaxdg&t=889.2s)]
*  because what we see today is distant galaxies running away from us. And we see the cosmic [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO4KKjNaxdg&t=893.2800000000001s)]
*  microwave radiation that tells us what it was like when it was young. And we imagine running [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO4KKjNaxdg&t=897.2s)]
*  it backwards in our minds. Yes, like a play button, literally like. Run the play button backwards. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO4KKjNaxdg&t=902.24s)]
*  So the galaxies go crushing together, the stars are ripped apart, the temperature goes up and up. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO4KKjNaxdg&t=907.76s)]
*  Eventually the atoms are ripped apart, even the protons and neutrons are ripped apart and [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO4KKjNaxdg&t=914.5600000000001s)]
*  separated into quarks. And then we picture this soup of quarks and leptons, they're called. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO4KKjNaxdg&t=918.8s)]
*  And then we say, well, what came before that? And so we have a guess, we have a guess that [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO4KKjNaxdg&t=926.8s)]
*  there's something called an inflation field, a purely conceptual quantum mechanical idea. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO4KKjNaxdg&t=932.16s)]
*  And we say, if this could happen in this particular way, then it would produce the expanding universe [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO4KKjNaxdg&t=938.4799999999999s)]
*  that we have today. And so it seems to hold up in the sense that there are a few predictions [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO4KKjNaxdg&t=944.0s)]
*  that it makes that we verified by observation of the cosmic background radiation. So when this was [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO4KKjNaxdg&t=949.76s)]
*  first proposed, I thought, well, that'll never work. We'd never know. But there is a little bit [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO4KKjNaxdg&t=956.4s)]
*  of evidence that this cosmic inflation story could be correct. So, but it's still pretty much of a [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO4KKjNaxdg&t=960.9599999999999s)]
*  guess. So then you say, well, what could come before that? And what does the theory predict? [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO4KKjNaxdg&t=966.8s)]
*  So the theory predicts maybe there could be other universes erupting out of this inflation field. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO4KKjNaxdg&t=973.92s)]
*  And we would never know they were existing. There could be billions or trillions or an infinite [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO4KKjNaxdg&t=982.4s)]
*  number of other universes, according to this idea. And we'd never know. But because this is so much [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO4KKjNaxdg&t=988.08s)]
*  of a guess, we honestly can't tell you what came before that. And then we get to what about quantum [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO4KKjNaxdg&t=994.72s)]
*  gravity, which we touched on very briefly. If quantum mechanics should apply to space and time [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO4KKjNaxdg&t=1001.76s)]
*  themselves, then what happens if time and space don't mean what they seem to mean anymore? [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO4KKjNaxdg&t=1009.12s)]
*  And then kind of all bets are off. That means we are completely confused. We have no successful [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO4KKjNaxdg&t=1017.04s)]
*  theoretical predictions based on that idea of quantum gravity. Doesn't mean there isn't any, [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO4KKjNaxdg&t=1024.48s)]
*  but then it gets into all the wonderful questions about wormholes and quantum entanglement and the [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO4KKjNaxdg&t=1031.36s)]
*  other mysteries of modern science and engineering. Oh, boy. My cosmic dust brain is... [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO4KKjNaxdg&t=1039.36s)]
*  Yeah, my cosmic dust brain is not able to do that either. But somebody will be working on it, [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO4KKjNaxdg&t=1046.24s)]
*  and some people are working on it. And we might get some breakthroughs. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO4KKjNaxdg&t=1052.0s)]
