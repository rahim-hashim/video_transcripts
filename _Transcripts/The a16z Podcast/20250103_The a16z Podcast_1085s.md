Video Description: Over the last year, governments have started securing GPUs and building critical infrastructure as they grapple with AI’s role as a foundational, general-purpose technology.

In this episode, Anjney Midha, General Partner at a16z, explores the concept of infrastructure independence and sovereign AI—how nations are navigating decisions to build, buy, or collaborate on AI capabilities. From compute deserts to hypercenters, Anjney examines how factors like energy, data, and regulation shape sovereignty, drawing parallels to historical technological adoption and highlighting the rise of technical founders solving complex, global infrastructure challenges.

# AI Is Becoming a Regional Race
**The a16z Podcast:** [January 03, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEksqAk3yrQ)
*  Are we going to welcome this technology or are we going to be hostile to its development? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEksqAk3yrQ&t=0.0s)]
*  AI is already percolated throughout society at one of the fastest diffusion rates of any [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEksqAk3yrQ&t=4.5600000000000005s)]
*  general purpose technology. And so now the question everybody's asking is, do we build or buy? [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEksqAk3yrQ&t=9.28s)]
*  My big idea is infrastructure independence. And it's the idea that a lot of countries and regions [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEksqAk3yrQ&t=16.080000000000002s)]
*  are starting to realize that modern AI, deep learning based AI, generative models, are a form [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEksqAk3yrQ&t=22.56s)]
*  of what have been called general purpose technologies. In the history of humanity, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEksqAk3yrQ&t=28.8s)]
*  we've only had maybe 20 or 22 or so general purpose technologies, like electricity, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEksqAk3yrQ&t=35.6s)]
*  the printing press, that have very broad based applications in society. They end up being [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEksqAk3yrQ&t=41.68s)]
*  largely horizontal economic multipliers and progress multipliers across a whole set of [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEksqAk3yrQ&t=47.84s)]
*  pillars and domains in society. There are usually two moments in the adoption of a [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEksqAk3yrQ&t=54.0s)]
*  general purpose technology where first, countries, nation states start asking, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEksqAk3yrQ&t=58.4s)]
*  are we going to welcome this technology or are we going to be hostile to its development? [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEksqAk3yrQ&t=62.72s)]
*  Okay. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEksqAk3yrQ&t=67.52s)]
*  And that's the first step that becomes pretty important in a country's progression. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEksqAk3yrQ&t=68.08s)]
*  Do we allow this in, regardless of whether we own it? [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEksqAk3yrQ&t=71.84s)]
*  Do we embrace it or not? [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEksqAk3yrQ&t=74.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEksqAk3yrQ&t=74.96000000000001s)]
*  And then the second is, do we build or buy? [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEksqAk3yrQ&t=75.44s)]
*  Right. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEksqAk3yrQ&t=78.72s)]
*  Right. Which is, can we trust somebody else to provide it for us? [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEksqAk3yrQ&t=79.28s)]
*  Well, well past the stage of, do we embrace it or not? Billions of people around the world now, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEksqAk3yrQ&t=84.16s)]
*  having already embraced it. So the governments don't really have a choice, so to speak. So in [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEksqAk3yrQ&t=88.08s)]
*  a sense, AI is already percolated throughout society at one of the fastest diffusion rates [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEksqAk3yrQ&t=92.48s)]
*  of any general purpose technology. And so now the question everybody's asking is, do we build or buy? [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEksqAk3yrQ&t=97.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEksqAk3yrQ&t=101.92s)]
*  It's the single largest probably purchasing decision that's going to happen in the next 24 months, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEksqAk3yrQ&t=102.0s)]
*  is do nation states start buying it? [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEksqAk3yrQ&t=108.08s)]
*  Do they build or buy? [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEksqAk3yrQ&t=111.36s)]
*  Do they build or buy? [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEksqAk3yrQ&t=112.16s)]
*  I love the parallel of companies because there are many companies that do choose to build, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEksqAk3yrQ&t=112.88s)]
*  but also companies that choose to rent or buy. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEksqAk3yrQ&t=116.64s)]
*  Right. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEksqAk3yrQ&t=119.19999999999999s)]
*  And so as you think about that, there's large nations around the world, like the United States, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEksqAk3yrQ&t=119.67999999999999s)]
*  which are clearly building. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEksqAk3yrQ&t=125.44s)]
*  Right. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEksqAk3yrQ&t=126.56s)]
*  But talk about the argument for smaller nations or the 190 plus. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEksqAk3yrQ&t=127.03999999999999s)]
*  The good news here is that we've got hundreds of years of human history to look at for clues [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEksqAk3yrQ&t=133.2s)]
*  about what happens next. If you're a small country and you were in the early 1900s, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEksqAk3yrQ&t=139.6s)]
*  you were watching the modern electrification of the developed world. If you kind of chart what [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEksqAk3yrQ&t=146.72s)]
*  happened with many of those countries, many of them decided to actually enter into what [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEksqAk3yrQ&t=152.95999999999998s)]
*  were called joint venture agreements. So it starts with a joint venture with a country that's at the [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEksqAk3yrQ&t=156.56s)]
*  frontier. These countries at the frontier of AI is what I call hyper centers. These are countries [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEksqAk3yrQ&t=160.95999999999998s)]
*  that have the ability to develop, train, build, and host their own frontier models. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEksqAk3yrQ&t=165.36s)]
*  I call them hyper centers mostly as an homage to the word hyper scalar. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEksqAk3yrQ&t=171.36s)]
*  Which is that there have been a handful of companies that have had the compute and the talent [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEksqAk3yrQ&t=174.96s)]
*  to actually build frontier AI. And now what we're seeing is a shift from just those companies [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEksqAk3yrQ&t=178.8s)]
*  driving a bunch of frontier AI to countries and regions driving it. And so if you're a small [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEksqAk3yrQ&t=184.8s)]
*  country and you're going, well, we certainly believe that it's important to have our own AI [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEksqAk3yrQ&t=189.52s)]
*  infrastructure. We want to be independent, but we don't have all the compute required to train [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEksqAk3yrQ&t=196.96s)]
*  these models or we don't have all the talent locally. Then what you enter into is a joint [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEksqAk3yrQ&t=202.48000000000002s)]
*  venture with a country or an overseas partner that matches your values. And this is the really [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEksqAk3yrQ&t=205.44s)]
*  important thing about AI models and how they're different from infrastructure like electricity [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEksqAk3yrQ&t=212.48000000000002s)]
*  is there's a fundamental encoding of human values in AI models because they're trained on data. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEksqAk3yrQ&t=216.72s)]
*  And the data has these local norms and cultural values embedded in the data. And so if you happen [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEksqAk3yrQ&t=222.4s)]
*  to train a model on a bunch of internet data collected in the US, the models are just generally- [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEksqAk3yrQ&t=229.2s)]
*  American. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEksqAk3yrQ&t=235.28s)]
*  American. They're encoded with that. And if you're trained the models on data in France, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEksqAk3yrQ&t=236.56s)]
*  they actually subtly have a bunch of different values encoded in the models that reflect those [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEksqAk3yrQ&t=243.6s)]
*  cultural norms. And so I think step number one, if you're a small country is actually being a little [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEksqAk3yrQ&t=248.64s)]
*  bit crystal clear about which value systems you align with most out of the hyper centers. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEksqAk3yrQ&t=253.44s)]
*  The way the internet worked out was there essentially ended up being two internets, [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEksqAk3yrQ&t=259.12s)]
*  the Chinese internet and the rest of the world. AI may not end up looking that different. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEksqAk3yrQ&t=262.88s)]
*  And if you're a small country, what you really have to figure out is whose values align [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEksqAk3yrQ&t=268.8s)]
*  more with yours. A good historical precedent to look at here is the technology of money. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEksqAk3yrQ&t=272.72s)]
*  Money is a pretty general purpose technology. And what happened in the early 1900s with the [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEksqAk3yrQ&t=277.84000000000003s)]
*  modernization of finance is a number of countries started to ask the same question is, [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEksqAk3yrQ&t=283.12s)]
*  do we build or buy our own currency? Do we rely on the dollar or do we have our own currency? [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEksqAk3yrQ&t=287.6s)]
*  And that led to the modern day currency regime where the dollar is a single global reserve [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEksqAk3yrQ&t=293.68s)]
*  currency. And that happened through a bunch of allied cooperation, where a number of countries [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEksqAk3yrQ&t=298.40000000000003s)]
*  realized they did not have the local resources required to hold the peg of gold to the dollar. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEksqAk3yrQ&t=302.64s)]
*  And so you have the US, you have China, you have India, and then you have a number of smaller [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEksqAk3yrQ&t=311.52s)]
*  countries that decided they wanted to be flow points. So you have Singapore and Ireland, [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEksqAk3yrQ&t=317.52s)]
*  and you have Luxembourg and Zurich that become massive global leaders in modern finance, [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEksqAk3yrQ&t=322.8s)]
*  because they decide they want to ally with one of those power centers. So if you think about in the [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEksqAk3yrQ&t=329.2s)]
*  AI world, let's call regions at the frontier hyper centers. And then we have compute deserts. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEksqAk3yrQ&t=334.8s)]
*  And these are places that have literally no install base of compute capacity to even be relevant. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEksqAk3yrQ&t=340.56s)]
*  All the smaller folks have to figure out which of the hyper centers they want to align with. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEksqAk3yrQ&t=345.76s)]
*  And how do you become a modern day Singapore, Ireland, Luxembourg, etc. for the world of AI [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEksqAk3yrQ&t=349.84000000000003s)]
*  infrastructure? It starts with deciding whether you want to be a compute desert or not. And if [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEksqAk3yrQ&t=355.76s)]
*  you're not, and you're going to actually embrace AI infrastructure as a government, then I think [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEksqAk3yrQ&t=360.64s)]
*  you've got to figure out which hyper center you want to align with most. And then it becomes [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEksqAk3yrQ&t=365.28000000000003s)]
*  actually quite easy to reason about how to be a valuable ally. That's such a good parallel, [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEksqAk3yrQ&t=369.28000000000003s)]
*  because a lot of people think about resources in terms of like the farmland that you have, [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEksqAk3yrQ&t=375.12s)]
*  the people who are working in that economy. But what you're pointing out is that countries [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEksqAk3yrQ&t=378.8s)]
*  for a long time have offered value or offered a resource in other ways. And as we think about AI, [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEksqAk3yrQ&t=382.96000000000004s)]
*  there's a few things that you've pointed out that countries can invest in, whether it's the compute [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEksqAk3yrQ&t=388.32s)]
*  capacity that they have, the energy resources to power AI, and then again, forward thinking policy. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEksqAk3yrQ&t=392.16s)]
*  So maybe we can break down each of those. How do you think about each of those blocks and how [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEksqAk3yrQ&t=397.76s)]
*  countries should be maybe maneuvering or investing in those things? The good news is that there's [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEksqAk3yrQ&t=401.92s)]
*  only three or four ingredients here that really matter. The first is compute, which we've talked [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEksqAk3yrQ&t=406.24s)]
*  about. The second is abundant and low cost energy, which powers the data centers. The third is data, [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEksqAk3yrQ&t=410.24s)]
*  just the availability of really high quality tokens for these models to learn on. And the [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEksqAk3yrQ&t=416.32s)]
*  fourth is regulation. So that's the good news. Now, the bad news is that world is pretty [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEksqAk3yrQ&t=421.04s)]
*  unevenly split up. Some countries just have dramatically more compute than others. Others [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEksqAk3yrQ&t=425.68s)]
*  have dramatically more energy than others because of their natural reserves. So if you are in the [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEksqAk3yrQ&t=430.8s)]
*  Middle East, you may not have massive data centers yet, but what you do have is vast, [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEksqAk3yrQ&t=437.04s)]
*  vast reserves of oil. And how you translate that into becoming a hyper center, it's the law of [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEksqAk3yrQ&t=443.12s)]
*  comparative advantage. You've got energy. You should use that to attract the world's best [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEksqAk3yrQ&t=452.08000000000004s)]
*  teams and companies and foundation model labs and so on by trading what you have with what they have. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEksqAk3yrQ&t=457.44s)]
*  And so I'm quite bullish on allied ties between countries that recognize what their strengths are [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEksqAk3yrQ&t=465.28000000000003s)]
*  and then partner with other countries to fill that gap. And by countries, I mean private companies [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEksqAk3yrQ&t=476.88s)]
*  too from other countries. One of the things we may end up seeing is jointly trained models [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEksqAk3yrQ&t=481.92s)]
*  between countries. For most countries, it's impossible to have total infrastructure independence [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEksqAk3yrQ&t=486.64000000000004s)]
*  at all parts of the stack. What is much more feasible is to be great at one part of the stack [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEksqAk3yrQ&t=491.76s)]
*  and then collaborate with another sovereign or another country or region to achieve joint [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEksqAk3yrQ&t=497.04s)]
*  independence from a value system that you don't subscribe to. Now, in the long term, you might be [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEksqAk3yrQ&t=502.48s)]
*  able to build things out, but with infrastructure, especially of this kind, it can often take years, [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEksqAk3yrQ&t=507.36s)]
*  if not a decade long scale. So as an example, lower down in the stack from the model layer, [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEksqAk3yrQ&t=512.96s)]
*  you have the chip layer. And even below that, you have the lithography layer. There's a company in [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEksqAk3yrQ&t=518.4s)]
*  Holland called ASML that builds literally the world's most important machines. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEksqAk3yrQ&t=524.72s)]
*  How many machines do they make per year? It's some very small number, right? [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEksqAk3yrQ&t=529.2s)]
*  Each machine costs about $200 million. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEksqAk3yrQ&t=533.36s)]
*  Yeah. And they're the only company that can actually make- [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEksqAk3yrQ&t=534.96s)]
*  They're the only company that can do EUV lithography of this precision, right? Now, [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEksqAk3yrQ&t=536.64s)]
*  is it feasible for the US to say we're going to build our own ASML like tomorrow? No. I mean, [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEksqAk3yrQ&t=541.28s)]
*  it's just going to take like 10 plus years, right? EUV lithography just takes a really long time. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEksqAk3yrQ&t=546.24s)]
*  On the other hand, is it feasible for a smaller country to say we're going to train our own local [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEksqAk3yrQ&t=551.04s)]
*  models at the frontier? That's a little bit easier to do over a month, like the quarters of time [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEksqAk3yrQ&t=556.0s)]
*  scale. If you've got a leading research team- If. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEksqAk3yrQ&t=562.48s)]
*  If. And that's a big if, right? There's only a handful really of research teams globally that [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEksqAk3yrQ&t=566.08s)]
*  are capable of this. And so to answer your question, yes, I don't think sovereign AI or [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEksqAk3yrQ&t=570.4s)]
*  infrastructure independence means you have 100% ownership over every part of the stack that's [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEksqAk3yrQ&t=575.28s)]
*  infeasible over the short term. It means that you don't rely on somebody for a critical part [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEksqAk3yrQ&t=580.32s)]
*  that you don't trust. Right. Can we talk about private [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEksqAk3yrQ&t=586.32s)]
*  companies for a second? Because you've brought them up a few times. How do you think about [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEksqAk3yrQ&t=589.6s)]
*  that dynamic where as a nation state, you're saying, okay, you need this sovereignty. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEksqAk3yrQ&t=594.0s)]
*  Right. But at the same time, [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEksqAk3yrQ&t=599.12s)]
*  can you rely on that sovereignty through the companies that exist within your nation, for [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEksqAk3yrQ&t=600.16s)]
*  example, like just using America as an example? Right. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEksqAk3yrQ&t=604.4s)]
*  Does the government really need to be involved or can they just let Anthropic or OpenAI kind of [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEksqAk3yrQ&t=607.52s)]
*  command that part of the stack? Or how do you think about the difference between government versus [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEksqAk3yrQ&t=612.32s)]
*  private enterprise? The line is pretty stark in a few countries and it's more blurry in others. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEksqAk3yrQ&t=617.6s)]
*  So in China, the line is very clear. There's a law called the PRC 2017 National Intelligence Law [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEksqAk3yrQ&t=626.16s)]
*  that says Chinese individuals and entities are required to support PRC national intelligence [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEksqAk3yrQ&t=631.6800000000001s)]
*  work by law, which means if there's any technology that a PRC company has access to, [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEksqAk3yrQ&t=638.48s)]
*  they are automatically obliged to make that available to the government. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEksqAk3yrQ&t=647.04s)]
*  And that's not the case in the United States. Right. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEksqAk3yrQ&t=651.04s)]
*  There are some covered types of technology, like dual use technology, like classified defense [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEksqAk3yrQ&t=653.12s)]
*  technology, where if you are developing it, particularly if you're funded under a defense [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEksqAk3yrQ&t=658.8s)]
*  program, then you're required to make that available to government because the government's [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEksqAk3yrQ&t=662.9599999999999s)]
*  paying for the development of that technology. Right. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEksqAk3yrQ&t=666.64s)]
*  But by and large, the private sector in the United States and most other allied countries [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEksqAk3yrQ&t=668.3199999999999s)]
*  is by default protected from having to make its technology available to the government. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEksqAk3yrQ&t=672.64s)]
*  It's not the case in the CCP. So I think that the question becomes for most countries is where on [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEksqAk3yrQ&t=677.28s)]
*  that spectrum do you want to exist? Every country approaches it slightly differently, but the five [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEksqAk3yrQ&t=683.68s)]
*  I's, the US, Canada, UK, Australia, New Zealand, we generally have sort of a joint approach, [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEksqAk3yrQ&t=689.12s)]
*  framework to categorizing this infrastructure. And by and large, AI models have not [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEksqAk3yrQ&t=696.0s)]
*  been, have not been categorized as being dual use or protected under national security. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEksqAk3yrQ&t=701.6800000000001s)]
*  The history of technology has largely shown that if you'd like to win, then unlocking the best [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEksqAk3yrQ&t=708.0s)]
*  talents of a country with as few bureaucratic slowdowns usually ends up winning. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEksqAk3yrQ&t=716.88s)]
*  Well, if we think about wanting to keep America at the frontier and we think about the different [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEksqAk3yrQ&t=724.24s)]
*  layers or ingredients that we talked about earlier, are there any high risk areas that we think [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEksqAk3yrQ&t=729.6800000000001s)]
*  or that you think we're falling behind? It could be in the energy department, it could be at the [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEksqAk3yrQ&t=735.44s)]
*  model layer, it could be the fact that we're dependent on ASML, you know, go down the line. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEksqAk3yrQ&t=739.44s)]
*  Is there anywhere that you think that we're high risk at, again, not keeping our edge? [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEksqAk3yrQ&t=744.8000000000001s)]
*  I think we go back to the four ingredients we talked about earlier, right, of the frontier of AI, [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEksqAk3yrQ&t=749.76s)]
*  which is compute, data, energy, and laws. Now, on the compute front, I think the private market [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEksqAk3yrQ&t=754.0s)]
*  in the United States is doing a pretty good job. You know, it's pretty responsive to market demand. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEksqAk3yrQ&t=760.16s)]
*  And I think there's no coincidence that the largest infrastructure businesses in the United [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEksqAk3yrQ&t=765.44s)]
*  States are chip companies and computing companies, because I think we've generally done a pretty good [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEksqAk3yrQ&t=770.32s)]
*  job of letting the market feed that demand. I think on the data side, things are extraordinarily [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEksqAk3yrQ&t=775.52s)]
*  tough. Because one, the Biden executive order last year was a starting gun that said, oh, AI is [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEksqAk3yrQ&t=783.6s)]
*  important, please do something about it, and left it to the states to figure it out. And the states [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEksqAk3yrQ&t=793.0400000000001s)]
*  have all taken a complete patchwork of approaches to data regulation. In 2024 alone, I think there [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEksqAk3yrQ&t=798.64s)]
*  were more than 700 pieces of state level legislation that were AI specific. And a bunch of those laws, [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEksqAk3yrQ&t=805.0400000000001s)]
*  if you look at it, are really well-intentioned, but atrociously implemented ideas for data [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEksqAk3yrQ&t=810.48s)]
*  regulation. Right, and impossible to adhere to. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEksqAk3yrQ&t=817.44s)]
*  Basically impossible to adhere to. And so I think one area where we are just handicapping ourselves [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEksqAk3yrQ&t=819.36s)]
*  is that there's no unified framework in the United States at the federal level yet [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEksqAk3yrQ&t=826.08s)]
*  for data, especially around training. And I think we needed that yesterday. Overseas, [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEksqAk3yrQ&t=830.24s)]
*  in a number of countries where rule of law, especially on copyright and IP and so on, [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEksqAk3yrQ&t=836.72s)]
*  is just less stringent. Those labs are happy to just race ahead. Whereas our companies here are [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEksqAk3yrQ&t=841.84s)]
*  trying to figure out what they should even comply with. And that greater hurts you more than actually [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEksqAk3yrQ&t=848.8000000000001s)]
*  a laissez-faire approach. I think our companies would be totally fine. The best founders at the [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEksqAk3yrQ&t=853.36s)]
*  frontier would be fine in the United States being compliant. They just want to be told what to comply [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEksqAk3yrQ&t=858.48s)]
*  with. Not across 50 different states [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEksqAk3yrQ&t=863.2s)]
*  and different regulations that are changing and unclear and in some cases impossible. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEksqAk3yrQ&t=864.24s)]
*  Right. There's also the fundamental scientific problem that they're just very real data walls [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEksqAk3yrQ&t=868.4s)]
*  that these models run into. One of the things that hurts frontier research in the United States and [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEksqAk3yrQ&t=873.28s)]
*  allied countries is a lack of government support in collaborating across borders to make more [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEksqAk3yrQ&t=878.48s)]
*  data available to allied regions. On energy, I think we've obviously hamstrung ourselves in [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEksqAk3yrQ&t=884.88s)]
*  the United States with nuclear. France, for example, embraced nuclear 20 years ago, [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEksqAk3yrQ&t=889.68s)]
*  has positioned them to have extraordinarily efficient data centers today. Whereas in the [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEksqAk3yrQ&t=893.84s)]
*  United States, I think we've basically shot ourselves in the foot around that. And then [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEksqAk3yrQ&t=897.9200000000001s)]
*  lastly, I think around inference regulation, what we're not doing enough of is making it clear who [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEksqAk3yrQ&t=901.36s)]
*  the liability rests on. I've seen a number of proposals ahead of legislative sessions next year [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEksqAk3yrQ&t=908.32s)]
*  that want to hold model developers liable for the outputs of the inference, even if the misuse is [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEksqAk3yrQ&t=914.64s)]
*  being done by somebody else. And what does that do that drives those very important developers [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEksqAk3yrQ&t=924.72s)]
*  elsewhere? Essentially forces most startups to lose much needed ground to big tech companies [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEksqAk3yrQ&t=929.28s)]
*  and that entrenches incumbents more. I mean, this idea really is truly global. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEksqAk3yrQ&t=936.88s)]
*  Right. What are you looking out for [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEksqAk3yrQ&t=942.56s)]
*  or what should maybe, let's say, a legislator or let's say, the head of a nation, what should [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEksqAk3yrQ&t=944.16s)]
*  they be thinking about and what are you looking out for in some of those decisions? Are you looking [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEksqAk3yrQ&t=948.9599999999999s)]
*  for countries that are buying GPUs or building out new energy centers? What are you paying [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEksqAk3yrQ&t=952.88s)]
*  attention to? The leading indicators definitely compute. If you think about the AI supply chain, [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEksqAk3yrQ&t=958.0s)]
*  the first mile starts at the data center. That's the new atomic unit of sovereignty, I would say, [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEksqAk3yrQ&t=962.64s)]
*  which is a new thing. We've never actually had nation states think about atomic units of an AI [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEksqAk3yrQ&t=967.36s)]
*  data center as a thing that countries should be purchasing. And I think about 24 months ago, [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEksqAk3yrQ&t=972.24s)]
*  we started seeing nations reason about that first mile as being important. So you've had an enormous [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEksqAk3yrQ&t=978.72s)]
*  amount of Nvidia's purchasing orders come from the balance sheet of governments. Just unprecedented [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEksqAk3yrQ&t=984.32s)]
*  demand they've been seeing from nation states realizing that they want to be hyper centers. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEksqAk3yrQ&t=990.24s)]
*  And that starts with them placing orders 12 to 36 months in advance to take delivery of GPUs, [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEksqAk3yrQ&t=995.52s)]
*  because if you don't get in front of that line, it's over. You're getting it after everybody else. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEksqAk3yrQ&t=1002.16s)]
*  The second thing I look for is founders who are deeply both technical, who often come from deep [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEksqAk3yrQ&t=1007.04s)]
*  research backgrounds and scientists who've led frontier model development already, often inside [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEksqAk3yrQ&t=1013.52s)]
*  of large hyperscaler labs. So an example is Arthur Mensch, who started Mistral. He worked at DeepMind [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEksqAk3yrQ&t=1019.4399999999999s)]
*  or Guillaume Lamp, who led the initial Lama family at Metta, who are deeply mission led and believe [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEksqAk3yrQ&t=1024.6399999999999s)]
*  that they can help solve a bunch of these infrastructure problems for the world's largest [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEksqAk3yrQ&t=1031.12s)]
*  governments. So there's a new class of founder who's both primarily technical and has their [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEksqAk3yrQ&t=1034.7199999999998s)]
*  training in academia, but is motivated to solve all the really hard problems that come with having [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEksqAk3yrQ&t=1040.08s)]
*  to deliver, solve a bunch of these infrastructure problems for really large nation states and regions. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEksqAk3yrQ&t=1045.76s)]
*  If you're a founder like that who has the guts, then your impact on humanity ends up being quite generational. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEksqAk3yrQ&t=1052.7199999999998s)]
