# The Algorithms Behind Self-Driving Vehicles
**The a16z Podcast:** [October 20, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67zkBl4g_0Q)
*  So this is my first time in a fully autonomous vehicle, but I've seen them around my area. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67zkBl4g_0Q&t=0.0s)]
*  They're driving around, I see no driver, but I also see the swirly thing on top. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67zkBl4g_0Q&t=8.36s)]
*  I see a bunch of different kind of appendages to the car. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67zkBl4g_0Q&t=12.8s)]
*  So maybe you could just break that down. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67zkBl4g_0Q&t=16.4s)]
*  Like what is happening? [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67zkBl4g_0Q&t=17.96s)]
*  How is all this technology coming together? [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67zkBl4g_0Q&t=19.6s)]
*  And what are the bits and pieces that you've added onto the car that allow it to be autonomous? [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67zkBl4g_0Q&t=21.400000000000002s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67zkBl4g_0Q&t=26.6s)]
*  So fundamentally you can think of it like, is the car aware of what's happening around it? [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67zkBl4g_0Q&t=28.200000000000003s)]
*  And then can it anticipate what the things around it are going to do? [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67zkBl4g_0Q&t=33.6s)]
*  And then reasoning on what it should do next. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67zkBl4g_0Q&t=38.2s)]
*  These are sort of the three components. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67zkBl4g_0Q&t=41.400000000000006s)]
*  In perceiving what's around us, this car with those appendages, as you mentioned, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67zkBl4g_0Q&t=43.0s)]
*  can see three football fields away, 360 degree, and it's getting a snapshot multiple times a second. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67zkBl4g_0Q&t=48.6s)]
*  And it's relying on a combination of the state of the art laser, camera, radars, all strategically positioned. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67zkBl4g_0Q&t=56.2s)]
*  So to give you an idea, lasers give you a very precise understanding of everything around you. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67zkBl4g_0Q&t=64.8s)]
*  It's the smallest detail. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67zkBl4g_0Q&t=69.4s)]
*  So if there was a child, you know, an inch out of this pole, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67zkBl4g_0Q&t=70.8s)]
*  it would be able to mark, oh, this is a demarcated child away from that pole. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67zkBl4g_0Q&t=75.0s)]
*  It will get to see that. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67zkBl4g_0Q&t=80.0s)]
*  The cameras are needed to distinguish between the red light and the green light. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67zkBl4g_0Q&t=81.8s)]
*  And the radars can almost see around corners, even when the laser and the camera or our human eyes can't, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67zkBl4g_0Q&t=86.6s)]
*  because they can sense objects coming in. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67zkBl4g_0Q&t=93.0s)]
*  And so we took an approach that we want to combine the best strengths of each of these modalities [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67zkBl4g_0Q&t=95.6s)]
*  to create the best picture of what you can see around the world, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67zkBl4g_0Q&t=102.2s)]
*  that you're just incredibly better than a human possibly could, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67zkBl4g_0Q&t=105.6s)]
*  both due to the attention span, the range, the fidelity, and the combination of these sensors coming together. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67zkBl4g_0Q&t=109.6s)]
*  The rivalry in self-driving is LiDAR versus, you know, Tesla Vision or the video processing. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67zkBl4g_0Q&t=115.39999999999999s)]
*  How has Waymo thought about that decision of what, you know, some people pose it as expensive hardware, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67zkBl4g_0Q&t=120.8s)]
*  more simple software, because you have so much fidelity from LiDAR, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67zkBl4g_0Q&t=126.8s)]
*  versus a bunch of cameras and just like a lot heavier processing? [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67zkBl4g_0Q&t=130.2s)]
*  Like, is there a future where maybe actually you don't need all of the same sensing systems? [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67zkBl4g_0Q&t=134.6s)]
*  You know, personally, I have found the LiDAR and video debate almost takes like an ideological sense. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67zkBl4g_0Q&t=139.4s)]
*  You know, for hard problems, the innovation arc that we're talking about, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67zkBl4g_0Q&t=145.8s)]
*  the best approach is taking a first principles approach, right? [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67zkBl4g_0Q&t=150.0s)]
*  Without, you know, neither love nor hate for a specific technology. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67zkBl4g_0Q&t=153.4s)]
*  That is a technology. It's a tool. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67zkBl4g_0Q&t=158.20000000000002s)]
*  And LiDAR clearly has strengths that a camera doesn't. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67zkBl4g_0Q&t=160.8s)]
*  For example, at nighttime, even the best cameras will have some challenges. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67zkBl4g_0Q&t=164.20000000000002s)]
*  And camera clearly has strengths that the LiDAR doesn't. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67zkBl4g_0Q&t=168.4s)]
*  And similarly, LiDAR has strengths that LiDARs and cameras don't. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67zkBl4g_0Q&t=171.20000000000002s)]
*  So saying you love LiDARs and hate cameras or vice versa is saying you love one wavelength versus the other wavelength, right? [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67zkBl4g_0Q&t=175.6s)]
*  It's not a fundamental thing. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67zkBl4g_0Q&t=183.4s)]
*  Okay. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67zkBl4g_0Q&t=185.20000000000002s)]
*  But there is a practical question. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67zkBl4g_0Q&t=186.0s)]
*  So clear on the first principles, does the combination of these sensors position you better than individual? [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67zkBl4g_0Q&t=188.20000000000002s)]
*  The answer is yes. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67zkBl4g_0Q&t=196.20000000000002s)]
*  We can show you that there are situations in which camera will be insufficient. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67zkBl4g_0Q&t=197.0s)]
*  Now the question is a practical economic one. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67zkBl4g_0Q&t=201.8s)]
*  Is your ability to bring this public good to a large number of individuals hindered by the fact that these things are expensive? [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67zkBl4g_0Q&t=203.8s)]
*  Yes. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67zkBl4g_0Q&t=210.6s)]
*  And LiDARs, you know, 20 years ago, if somebody told you that all these Toyota's or these cars are going to have radars, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67zkBl4g_0Q&t=211.4s)]
*  you'd be like, no, radars are expensive. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67zkBl4g_0Q&t=218.0s)]
*  Guess what? [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67zkBl4g_0Q&t=219.6s)]
*  Every single, you know, most cars have radars today. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67zkBl4g_0Q&t=220.2s)]
*  Cameras on cell phones were a novelty. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67zkBl4g_0Q&t=224.2s)]
*  You know, the old Nokia phones would have, you'd be like, oh, who needs a camera on a phone, right? [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67zkBl4g_0Q&t=227.39999999999998s)]
*  You may have, I'm sure now cell phones have better cameras than dedicated cameras of six years ago. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67zkBl4g_0Q&t=231.79999999999998s)]
*  LiDAR is going through the same transformation. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67zkBl4g_0Q&t=237.2s)]
*  Right now, the iPhones have LiDARs, right? [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67zkBl4g_0Q&t=239.79999999999998s)]
*  The amount we have been able to cost down these LiDARs in the last two years is incredible. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67zkBl4g_0Q&t=242.39999999999998s)]
*  Okay. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67zkBl4g_0Q&t=247.0s)]
*  So you're not concerned about that? [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67zkBl4g_0Q&t=247.39999999999998s)]
*  No. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67zkBl4g_0Q&t=248.79999999999998s)]
*  And we, you know, we had four or five years ago, we had that belief. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67zkBl4g_0Q&t=249.2s)]
*  Now we have that proof. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67zkBl4g_0Q&t=253.2s)]
