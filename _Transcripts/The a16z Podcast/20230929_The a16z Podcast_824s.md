# Solving Earthâ€™s Problems in Space
**The a16z Podcast:** [September 29, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bBStM7zcAU)
*  8 years. That is the time between President Kennedy's announcement of the Apollo Project [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bBStM7zcAU&t=0.0s)]
*  in 1961, and the first human footsteps on the moon. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bBStM7zcAU&t=5.6000000000000005s)]
*  And if that sounds like a long time, consider that Galileo invented the telescope in 1609. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bBStM7zcAU&t=19.2s)]
*  In the 400 plus years that humans have been analyzing the cosmos, it took just 8 for NASA [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bBStM7zcAU&t=24.9s)]
*  to figure out how to usher humans to the moon and back safely. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bBStM7zcAU&t=31.46s)]
*  That is a story of exponential growth. And it's also a comforting reminder that humankind [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bBStM7zcAU&t=35.7s)]
*  has a history of building inconceivable technologies and the audacity to pursue incredibly complex [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bBStM7zcAU&t=40.78s)]
*  problems. Plus, we can mobilize pretty quickly when we need to. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bBStM7zcAU&t=46.94s)]
*  If you have a digital key fob in your car, it's more powerful than what we sent to the [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bBStM7zcAU&t=51.14s)]
*  moon with the Apollo astronauts. So that tells you the power of exponential growth. You just [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bBStM7zcAU&t=54.7s)]
*  wait a long time and invest trillions of dollars and something will happen. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bBStM7zcAU&t=59.86s)]
*  So when we say, can we solve the engineering problems of little planet Earth? Can we manage [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bBStM7zcAU&t=64.74s)]
*  our climate? Can we manage our resources? Can we manage pollution? Well, yes, of course. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bBStM7zcAU&t=70.26s)]
*  The capabilities to manage also grow exponentially with time. And so when you say, oh, it can't [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bBStM7zcAU&t=75.74s)]
*  be done, it just means we don't know how it can be done. But if it's important enough, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bBStM7zcAU&t=81.66s)]
*  we will do it. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bBStM7zcAU&t=86.89999999999999s)]
*  In this video, we explore the secrets of space as part of a longer conversation I had with [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bBStM7zcAU&t=88.14s)]
*  astrophysicist John Mather, who's also a Nobel Prize winner for his work on the COBE [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bBStM7zcAU&t=93.25999999999999s)]
*  satellite and more recently a key figure in the James Webb Space Telescope project. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bBStM7zcAU&t=98.25999999999999s)]
*  Join in as we explore how the pursuit of space has led to very earthly innovations [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bBStM7zcAU&t=104.38s)]
*  like Lasik eye surgery or precision GPS. But also you'll get to hear John's takes on [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bBStM7zcAU&t=109.06s)]
*  the increasing distrust in science, investment in research and becoming a multi planetary [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bBStM7zcAU&t=114.38s)]
*  species. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bBStM7zcAU&t=120.3s)]
*  As a reminder, the content here is for informational purposes only, should not be taken as legal, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bBStM7zcAU&t=121.41999999999999s)]
*  business, tax or investment advice, or be used to evaluate any investment or security [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bBStM7zcAU&t=126.22s)]
*  is not directed at any investors or potential investors in any A16Z fund. For more details, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bBStM7zcAU&t=131.1s)]
*  please see A16Z.com slash disclosures. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bBStM7zcAU&t=136.5s)]
*  There is this question, are we alone? Where did we come from? But then there are also [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bBStM7zcAU&t=149.34s)]
*  all of these questions that impact maybe our day to day, right? Or us understanding what [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bBStM7zcAU&t=155.0s)]
*  is happening on Earth. And so maybe you could just speak to that, how some of this cosmic [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bBStM7zcAU&t=159.78s)]
*  exploration ultimately ladders back into what we understand about the things that we're [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bBStM7zcAU&t=164.7s)]
*  building engineering science on the ground. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bBStM7zcAU&t=169.5s)]
*  Oh, a few things. One general observation is that we NASA take on incredibly hard engineering [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bBStM7zcAU&t=172.3s)]
*  challenges like going to the moon with people or building this great telescope. And then [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bBStM7zcAU&t=178.82s)]
*  we say, yeah, we actually can design, build and cooperate to build something incredibly [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bBStM7zcAU&t=183.82s)]
*  hard and difficult and it can work. So it should give us reason for confidence and optimism [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bBStM7zcAU&t=188.54000000000002s)]
*  that when we take on other challenges like managing our own little planet, we can do [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bBStM7zcAU&t=194.06s)]
*  that. So we also, of course, at NASA, we take pictures of the planet. We watch little Earth [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bBStM7zcAU&t=199.26000000000002s)]
*  all the time. We have dozens and dozens of things looking down to map the circulation [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bBStM7zcAU&t=205.58s)]
*  of the oceans, the clouds and various atmospheric constituents like carbon dioxide. We see where [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bBStM7zcAU&t=211.62s)]
*  it comes from, methane, we see where it's being emitted from various sources on Earth. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bBStM7zcAU&t=218.3s)]
*  So we're providing the data that it takes to understand our little planet. And so then [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bBStM7zcAU&t=223.74s)]
*  some of the potential answers for how do we stabilize our planet and protect ourselves [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bBStM7zcAU&t=231.14000000000001s)]
*  might have pieces of technology from space also. Some people are working on, well, can [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bBStM7zcAU&t=235.58s)]
*  you generate electrical power and beam it down from space? Or can you block some sunlight [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bBStM7zcAU&t=240.70000000000002s)]
*  with something in space? So there are lots of creative ideas. Some of them might work. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bBStM7zcAU&t=246.9s)]
*  Another thing that sort of generally observe is that we have exponential growth of problems [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bBStM7zcAU&t=251.7s)]
*  and we exponential growth of capabilities. And exponential growth is something people [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bBStM7zcAU&t=257.58s)]
*  don't appreciate. It means that something gets bigger and bigger and bigger every now [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bBStM7zcAU&t=262.62s)]
*  and then like it used to be Moore's law about transistors. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bBStM7zcAU&t=268.26s)]
*  I was going to say, semiconductors is kind of the... [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bBStM7zcAU&t=271.98s)]
*  We knew that that just got bigger and better faster all the time. And people don't really [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bBStM7zcAU&t=273.42s)]
*  understand any of the details, but they just see that that happens. And so we start off [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bBStM7zcAU&t=279.14s)]
*  with that can't be done, that's impossible. Then somebody invents something and then somebody [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bBStM7zcAU&t=283.46s)]
*  wants some more. And gradually we invest our billions or trillions as it takes to because [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bBStM7zcAU&t=287.65999999999997s)]
*  there's a demand for it. And now we have a pocket computer that's far more powerful than [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bBStM7zcAU&t=293.82s)]
*  we could have going to the moon with on the Apollo. So as an example, somebody heard this [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bBStM7zcAU&t=298.74s)]
*  story, the key fob is for your car. If you have a digital key fob in your car, it's more [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bBStM7zcAU&t=305.26s)]
*  powerful than what we sent to the moon with the Apollo astronauts. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bBStM7zcAU&t=310.06s)]
*  Is it? Is that true? [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bBStM7zcAU&t=313.18s)]
*  Yeah, honest. So that tells you the power of exponential growth. You just wait a long [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bBStM7zcAU&t=315.09999999999997s)]
*  time and invest trillions of dollars and something will happen. So when we say, can we solve [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bBStM7zcAU&t=319.78s)]
*  the engineering problems of little planet Earth? Can we manage our climate? Can we manage [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bBStM7zcAU&t=326.22s)]
*  our resources? Can we manage pollution? Well, yes, of course. The capabilities to manage [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bBStM7zcAU&t=330.78000000000003s)]
*  also grow exponentially with time. And so when you say, oh, it can't be done, it just [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bBStM7zcAU&t=336.7s)]
*  means we don't know how it can be done. But if it's important enough, we will do it. I've [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bBStM7zcAU&t=342.26s)]
*  been to science fairs quite a few times to see what the young people are working on. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bBStM7zcAU&t=347.9s)]
*  And in the physics and engineering, there is a really large fraction of the kids are [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bBStM7zcAU&t=351.38s)]
*  working on batteries, energy supplies, pollution control and resource management. So kids are [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bBStM7zcAU&t=355.38s)]
*  already aware that that's where the opportunity is. And our world is actually sponsoring the [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bBStM7zcAU&t=361.82s)]
*  job. And when I was only like 10 or 15 years ago, that people were very confidently telling [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bBStM7zcAU&t=367.14s)]
*  us that electric everything was impossibly, either it's impossible or too expensive, or [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bBStM7zcAU&t=372.65999999999997s)]
*  it'll cost too much and we shouldn't do it. So it we don't know how to do it is not the [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bBStM7zcAU&t=378.17999999999995s)]
*  same as we're not going to do it. And don't and we don't know how to do it doesn't mean [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bBStM7zcAU&t=382.94s)]
*  we can't afford it. It just means we are lacking of imagination and patience. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bBStM7zcAU&t=387.94s)]
*  Do you think that there are any significant misconceptions about space? And that could be [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bBStM7zcAU&t=393.74s)]
*  in terms of what we've discovered, but it also could be perhaps the way people view our [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bBStM7zcAU&t=400.06s)]
*  investment into space and, you know, the development past our small little earth. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bBStM7zcAU&t=405.14s)]
*  Lots of possibilities. Well, I guess the number one misconception here that people have about [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bBStM7zcAU&t=412.38s)]
*  spaces that the Big Bang was a firecracker happening at a place in a pre existing space in [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bBStM7zcAU&t=416.74s)]
*  time. Okay. And so that's not about astronomy. See, we see the entire universe is expanding. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bBStM7zcAU&t=423.78000000000003s)]
*  It's probably infinite. So it's not a thing that happened at a place in time. It's the entire [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bBStM7zcAU&t=429.66s)]
*  thing happening all at once. Okay, so that's, you know, because Sir Fred Hoyle gave it that [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bBStM7zcAU&t=434.54s)]
*  name. We are instantly drawn to thinking of a firecracker, but that's not what it is. Okay, [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bBStM7zcAU&t=440.1s)]
*  so there's that one. Then there's the other question was, what good is space research for [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bBStM7zcAU&t=446.02000000000004s)]
*  mankind? It's exciting for young people. And we draw in new science and engineering people to [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bBStM7zcAU&t=450.78000000000003s)]
*  study these things, because it's exciting. And then they go on and solve all the other problems [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bBStM7zcAU&t=456.62s)]
*  of humanity. And some of it's also extremely practical. From space, we can see the earth and [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bBStM7zcAU&t=461.74s)]
*  study the earth and see what we're doing to it. Then of course, NASA, among other things we do is [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bBStM7zcAU&t=469.42s)]
*  we have extreme demand for extreme objects of engineering. So when we need something, we'll [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bBStM7zcAU&t=474.82s)]
*  invent it. And then it may have value elsewhere in our world. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bBStM7zcAU&t=482.18s)]
*  Yeah, and we've seen so many examples of this, right through especially in the in the first space [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bBStM7zcAU&t=486.90000000000003s)]
*  race, a lot of that technology was that applied. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bBStM7zcAU&t=491.3s)]
*  So and a lot of it's not directly traceable. But because we're doing these things, it happens. So [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bBStM7zcAU&t=493.62s)]
*  lovely story from the Webb telescope, the person who figured out how to measure the Webb [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bBStM7zcAU&t=499.58s)]
*  telescope mirrors while we were polishing them today to get them exactly right. He went on to [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bBStM7zcAU&t=503.94s)]
*  invent a technology that you see in your eye doctor's office, so they can see the back of your [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bBStM7zcAU&t=508.58s)]
*  eye much better. And even if you want to give you much better eyesight, you can get 2010 eyesight [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bBStM7zcAU&t=513.82s)]
*  from using this technology. We we learned some math and we learned some made some engineering and [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bBStM7zcAU&t=520.22s)]
*  now it's in many, many doctors offices. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bBStM7zcAU&t=525.94s)]
*  Yeah, well, I have to ask you, what do you think about this concept of us as humans as little, you [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bBStM7zcAU&t=528.66s)]
*  know, space dust, creatures becoming a multi planetary species and also just I mean, I'm uniquely [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bBStM7zcAU&t=534.9399999999999s)]
*  curious to hear your perspective because there's a level of grounding in the science in terms of, [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bBStM7zcAU&t=541.26s)]
*  you know, is it better to optimize what we have here on Earth? Or is it actually practical, worth [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bBStM7zcAU&t=546.14s)]
*  being ambitious and trying to make that a reality on these other planets? [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bBStM7zcAU&t=551.9s)]
*  My perspective is we are one a one planet species. This is it. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bBStM7zcAU&t=556.74s)]
*  Okay, fascinating. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bBStM7zcAU&t=560.3000000000001s)]
*  Little planet Earth is a beautiful planet. It's nice and warm here. There's air. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bBStM7zcAU&t=560.86s)]
*  And it's a nice feature. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bBStM7zcAU&t=565.14s)]
*  None of the other things we can possibly reach are anything like it. The moon has no air. The Mars [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bBStM7zcAU&t=566.46s)]
*  is cold and has a little bit of air, but you can't breathe it. And, and you can't go outside without [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bBStM7zcAU&t=572.1s)]
*  being bombarded with cosmic rays and you're going to die in a few years if you do that too much. So [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bBStM7zcAU&t=577.74s)]
*  just don't think that way. Earth is our home. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bBStM7zcAU&t=582.7s)]
*  Earth is our home. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bBStM7zcAU&t=585.9399999999999s)]
*  Take care of it. So there's a lot of wonderful imagination about going elsewhere, but there's no [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bBStM7zcAU&t=586.74s)]
*  obvious path to do it. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bBStM7zcAU&t=593.42s)]
*  Maybe one other question that relates to our wider world is this lack of trust or decrease in trust in [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bBStM7zcAU&t=595.14s)]
*  institutions over time. Some of those institutions are scientific institutions. And so I'm just [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bBStM7zcAU&t=602.02s)]
*  curious to hear your perspective on that. Just your, your pulse, your reaction almost to that. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bBStM7zcAU&t=607.7s)]
*  So one part of it is scientists have been discovering things that some people didn't want to [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bBStM7zcAU&t=613.3000000000001s)]
*  know. And so because what we're doing is so important, it matters to people's lives daily. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bBStM7zcAU&t=618.4200000000001s)]
*  There's a pushback because they don't want to know this information sometimes. So it's been going on [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bBStM7zcAU&t=627.1s)]
*  since Galileo, probably even before him. So the practical importance of what scientists and [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bBStM7zcAU&t=632.2199999999999s)]
*  engineering are doing is immense. And so we don't always like the result. So it's not so much that [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bBStM7zcAU&t=639.4599999999999s)]
*  we're against science as that we don't like what's happening. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bBStM7zcAU&t=645.62s)]
*  And if it's so important, how do you see the involvement of private versus public dollars going to that? [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bBStM7zcAU&t=648.3399999999999s)]
*  Or how would you think about that? [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bBStM7zcAU&t=654.26s)]
*  Well, the public dollars come because our representatives have decided it's important for the [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bBStM7zcAU&t=656.66s)]
*  whole country to do it. So sometimes it's for actual personal daily benefits, like health. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bBStM7zcAU&t=663.06s)]
*  Sometimes it's for prestige matters. The United States should be showing the world that we're great [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bBStM7zcAU&t=670.4599999999999s)]
*  leaders in the cause of freedom and science and democracy and so forth. So the Apollo program was an [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bBStM7zcAU&t=675.8199999999999s)]
*  example of that. Don't mess with us. We can do anything we like. And so it sort of worked. The Soviet [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bBStM7zcAU&t=681.78s)]
*  Union did not attack us. So there are a lot of different versions of why the public dollars are [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bBStM7zcAU&t=687.9s)]
*  spent. But I would say having been to visit the committee room for the House Committee on Science [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bBStM7zcAU&t=692.66s)]
*  and Technology, it's covered with space pictures. They love what we do at NASA and it's visible. The [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bBStM7zcAU&t=700.58s)]
*  public can see what we do. You can't make a pretty picture about a virus. But the viruses are [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bBStM7zcAU&t=707.54s)]
*  actually even more important. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bBStM7zcAU&t=714.42s)]
*  Well, for us on Earth. All right, well, let's close out on one more question, which is, you know, you [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bBStM7zcAU&t=716.8199999999999s)]
*  have been working in this industry for a very long time. And we'll see where longevity science goes. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bBStM7zcAU&t=722.18s)]
*  But if you did have, hypothetically, 100 more years to work on something, is there some big, ambitious [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bBStM7zcAU&t=727.38s)]
*  project that you would love to get your hands on? Is there something that you would really love to be a [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bBStM7zcAU&t=734.6600000000001s)]
*  part of yourself? [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bBStM7zcAU&t=739.98s)]
*  Well, I have some ideas of things I'm working on now. But they're probably not going to last 100 years. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bBStM7zcAU&t=741.34s)]
*  So the things that do look exciting 100 years from now, it could still be the dark matter and the dark [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bBStM7zcAU&t=746.4200000000001s)]
*  energy and the search for life elsewhere in my sort of territories. Here on Earth, I think we're going [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bBStM7zcAU&t=751.7s)]
*  to see astonishing growth in artificial intelligence. And it'll be a powerful tool and a [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bBStM7zcAU&t=758.26s)]
*  powerful weapon. And we'll have to get used to it because it's going to happen very quickly. And [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bBStM7zcAU&t=763.78s)]
*  it's not so long ago that really smart people were telling us it could never happen. And now [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bBStM7zcAU&t=769.3s)]
*  And here we are. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bBStM7zcAU&t=774.74s)]
*  smart people are telling us, oh my god, I'm scared to death. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bBStM7zcAU&t=775.4599999999999s)]
*  Well, you said yesterday, another great quote was basically, while we're busy worrying, technology [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bBStM7zcAU&t=778.74s)]
*  advances. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bBStM7zcAU&t=784.5s)]
*  Yeah, it really does. And if you want to know what's happening, see where the money is going. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bBStM7zcAU&t=785.3s)]
*  Many, many billions of dollars are being spent on artificial intelligence. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bBStM7zcAU&t=790.58s)]
