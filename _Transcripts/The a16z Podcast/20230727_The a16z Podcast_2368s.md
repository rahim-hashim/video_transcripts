# Classroom 2050: Unleashing AI, XR, Gaming
**The a16z Podcast:** [July 27, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8)
*  This is a moment for reimagining learning. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=0.0s)]
*  Generative AI kind of jumped us forward 20 years faster. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=2.7600000000000002s)]
*  There's this assumption that every student is going to use it to cheat. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=6.24s)]
*  The most power happens when the AI works with the student. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=9.52s)]
*  Can teachers handle VR? Can teachers handle AI? [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=12.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=15.0s)]
*  Like, absolutely. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=15.32s)]
*  I have a hundred percent of teachers opting in to our program. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=16.32s)]
*  You can go to Ancient Rome, you could talk to Caesar, you could talk to Cleopatra. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=19.72s)]
*  The kids in school today are growing up into a world that's incredibly fast-paced [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=24.12s)]
*  and it's complex. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=29.759999999999998s)]
*  The technology is here, the pedagogy is here, the teacher training is here. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=31.36s)]
*  We just now need to put our heads down and execute. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=34.56s)]
*  The year is 2023, and so much has changed in the last 50 when it comes to technology. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=36.92s)]
*  We have smartphones that fit in our pockets. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=44.4s)]
*  We have the world's knowledge accessible to anyone with an internet connection. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=47.2s)]
*  And we even have tools now that summarize incredibly complex concepts [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=52.0s)]
*  in the voices of our favorite fictional characters. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=56.16s)]
*  But now, reflect on the state of the classroom, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=59.48s)]
*  the very forum where we raise the next generation. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=62.76s)]
*  How has that evolved in the same time period? [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=66.52s)]
*  Despite so many children already using these cutting-edge technologies [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=69.48s)]
*  like AI, XR, and gaming outside the classroom, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=73.56s)]
*  interestingly enough, they haven't really made their way in. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=77.72s)]
*  And in this episode, we explore why that is, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=81.36s)]
*  especially given the learning loss that we saw prior to and during COVID [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=84.32s)]
*  and how these technologies might actually help us [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=88.84s)]
*  radically upgrade the classroom of the future. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=91.56s)]
*  This episode was actually recorded live at the Aspen Ideas Festival, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=94.92s)]
*  which I got to attend for the first time ever recently. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=98.47999999999999s)]
*  And I was joined by four unique guests. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=101.64s)]
*  We had Sala Khan, founder of Khan Academy, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=104.52s)]
*  which recently unveiled Khanmigo, an AI-powered tutor. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=107.12s)]
*  We also had Anarupa Gangulyi. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=111.28s)]
*  She is the founder of Prisms VR, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=113.56s)]
*  which is using VR to better teach our children math and science concepts [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=115.48s)]
*  through spatial reasoning and abstraction. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=119.75999999999999s)]
*  We also had Allison Matthews, head of Minecraft Education, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=122.28s)]
*  who's tailoring the most popular game in the world [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=126.0s)]
*  to empower and teach young people skills like coding or even active citizenship. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=129.56s)]
*  And finally, we had Romy Drucker, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=134.6s)]
*  director of the education program at the Walton Family Foundation, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=136.32s)]
*  who has a bird's eye view into the challenges and opportunities in the space. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=139.88s)]
*  Honestly, I wish I grew up in an era where these technologies were at my fingertips. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=143.84s)]
*  So let's not squander this opportunity and let's dive in. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=149.0s)]

*  All right. Welcome, everyone. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=188.8s)]
*  Welcome to Classroom 2050. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=190.64s)]
*  Welcome to our classroom for the next 50 minutes. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=192.36s)]
*  I'd love to just start by getting a pulse from the room. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=195.72s)]
*  How many of you are excited about new technologies like AI, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=199.56s)]
*  XR, extended reality, gaming? [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=203.84s)]
*  Let's put your hands up. Who's excited? Great. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=206.64000000000001s)]
*  Now, how many of you keep your hands up and then put them down? [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=209.60000000000002s)]
*  How many of you feel like these technologies [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=212.56s)]
*  have successfully made it into the classroom for the better? [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=216.20000000000002s)]
*  Put your hand down if you don't think they've made it there. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=219.72s)]
*  Keep it up. I only see a few hands still up there. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=222.12s)]
*  But luckily, we have some wonderful founders today [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=225.24s)]
*  who are working on exactly that problem, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=228.24s)]
*  figuring out how we elevate the classroom [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=230.76000000000002s)]
*  after it's been relatively stagnant, quite frankly, for many years. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=233.44s)]
*  And to kick things off, let's really ground ourselves on where we are. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=237.36s)]
*  Romi, maybe you can help us here. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=241.20000000000002s)]
*  What is the data saying in terms of the student experience? [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=242.8s)]
*  What are kids really facing? [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=245.84s)]
*  How can we really get a better understanding of that? [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=247.52s)]
*  Thank you so much, Steph, for being here and moderating this discussion. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=250.4s)]
*  As many of you know, the pandemic was a huge setback in education, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=254.4s)]
*  and it exacerbated and widened already deep inequities. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=259.04s)]
*  We know from data that came out last week [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=265.6s)]
*  that math achievement levels are the lowest they've been in this country [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=268.08000000000004s)]
*  since 1990, [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=272.68s)]
*  and literacy achievement levels are the lowest they've been since 2004. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=274.96000000000004s)]
*  And the pandemic erased two decades of progress [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=280.32s)]
*  that we had made in education [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=284.08s)]
*  through a variety of different change initiatives. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=286.12s)]
*  So we have a lot of work to do. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=289.56s)]
*  The good news is that students, families, and educators agree [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=292.35999999999996s)]
*  that this is a moment for reimagining learning, [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=296.68s)]
*  both embracing technology, [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=299.84s)]
*  but also thinking about how we strengthen relationships in classrooms, [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=302.24s)]
*  how we better support student wellbeing [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=306.0s)]
*  to address the mental health crisis. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=308.76s)]
*  Thank you, Romi. And, Anarupa, I want to move to you. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=311.28000000000003s)]
*  What will it take specifically to develop the next generation of STEM talent? [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=314.12s)]
*  I know you have some data there. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=319.76s)]
*  Give us a grounding there in terms of what that will really take [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=321.28000000000003s)]
*  and what we're seeing up until now. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=324.12s)]
*  Absolutely. I discovered that the top indicators of success [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=326.32s)]
*  in post-secondary STEM is, number one, your ability to think spatially. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=329.0s)]
*  The Soviets had first discovered it in the 1970s, [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=332.64s)]
*  so if you think about a rough definition, [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=334.64s)]
*  it's your ability to rotate 3D objects in your mind [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=336.48s)]
*  and maintain perspective of that object. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=339.08s)]
*  The second top indicator of success in post-secondary STEM [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=341.32s)]
*  is your ability to abstract. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=343.68s)]
*  And when I say abstract, I don't mean looking at word problems, [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=345.64s)]
*  talking, drawing diagrams and visualizations, [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=348.84s)]
*  creating charts and tables and creating equations, [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=351.4s)]
*  because those are all 2D representations of thought. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=353.0s)]
*  Abstraction is Isaac Newton. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=355.24s)]
*  He was sitting under a tree and Apple fell. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=356.71999999999997s)]
*  He's like, whoa, how do I ascribe language, notation, [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=358.32s)]
*  and build mathematical models of this physical experience? [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=361.08s)]
*  So I started Prisms three years ago to scale these best practice methodologies. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=364.36s)]
*  How do you immerse children in problems in the first person, [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=368.20000000000005s)]
*  create the intellectual need for why they have to learn something, [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=372.6s)]
*  and then through building a solution to that problem, [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=375.32000000000005s)]
*  learn the math and science that you need to? [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=377.76000000000005s)]
*  So how does Prisms work? [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=379.84000000000003s)]
*  We utilize virtual reality, [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=382.6s)]
*  so students put their VR headsets on, their mobile VR headsets, [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=385.8s)]
*  and they're transported to a world. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=388.44000000000005s)]
*  It is my mission and commitment that when kids see math problems in math class, [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=390.28000000000003s)]
*  they should not be like, that's not a real problem. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=394.08000000000004s)]
*  No one really important is actually solving it. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=396.44s)]
*  They should go, I heard that in the news. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=398.44s)]
*  I know absolutely that very smart people are working on this, [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=399.84s)]
*  building mathematical identities from a very young age [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=402.47999999999996s)]
*  and this belief that I can contribute to the mathematical sciences. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=405.12s)]
*  So that through line of going from physicality, simulations, [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=407.56s)]
*  data visualizations, chart tables, equations, [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=411.15999999999997s)]
*  is really scalable. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=413.56s)]
*  It's most of secondary math and science. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=414.56s)]
*  So we've built out all of algebra one, geometry, middle school math, [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=416.4s)]
*  algebra two, pre-calculus. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=419.12s)]
*  We'll be pushing into all of higher ed very soon. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=420.47999999999996s)]
*  I mean, we have so much to dig into there. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=423.4s)]
*  And by the way, we didn't have a chance to call this out, [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=425.48s)]
*  but we wanted, you know, there's many ways that people learn. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=427.92s)]
*  And instead of talking about the technologies [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=431.36s)]
*  that these wonderful founders are building, [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=433.56s)]
*  we wanted to make sure you had a glimpse into really what we're talking about here. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=435.32s)]
*  And so we've talked about different technologies. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=438.48s)]
*  So this is a glimpse into VR. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=440.24s)]
*  One of the other technologies entering the classroom is AI, you know, [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=442.84000000000003s)]
*  one of the topics of the year. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=446.40000000000003s)]
*  So Sal, why don't you talk to us about what you're building there? [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=447.96000000000004s)]
*  And of course, we'll also pull up, you know, [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=450.48s)]
*  some of the technology that you're building. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=452.72s)]
*  Yeah, so, you know, Khan Academy has been around a little while now, [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=454.48s)]
*  and most folks associate us with videos, [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=457.88s)]
*  but most of our resources have been around personalized practice. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=459.76s)]
*  I'm kind of a traditionalist and a progressive, where I say, [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=462.56s)]
*  well, but there's also just gaps in students' foundations. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=466.12s)]
*  The number of times that I've gone to, like, a seventh grade math classroom, [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=468.68s)]
*  this was recent, I was in the Bronx, they're working on Khan Academy, [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=471.44s)]
*  the kids were doing exponents, and it was like summing to the third [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=474.44s)]
*  to the seventh power, so it's to the 21st power, three times seven. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=477.36s)]
*  I saw an eighth grader grab a calculator for that. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=480.56s)]
*  I literally slapped their hand, I don't know if you're allowed to do that. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=482.36s)]
*  But I slapped their hand, I'm like, what's three times seven? [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=484.71999999999997s)]
*  And I saw the eighth grader start to do this. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=486.48s)]
*  And that's just a very basic example of, like, there's massive fluency gaps [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=488.12s)]
*  in students and just some very basic, and it's causing too much cognitive load. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=492.12s)]
*  So that's where Khan Academy started is, hey, can we get people as much practice, [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=495.6s)]
*  learn at their own time and pace? [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=499.92s)]
*  You're a teacher with 30 kids, but there is a way that all 30 kids [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=501.15999999999997s)]
*  can go at different paces. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=504.08s)]
*  You, as a teacher, can understand where the kids are, [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=505.56s)]
*  and the students have multiple shots at goal in order to understand [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=508.44s)]
*  those underlying skills. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=511.32s)]
*  That's what we've been working on for 10 plus years. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=513.0s)]
*  And I'm happy to talk more about it, but we're seeing some very promising results [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=516.24s)]
*  pre-AI. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=519.1999999999999s)]
*  But then last summer, OpenAI reaches out to us. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=520.88s)]
*  This is obviously months before chat GPT and all of that. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=525.28s)]
*  And they said, hey, we're training our next generation model. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=527.68s)]
*  It was GPT-4. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=530.1999999999999s)]
*  For those, when chat GPT came out, it was based on GPT-3.5. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=531.8s)]
*  I was skeptical, because I had been paying attention to previous generations [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=538.7199999999999s)]
*  of these models. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=542.8399999999999s)]
*  But when we started playing with GPT-4, we said, this one's different. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=544.0799999999999s)]
*  This one, you can actually get it to act as a tutor. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=548.1999999999999s)]
*  It still had issues around hallucinations, which is when [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=551.64s)]
*  the AI just makes up facts. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=554.12s)]
*  It still has, that is the technical term for it. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=555.9599999999999s)]
*  It had issues when it came to math, which obviously, we don't only do math, [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=559.4799999999999s)]
*  but math is very close to our heart, and it's got to be accurate. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=565.88s)]
*  And we were worried about guardrails. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=570.4s)]
*  What if students use it for negative things, or they go into some type [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=571.88s)]
*  of weird rabbit hole? [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=575.52s)]
*  So we said, can we put guardrails around it? [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=576.52s)]
*  So we started working pretty aggressively. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=578.92s)]
*  We were under NDA with OpenAI since last summer. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=580.84s)]
*  Then chat GPT came out. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=584.48s)]
*  And we weren't going to launch our thing until the GPT-4 launch in March. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=586.64s)]
*  And I remember telling Greg Brockman, like, hey, I thought we were waiting. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=591.88s)]
*  He's like, no, chat GPT is nothing new. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=594.56s)]
*  It's just a chat interface on top of GPT 3.5. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=596.1199999999999s)]
*  And that captured everyone's imagination. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=599.7199999999999s)]
*  And it immediately put a bit of a bomb into the education system, [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=601.8399999999999s)]
*  where everyone was like, oh, kids are going to use this to cheat, [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=607.76s)]
*  write their essays. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=610.76s)]
*  And by the way, it's bad at math, and it makes up things, et cetera, et cetera. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=611.88s)]
*  I was initially bummed, because we're working on what I think is a reasonably [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=616.3199999999999s)]
*  thoughtful solution here. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=619.92s)]
*  Now this thing just gets thrown out into the universe, [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=620.9599999999999s)]
*  and everyone's first impression is going to be AI plus education is really bad. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=624.4399999999999s)]
*  In hindsight, I actually think that was a blessing, because what it did is [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=629.36s)]
*  it forced people to grapple with some real things. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=633.1999999999999s)]
*  When we first saw GPT-4 months before chat GPT, we were like, yeah, [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=635.1999999999999s)]
*  people are going to be able to use this to write essays. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=638.24s)]
*  People are going to be able to use this to do college essays, [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=639.92s)]
*  do their homework, et cetera. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=642.12s)]
*  How do we mitigate these risks? [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=643.16s)]
*  But the fact that chat GPT, within a month or two, 40% of teachers were using [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=645.6s)]
*  this very imperfect tool for themselves, for things like lesson planning. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=650.16s)]
*  And students were already using it, but it was forcing the issue on the education. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=653.76s)]
*  Most of EdTech is things are okay, maybe we could use technology to make it better, [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=659.68s)]
*  but this was like, wow, things just got broken. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=664.4399999999999s)]
*  Maybe we need to do something to make it better. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=667.48s)]
*  So we launched our implementation, which we call Conmigo. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=671.3199999999999s)]
*  We've always tried to approximate personal tutoring at Khan Academy through videos and [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=676.12s)]
*  exercises, but I think generative AI kind of jumped us forward 20 years faster than [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=681.04s)]
*  I thought, if you would ask me a year ago, where it can act as a tutor. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=686.76s)]
*  And maybe just as interestingly act as a teaching assistant to help generate [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=691.08s)]
*  lesson plans, help refresh a teacher's knowledge, create rubrics, etc, etc. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=694.84s)]
*  And that last screen you just saw, it was actually in Spanish as well. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=699.48s)]
*  It works in every major language, which by itself already solves a major issue, [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=701.88s)]
*  where you can be doing your work in English, but get help in Brazilian Portuguese, [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=706.12s)]
*  in Spanish, in Vietnamese, whatever language you need that help in. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=711.08s)]
*  It does not cheat if you ask the student, if you ask Conmigo, hey, tell me the answer. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=716.08s)]
*  It will not tell you the answer, but say I'm your tutor. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=721.36s)]
*  It'll act Socratic and say, well, what do you think is the next step? [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=723.52s)]
*  We've done a bunch, unless you all want to, I won't go into all the details, but [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=727.44s)]
*  it's substantially better, I won't say perfect, but substantially better at math [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=730.52s)]
*  than what you would get just out of the box with GPT-4. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=734.6s)]
*  We have a second artificial intelligence. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=738.72s)]
*  Well, all conversations are monitorable by parents and teachers, [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=740.48s)]
*  which we thought was an important guardrail. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=743.4399999999999s)]
*  And then we have a second AI that monitors the conversations. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=745.52s)]
*  Founders so far have talked about maybe how early on there are misconceptions, [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=748.48s)]
*  misperceptions from whether it's students, teachers, people in school boards, [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=752.68s)]
*  about welcoming this technology. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=756.84s)]
*  So I want to get into those conversations too. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=758.76s)]
*  But Allison, please give us a glimpse into the world of gaming, [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=760.88s)]
*  because that is a form of technology that has immense growth as well, [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=765.8s)]
*  just like AI and extended reality, but maybe isn't met with the same level of open arms. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=770.4s)]
*  So we'd love to hear what you're building. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=777.0s)]
*  Yeah, for sure. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=778.88s)]
*  Minecraft is an immersive 3D virtual space that's filled with beautiful biomes and [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=779.72s)]
*  all kinds of animals. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=787.04s)]
*  So Minecraft education. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=789.0799999999999s)]
*  We built on top of that wildly popular video game a powerful teaching and [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=792.9599999999999s)]
*  learning platform by putting safety, security, privacy features that educators [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=798.88s)]
*  need and parents expect on top, as well as an in-game library that's full of [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=805.4399999999999s)]
*  learning experiences from learning to code and math, history, literacy, [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=811.88s)]
*  but all the way to learning how to be a more active citizen or learning about climate change. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=818.08s)]
*  We know, and maybe you do too, that video games are one of the most powerful ways to [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=824.32s)]
*  engage a person in a deeply engaging, deeply immersive experience. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=830.68s)]
*  And it lights up intrinsic motivation. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=836.28s)]
*  Intrinsic motivation is just that desire to keep trying to go deeper, [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=838.8s)]
*  to learn more, because you love it. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=843.92s)]
*  You're having fun. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=847.24s)]
*  You're passionate about it. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=848.5999999999999s)]
*  Amazing. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=850.76s)]
*  Anirupa, I'm going to go to you next with these misconceptions partially because [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=851.68s)]
*  Anirupa is actually a previous educator herself. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=855.0s)]
*  And so tell us a little bit more about maybe the way that people view the [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=858.3599999999999s)]
*  introduction of these technologies, whether it be VR, but also AI, also gaming. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=862.5999999999999s)]
*  And where maybe some of those assumptions may be misplaced. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=867.76s)]
*  Yeah, I think a common misconception is that technology is going to replace the [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=871.04s)]
*  pedagogy, and it's not. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=874.36s)]
*  Pedagogy is pedagogy. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=876.3199999999999s)]
*  And so what the tech will allow you to do is it will scale that. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=877.3199999999999s)]
*  So in the case of PRISM, you are building an elementary school building in India [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=879.84s)]
*  that creates a shaded region. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=882.8s)]
*  You're building a satellite that does XYZ. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=883.76s)]
*  And to do that thing, you have to learn ratios. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=886.04s)]
*  You have to apply linear functions. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=888.84s)]
*  And so what I've learned is that instead of talking about the technology, [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=891.92s)]
*  talk about the learning design. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=895.92s)]
*  And when you're focused on the learning design, whether it's a powerful AGI tool [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=897.92s)]
*  or game design or, in my case, spatial computing, that is just fueling a way of [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=904.12s)]
*  teaching and learning. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=908.68s)]
*  And when you project it in that manner, nobody pushes back. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=909.8399999999999s)]
*  Like, I have 100% of teachers opting in to our program. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=912.9599999999999s)]
*  And that might seem like, are you sure, Anirupa? [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=916.76s)]
*  Like, everyone's a little bit afraid of VR? [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=919.5999999999999s)]
*  And no, because in my deck, you don't see VR anywhere. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=921.24s)]
*  So that's the first thing that I would say the key misconception is it's not [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=924.8s)]
*  about the technology. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=928.04s)]
*  The technology powers the learning design. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=928.8s)]
*  And the second thing that I would say was it is then, therefore, incumbent upon [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=931.12s)]
*  those who are building learning solutions to over-index on training teachers in the [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=935.08s)]
*  pedagogy and not the tech. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=939.2s)]
*  We focus too much time on, let me teach you about how to utilize this hardware. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=941.04s)]
*  No, we're going to spend 30 seconds on that because you're actually very smart and [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=946.04s)]
*  you know how to do it. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=949.24s)]
*  You just need to kind of have that confidence. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=949.84s)]
*  And we're going to spend the market share of the time on lesson study, [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=951.9599999999999s)]
*  intellectual preparation, job-embedded coaching. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=955.0799999999999s)]
*  How do you get learning outcomes? [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=958.28s)]
*  So I would say kind of that's where my mind to in terms of the main [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=959.9599999999999s)]
*  misconceptions. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=962.8s)]
*  And the bow that I would tie on that is there's been this feeling and [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=963.4799999999999s)]
*  perception that school systems are regressive. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=967.64s)]
*  And they're somehow contra to progress. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=969.76s)]
*  When you show them how it's standards aligned, how you teach bell to bell in a [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=972.0s)]
*  50 minute instructional episode, how you prepare for it, [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=975.4s)]
*  you're not going to get any pushback. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=978.88s)]
*  It's just kind of showing them how you go from point A to point B. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=980.08s)]
*  So maybe you can comment on that. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=982.96s)]
*  You already touched on some ideas where there's this assumption that with AI in [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=984.24s)]
*  the classroom, every student is going to use it to cheat. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=988.64s)]
*  They're never going to learn again because why would they, right? [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=992.1600000000001s)]
*  They've got this assistant who can do it for them. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=994.0400000000001s)]
*  So maybe just speak to that directly. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=996.2800000000001s)]
*  What are you seeing in terms of maybe the reality or what can be designed to maybe [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=998.1600000000001s)]
*  construe that reality? [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1002.9200000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I think Chad GPT has forced folks into one of two modes. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1004.84s)]
*  Either have some assignments where you just say use whatever help you want. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1009.4s)]
*  And now I have a higher, and that's reasonable because we now use it in the [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1015.0799999999999s)]
*  workplace, etc. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1018.4399999999999s)]
*  There's another mode even without technology, everyone said, okay, [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1019.92s)]
*  I guess we're going to have to do more in class proctoring now, things like that. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1023.0s)]
*  I think both of those are probably part of the mix. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1027.16s)]
*  We think actually the most power happens when the AI works with the student. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1030.76s)]
*  So like in a couple of months, we're going to be launching something, [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1035.28s)]
*  we're going to initially do it for college essays, which is a whole other, [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1038.48s)]
*  this is the first college admission cycle in the Chad GPT era. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1040.88s)]
*  So it's going to be very interesting. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1044.0s)]
*  But we've created activities where it can interview the student and [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1047.16s)]
*  help surface things that would make for good college essays. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1050.4s)]
*  So brainstorm with the student, not for the student. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1053.2s)]
*  A modality where you can write an essay of any kind and [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1056.6000000000001s)]
*  then ask for feedback from the AI. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1061.72s)]
*  And not just on, we've all seen technologies that can help with your grammar and [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1063.88s)]
*  things like that. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1067.4s)]
*  But once again, not just tell you this is how to write it grammatically correct, but [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1068.92s)]
*  say, hey, look at your verb tense again. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1071.52s)]
*  Once again, act like a tutor. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1074.16s)]
*  But now with generative AI, especially with GPT-4, [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1076.0800000000002s)]
*  it can really go into the argument that you're making and [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1078.68s)]
*  how do you make it more emotive and how do you really make it an excellent paper. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1081.8400000000001s)]
*  And what's interesting about that is when you work with the AI and [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1086.16s)]
*  all of the interactions are logged, a teacher can actually not just [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1089.0400000000002s)]
*  introspect on the final outcome, they can introspect on the process. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1094.04s)]
*  So we're building a mechanism right now where the teacher can assign through the AI. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1097.68s)]
*  Hey, I want everyone in my 11th grade AP American History course to write a paper [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1103.24s)]
*  on how the world would have been different if the American Revolution didn't happen. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1107.6s)]
*  I don't know, something. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1110.56s)]
*  And then every student will be able to work on it with Conmigo. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1111.4s)]
*  And Conmigo will be like, okay, [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1114.36s)]
*  do you think that really backs up your argument? [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1115.52s)]
*  How about this? [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1117.2s)]
*  They're riffing together, which I think will be a better experience for [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1118.32s)]
*  a lot of students. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1121.12s)]
*  And then even while that's happening, the teacher will be able to talk to Conmigo. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1122.44s)]
*  It's like, okay, what's everyone up to? [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1125.6000000000001s)]
*  And says, okay, I've already started, this student is doing great, [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1127.3200000000002s)]
*  this student seems kind of stuck. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1131.44s)]
*  This student just copied and pasted something in there. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1133.2s)]
*  I don't know where it came from. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1136.0400000000002s)]
*  We might want to double click on that. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1137.64s)]
*  Maybe they're using chat GPT. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1139.1200000000001s)]
*  And I think then all of a sudden, you've kind of addressed this issue where now [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1142.1200000000001s)]
*  the artificial intelligence not only do you not have to worry about policing it in [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1146.48s)]
*  the same way, can help students write better, it can give teachers better [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1150.2s)]
*  feedback. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1153.28s)]
*  A lot of mastery learning is multiple shots at goal. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1154.3600000000001s)]
*  If you're at a certain level, 80%, you should try again. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1157.48s)]
*  You should be able to do the writing, but writing, [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1161.04s)]
*  it's very hard to get feedback. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1162.44s)]
*  But now the AI can give multiple rounds and then also give the teacher first pass [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1164.32s)]
*  of like, based on the rubric we created together, [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1168.52s)]
*  I'd give the student a four out of five on that dimension, [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1170.88s)]
*  a five out of five on that dimension. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1172.92s)]
*  So I think that's probably where we're gonna go. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1174.88s)]
*  By the way, this isn't crazy. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1176.68s)]
*  I did a year of exchange in Sweden and they have a totally different grading [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1178.1200000000001s)]
*  system, including you can submit an assignment and you can pass or fail. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1182.28s)]
*  And if you fail, they tell you what to change. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1186.48s)]
*  They tell you how to get better. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1189.16s)]
*  So this is not like completely grown out of AI and totally new. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1190.3600000000001s)]
*  These concepts do exist elsewhere. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1194.8s)]
*  We've been doing that in our lab school with humans, but [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1196.52s)]
*  it's more resource intensive. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1198.3600000000001s)]
*  Right, exactly. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1199.48s)]
*  Allison, actually that dovetails perfectly into this idea that if we are introducing [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1200.64s)]
*  these technologies, what is the future of a teacher or teachers in general? [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1204.88s)]
*  How does that role evolve? [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1210.1200000000001s)]
*  And then also if you have time, [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1211.92s)]
*  I'd love to just hear your take on how people view gaming, [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1213.1200000000001s)]
*  cuz that's a very interesting topic on its own. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1215.64s)]
*  Yeah, so Minecraft education is now in 119 countries and [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1219.0s)]
*  we've got millions of players every month. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1225.3600000000001s)]
*  And a big focus of the team is on connecting with educators so [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1227.6000000000001s)]
*  we can understand what are the problems that they're trying to solve. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1231.2s)]
*  And one of them is similar to what Sal was talking about in that in any given [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1234.28s)]
*  classroom, you're gonna have a full range of readiness for [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1238.28s)]
*  whatever the course material is that's being covered. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1242.04s)]
*  And so what teachers really need is a tool that enables differentiated learning. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1245.1s)]
*  So a way that someone who totally understands the content can take it [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1251.12s)]
*  further and someone who's, it's new to them, they haven't understood this before, [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1257.2s)]
*  to start to get familiar with the material. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1262.16s)]
*  And to your question of the role of the teacher, [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1264.72s)]
*  because the game supports, we've got scaffolded learning experiences in the game, [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1268.16s)]
*  which means if you're stuck, if you don't know Minecraft or [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1273.88s)]
*  if you don't really understand the lesson, we've got little things built into [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1277.0800000000002s)]
*  the lessons that can help give you tips or clues on how to move forward. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1281.0800000000002s)]
*  So students can be self-directed in that way, which frees the teacher up [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1286.1200000000001s)]
*  to actually work with the students who need more attention or [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1290.4s)]
*  to challenge the students who are racing ahead. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1294.24s)]
*  So that's one. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1297.0400000000002s)]
*  I wanted to point out one other thing for teachers, [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1298.68s)]
*  cuz we've had a lot of teachers, especially early on, tell us, okay, [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1301.52s)]
*  this is the, the kids love this game. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1305.68s)]
*  Why would I bring this into the classroom? [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1308.68s)]
*  I'm gonna lose control immediately. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1310.3200000000002s)]
*  They all understand it better than I do. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1312.16s)]
*  So, yes, this is true. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1314.48s)]
*  And none of us as adults will ever understand Minecraft as well as [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1317.9199999999998s)]
*  the average eight year old. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1321.9599999999998s)]
*  That's just a fact. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1323.1599999999999s)]
*  And so what that requires is a mindset shift, right? [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1325.32s)]
*  The kids in school today are growing up into a world that's incredibly [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1329.08s)]
*  fast-paced and it's complex. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1333.48s)]
*  So they need mindset that's gonna enable them to be successful in [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1336.32s)]
*  a world that's changing rapidly. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1339.9599999999998s)]
*  So they need to build a growth mindset. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1342.12s)]
*  They need to build leadership skills, collaboration, communication skills. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1344.56s)]
*  And these are sort of those higher order things that can be achieved [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1349.48s)]
*  through playing a game and the teacher has the ability to generate some of [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1355.04s)]
*  these conversations in the classroom about, tell me why you did that in the game. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1359.52s)]
*  Help me understand your thought process that made you go destroy that other [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1365.52s)]
*  students work in the game. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1369.92s)]
*  Let's have a conversation about digital citizenship and the fact that, [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1372.88s)]
*  you know what, what we do in a virtual world creates feelings in the real world. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1376.6000000000001s)]
*  And this is something that it's really important for [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1381.76s)]
*  all young people and adults, frankly, to learn. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1385.0400000000002s)]
*  Like, how can we be better citizens in the world? [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1388.44s)]
*  So just sort of an example of taking things to the next level. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1391.68s)]
*  I love that. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1396.0s)]
*  All right, so Romy, how can the many folks from different backgrounds who have [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1396.64s)]
*  different associations with the classroom, how can they get involved? [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1401.8s)]
*  How can they really help us bring these technologies or [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1406.44s)]
*  this innovation into the classroom? [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1410.28s)]
*  Yeah, I love this conversation and [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1412.92s)]
*  I think you're hearing a couple of consistent themes about learning in the future. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1414.56s)]
*  One is the importance of agency and personalization. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1420.0s)]
*  When we think about, and you heard this from all of our speakers, [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1424.12s)]
*  the kinds of experiences that are gonna help young people find their purpose, [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1427.28s)]
*  help them navigate this increasingly complex world. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1432.8s)]
*  They need to feel a sense of ownership over their education and [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1436.6s)]
*  they need to feel excited about learning. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1440.2s)]
*  We released new research last week with Gallup where, so [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1443.4s)]
*  students are telling us that they want an experience that reflects the kind of [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1446.6s)]
*  personalization, the kind of ownership, [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1452.48s)]
*  this sense that they are not just sort of in a transaction. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1455.28s)]
*  But really building the skill sets and [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1460.3600000000001s)]
*  mindsets, as Allison said, that are gonna help them be successful. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1462.6000000000001s)]
*  The other thing that's coming up is that the pandemic really kind of [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1467.3600000000001s)]
*  changed the conversation about where learning happens. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1471.6000000000001s)]
*  And what we experienced is that learning can happen anywhere. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1475.48s)]
*  Obviously it needs to happen in school, [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1479.8s)]
*  because that's where students are for most of the day. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1482.48s)]
*  And also many parents are thinking differently about what learning looks [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1485.48s)]
*  like, learning on a continuum, different experiences that [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1489.56s)]
*  provide students with those opportunities to engage and explore. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1493.8s)]
*  And I think Minecraft is a great example, whether it's being used in a classroom or [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1499.48s)]
*  outside of a classroom, to build on top of the skill building and [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1503.64s)]
*  the mindset building that is happening. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1509.04s)]
*  And we know that educators and families play a huge role in that. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1512.36s)]
*  And that the point of adoption for these technologies is too late. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1516.28s)]
*  So one of the things we need to be doing is incorporating early on in the R&D [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1521.72s)]
*  process, and I know this matters to everyone on the stage, educator and [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1526.64s)]
*  family perspectives when it comes to the development of these products. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1530.32s)]
*  And I know the speakers will have great examples of how your [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1535.08s)]
*  facilitating that kind of inclusive R&D. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1538.72s)]
*  But as we think about really deploying these solutions across districts, [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1541.2s)]
*  across schools, that feedback loop and [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1546.3600000000001s)]
*  strengthening that feedback loop is gonna be more important than ever before. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1548.88s)]
*  Absolutely, and Aruba, maybe you can speak to that because maybe the group has [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1552.76s)]
*  already picked up on this, but there's a level of hardware as well with VR, right? [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1557.16s)]
*  And so you not only have to get into these classrooms, but [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1561.08s)]
*  you have to get educators, school boards to opt in to this new cost. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1564.3600000000001s)]
*  And so how are you doing that? [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1568.32s)]
*  How are you working with these folks to not only open their aperture for [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1569.52s)]
*  the technology, but also the cost and figuring out how you can roll this out [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1573.8799999999999s)]
*  really broadly so that if it is as game changing as we think it can be, [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1578.0s)]
*  that everyone has access. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1583.12s)]
*  Yeah, and I wanted to kind of put you back on the role of the teacher. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1584.84s)]
*  Please, yeah. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1588.96s)]
*  I was a math director for many years. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1589.6799999999998s)]
*  And at NCTM, we've been talking about student-based learning, [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1592.48s)]
*  problem-driven learning, discourse for decades. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1596.32s)]
*  So what's been really fun is that the role of the teacher isn't changing at all. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1599.24s)]
*  She's just now able to do it. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1603.36s)]
*  What was happening before is we were telling them to do discourse. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1604.92s)]
*  We were telling them to do PBL. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1607.72s)]
*  And the tools that she had were not amenable to that. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1609.24s)]
*  So what's so great about going back to the question of adoption is when we go in, [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1611.92s)]
*  we're like nothing is changing. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1615.28s)]
*  You as the great teacher, you are launching an activation conversation. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1616.76s)]
*  You put your headset on and they start working. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1619.84s)]
*  Teacher has a web-based dashboard. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1621.56s)]
*  So she's monitoring and providing feedback. [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1623.44s)]
*  So when we share this pedagogy, school boards are like, [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1625.84s)]
*  that's exactly how we want to teach. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1628.4399999999998s)]
*  How do we do that? [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1630.12s)]
*  By the way, there's a hardware investment. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1631.1599999999999s)]
*  Well, how much? [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1632.8799999999999s)]
*  Well, VR isn't for every day. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1633.76s)]
*  VR has a very specific role in the curriculum. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1635.48s)]
*  All the other resources that we have, the wonderful computer software that's been [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1638.72s)]
*  built and evolved over the past couple decades, that's great. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1642.6399999999999s)]
*  It just needs to be founded in something that's really real world and [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1645.4399999999998s)]
*  visceral for kids. [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1648.56s)]
*  So VR is only the first two days of a unit of study. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1649.76s)]
*  It tells you why you're learning what you're learning. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1652.12s)]
*  It helps you derive a mathematical construct through a series of physical and [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1653.8s)]
*  tactile experiences. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1657.68s)]
*  And then once that's done, those card of headsets can go to the next classroom. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1659.1599999999999s)]
*  So we're deploying at about a 15 to 1 ratio at present. [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1662.76s)]
*  As we create more and more content, [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1666.36s)]
*  that might need to come down to 10 and potentially 5 over time. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1668.76s)]
*  But that's really been the sell. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1671.84s)]
*  And so I don't know if that kind of gets to the heart of the question, but [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1673.76s)]
*  we are selling a vision that is not new. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1677.04s)]
*  People have always wanted to teach this way. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1680.0s)]
*  We are now providing the hardware and [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1681.68s)]
*  the hardware wasn't available five years ago. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1683.28s)]
*  So for those of you, I had a DK1, I'm a big VR enthusiast. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1685.76s)]
*  If you guys have been following a few years ago, it was not standalone. [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1689.8s)]
*  There was a bulky umbilical cord, these big pieces of hardware. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1692.92s)]
*  Movement tracking was bad, hand tracking wasn't there, eye tracking. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1696.1200000000001s)]
*  It was uncomfortable at best, right? [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1698.5600000000002s)]
*  That's not the case anymore. [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1701.2s)]
*  There's a psychological safety and a comfort that kids have. [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1702.24s)]
*  Kids, most of them have the quest at home. [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1705.3600000000001s)]
*  So when they come in and they see the quest in the Picos in school, [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1707.2s)]
*  I cannot tell you about it. [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1710.0s)]
*  Nicole, for the number of times kids have said, finally, [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1711.08s)]
*  you guys are coming into the 21st century. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1713.76s)]
*  Because they get to see the tech that they have at home in their classrooms. [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1716.08s)]
*  Definitely. [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1719.6s)]
*  I want to just touch on something that you've told me directly and [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1720.4s)]
*  you kind of touched on there. [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1723.16s)]
*  But when you are going to these schools, [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1724.12s)]
*  maybe a misconception is that teachers don't want this. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1726.84s)]
*  But they're responding like, I've been wanting this forever, right? [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1729.64s)]
*  And they're also, something that I thought was interesting that you've mentioned is, [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1733.28s)]
*  they are smart. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1737.2s)]
*  And there's this maybe misconception around, can teachers handle VR? [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1738.52s)]
*  Can teachers handle AI? [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1743.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1744.68s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1745.2s)]
*  Well, it's what happened with many teachers who held lower expectations for [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1746.0s)]
*  their kids of, well, we don't know if the kids can do it. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1750.2s)]
*  Same thing with district leadership. [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1752.88s)]
*  The number of times the superintendent has told me, [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1755.0800000000002s)]
*  my teachers can't do this. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1756.8400000000001s)]
*  I'm like, put your teachers in front of me. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1757.92s)]
*  And I'm going to tell you, say, one example and then tie a bow. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1759.52s)]
*  But Umbil ISD, small 45,000 student district in Texas. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1763.1599999999999s)]
*  They were like, only a small group of my teachers are going to want to use this. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1767.4799999999998s)]
*  I said, okay, because I've seen this a million times happen now. [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1771.2399999999998s)]
*  So they got 90 teachers in a room. [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1774.32s)]
*  They'd only purchased for about 40 teachers. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1775.9599999999998s)]
*  Every single teacher put their hand up and said we want to do it. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1778.32s)]
*  And they were texting their friends. [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1781.1599999999999s)]
*  So 170 teachers opted into a program they'd only paid for for 40 teachers. [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1782.6s)]
*  And again, it's underestimating what our teachers are capable of and [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1786.6s)]
*  what they want. [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1791.0s)]
*  And as I mentioned, kids are digital native. [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1792.08s)]
*  So when the VR headsets come out, they're off to the races. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1794.08s)]
*  They know the UI. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1796.44s)]
*  So the teachers can focus on pedagogy. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1797.6399999999999s)]
*  She doesn't have to worry about teaching them the controllers and [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1799.12s)]
*  teaching them all the, the kids have that. [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1801.36s)]
*  She gets to focus on the questioning, the conversation, [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1803.84s)]
*  the convergence of key mathematical notation conventions and outcomes. [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1806.44s)]
*  And we must build with that in mind that if we make teachers the conduit for [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1809.3999999999999s)]
*  the tech, we're setting ourselves up for failure. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1812.68s)]
*  Something you also spoke to was the why now. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1815.56s)]
*  So Sal, I'd love to get your take on this. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1817.28s)]
*  I mean, maybe it's a little obvious with AI because last year has been [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1819.3999999999999s)]
*  so crazy, but at the same time, tell me a little bit more about the why now and [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1822.0s)]
*  specifically, what might this unlock? [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1826.08s)]
*  Like let's think a little more broadly about the next couple of years and [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1828.6s)]
*  think past just like, okay, our kids will be using a chat bot. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1831.36s)]
*  Yeah, I mean to Romy's opening remarks, the situation is not good. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1835.56s)]
*  And a lot of people blame the pandemic, but [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1839.8s)]
*  it was pretty bad before the pandemic. [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1841.32s)]
*  People have looked at the NAEP results and I think it was Detroit had 3% of kids. [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1843.32s)]
*  And I think there were eighth graders who are proficient in math, 3%. [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1848.68s)]
*  And it's like, wow, the pandemic was pretty bad. [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1852.1599999999999s)]
*  Well, before the pandemic was 6%. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1854.24s)]
*  So it was still pretty bad. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1856.76s)]
*  And this is why you see things like a majority of kids in the US who graduate [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1859.6799999999998s)]
*  from high school, so you're already talking about the top, I don't know, 80%. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1865.1599999999999s)]
*  And then the subset of them that want to go to college, [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1868.8s)]
*  then you're talking about the top 40 or 50%. [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1870.76s)]
*  A majority of them, when they get to their colleges, [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1873.28s)]
*  they don't even place into college algebra. [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1875.6799999999998s)]
*  This is the first time that mastery learning is being enforced and [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1878.1999999999998s)]
*  their colleges say, wait, you're not even ready to learn high school math yet. [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1880.64s)]
*  You're gonna take remedial math and that has all sorts of predictive, [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1884.1200000000001s)]
*  that the kids aren't gonna graduate, they're gonna have debt, no degree, etc, etc. [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1887.0400000000002s)]
*  And there's even been people say, well, maybe we shouldn't make algebra [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1890.8000000000002s)]
*  requirement. [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1893.0800000000002s)]
*  I'm like, this is like, it's really like eighth grade level algebra that [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1893.6000000000001s)]
*  is considered a weeder class in our colleges. [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1898.16s)]
*  And that's because the average American student learns about 0.6 to [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1901.0s)]
*  0.7 grade levels per year. [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1905.2800000000002s)]
*  Which, yeah, after 12 years, you're at a seventh grade level. [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1907.92s)]
*  So that's the baseline. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1911.24s)]
*  And so this is something that obviously we've, pre-AI, have been very focused on. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1914.08s)]
*  And we have a lot of, we have about 50 plus efficacy studies. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1918.72s)]
*  I think we're the most studied platform because we're just out there. [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1922.3999999999999s)]
*  But they all say the same thing. [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1925.48s)]
*  People put in, students put in 30 to 60 minutes a week. [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1926.72s)]
*  So not like a huge amount. [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1929.76s)]
*  They're accelerating 40, 50%. [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1931.8799999999999s)]
*  In some of our more, let's call it lab environments, we kind of run some schools. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1934.72s)]
*  They're more like sister organizations where the students are putting closer to [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1939.32s)]
*  30 minutes a day. [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1942.9199999999998s)]
*  Because they're learning at their zone of proximal development. [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1944.48s)]
*  All of these ideals that ed schools have always been teaching. [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1946.56s)]
*  The differentiated instruction, mastery learning, zone of proximal development. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1949.4399999999998s)]
*  But teachers had no way of implementing it. [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1952.8s)]
*  We actually haven't been sharing this because we almost think that the results [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1955.08s)]
*  are outlandish. [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1957.84s)]
*  Kids are getting about two grade levels a year. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1958.48s)]
*  Like when you do it consistently. [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1960.3999999999999s)]
*  And so it's not just genius kids who are doing calculus in middle school. [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1962.9199999999998s)]
*  It can actually be maybe all kids. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1966.24s)]
*  And that's at the same time that there's kids down the street who by the time [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1967.84s)]
*  they're 19, they can't do algebra much less calculus. [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1971.36s)]
*  And it has nothing to do with, I think, any kind of innate ability. [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1974.1999999999998s)]
*  So that's the baseline. [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1977.6399999999999s)]
*  Generative AI, there's always been this dream of, I always cite these science [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1979.9199999999998s)]
*  fiction books, Diamond Age, where they- [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1985.04s)]
*  Favorite book ever. [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1987.08s)]
*  Oh, that's your favorite, very good. [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1987.9199999999998s)]
*  Well, you're kind of working on it too. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1989.04s)]
*  Where you take a different, where it's a future where it's a neo-Victorian China, [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1990.36s)]
*  where there's an app for educating a member of a nobility's granddaughter. [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=1996.76s)]
*  It's an AI based virtual reality app that can educate a child and it gets pirated. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=2002.0s)]
*  It gets in the hands of these 200,000 orphan girls living in barges and they [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=2007.92s)]
*  just take over because they get such a good education. [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=2012.28s)]
*  And a lot of folks in the education world have always used the name of that app in [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=2014.76s)]
*  the book, which is the Young Ladies Illustrated Primer. [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=2018.2s)]
*  That's kind of like the code word for the true north that I think a lot of us, I [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=2020.76s)]
*  mean everything that all of us are doing are kind of somewhat inspired by things [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=2024.6s)]
*  like that and when the generative AI capabilities, not only did it throw a bomb [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=2028.52s)]
*  into how our kids are going to cheat, etc., etc., so that created an urgency to [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=2033.68s)]
*  figure out solutions. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=2038.32s)]
*  But it also, I think, laid out part of the solution, which we can now get much [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=2040.48s)]
*  closer to the Young Ladies Illustrated Primer. [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=2045.16s)]
*  Yeah, by the way, for the educators in the audience, I would love if you could [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=2046.8s)]
*  challenge your kids to come up with some positive sci-fi. [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=2050.04s)]
*  We need more of that technology. [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=2053.0s)]
*  It's inevitable and it's natural for us to... [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=2055.16s)]
*  I want to say one thing. [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=2058.72s)]
*  It's one of my favorite books because the author is making a case for one of the [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=2060.32s)]
*  most important qualities that young girls should have. [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=2065.16s)]
*  And if you were to take a guess, what would that be? [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=2068.56s)]
*  If you were to teach your young girls anything, what would that be? [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=2070.88s)]
*  Take rest. [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=2073.36s)]
*  Subversion. [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=2074.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=2075.84s)]
*  The book makes the case for subversion. [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=2076.84s)]
*  And it's incredible. [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=2078.4s)]
*  It changed my life. [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=2080.36s)]
*  I read it when I was a teenager before I went to college. [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=2080.92s)]
*  So thank you for referencing that. [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=2083.92s)]
*  You're right. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=2085.56s)]
*  That's exactly what we're all kind of building towards. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=2085.92s)]
*  Allison, I want to... [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=2088.56s)]
*  Oh, go ahead. [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=2089.2400000000002s)]
*  I'll say one last real quick thing is, we kind of focused on some of the bread and [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=2089.76s)]
*  butter stuff, but there's things you can do with the generative A. [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=2093.76s)]
*  Anna that is... [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=2096.56s)]
*  You can talk to simulations of historic characters, fictional characters, and you [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=2098.28s)]
*  can only imagine it's coming very soon where it's not just chatting, you're talking. [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=2102.96s)]
*  And then I think you start to merge these things with platforms like you're [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=2107.2400000000002s)]
*  hearing, and it becomes completely immersive. [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=2110.76s)]
*  You can go to ancient Rome, you could talk to Caesar, you could talk to Cleopatra. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=2112.1600000000003s)]
*  It's like the holodeck on Star Trek. [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=2117.44s)]
*  And I honestly didn't think that was going to happen in my lifetime. [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=2119.04s)]
*  I think that's going to happen in the next five years. [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=2121.96s)]
*  100%. [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=2123.6000000000004s)]
*  And it's exciting, or I think it is. [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=2124.6000000000004s)]
*  In the interest of time, we only have a few minutes left. [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=2126.0800000000004s)]
*  So I'd love to just give you all the same prompt, and we'll start with you, [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=2128.1600000000003s)]
*  Romi, and come back this direction. [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=2131.6000000000004s)]
*  I guess just any call to action. [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=2134.0800000000004s)]
*  Again, we have so many people in this audience. [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=2135.8s)]
*  We have some students. [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=2137.56s)]
*  We have some educators. [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=2138.48s)]
*  We have a lot of parents, a lot of people that care about the classroom, and [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=2139.68s)]
*  perhaps how technology can play a role. [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=2143.8399999999997s)]
*  And so just any call to action for people if they want to help out, [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=2145.52s)]
*  if they want to learn more, Romi, I'll start with you. [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=2149.3199999999997s)]
*  This North Star and really optimistic and bold vision that you hear everyone on [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=2152.9199999999996s)]
*  the stage talking about, it's not a political one. [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=2157.3599999999997s)]
*  We want a generation of kids to be upwardly mobile. [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=2160.3199999999997s)]
*  And these are kids and families who have been trapped in generations of [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=2163.7999999999997s)]
*  intergenerational poverty. [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=2170.36s)]
*  And also you hear it is not a clear path to classroom 2050. [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=2172.32s)]
*  So we have to be able to hold the optimism and hope and boldness, and [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=2176.64s)]
*  also realize that there's gonna be a lot of fear in the system pushing against this. [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=2182.2s)]
*  So I would just come back to what I said at the beginning, which is the importance [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=2187.0s)]
*  of collaboration in tackling this kind of educational change is just, [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=2190.88s)]
*  we need it more than ever before. [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=2198.2s)]
*  We need to be working across lines of difference. [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=2199.72s)]
*  We need to be coming together around a common vision for [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=2202.52s)]
*  what is possible for young people. [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=2206.12s)]
*  And that's just gonna take a different kind of conversation and dialogue. [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=2208.64s)]
*  And as we do that, as we talk about EdTech, continuing to come back to [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=2212.56s)]
*  the cultural and structural changes in education, which means just again, [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=2217.08s)]
*  continuing to think about how we organize schools. [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=2221.92s)]
*  Think about the choices we're giving to families and [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=2225.48s)]
*  making the job of teaching easier and more sustainable for teachers. [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=2227.88s)]
*  Thank you, Allison? [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=2232.12s)]
*  Okay, so from a gaming perspective, [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=2233.92s)]
*  I talk to a lot of parents who are like, yeah, my kids love Minecraft. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=2235.4s)]
*  I don't know what they do in there, but I know it's really lots of creativity. [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=2238.88s)]
*  So my call to action would be to play the game with your kids. [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=2242.6s)]
*  Or if you can't play the game with your kids, [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=2247.52s)]
*  sit beside them while they play. [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=2250.08s)]
*  Because in Minecraft, they're figuring out who they are as a human. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=2252.0s)]
*  If they're the person playing with their friends who's organizing the mission, [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=2256.68s)]
*  maybe they're going to grow up to be a leader or a manager. [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=2261.16s)]
*  If they're the person who's designing this incredible castle, [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=2264.8s)]
*  maybe they'll grow up to have a world in design or urban planning. [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=2268.96s)]
*  Or maybe they're the person that builds all the crazy machines with redstone. [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=2273.2400000000002s)]
*  So maybe they're gonna be an electrical engineer, or [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=2277.4s)]
*  they're gonna go into science in some way. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=2280.16s)]
*  And so it's a great way for you to get to know your kids on sort of a deeper level, [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=2282.92s)]
*  and then help them see the things that maybe they don't see about themselves. [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=2287.12s)]
*  Amazing. [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=2290.96s)]
*  Play with all of the above, that's the best way to learn it. [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=2291.48s)]
*  Yeah. And don't let fear get in the way of trying something out, [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=2293.88s)]
*  because if we do that, all that's gonna happen is all of our kids are gonna [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=2297.3599999999997s)]
*  benefit from all of this. [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=2299.92s)]
*  I'm not worried about them, but then the other kids are not. [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=2300.8399999999997s)]
*  And then that's gonna create a bigger divide. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=2303.08s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=2304.7599999999998s)]
*  Anarupa? [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=2305.3599999999997s)]
*  I'll be brief. [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=2306.12s)]
*  I know this panel was called the Classroom of 2050, but [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=2307.44s)]
*  I actually wanna be very clear. [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=2309.72s)]
*  It's the Classroom of 2023. [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=2311.04s)]
*  It's happening right now. [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=2312.64s)]
*  Go to a school near you. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=2314.68s)]
*  All of us have deployed to hundreds of school systems. [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=2316.16s)]
*  I mean, people who have been here for way longer than I have. [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=2319.2s)]
*  Millions and millions of kids are using. [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=2321.6s)]
*  So just wanted to end with that, that the technology's here, [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=2323.3599999999997s)]
*  the pedagogy's here, the teacher training is here. [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=2326.6s)]
*  We just now need to put our heads down and execute. [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=2328.8399999999997s)]
*  And if I were to have a last word, [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=2331.08s)]
*  the thing that I've seen missing in school districts, I've worked across many, [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=2332.7999999999997s)]
*  many of them, I have very large teams. [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=2335.48s)]
*  We were missing execution. [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=2337.92s)]
*  And that's what the everything is now there, pieces are there. [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=2339.8s)]
*  We just now need to collaborate and execute together. [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=2342.32s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=2344.8s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=2345.32s)]
*  And thank you so much, everyone, for listening. [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKfGSvtxkl8&t=2345.8s)]
