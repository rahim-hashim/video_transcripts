Video Description: What if the rise of Apple also built modern China?
a16z’s Erik Torenberg is joined by board partner and former Microsoft Windows chief Steven Sinofsky to unpack how Apple’s pursuit of design excellence and supply chain scale catalyzed China’s manufacturing superpower status - and why that partnership is now under intense scrutiny.
Inspired by the book Apple in China (but not a book review), the episode dives deep into:
- The early days of Apple’s shift to Chinese manufacturing 
- What experts got wrong in 1999 about trade, globalization, and China’s trajectory
- How Tim Cook’s operational playbook reshaped the global tech industry
- Behind-the-scenes stories from Microsoft’s own hardware battles and -Surface launch
- Why Apple’s entanglement with China may now be a strategic liability
- What COVID revealed about fragile global dependencies — and where innovation goes next
- How national policy, intellectual property, and AI intersect in the new industrial era
The episode opens with a few reactions to WWDC: Apple’s new UI, the iPad’s evolving role, and why Apple’s AI story still feels unfinished - before zooming out into one of the most consequential tech and geopolitical stories of our time.

# How Apple Became So Reliant on China & What it Means For Their Future
**The a16z Podcast:** [June 18, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs)
*  As Tim Cook says, people think that China is about cheap manufacturing. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=0.0s)]
*  It's the skills they have. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=4.4s)]
*  Apple would just argue there was no way we could even have started the iPhone anywhere else. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=6.08s)]
*  All the experts in 1999 were like two things. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=10.48s)]
*  Yay for global trade. This is what we all want. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=13.84s)]
*  And also, don't worry. China, they're going to stay a third world dictatorship forever. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=16.64s)]
*  They couldn't have been more wrong. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=22.96s)]
*  Steven, I've been looking forward to this episode because this is a full circle moment for me. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=30.88s)]
*  You were how I got introduced to A16Z. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=37.36s)]
*  You were on the board of Product Hunt over 11 years ago, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=39.28s)]
*  which is how I was introduced to you and the firm. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=42.88s)]
*  And I'm glad to be back in business together. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=45.6s)]
*  I couldn't be more excited for us to be working together on this one. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=47.760000000000005s)]
*  And then more in the future, I hope. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=51.36s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=53.28s)]
*  Yeah, definitely a reunion of sorts. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=53.6s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=55.6s)]
*  For those who haven't been longtime fans of the podcast or the firm, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=56.64s)]
*  you've been A16Z for over a decade as a board partner, etc. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=60.88s)]
*  And before that, you spent many years at Microsoft helping lead both office and Windows. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=64.56s)]
*  And you helped introduce the service PCs, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=70.88s)]
*  which is relevant to the conversation we're about to have. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=72.64s)]
*  So we're here to talk about Apple. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=75.6s)]
*  We're here to talk about, inspired by the book, Apple in China. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=78.24000000000001s)]
*  But first, let's briefly cover WWDC. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=80.8s)]
*  What reactions and how it takes we have from it? [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=84.88s)]
*  WWDC is their big yearly developer event. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=86.8s)]
*  It's a remarkable platform that's been doing yearly releases for 26 years. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=90.24s)]
*  It blows my mind what they've done and the scale that they operate at. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=95.92s)]
*  But I think, look, there are three big things that came out of it. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=100.64s)]
*  The first was obviously the big push. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=104.88s)]
*  It was also the big reaction, which was called Liquid Glass. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=108.64s)]
*  And it's the new user interface design. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=113.2s)]
*  So having gone through multiple big user interface redesigns of widely used products, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=116.24000000000001s)]
*  although to be humble about it, not one used by a billion people, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=122.08s)]
*  the reaction is extremely predictable, which is a bunch of people, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=125.84s)]
*  their heads just explode and they don't want it. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=129.44s)]
*  They don't like it. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=132.0s)]
*  You can always tell they dive in immediately to what problem does it solve? [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=132.64000000000001s)]
*  So if there's change, it must solve a problem. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=137.84s)]
*  But there are lots of reasons that designs change. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=140.0s)]
*  And then there's the reality. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=142.56s)]
*  This was the developer conference, so it's not done. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=143.76s)]
*  And Apple is very, very good at finishing these things. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=147.84s)]
*  And all the bugs and all the issues, I can't read it, it's blurry, it's noisy. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=152.64000000000001s)]
*  Those will all get fixed. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=157.52s)]
*  You know, and what's left is, is it great and is it unique enough? [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=159.36s)]
*  And time will tell. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=164.08s)]
*  I basically am reserving judgment and not joining in the hysteria on either side. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=165.52s)]
*  I have no need to defend it and no need to say it's the worst thing to happen [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=171.44s)]
*  to computing since ternary processors or something. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=174.96s)]
*  The second thing that I thought was huge personally was just that the iPad gets [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=178.88s)]
*  Windows with a lowercase W. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=185.12s)]
*  And I think that's just fascinating, like 12 different ways. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=188.24s)]
*  It goes back to the original toaster refrigerator comment or the iPad is different [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=194.24s)]
*  or Steve holding the iPad only like this because it was a book. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=199.04s)]
*  And it's just a recognition of who uses it and what they use it for. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=203.92s)]
*  I worry it's a little late. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=208.79999999999998s)]
*  Like I think a lot of people have made up their minds about what to use where. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=211.35999999999999s)]
*  Now the iPad sells an enormous number of units and people who don't use them don't understand [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=215.12s)]
*  that they sell more iPads than the laptop run rate in the US. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=220.48s)]
*  It's a big number and they're enormously popular with different segments. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=225.84s)]
*  It'll be interesting to see how this plays out. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=231.12s)]
*  The weirdest thing about it is the iPad is a Mac. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=233.36s)]
*  The Mac is an iPad in terms of the hardware. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=237.68s)]
*  And so you're really talking about a difference in software and how they deal with that over [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=240.16000000000003s)]
*  time and what apps run where and where is the experience is going to be super interesting. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=247.44000000000003s)]
*  The third thing was more an act of omission and commission and which was AI. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=251.67999999999998s)]
*  And the whole event sort of started with Craig apologizing in it. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=257.92s)]
*  Not really apologizing but in an Apple way which was like it took more time than we planned. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=262.8s)]
*  So we're not going to talk about it anymore. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=267.84s)]
*  And I personally think that months ago when they with a great fanfare launched all these AI features [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=270.24s)]
*  that was out of character for them. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=278.32s)]
*  They announced a bunch of stuff that they weren't done with yet that hadn't been. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=280.79999999999995s)]
*  It was the right stuff but they didn't capitalize on it to be polite. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=284.15999999999997s)]
*  And I think what they're probably doing is saying we're not really good at this pre-announce [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=289.91999999999996s)]
*  catch up to our own announcements thing which of course I grew up doing. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=296.0s)]
*  So I'm like completely comfortable in that world of just make stuff up and hope you catch up [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=299.28s)]
*  or people forget. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=303.84s)]
*  And so I think that they're back to like we're not the first mover company. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=305.03999999999996s)]
*  We're the first integrator company and they're going to just sit back and watch the technology [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=308.8s)]
*  mature a little bit more. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=314.24s)]
*  But they do have a hole in a perception sense which is Siri and what they're going to do about that. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=315.36s)]
*  And to not talk about it very much is interesting. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=322.96000000000004s)]
*  You know a lot of people have commented on the sort of the failures of Apple intelligence [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=326.72s)]
*  or just Apple's sort of inability to capitalize on this innovation. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=330.32000000000005s)]
*  We just saw Metta sort of purchase 49 percent of scale. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=335.76s)]
*  So they're making some big moves. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=341.28s)]
*  How do you make sense of Metta's move and could we see Apple do a similar type of play [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=342.88s)]
*  where they sort of buy the talent in-house or buy the company? [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=347.44s)]
*  How do you think about that? [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=350.0s)]
*  I think what Metta is doing is at the very least it's great for AI. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=352.15999999999997s)]
*  I'll let Metta decide how great it is for Metta or whatever but it's great for AI. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=358.24s)]
*  The reason is that if you go back the way platforms have been evolving, [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=362.40000000000003s)]
*  in mainframes IBM had 100 percent. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=370.48s)]
*  In PCs Microsoft had 95 percent. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=372.88000000000005s)]
*  Then you start getting out there and then in servers actually ended up being like [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=376.48s)]
*  at best case 50-50 and it's been downhill and it's all Linux now. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=381.12s)]
*  In phones you have this split 80-20 globally but you have to really dig down by [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=385.44000000000005s)]
*  country where it's 80-20 the other way. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=392.0s)]
*  In cloud it's very likely we're going to end up in a 40-40-20 kind of world. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=395.52s)]
*  So AI it's almost inconceivable that there'll be one winner. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=403.12s)]
*  The overlay is China and how that plays out. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=410.16s)]
*  The mobile industry is a really good example of how difficult it is. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=413.28s)]
*  The smartphones so to speak, Japan had this huge lead in this thing called iMode but it only [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=417.2s)]
*  existed in Japan. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=424.32s)]
*  They were leaders in technology and experience. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=428.64s)]
*  They had all these micro payments, all this stuff but it didn't go anywhere outside of the country. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=430.8s)]
*  The biggest risk to AI is that it becomes either someone tries to think it's only one player, [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=437.91999999999996s)]
*  which at times the federal government has acted like that, or one player says it should only be [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=444.4s)]
*  us, which there is a player sort of claiming that, or it gets geographically constrained. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=448.96s)]
*  It doesn't matter which one of those might happen. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=456.32s)]
*  To prevent any one of them you just need a lot of players operating at huge scale. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=459.2s)]
*  So we have in the startup world you have Anthropic and you have OpenAI. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=463.76s)]
*  You have in pure open source you have Meta. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=469.28000000000003s)]
*  Then you have Microsoft and Google. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=473.84000000000003s)]
*  We have innovation happening on all cylinders and all fronts, which is great because the competition [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=477.44s)]
*  is basically making the call that it's going to be one and it's sort of going to be this government [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=485.84000000000003s)]
*  driven approach. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=490.72s)]
*  It might not be one company but it will be one approach that's sort of sanctioned in some way. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=491.92s)]
*  It'll be interesting to see how that plays out. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=497.28s)]
*  There's nothing better than more and open for AI right now. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=500.47999999999996s)]
*  It's worth just commenting on the market structure point because when we look back [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=505.28s)]
*  at the last few years of our sort of growth investing in this category, [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=508.0s)]
*  we've been very aggressive but we regret not being even more aggressive. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=512.8s)]
*  Because one of those principles was, hey, we want to back the market leader. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=516.16s)]
*  When you see a second place company we're like, hey, it's not the market leader but in this market, [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=519.04s)]
*  as you mentioned, it's not winner take all or just the market is so big that even the second [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=523.12s)]
*  place, the third place can be generational companies. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=528.08s)]
*  We're not even at the point yet, which is where I believe we'll get, which is the initial [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=531.2s)]
*  go-to-market has all been this cloud-based thing but there's all these challenges with that like [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=536.5600000000001s)]
*  privacy and security and cost. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=541.52s)]
*  The idea that we would foist variable cost on the entire world of software, [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=545.6s)]
*  very tough for me as a fixed cost low price volume mindset to think will sustain. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=551.36s)]
*  I think there's a whole wave of AI on the edge that's going to happen, which only benefits from [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=556.5600000000001s)]
*  open. There's nothing but positive to say. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=563.28s)]
*  Does it make sense to look at this Alexander Wang or this sort of scale as something of like a [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=569.84s)]
*  $15 billion acquihire of Alex plus the top talent at scale? [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=574.5600000000001s)]
*  If you're advising Apple, do they or even some of the other big incumbents need to do [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=578.72s)]
*  something similar? Obviously, Microsoft is what we'll start with opening out to begin with but [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=583.84s)]
*  if you're Apple, how do you think about how to play here? [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=588.08s)]
*  Well, I think the two plays or three, one is going to be the weird partnership dance play that [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=591.04s)]
*  Microsoft and OpenAI have. It seems obvious that at some point Microsoft will have much more [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=597.6s)]
*  first party software. We have always made our play by just having everything, which is Amazon. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=603.6s)]
*  Anything that comes out, they're going to end up supporting, which is just how retail works. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=613.36s)]
*  You get all the cereals, not just Froot Loops. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=618.96s)]
*  Then I think there's just the where we're going to go our own way in a sense, which is Gemini [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=622.32s)]
*  taking their approach or OpenAI itself or Anthropic itself. I think that Apple needs to pick one. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=628.8s)]
*  They did announce like, hey, you can call any model through our API, but the real thing that [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=636.64s)]
*  Apple needs to do is figure out what model is going to be tuned to run on their unique hardware on the [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=640.48s)]
*  edge and their unique offering or constraint depending on privacy and how that plays out. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=646.4s)]
*  Just to evaluate one of those paths, if Satya could go back in time knowing what he knows now, [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=652.96s)]
*  do you think he might have done something or would you have considered doing something different? [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=658.0s)]
*  How should we think about how this has worked out for Microsoft? [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=662.5600000000001s)]
*  These are tricky things. You can't ask me questions about my friends. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=664.72s)]
*  Putting aside his advice, I would say, I genuinely, to those listening, I do not know anything that's [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=668.64s)]
*  going on. Microsoft has been involved in AI research since 1993. They were the first hires [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=675.44s)]
*  into Microsoft research when the labs were formed. I was working for Bill way back then. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=685.2s)]
*  Satya worked closely with those researchers when he was the manager of the Bing team for a while [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=690.24s)]
*  because that was the cornerstone of what Bing was doing because that's what Google was doing in say [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=694.96s)]
*  2006, 2007, something like that. I would not be at all surprised. I don't know anything. I swear [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=700.48s)]
*  people that there's some first party thing that they're just trying to figure out when and how [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=709.2s)]
*  good does it have to be because if you are Microsoft, it turns out that the strength of [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=714.4s)]
*  Microsoft is that you never have to be best. You just have to be included. It's likely that [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=720.0s)]
*  that will be their play. That's generally how enterprise software works. It's the inclusion [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=728.56s)]
*  and the bundle that customers value and pay lots of money for not being the very, very best at any [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=732.8s)]
*  given moment. It's fascinating how all the big players have sort of crystallized their [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=739.28s)]
*  approaches in response to each other. I want to segue to the main focus of our conversation [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=744.08s)]
*  today, which is not a book review of Apple in China, though it's a great book, but inspired [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=749.0400000000001s)]
*  by the book. There's a few things I just want to say. First, just the notion that I believe [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=752.72s)]
*  they said Apple invests $55 billion a year in China. I think the author said that's equivalent [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=758.48s)]
*  or maybe even bigger than the entirety of the Marshall Plan. It is just astronomical. This book [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=764.0s)]
*  talks about how Apple not only built its company in China, but also helped build China itself, [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=770.4s)]
*  China's sort of manufacturing economy and introduced the level of talent and knowledge [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=776.0s)]
*  or sort of taught China not just how to build phones, but that same sort of knowledge then [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=781.6s)]
*  to help build Tesla, which are phones on wheels, and then led to other sort of [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=787.92s)]
*  technologies used for the military, which we'll get to. But first, I just want to ask, [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=793.76s)]
*  was this inevitable? Did this make sense at the time? How do we make sense of this 20 years later? [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=798.8000000000001s)]
*  How did this all happen? It is crazy how it all happened. I mean, I think you go back, like, [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=804.88s)]
*  of course, Apple, we all know it was in the garage in Palo Alto. They famously built the computers [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=809.44s)]
*  there. But the thing was, from the very beginning, Apple itself was all about super tight control. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=814.48s)]
*  I mean, first you had Woz basically creating works of art on the motherboard. And then they [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=820.88s)]
*  built a factory. You know, there was the factory right here. And that's where they built computers. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=827.28s)]
*  And they just kept doing more of that tight control, build the whole computer. Then Steve [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=832.3199999999999s)]
*  left Apple. Macintosh, of course, was famously the same thing. But Steve pushed and pushed on costs [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=839.92s)]
*  and the shape of it made the famous toaster that you carry around and things like that. But [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=845.68s)]
*  after Steve left, the company had enormous difficulty competing with the IBM PC. One of [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=851.12s)]
*  the things that it did sort of later, like in the late 1990s, was a super innovative laptop. Now, [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=857.68s)]
*  everybody's like, what does a little innovative laptop mean? Well, it turns out in the late 1990s, [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=867.04s)]
*  laptops, nobody bought them. They were slow, expensive, bad computers. They were just portable. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=870.16s)]
*  That was their big thing. And if you had to have one, you did. But they built this thing that was [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=878.16s)]
*  the original portable for Mac called PowerBook. And they tried to cram a lot as they tried to make [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=881.8399999999999s)]
*  the best laptop possible. And in order to do that, they ultimately were hitting the limits of [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=889.04s)]
*  manufacturing in the US. And so Jean-Louis Gasset, who was running the Macintosh business at the time, [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=896.16s)]
*  he was very famous French executive for Apple that Steve hired to run Apple France, [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=902.5600000000001s)]
*  working for Scully. He actually pushed to do an experiment of like partnering with Sony in Japan [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=909.28s)]
*  to build a PowerBook. And so the original PowerBook line had sort of three computers of [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=915.6800000000001s)]
*  different sizes, power and whatever. And the one model was done as a joint design effort with [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=920.88s)]
*  something which was just incredibly brazen for Apple culture to like break out like that. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=926.48s)]
*  And they did. And like it came back and the people at Apple were like, wow, man, this is not so bad. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=931.92s)]
*  It wasn't the best selling model, a lot of complexity, and you could read all about it [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=939.92s)]
*  in this book or other places. But it sort of a light bulb went off. Like, maybe this helps us [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=943.04s)]
*  solve some of our constraints. Now they had other constraints, like the chips were wrong for the Mac. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=949.04s)]
*  The PC was like half the price, like a lot of problems they had. But it was like a wow moment. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=953.84s)]
*  And that was really interesting. But they were failing at computers. Tim Cook joins Apple in like [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=960.8000000000001s)]
*  1997. And he comes from IBM. And at IBM, he was like about making PCs. And he shows up and he's [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=967.44s)]
*  already working this whole kind of world of supply chain and all this other stuff. He then [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=976.48s)]
*  later goes to Compaq, which is a famous Texas based computer maker, and does really helps them [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=983.04s)]
*  drive that whole motion of building in China. And I'll talk about that maybe in a minute. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=993.9200000000001s)]
*  But the thing that gets built by Apple, then in 1999, is this iMac G3. Now most people aren't [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=999.36s)]
*  old enough to remember it, but it was this sort of gumdrop shape translucent, Johnny Ive creation. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=1008.48s)]
*  And you look at that, you're like, wow, that's neat. And you're like, no, you don't understand. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=1014.64s)]
*  It was impossible. Like every element of that computer couldn't be built. Not just the stuff [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=1018.24s)]
*  that they left off, like it didn't have serial ports and parallel ports and all this other stuff. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=1023.84s)]
*  But it was like clear plastic. Computers came in gray stamped aluminum metal boxes with screws. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=1028.4s)]
*  And this was like a tool-less, fanless, like amazing thing. And it was all done through this [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=1035.52s)]
*  China based manufacturing stuff. But it was done in a very unique way at the time, [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=1044.0800000000002s)]
*  which was the Apple people just went there and smothered the manufacturing line. And they, [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=1049.68s)]
*  every step and samples back and forth and this whole deal. And I'm glossing over a very complex [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=1054.1599999999999s)]
*  timeline of events. And it sounds a little bit more all or nothing in sudden, but it's a very [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=1060.24s)]
*  gradual transition. But this product was huge. And then the next one was the iPod. And so now [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=1064.8s)]
*  they're already comfortable with this model a little bit, but the iPod was like all of a sudden [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=1073.6s)]
*  the assembly of it starts to look like, almost like a war games screen of all these [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=1078.0s)]
*  incoming things. Because it's like a disk drive invented in Japan, manufactured in Thailand. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=1083.36s)]
*  And all the stuff is coming together. And all the parts, the click wheel and everything are in China. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=1091.12s)]
*  And it's all of a sudden being made in one place in this incredible form factor. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=1095.76s)]
*  Like if you were to look at the other media players at the time, they were these big honking [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=1100.1599999999999s)]
*  plat- they looked like game console things. Like not this solid deck of cards glued together with [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=1104.7199999999998s)]
*  no tolerances. I mean, it's incredible. And so that was really the start of designed in Cupertino, [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=1111.52s)]
*  manufactured in China. And that whole process. And that was celebrated at the time, [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=1118.96s)]
*  because we were excited about sort of more integration with China. So that wasn't seen [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=1124.8799999999999s)]
*  as such a problematic thing at the time, right? Oh, it's absolutely. It's even more than that. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=1130.72s)]
*  This was like hailed as like, this is the modern way to do business. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=1135.52s)]
*  An example of this that's just super close to home about how things have changed was that [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=1141.44s)]
*  in 1999, the World Trade Organization gathered in Seattle to ratify China as a member of the World [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=1146.3999999999999s)]
*  Trade Organization. And this is the organization that sort of navigates tariffs and trade rules [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=1154.56s)]
*  between countries. All the cool countries were in it, but not like communist, socialist, China, [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=1160.16s)]
*  without a totalitarian government. And so the Clinton administration had really pushed for [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=1166.64s)]
*  China to come in and it actually split the Democratic Party. People today, their heads [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=1174.48s)]
*  would explode if you tried to sell it. And it turns out the Republicans were split too, [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=1178.5600000000002s)]
*  because half the Republicans were like, free trade, free trade, free trade. And the other half were [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=1183.2s)]
*  like, we hate communism, we hate communism. So the whole world, if you look back in 1990, [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=1187.6s)]
*  it's like completely upside down from today. And there were huge riots in Seattle. Like the city [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=1192.8s)]
*  was like a mess over this moment, because it was viewed as this basic, like this pro-business, [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=1201.28s)]
*  anti-labor kind of thing, because it just meant cheap outsourcing in China. Now, the reason for [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=1207.4399999999998s)]
*  that was because that was the whole direction of American business. There's a very famous book in [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=1212.48s)]
*  the 80s called In Search of Excellence. And In Search of Excellence is sort of this Jack Welchian [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=1217.44s)]
*  GE management mantra of like, what you do, you stick to your knitting. Like you do the stuff that [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=1222.64s)]
*  you're good at and you outsource everything else. And you figure out that core part of your company. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=1229.6000000000001s)]
*  And it was like, that was what you just did. Like you don't have full-time people to water the plants, [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=1235.76s)]
*  you don't have full-time people to cook in the kitchen, you don't have full-time people [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=1241.6000000000001s)]
*  manufacturing. You just do that elsewhere. And that was the state of American business. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=1244.96s)]
*  It was like, let's get into China. We got the support of the president, it's the whole global [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=1250.88s)]
*  market. Let's reduce trade barriers between countries. And so it was celebrated as the [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=1256.08s)]
*  start of a whole new industrial era. So at what point did that change both for Apple as a company, [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=1263.52s)]
*  that they realized, hey, maybe we have some risks here, but also from a geopolitical standpoint? [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=1269.28s)]
*  Was it when she came to power? Was it when Trump was elected? How did things start to change? [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=1275.52s)]
*  It helps on this one to go a little bit backwards, I think too, because before we get to like, when [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=1280.72s)]
*  did Apple recognize? We should say like, there are other examples of everybody doing this. And [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=1285.36s)]
*  the reason it's important is because it contrasts with Apple, which is the PC industry created what [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=1291.52s)]
*  enabled Apple to do what Apple did. So Apple was on this path of like, [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=1297.6000000000001s)]
*  let's manufacture in China and let's keep very tight control. But the PC industry had a whole [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=1302.3200000000002s)]
*  different approach, which was this much more classical in search of excellence outsourcing [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=1308.3200000000002s)]
*  method. So Dell and Compaq, which were the two big makers with IBM, were in Texas. And Michael was [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=1313.2800000000002s)]
*  building PCs in his dorm room, and then they had a factory in Texas. Compaq were some business guys [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=1320.0800000000002s)]
*  who built a whole factory in Texas. And the parts were being flown in from wherever they came from, [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=1324.72s)]
*  disk drives from this country, CPUs from Intel in the US, whatever, cables from China and stuff [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=1329.3600000000001s)]
*  like that, and assembling them in the US. But the problem was they were all standard parts. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=1334.4s)]
*  Like, when you bought a computer from Dell and from Compaq, if you open them up, [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=1339.76s)]
*  Intel processors, Seagate disk drive, also from US, you know, like all. And so they were really [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=1345.1200000000001s)]
*  not competing on who could buy those parts and put them into a gray or beige box more quickly. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=1351.04s)]
*  They were competing on the other three P's of the marketing mix, which is price, place and promotion, [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=1357.6s)]
*  not just product. And so if you go back to in search of excellence, well, the idea is, well, [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=1363.68s)]
*  since we can't compete on manufacturing, let's just make it as cheap as possible. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=1368.24s)]
*  And so they, Compaq led, and they were making the cases for Compaqs, which were these like [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=1374.0s)]
*  15 pound aluminum, like you could, they were like shipping containers, basically, that held the PC. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=1379.92s)]
*  They were making those in China. So it was the biggest, heaviest part. So it sort of made sense [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=1385.44s)]
*  to see like, how many parts could we get in the box before we ship the box to the US, which was [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=1389.3600000000001s)]
*  two thirds of the market. And so they just started going to these assembly plants. And they went to [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=1394.24s)]
*  one and said, we want you to build our PC. And they said, you got it. Because these guys, they are [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=1400.48s)]
*  hungry. They, they want, and they were just having the ability because of WTO and all this other stuff [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=1405.92s)]
*  to like open up and just do business. And so they were like the capitalists in South China. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=1412.0800000000002s)]
*  And so they were like, whatever you want us to do, we're going to do it. And so Compaq being very, [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=1417.76s)]
*  you know, they want secrecy and intellectual party. So they were like, that we'll build you a building. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=1422.64s)]
*  And so all of a sudden, Compaq had like a building that was theirs. And then they went to a Dell and [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=1426.96s)]
*  we'll build you a building too. And also there's this other company that makes music players. They [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=1433.9199999999998s)]
*  have a building over here and all these makers were starting to serve multiple PC companies. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=1437.6s)]
*  And then the PC companies were like, Hey, this is kind of working for us because we're crushing [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=1445.52s)]
*  Apple in the marketplace and our PCs are getting cheaper and people are buying more. And the [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=1449.6799999999998s)]
*  Windows 95 thing is taking off. Everything is just dandy. And so they, they started just like saying, [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=1454.6399999999999s)]
*  Hey, we don't even need engineers. Like we, whereas Apple was like flying more and more people to do [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=1461.12s)]
*  more and more advanced stuff. They were like more gray boxes, more interchangeable parts, more lower [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=1466.4799999999998s)]
*  cost. We'll just keep selling more and making it up in volume. And that's exactly what was happening. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=1471.84s)]
*  And so these people, which were called ODM's original design and manufacturers were saying, [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=1476.9599999999998s)]
*  you just tell us roughly what you want. We'll make it. And so you'd go to meetings with them [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=1482.2399999999998s)]
*  and they would just show prototypes of all the computers they could build. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=1488.4s)]
*  And they would just, you pick, you want this one, you, and they're like, a little taller, [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=1492.16s)]
*  smaller, thicker, thinner. We want to be able to swap out graphics cards. Yes, yes, yes. And yes. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=1496.0s)]
*  And here's the Dell logo on it. And then they got very, very good. So they were effectively [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=1501.2s)]
*  moving up the stack and becoming product makers and designers. And they began, the reason is very [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=1506.72s)]
*  simple. They also couldn't compete on labor. Like the way that the government's working, [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=1513.04s)]
*  the socialist part of this experiment was you can't live anywhere you want in China. You have to, [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=1517.76s)]
*  you live where you're born. And if you want to move, it's a whole thing. You're not allowed to [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=1524.24s)]
*  just move. But what China was doing was taking all the hundreds of millions of poor people [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=1527.44s)]
*  and letting them live temporarily in all the factories of all kinds, clothes and cars and [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=1532.96s)]
*  computers, and live for part of the year and then bring massive amounts of cash back to the [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=1538.4s)]
*  world. And that's how China lifted a billion people out of poverty. Well, those are all the same [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=1543.3600000000001s)]
*  workers. So you can't get a better deal on labor. And then you're all going to the same ODMs who [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=1547.92s)]
*  are building the same factories. So it's hard to get a better deal on that. So the ODMs were just, [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=1555.52s)]
*  in order to compete, they were moving up the food chain. And the American electronics world, [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=1560.16s)]
*  whether it was TVs or whatever, we're like, yeah, or Japan, we're doing it with Sony. We're like, [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=1564.4s)]
*  we love this. Just keep showing us more stuff. We can put our brand, our name on, and we'll just [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=1569.2800000000002s)]
*  focus on sales and marketing and distribution and branding. We're awesome. And so the start of all [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=1573.2800000000002s)]
*  of this was really, and by the way, like little things, like there were all of a sudden 50 [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=1579.2800000000002s)]
*  different music players, because all that knowledge was distributed throughout all these makers. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=1583.3600000000001s)]
*  And so it was very, very interesting. Now, what was really going on? What's it like to visit one of [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=1589.1200000000001s)]
*  these ODMs? Like, these guys are crazy. Like, so you think like, when I first went, they're like, [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=1594.64s)]
*  you've been there a few times, a bunch. Oh, I lived in China, like in 2004, even. And that's all I did [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=1600.8s)]
*  was visit all these people all the time and the government and we go on forever. But the thing [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=1605.28s)]
*  about these was, you know, you think you'd go and it's like a factory, like how exciting. And I've [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=1609.84s)]
*  been to like car factories and washing machine factories, because they're all Microsoft customers. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=1614.64s)]
*  So you go and you visit them and they all show you plants and stuff. And, you know, you go and [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=1618.16s)]
*  like, all of a sudden you're like, oh my God, this is like a hospital. Like, and I'd been to Intel, [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=1621.92s)]
*  which is like an operating room, like it's all bunny suits and all the, but this is like, [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=1626.3200000000002s)]
*  they're just joining parts. It's the same thing I do in my living room when I buy a PC, like I'm [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=1630.72s)]
*  just putting all the parts here, but they, you know, these things are football fields. And I [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=1634.3200000000002s)]
*  should say, just for baseline, I did summer jobs at the factory that built intercontinental [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=1638.3200000000002s)]
*  ballistic missiles and surface to air missiles in Orlando. So I've seen big giant factory floors [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=1644.24s)]
*  before. There are like thousands of people on hundreds of acres of assembly and you just watch [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=1649.36s)]
*  like computers flying off. And, and so the owners of these are very proud and they, they take you on [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=1655.6s)]
*  tour. You go and you meet the CEO, founder of these ODMs and they take you on the tour. They show you [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=1662.16s)]
*  everything, show you every step in the line. And then they, but you know, they show you the one [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=1667.36s)]
*  you're allowed to see. So like I was at Microsoft, I couldn't see any of them. So, but I can see, [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=1670.96s)]
*  he was very proud to always show me like one step in the process. And that was the step when they [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=1676.48s)]
*  attached the windows logo to the PC, something Steve Jobs would never have allowed, but the [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=1681.52s)]
*  windows logo meant it was a legal copy of windows. The whole reason I moved to China was because they [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=1686.32s)]
*  were stealing windows in office left and right. And my job was to sort of somehow help to see if [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=1690.8s)]
*  we could stop that. But, but they were very proud and very legal about that step. And so I have lots [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=1695.28s)]
*  of photos of stickers being put on, on computers. And then you go and you just go outside and he [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=1700.96s)]
*  goes, that's where we make HP laptops. That's where we make, and this is where we make those other [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=1706.8s)]
*  laptops that we're not allowed to tell you about. And that's the difference. Like, and, and what was [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=1712.3999999999999s)]
*  going on in the Apple building was just super important. And that's where he gets the answer [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=1718.48s)]
*  to your question. Like the Apple building was like fast forward a little bit and they're building [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=1723.12s)]
*  what became the MacBook Air. And so like the MacBook Air goes back to the original Powerbook [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=1728.1599999999999s)]
*  100 experiment, which was how can we take what basically suck, which are laptops that people, [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=1733.84s)]
*  windows people use? Like give you an idea. Like when the MacBook Air came out, the typical [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=1739.9199999999998s)]
*  knowledge worker in a company was traveling with about six pounds of computer gear, [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=1744.1599999999999s)]
*  yeah, which was a laptop. It was probably an inch and a half thick, you know, nine by 12. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=1748.64s)]
*  It had one of these padded laptop cases that you sometimes see. It was awful. I actually wouldn't [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=1753.8400000000001s)]
*  even travel. I only use like Japanese laptops that, that were sitting on envelopes and stuff. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=1759.44s)]
*  And then they would, so the Apple was building the MacBook Air. And so now we know it was this [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=1763.6000000000001s)]
*  machine milled aluminum chassis in that building that they showed us. And, and it was like [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=1770.24s)]
*  remarkable. Now, now Steve held it up and put it in an envelope and everybody, [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=1777.84s)]
*  and I'm like, my Sony fits in an envelope, but my Sony was $3,500 made by hand in Japan. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=1783.28s)]
*  And, and this was kind of a miracle. And the problem was that the, the ODM who was on tour [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=1789.76s)]
*  with me, you know, we went up, so this is what happens. You go on the tour, they take you up a [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=1797.84s)]
*  secret elevator and then you're, it's like, you're literally above the factory. And all of a sudden [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=1801.52s)]
*  I'm like in a Bond movie and, and like I, the elevator door opens and you're in this football [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=1806.8s)]
*  ball field sides office with like a tea ceremony room and like weird ancient suits of armor for [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=1813.6s)]
*  art. Were you ever terrified? I was completely terrified. I'm like, I'm like, oh my, and of [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=1820.32s)]
*  course nothing ever, no one ever gets hurt. But like, what the hell? Like I'm like looking, is [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=1824.48s)]
*  there a stairway that's going to turn to a slide and I'm going to end up being eaten by Japanese [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=1829.52s)]
*  sharks, Chinese sharks or something. But there's like ancient scrolls and we have to go through [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=1832.8s)]
*  in every single piece of art. I'm getting the story and every, and I, and I'm like, I'm jet lag, [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=1836.96s)]
*  and I have to pee and like, I'm here to just make sure the stickers are going on the laptops, [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=1841.6s)]
*  but I'm getting the full deal. And then we sit down and he's like, the windows people are losing. [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=1845.68s)]
*  That's me. Yeah. And because I am building these great things and, and then he shows me [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=1852.8s)]
*  prototypes for all these windows computers. So these are the ones that he built without any help [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=1858.56s)]
*  from the Apple people. And he's like, we could build these, but we can't convince, you know, [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=1863.9199999999998s)]
*  Michael or, or, or compact or anybody to build them. They're too expensive or whatever. I can [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=1870.1599999999999s)]
*  make them cheaper. But, and I also, and this is where they get candid, like it's very difficult [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=1874.8s)]
*  to work with those people. They, they don't give them any degrees of freedom. He can't be creative, [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=1879.28s)]
*  but he also can't move up the stack. And the PC people just wouldn't do it. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=1884.48s)]
*  And so two lessons from that. One is that Apple taught them how to do this. Now they didn't plan [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=1890.88s)]
*  on doing that, but osmosis happens and they got all these skills. And then the other was [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=1897.76s)]
*  Apple was still going to uniquely do it and no one else was going to come and invest that money. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=1904.4s)]
*  Now we were there also at one point to help them help get surface built. We were actually doing it [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=1909.68s)]
*  to solve the problem. The reason surface exists is because the PC makers wouldn't build like an [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=1915.52s)]
*  aluminum computer basically, or an all in one for that matter. And so like we actually, we did a [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=1920.8s)]
*  whole different approach to metal. We actually built a whole metallurgy plant to do injective [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=1927.12s)]
*  magnesium alloy for the original surface computer that ran Nvidia chips and all this other stuff. [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=1931.76s)]
*  And then, and, and we were going to light, we were willing to make cases of any size or shape for [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=1937.36s)]
*  the OEMs, but they just saw it as a niche. And so Apple, so the PC makers just continued to stamp [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=1943.6s)]
*  out routine things for at least three more years until Intel finally invested a bunch of money [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=1951.04s)]
*  in the OEMs via pricing to get them to build what today look like laptops for windows called [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=1957.2s)]
*  ultrabooks. Yeah. And, and, but Apple just continued to do that and they were building [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=1962.56s)]
*  that expertise just inadvertently. And then Intel came in and piled on more. And so more people knew, [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=1968.8s)]
*  except in this sort of the slightly more open part of China. And so it, it just, it, it was like this [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=1974.0s)]
*  slow moving osmosis that gets us to the point where, as Tim Cook says, people think that China [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=1982.24s)]
*  is about cheap manufacturing, but it's the skills they have. Like nobody else in the world could run [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=1988.64s)]
*  500 prototyping aluminum milling machines at one time and produce the right defect rate and save [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=1995.76s)]
*  all the waste and develop all the stuff, you know, all these things. Like when we're making surface, [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=2001.3600000000001s)]
*  you know, you have to use all this pressure sensitive adhesive and keep all the things [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=2005.68s)]
*  together to make it USB thickness. And like, nobody here knows how to do that. They were telling us [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=2008.3200000000002s)]
*  what they were doing. Yeah. And, and that is what happened. And it was not by, it was not a design. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=2014.64s)]
*  And that's one of the differences I have with the book. The book is clear. It wasn't on purpose, [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=2021.6000000000001s)]
*  but it still makes it seem like we could have stopped it at any point. And I don't, not only do I [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=2026.16s)]
*  not see that we could have, there was no interest in stopping it. Like it for the global view of trade, [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=2031.44s)]
*  it was working exactly as planned for everybody. Yeah. And so let's get, now get back to when did [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=2037.92s)]
*  that start to change? I don't know if it's going to book or someone said, Hey, China has Apple by [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=2043.76s)]
*  the balls or has us by the balls. Let's talk about that. And we realized that happened at one point. [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=2047.84s)]
*  It's the point of no return. So the point of no return was basically, I would say two years into [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=2053.12s)]
*  the iPhone, the scale was such, there was nowhere else. I'm sure Apple would just argue, Oh, there [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=2057.44s)]
*  was no way we could even have started the iPhone anywhere else. And I could tell you we like surface, [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=2062.88s)]
*  there was no chance we were, and that's a low volume product. Like there was no, no chance. And [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=2068.8s)]
*  most things are very low volume, which makes the non-recurring engineering costs much higher. [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=2073.36s)]
*  So even more impossible to build all the startups. You know, you can't even consider doing that. So [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=2080.0s)]
*  like the point of no return happened so long ago that it's sort of a weird thing to think about [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=2087.6000000000004s)]
*  $50 billion a year investment, because that's not what did it. What did it was, was this unique [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=2092.88s)]
*  blend of socialism or totalitarianism and entrepreneurship. And that's the thing that [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=2099.36s)]
*  all the experts got wrong. All the experts in 1999 were like two things, yay for global trade. This [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=2105.44s)]
*  is what we all want. And also, don't worry, China is, they're going to stay a third world dictatorship [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=2112.88s)]
*  forever. They couldn't have been more wrong. And frankly, that's how I felt living there. [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=2120.32s)]
*  Right. Like I was like, it does, you know, like, yes, obviously, it fuels the South's herring. Like [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=2126.48s)]
*  you turn on CNN and you're watching and then it vanishes. And you're like, well, that was weird. [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=2131.6800000000003s)]
*  You know, you try to connect to a website randomly from Lincoln, you can't see it anymore. And there [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=2134.96s)]
*  are all these people that work for the government in our office and I can't talk to them. And I don't [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=2139.52s)]
*  know why they're there. I'm their boss. It's super weird. Like there's a lot of stuff that is an [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=2143.76s)]
*  American, you're like, this is just kind of strange. But you go to the ODM. I could have been visiting [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=2147.76s)]
*  Kimberly Clark in a plant or Kellogg's. It looked like a factory with a person who was like, just [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=2154.0s)]
*  tell me what I can make and sell. I'm there for you. And so you're in this weird hybrid world that [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=2160.0800000000004s)]
*  was completely predicted wrong. And so you wake up and you're like, oh, well, they were really [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=2168.0800000000004s)]
*  working. And a great way to think of it is like the car industry. So the car industry, there was [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=2175.36s)]
*  no auto industry when I was living in China. All the cars were Volkswagen or Mercedes. And that's [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=2179.76s)]
*  what everybody drove around. That's what if you owned a car, you own the Volkswagen. If you got [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=2185.92s)]
*  driven around, you got driven around a Mercedes. And that's just how it was. And the way they got [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=2189.1200000000003s)]
*  there was by doing these joint ventures with the China. And that was the mandated way. And the joint [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=2193.36s)]
*  venture came with like, you know, these terms that were onerous, like you had to give them all your IP, [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=2198.08s)]
*  right? You know, and for us, like even to get a license to sell software, not that Anna was [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=2203.36s)]
*  buying it legally, but to sell software, you had to sort of allow these inspectors to come in and [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=2207.36s)]
*  see stuff. And like we had to shut down Hotmail for forever because like we wouldn't let them see [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=2211.6800000000003s)]
*  the data center servers, which weren't even in China and all sorts of complexities. But if you [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=2217.84s)]
*  wanted to sell into the world's largest population market, that was your choice. Comply or not. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=2222.7200000000003s)]
*  In the meantime, they're the entrepreneurs in Southern China are they're not looking at Beijing [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=2229.44s)]
*  for government direction. They're actually going, well, we have to beat Korea. We have to beat Japan. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=2235.2s)]
*  We have to beat Singapore. We have to beat Vietnam or Indonesia. And those are all their neighbors. [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=2240.48s)]
*  And they see them all. And and like we met once with until the car companies, if you just fast [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=2245.12s)]
*  forward, they all are out of China now. These joint ventures, they could never get their money out. [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=2250.72s)]
*  They lost all their IP. They're mad. It's just horrible to like Volkswagen, Ford, Mercedes. This [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=2254.7999999999997s)]
*  has been a nightmare. Tesla doesn't have didn't have to do a joint venture, which is sort of the [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=2259.9199999999996s)]
*  modern thing, just like Apple, where they were allowed to operate. But it turns out there are [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=2264.0s)]
*  all these soft ways that the company could be miserable. That's where it goes from entrepreneurship [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=2268.72s)]
*  right to the socialist totalitarianism, where they can just, you know, the Communist Party could [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=2274.48s)]
*  just say, we all need to have phones and we like this model from Huawei. Yeah. Or we're picking a [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=2278.96s)]
*  new 5G standard and it's going to step all over the Qualcomm patents, but it's only in China where [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=2285.36s)]
*  we enforce the laws. And you're like, but the WTO says the what says what? Like, and you know, [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=2291.52s)]
*  you get really stuck on this kind of stuff. And and I think what what everybody learned was in, [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=2297.44s)]
*  you know, say 2000s 2010 was very easy to pour money into China. Yeah, but it doesn't come out. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=2303.92s)]
*  Nobody the returns just aren't aren't there. And then it's also easy if you're one of the blessed [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=2310.16s)]
*  sort of companies to sort of grow. But but then all these soft things happen. Now, a lot of people [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=2315.6800000000003s)]
*  love to say how that's just totalitarian governance, but they forget, like the history of trade in [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=2321.28s)]
*  America. Yeah, you know, like, it's actually, you know, or we talk about the EU a lot. But you know, [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=2326.7200000000003s)]
*  we have a lot of these soft things, too. You know, like when San Francisco County wants to buy [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=2331.76s)]
*  fleet vehicles, they don't they just say, well, they have to be American cars. Right. Like, [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=2337.6800000000003s)]
*  they don't even think about it. They're like, step one has to be an American car. Yeah. And when the [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=2343.1200000000003s)]
*  Defense Department buys stuff, like there's a massively thousand long thousand page list of [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=2347.92s)]
*  all the things that you have to check off in order to be sold to the defense department to the outside [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=2352.48s)]
*  world that looks like safety and security. But it also could be viewed just as much as protectionism. [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=2357.92s)]
*  Yeah. And it's this it's just two sides of a coin. Yeah. Okay, so the when we look at [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=2363.76s)]
*  Apple's dependency on China, when does this go from sort of, okay, this is great to, okay, this is [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=2371.04s)]
*  actually an existential risk for the for the company? Or would you say we are there yet? Or [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=2379.2000000000003s)]
*  how is this developed, you know, into the into the current era? The easiest way to view the wakeup [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=2384.32s)]
*  call is is through the lens of COVID. Right. I think which is all of a sudden, the entire world [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=2389.84s)]
*  learned that this global system, while great for prices, great for in search of excellence, focus [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=2395.52s)]
*  on what you're knitting and what you do well, it turns out it's it's actually pretty fragile. Yeah. [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=2402.88s)]
*  And it's fragile because there's single points of failure all over the place. Yeah. And, and in this [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=2407.28s)]
*  case, the single point of failure turned out to be like, well, you can't go all if this city is closed, [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=2413.92s)]
*  no one can go into the factory. Yeah. And then if if transit is closed, then the stuff can't make it. [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=2418.7200000000003s)]
*  And so I just think COVID was the wakeup call for the whole system. And of course, at the national [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=2425.28s)]
*  security level, it's, it's massively important now, because you know, you can't afford to have a [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=2431.92s)]
*  nation shut down, right, because of these things. And if all the technologies are based on chips, [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=2439.6s)]
*  which are assembled in one place and packaged by these people who have all the skills to package [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=2444.96s)]
*  them that you go, well, that's that's sort of a problem. Now, the defense weren't long ago, [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=2450.0s)]
*  figured this out for like, guns and rockets, like those are all made in the US, like, you know, the [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=2453.6s)]
*  the military sidearm is a Beretta pistol, which is the oldest company in the world in Italy. And, [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=2459.7599999999998s)]
*  you know, the first thing Italy did to win the bid was set up a factory in the US. And so good [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=2465.76s)]
*  news, we have plenty of sidearms that we could throw at the drones or something, you know, but [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=2469.92s)]
*  drones is the opposite end of the spectrum. Like, all of a sudden, drones are the most important [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=2475.6000000000004s)]
*  thing. And like, all of a sudden, we were like, we don't even we don't not just we don't make the [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=2479.6800000000003s)]
*  drone, we don't make any of the parts for the drone. Yeah. And they're all made. The only person [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=2485.92s)]
*  makes them is our enemy, so to speak. So this seems to be a problem. And so let's say Trump [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=2490.4s)]
*  brings you in and says, Hey, I've noticed that you nearly all of computing is in every level stack [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=2495.44s)]
*  is is done in China and Asia more broadly. And I'm trying to sort of decrease our dependencies. [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=2501.2000000000003s)]
*  Microsoft man, what should I do? Well, obviously, there are much smarter people who know more and [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=2508.32s)]
*  have much more at stake than I do trying to solve this. I mean, you have to do it. Yeah, like it. [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=2513.04s)]
*  The thing is, it goes against all these academics that were experts in 2000 that said it was good. [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=2519.6s)]
*  But they didn't think about all of these. Like, nobody thought that the dependency would be on, [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=2524.96s)]
*  on, you know, sort of the replacement for the Soviet Union in terms of long time enemy. And so [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=2531.36s)]
*  you now you know, no more would we be dependent on the Soviet Union for something than we would be on [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=2537.52s)]
*  on China. Like, there's no choice in that matter. Now, hopefully, our detente with China is already [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=2543.52s)]
*  vastly more open than anything that up until 1990 that the Soviet Union was. So we're in a very good [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=2552.48s)]
*  sort of peaceful situation there. But that doesn't change the posture. Yeah. And so, you know, [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=2558.0s)]
*  Apple is like doing this experiment. It's obviously more than experiment to build in India, [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=2565.12s)]
*  which solves their problem. It doesn't necessarily solve the the current administration's view of the [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=2570.8s)]
*  solution. Right. I mean, because if you think of it like the other part of free trade that [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=2577.76s)]
*  inverted, twisted and, you know, split the party, the political parties in half of the US was NAFTA [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=2582.1600000000003s)]
*  in the early 1990s, which was like free trade with Canada and Mexico, what could be more of a no [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=2587.5200000000004s)]
*  brainer? Well, it turns out it was also the global view of things like in fact, NAFTA, [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=2593.92s)]
*  half the Democrats voted against it, half the Republicans voted against it, the same as WTO kind [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=2600.7200000000003s)]
*  of stuff. And and here we are, like, well, that meant that all the jobs just moved to Canada and [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=2605.52s)]
*  Mexico. Yeah. And and, you know, long term, also not having employed people is a bad thing. It [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=2611.12s)]
*  doesn't matter if it's manufactured or anything. It's just like weird that just being across a [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=2617.52s)]
*  border would so substantially change the economics of what's made. Yeah. I mean, especially when you [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=2622.0s)]
*  literally just drive the parts back and forth through Texas. Yeah, it's kind of weird or [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=2627.44s)]
*  Minnesota or whatever. And so so I think this reset is happening broadly. I don't like the idea [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=2631.44s)]
*  that that the people who are very much in favor of this global world sort of ignore [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=2638.6400000000003s)]
*  inherent risks of the polarized world, but also just immediately jumped to no one's going to pay [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=2643.36s)]
*  five thousand dollars for an iPhone. Yeah. What an incredibly silly argument, because if you were to [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=2647.92s)]
*  look at an iPhone and think about making it by hand, you would go, it's going to cost like [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=2653.28s)]
*  a hundred thousand dollars each one. It's like a fancy watch. And so what the reason that it's [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=2656.4s)]
*  a thousand dollars or fifteen hundred dollars or whatever is because of the innovation in [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=2661.28s)]
*  manufacturing. So all that needs to happen is like another step function change in manufacturing. [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=2665.76s)]
*  And of course, for decades, that's all Apple woke up and thought about. So they remained that whole [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=2673.2000000000003s)]
*  operating mode of Apple's of being sending zillions of people being on the factory floor. [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=2680.32s)]
*  That's what they do. Yeah, they rely on skills, but they are there inventing these things. Yeah. [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=2684.96s)]
*  And so, you know, if you look at, you know, the Apple Apple Vision Pro, like it has all these [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=2690.88s)]
*  lenses and all they were on top, they made all of that stuff. And so what they're going to do is [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=2696.96s)]
*  they're going to focus on, OK, if we have to do this, we're going to also end up with giant [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=2702.56s)]
*  factories of robots or better automation or new packaging technologies that don't require as many [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=2708.16s)]
*  steps, all this stuff that they have already the world leaders in. So you're sort of optimistic [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=2712.72s)]
*  or that this is a solvable problem that they can decrease the Apple can decrease its dependency [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=2718.9599999999996s)]
*  and figure out whether it's French or I think everybody is. And I know, you know, it's easy [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=2724.0s)]
*  because of the book to focus on Apple. But like, everybody faces this problem. Yeah. Like, you know, [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=2727.68s)]
*  even if you make cars in Detroit that are really manufactured and assembled in Canada, like where [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=2733.68s)]
*  do all the in dash electronics and all the car computers come from? Right. They're just flown in [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=2739.44s)]
*  on a plane to be glued in. And so they're I'm I'm not I'm not just optimistic. I mean, this is [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=2743.92s)]
*  literally how innovation happens. Like innovation isn't invention. Invention is like was just sitting [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=2749.6s)]
*  around thinking what would be really cool to make. But innovation is like this is the constraints [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=2756.4s)]
*  that I have to work in. Like I'm going to solve this problem. And nobody loves to do that more [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=2761.36s)]
*  than engineers. Yeah. And and so like if you're a packaging engineer, like in the software, [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=2765.52s)]
*  hardware, motherboard, like this is like you live for this. How do we reduce the steps? How do we [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=2771.12s)]
*  reduce the components? How do we cram more into this is like your whole focus in life. It's your [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=2775.7599999999998s)]
*  mission. So of course, I mean, like, yes, and they've been working on it. And so the way innovation [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=2781.28s)]
*  happens is the people have been working on stuff go, I have a totally better idea. And then you try [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=2785.68s)]
*  it. And like, oh, this one worked. The other 1000 didn't work. I mean, that translucent case, [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=2790.88s)]
*  like, it's not like people haven't thought of making plastic cases before. And translucent [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=2796.32s)]
*  plastic was like a thing. And then they sat down and they just made it. Because you can build [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=2799.92s)]
*  things like that's a thing that happens. And factories are things that can be built. Yeah. [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=2805.12s)]
*  And so like, there, I don't see any reason why I just I think that the mistake is either thinking [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=2810.48s)]
*  that China is about cheap labor, or the mistake is thinking that for things that be made in the [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=2817.04s)]
*  US, it has to recreate 300 million migrant workers on buses working temporarily and going back home. [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=2822.08s)]
*  Like, I don't know, that's just one way that was their constraint. Yeah, like their constraint was [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=2829.44s)]
*  we have to employ all these people, but not let them move. Yeah, that was their constraint. Like, [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=2834.48s)]
*  we have an idea. Let's build the factories in Shenzhen and get a bunch of buses and dorms. [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=2838.56s)]
*  Problem solved. Right. We have a different one. We don't have 100 extra million people. [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=2843.8399999999997s)]
*  We have a lot of money and a lot of intellectual power, and a big desire to bring low cost, [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=2848.56s)]
*  high tech products to people. Yeah. Let's just solve, let's build things. [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=2854.48s)]
*  And during towards closing here, you know, it felt inevitable to me, sort of the Apple, [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=2859.04s)]
*  you know, would become this even much bigger than it is today in the sense of I remember reading [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=2864.24s)]
*  the stat of like, wait, I'm sorry, much bigger than like, the hugest company in the world. [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=2868.24s)]
*  You know, nine out of 10, I think high schoolers, you know, prefer Apple products. So if you sort [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=2872.48s)]
*  of when they get to college, when they graduate, like, why isn't sort of iPhone market share much [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=2879.36s)]
*  bigger? Why wouldn't it just keep getting significantly bigger? Not just the phone, [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=2883.84s)]
*  but also in sort of laptop desktop as well. And so the but when you look at the risks, [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=2887.6s)]
*  maybe sort of that's this, you know, the China situation just drastically increases prices if [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=2894.0s)]
*  something were to material happen in the short term, or maybe there's a new form factor that [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=2899.04s)]
*  Johnny I've had open AI or someone else figures out that overplays the phone that doesn't seem [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=2903.6s)]
*  super likely in the short term. But how do you sort of react to that to sort of? [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=2908.8s)]
*  Yeah. Well, I think, you know, look, people always think that like, like, you're either in the school [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=2914.16s)]
*  that things are just going to keep going like they're going to go forever. Or like, idiot, [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=2920.56s)]
*  this thing is over. There's already a new thing. But there's like, you can't buy or touch the new [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=2924.32s)]
*  thing. And we are in that in between space right now. And I do think that that it's it's highly [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=2928.88s)]
*  likely that that new ways to make things will get figured out. It's highly likely that it's going to [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=2936.4s)]
*  get much more competitive in phones only because the target is a little bit more stable. And the [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=2942.2400000000002s)]
*  best way to think of it is, like, Macs are, you know, half the laptop market in the US at this [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=2949.28s)]
*  point, you know, not quite, but with segments. And and so nobody thought that would ever happen. [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=2955.92s)]
*  Yeah. But that's partially because the the reason that could happen is because the use case for [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=2962.08s)]
*  laptops stagnated about 2000. And so all of a sudden, I'm basically running a browser and [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=2966.64s)]
*  Microsoft Office. Yeah. And if you're doing that a Mac, modular differences in office is roughly [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=2973.04s)]
*  the same. And so then if they're the price is the same at $1,000, why not? Half the market [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=2978.8s)]
*  is always going to view it as a price point, like and $1,000 is $200 more than $700. [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=2986.16s)]
*  And so a certain amount of the market is going to buy the phone that's free with the plan. And [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=2992.2400000000002s)]
*  that's just going to happen. But more and more of the market will see the phone as like a positive, [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=2999.6800000000003s)]
*  you know, positive part of life and be willing to invest in it, like any branded item. And I [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=3007.44s)]
*  think that's going to happen. So I don't but I don't know what's going to happen on the device [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=3013.12s)]
*  side. I think generally speaking, the form factor is going to last much longer than even the most [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=3016.96s)]
*  optimistic people think. I mean, you know, there's like a lot of people running PCs still, you know, [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=3021.6s)]
*  even though nobody in Silicon Valley knows that. And and I but I I think like, it's just going to [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=3027.2s)]
*  be up for grabs. Like there's no nothing written anywhere. Bill Gates used to always, always, [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=3033.68s)]
*  have to remind people that, you know, Microsoft, any day, somebody could just show up and do a [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=3040.1600000000003s)]
*  better version of everything Microsoft does, because it's software. And the economy of scale, [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=3046.48s)]
*  all that stuff isn't the barrier that people used to think manufacturing devices specifically has a [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=3052.6400000000003s)]
*  barrier. But also because of the automation, because of all this work is going on, that barrier is [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=3058.96s)]
*  just going to drop. In fact, it has dropped. The only reason that there are so many amazing Samsung [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=3063.76s)]
*  phones is because they've all seen the movie. Yeah, like they know what to do. Is there anything [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=3068.72s)]
*  else you want people to take either from this book or from this this conversation kind of in summary? [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=3073.52s)]
*  Well, I think I would sort of just to learn one issue that I just think is is super important for [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=3078.0s)]
*  people to really consider in the competition between the US and China and also how it relates [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=3083.04s)]
*  to AI, which is the difficulty we're all going to have collectively to navigating the world of [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=3087.12s)]
*  intellectual property. Yeah, you know, I just think, I think it's very, very easy to say China [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=3092.08s)]
*  doesn't respect intellectual property, so they can't be part of the world stage flat out. I mean, [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=3097.84s)]
*  they've crushed the pharmaceutical industry that way. You know, what they've done with BYD and Tesla [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=3101.92s)]
*  arguably pretty rude and stuff like that. But on the other hand, it's just as easy to say, well, [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=3107.92s)]
*  because of AI, all knowledge, all content, all information just needs to be free to train and [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=3112.08s)]
*  to reuse. Neither of those are realistic positions. And I think that this issue is far more subtle and [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=3117.6000000000004s)]
*  far more important than than I think either China thinks or the sort of the dijority in the US think. [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=3126.56s)]
*  And I believe that that's one that's going to need a lot. And I worry about wild cards like I worry [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=3134.56s)]
*  about the European Union going crazy in one direction or another and passing some rule, [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=3140.32s)]
*  then all of a sudden, that market is weird, or Japan, which was like went the other way, [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=3144.96s)]
*  because they have a language challenge, which is Japanese, like they could just they're in control [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=3149.52s)]
*  of Japanese. So they just said, Yeah, we could train anything here. Yeah, but it's like, yeah, [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=3153.6s)]
*  but that's just Japanese. Or is it a loophole for English? We're not really sure. Yeah. And so I [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=3156.7999999999997s)]
*  think that that issue is the one where policymakers need to spend the most time. But it's also [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=3161.7599999999998s)]
*  structured in the US that it's just it's a litigation issue. And there's no way around it. [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=3167.44s)]
*  So we're in for years of kind of market uncertainty over how this plays out. And that's been a core [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=3171.7599999999998s)]
*  part of Apple's advantage has been their ability to maintain the intellectual property of this [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=3177.2s)]
*  components and manufacturing and assembly. And and now that's dispersed. Yeah. Yeah. [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=3183.12s)]
*  That's a good place to end. Steven has been a fantastic conversation. Thank you so much [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=3189.92s)]
*  for coming on. Thank you. It was great to be back together. [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=3193.8399999999997s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi0GWhfydxs&t=3213.12s)]
