*  in the companies discussed in this podcast. For more details, including a link to our investments, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMQw5WTwWF0&t=87.28s)]
*  please see a16z.com slash disclosures. Hi, everyone. I'm Julie Yu, general partner [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMQw5WTwWF0&t=92.56s)]
*  on the biohealth team here at Inquist and Horowitz. And this is my big idea for 2024. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMQw5WTwWF0&t=101.36s)]
*  It is about democratizing miracle drugs. In 2023, a wave of therapies hailed as miracle drugs, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMQw5WTwWF0&t=106.16s)]
*  including GLP-1s and cell and gene therapies, had a profound impact in patients' lives. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMQw5WTwWF0&t=113.44s)]
*  But our current health care insurance system is just not set up to bear the cost of these therapies [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMQw5WTwWF0&t=119.67999999999999s)]
*  or to accurately gauge their value, given that some are curative, nor are our health care providers [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMQw5WTwWF0&t=124.96s)]
*  prepared to manage the complex logistics, data collection, and clinical operations needed to [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMQw5WTwWF0&t=130.8s)]
*  realize the full benefits of these therapies. We look forward to seeing builders innovating at the [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMQw5WTwWF0&t=136.4s)]
*  intersection of policy, biopharmaceutical manufacturing, financing, and clinical [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMQw5WTwWF0&t=141.92000000000002s)]
*  operations so that we have a viable means to bring these miracle drugs to market without [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMQw5WTwWF0&t=147.12s)]
*  bankrupting or breaking the system. All right, Julie. So I feel like this will be a rarity, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMQw5WTwWF0&t=152.72000000000003s)]
*  but for listeners who may be unfamiliar, let's start with GLP-1s. Why are people touting these [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMQw5WTwWF0&t=158.0s)]
*  as miracle drugs? Yeah, so GLP-1s are all the rage as you're implying. But so the premise of GLP-1s [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMQw5WTwWF0&t=163.44s)]
*  is that a GLP-1 is actually a hormone that is naturally occurring in our bodies, and it's [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMQw5WTwWF0&t=170.48s)]
*  generally secreted in response to food intake. So when we eat, this hormone is secreted by our [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMQw5WTwWF0&t=176.4s)]
*  intestinal tract. And the main job of that hormone is to help manage blood sugar levels. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMQw5WTwWF0&t=182.4s)]
*  And so the initial core use case for the drug form of this hormone was to treat type 2 diabetes. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMQw5WTwWF0&t=187.36s)]
*  And obviously, type 2 diabetes has huge prevalence in the American population. It affects over 11% [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMQw5WTwWF0&t=194.24s)]
*  of us. And so 1 in 10 of the people that you know are likely to be diagnosed with type 2 diabetes [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMQw5WTwWF0&t=200.48000000000002s)]
*  at some point in their life. So that in and of itself is obviously hugely impactful. But I think [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMQw5WTwWF0&t=204.88000000000002s)]
*  probably what's driving more of the popular awareness of GLP-1s is that it has this, quote, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMQw5WTwWF0&t=211.28000000000003s)]
*  unquote, side effect that it also has been shown to lead to weight loss. And part of the reason for [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMQw5WTwWF0&t=216.56s)]
*  that is that it actually suppresses appetite as part of the mechanism of action. And so therefore, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMQw5WTwWF0&t=222.56s)]
*  on the basis of that observation, a subset of GLP-1s have actually been approved for treating [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMQw5WTwWF0&t=228.24s)]
*  obesity. And obesity opens up the aperture even broader in terms of the applicability across our [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMQw5WTwWF0&t=233.36s)]
*  population. Sadly, it affects 42% of the American population, which is remarkable. And so [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMQw5WTwWF0&t=239.92000000000002s)]
*  and there's been a wave of celebrities on TikTok touting their ability to lose upwards of 20% of [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMQw5WTwWF0&t=247.52s)]
*  their weight from taking these drugs. And there's a popular analogy that people say GLP-1s are to [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMQw5WTwWF0&t=253.6s)]
*  obesity, what eyeglasses are to nearsightedness. And so it has that level of sort of societal impact [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMQw5WTwWF0&t=259.6s)]
*  in terms of fixing a disease that has such negative implications for health of our population. So [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMQw5WTwWF0&t=266.32s)]
*  there's been a lot of hype about these drugs. I think the miracle part of it sort of stems from [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMQw5WTwWF0&t=273.12s)]
*  two things. One is it's weight loss capabilities. And obviously, we as a society are just obsessed [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMQw5WTwWF0&t=277.28000000000003s)]
*  with weight loss in general. And so that's obviously been one reason that these drugs are [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMQw5WTwWF0&t=284.0s)]
*  part of the zeitgeist. But then two, from a clinical perspective, I think what we are all so [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMQw5WTwWF0&t=288.0s)]
*  excited about is that there appears to be a really compelling set of side benefits related to all of [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMQw5WTwWF0&t=292.96000000000004s)]
*  the comorbidities of obesity. So if you are obese, you're very likely to have other illnesses, [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMQw5WTwWF0&t=299.6s)]
*  namely things like cardiovascular disease that lead to heart attacks and strokes and [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMQw5WTwWF0&t=305.12s)]
*  early death, basically. And there's been a number of recent studies that show very potentially very [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMQw5WTwWF0&t=309.52000000000004s)]
*  significant benefits of these drugs as it relates to cardiovascular benefits, which as we'll get to [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMQw5WTwWF0&t=316.24s)]
*  has very big significant implications in terms of how health insurance companies would look at this [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMQw5WTwWF0&t=322.56s)]
*  and in general how we think about this as a benefit to society from a health care perspective. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMQw5WTwWF0&t=328.08s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. And I mean, the case is compelling. And I hadn't heard the eyeglasses [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMQw5WTwWF0&t=332.71999999999997s)]
*  analogy, but I think it's pretty spot on. So you mentioned one in 10 for type two diabetes and 40% [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMQw5WTwWF0&t=337.68s)]
*  40 plus percent of Americans are obese. How does that compare to the number of people who are [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMQw5WTwWF0&t=346.4s)]
*  actually on these drugs? And maybe where does cost or insurance come into play there as it relates [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMQw5WTwWF0&t=351.59999999999997s)]
*  to how many people have access? Yeah. So just to baseline everyone's sort of view on this. So [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMQw5WTwWF0&t=357.12s)]
*  there's a drug called Humira, which was the best selling drug ever in the history of American drug [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMQw5WTwWF0&t=364.08s)]
*  industry. And that drug was used by roughly 300,000 Americans each year. And so it had a [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMQw5WTwWF0&t=370.16s)]
*  huge level of impact, but a fairly finite number of humans who were impacted by it. In the case of [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMQw5WTwWF0&t=376.24s)]
*  GLP ones, there was a study that showed in 2022 based on prescription claims data analysis, [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMQw5WTwWF0&t=382.88s)]
*  that there was roughly a 3.6 million prescription claims for GLP ones in that year. And the [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMQw5WTwWF0&t=390.0s)]
*  interesting thing is that I think we're just getting started, right? So that's obviously a small [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMQw5WTwWF0&t=397.84s)]
*  subset of those who are like clinically eligible, technically speaking, as far as type two diabetes [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMQw5WTwWF0&t=401.84s)]
*  and obesity go. But the insurance policies for covering these drugs are still very, very immature. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMQw5WTwWF0&t=407.2s)]
*  And that's a lot of the sort of recent media attention that's been paid to these drugs, [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMQw5WTwWF0&t=413.44s)]
*  this drug class, is that you hear about all these insurance denials and people struggling to get [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMQw5WTwWF0&t=417.68s)]
*  coverage for these drugs through their employer sponsored benefit plans and even on Medicare and [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMQw5WTwWF0&t=422.88s)]
*  Medicaid. And so there's still a ton of questions about under what circumstances it actually makes [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMQw5WTwWF0&t=428.96s)]
*  sense to reimburse for these drugs, because they are very, very expensive, as we'll talk about. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMQw5WTwWF0&t=433.84s)]
*  And these drugs also, if you stop taking them, are likely to very much lose their benefits. So [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMQw5WTwWF0&t=438.15999999999997s)]
*  you could revert in terms of your weight loss and your type two diabetes management. And so there [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMQw5WTwWF0&t=445.67999999999995s)]
*  needs to be probably some degree of demonstration of compliance with the drugs in order for health [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMQw5WTwWF0&t=450.15999999999997s)]
*  insurance companies to get comfortable reimbursing them into perpetuity over the course of your life. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMQw5WTwWF0&t=455.52s)]
*  And so that same study that I referred to showed that it's probably only about a fourth, 25% of [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMQw5WTwWF0&t=460.88s)]
*  employer sponsored insurance plans that today cover these drugs in terms of the benefit. And so, [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMQw5WTwWF0&t=467.68s)]
*  you know, I don't think the floodgates have even been close to be opening on these drugs being made [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMQw5WTwWF0&t=473.52000000000004s)]
*  accessible to all those who might actually medically qualify for them. Absolutely. And I want to get [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMQw5WTwWF0&t=478.56s)]
*  into where insurance plays a role. But before we do that, you also mentioned curative cell and gene [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMQw5WTwWF0&t=483.6s)]
*  therapies. Can you give a couple more examples of those? Because it sounds like maybe it's not [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMQw5WTwWF0&t=489.52s)]
*  just GLP-1s that are poised to potentially make a greater impact in a way that maybe our providers [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMQw5WTwWF0&t=493.84s)]
*  or insurers aren't quite ready. Yeah, I would even argue that cell and gene therapies are probably [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMQw5WTwWF0&t=499.52s)]
*  the more extreme version of what we just described with GLP-1s, both in terms of the miraculous nature [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMQw5WTwWF0&t=503.84s)]
*  of what they do, but also in terms of the cost burden and the clinical burden to our current [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMQw5WTwWF0&t=509.52s)]
*  healthcare system. So there are many, you know, chronic or fatal diseases that stem from genetic [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMQw5WTwWF0&t=514.24s)]
*  code mishaps. So you might be born with a gene mutation in your actual, you know, native genetic [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMQw5WTwWF0&t=520.4s)]
*  code that results in some kind of debilitating disease. One common example is sickle cell [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMQw5WTwWF0&t=527.04s)]
*  anemia, in which there's a single gene mutation that arises during when you're born. And that [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMQw5WTwWF0&t=532.32s)]
*  impacts the shape of your red blood cells and has all sorts of very negative implications on your [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMQw5WTwWF0&t=539.36s)]
*  health status throughout your life. And you actually have to get sort of ongoing blood [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMQw5WTwWF0&t=544.48s)]
*  transfusions, basically, is kind of the current state of the art of how we treat that. So it's [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMQw5WTwWF0&t=548.72s)]
*  both expensive, but also extremely taxing for both patients and providers. There's also other types [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMQw5WTwWF0&t=552.08s)]
*  of diseases like cancer in which mutations might arise during your life, so after you're born. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMQw5WTwWF0&t=560.08s)]
*  And so historically, we've had a thesis that, you know, if you were to be able to program drugs, [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMQw5WTwWF0&t=565.12s)]
*  cells and genes, essentially, to be able to address those kinds of diseases that you could actually [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMQw5WTwWF0&t=572.88s)]
*  cure, entirely cure those diseases so that, you know, you no longer have to deal with that for the [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMQw5WTwWF0&t=577.36s)]
*  rest of your life. And so we now are in an era where we finally have the first versions of those [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMQw5WTwWF0&t=582.16s)]
*  diseases, sorry, those drugs that are now available on the market. These are, you know, programmable [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMQw5WTwWF0&t=587.76s)]
*  medicines, as we call them. So you're either programming a cell to go target a certain cancer [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMQw5WTwWF0&t=594.24s)]
*  type within your body, and it'll really be programmed to kill those cancer cells to completely [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMQw5WTwWF0&t=601.44s)]
*  eradicate it from your body. Or you can do a gene therapy, which actually changes the genetic makeup [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMQw5WTwWF0&t=606.48s)]
*  of your body so that the disease that you were born with is completely gone. And so those genes [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMQw5WTwWF0&t=611.84s)]
*  are, generally speaking, you know, orders of magnitude more expensive than really anything [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMQw5WTwWF0&t=620.0s)]
*  that we've seen, you know, in society to date. And so, and they're also very, very complex [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMQw5WTwWF0&t=624.8s)]
*  to administer. And we can talk more about that. But these, effectively, the way I'd put it is that [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMQw5WTwWF0&t=630.72s)]
*  our current system just is not designed at all to be able to handle the adoption and absorption [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMQw5WTwWF0&t=636.8s)]
*  and access to these kinds of therapies today. The ones that are available on the market today [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMQw5WTwWF0&t=643.52s)]
*  are administered in a very, I would say, bespoke and kind of one-off fashion in terms of how [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMQw5WTwWF0&t=648.88s)]
*  insurance companies cover them, in terms of how doctors are sort of managing the therapeutic [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMQw5WTwWF0&t=653.36s)]
*  administration piece and how patients are being handled as far as their patient journeys. And so [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMQw5WTwWF0&t=658.4s)]
*  it's a huge problem. And there are dozens of drugs of this ilk that are projected to be approved and [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMQw5WTwWF0&t=663.68s)]
*  brought out to the market in the next several years. And so we think there's a very sort of [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMQw5WTwWF0&t=671.28s)]
*  imminent why now dynamic around why we need to solve for this sooner than later. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMQw5WTwWF0&t=676.4s)]
*  Yeah. And I mean, these are the kind of drugs that we've always wanted, right? We've always [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMQw5WTwWF0&t=680.72s)]
*  wished for. You use the term miracle drugs. So why is it that our healthcare system isn't really [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMQw5WTwWF0&t=685.4399999999999s)]
*  poised to cushion the introduction of these drugs and the GLP-1s that we talked about earlier? [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMQw5WTwWF0&t=691.6s)]
*  What really needs to change in order for the insurers and the providers and the patients to [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMQw5WTwWF0&t=696.9599999999999s)]
*  get access, but also, as you said, not completely steamroll or break down the system? [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMQw5WTwWF0&t=701.92s)]
*  Yeah. So the original sort of blurb here referred to two things. One is that we could [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMQw5WTwWF0&t=708.7199999999999s)]
*  bankrupt the system and one is that we could break the system. So on the bankrupting of the [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMQw5WTwWF0&t=714.4s)]
*  system side, some of these cell and gene therapies that I mentioned, it can be a one-time cost of [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMQw5WTwWF0&t=718.3199999999999s)]
*  two to $3 million and sometimes more. And so if I'm a health insurance company and you're telling me, [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMQw5WTwWF0&t=725.12s)]
*  okay, I've got this individual, I obviously would love to administer a drug that can literally save [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMQw5WTwWF0&t=730.48s)]
*  their life and change and eradicate this disease that they would have to deal with for the rest of [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMQw5WTwWF0&t=735.84s)]
*  their life, but it's going to cost me $3 million upfront. And as an employer who covers the health [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMQw5WTwWF0&t=739.84s)]
*  insurance benefit for my employees, the average tenure of any employee in my company is maybe [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMQw5WTwWF0&t=746.5600000000001s)]
*  three to four years on average and even lower for tech companies. And so what incentive do I have [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMQw5WTwWF0&t=751.76s)]
*  to pay this upfront fee for something that will benefit this person over the entirety of their [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMQw5WTwWF0&t=757.76s)]
*  life, but that person is going to leave my insurance plan in maybe two or three years. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMQw5WTwWF0&t=762.8s)]
*  And so I'm not actually going to reap the benefits of that upfront cost for many, many years [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMQw5WTwWF0&t=767.2s)]
*  after that person's gone. And so that's kind of the premise of how the current insurance system [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMQw5WTwWF0&t=774.16s)]
*  is designed and why it's not set up to incentivize people to be willing to pay for these drugs [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMQw5WTwWF0&t=779.04s)]
*  upfront. And so that's one huge area where there just needs to be sort of fundamental innovation [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMQw5WTwWF0&t=784.8s)]
*  on just financing mechanisms to underwrite that risk profile in such a way that any individual [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMQw5WTwWF0&t=792.0s)]
*  payer only really has to pay their fair share, let's call it, while that person is on their plan [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMQw5WTwWF0&t=798.3199999999999s)]
*  and that you can sort of spread the risk as the person moves across insurance plans or create a [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMQw5WTwWF0&t=803.8399999999999s)]
*  portable product that sort of follows that person throughout their entire life. And that just requires [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMQw5WTwWF0&t=809.52s)]
*  a lot of, again, innovation on the underwriting side in terms of the services that need to wrap [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMQw5WTwWF0&t=814.0s)]
*  around that and lots of other things that relate to that. So that's kind of the financing piece. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMQw5WTwWF0&t=818.8s)]
*  And then on the sort of breaking the system piece, these drugs, as I mentioned earlier, [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMQw5WTwWF0&t=824.56s)]
*  are very, very complicated to administer. So in the case of cell and gene therapies, [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMQw5WTwWF0&t=830.72s)]
*  which are probably the most extreme case, you are literally removing cells from a person's body who [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMQw5WTwWF0&t=834.64s)]
*  has been diagnosed with cancer. You need to transport them to a manufacturing facility [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMQw5WTwWF0&t=841.44s)]
*  where you reprogram the cells, you genetically engineer them, you regrow those cells, and then [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMQw5WTwWF0&t=846.5600000000001s)]
*  you package them to be sent back to a hospital that is trained and qualified and certified to [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMQw5WTwWF0&t=852.48s)]
*  actually deliver this highly complex therapy. These cells are infused into the patient and [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMQw5WTwWF0&t=858.1600000000001s)]
*  you need to really like monitor the patient while this is happening because you might have an immune [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMQw5WTwWF0&t=863.6800000000001s)]
*  response that could be really severe and things of that sort. And then that patient generally needs [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMQw5WTwWF0&t=868.24s)]
*  to be monitored in the hospital for many, many weeks subsequently so that you can see that the [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMQw5WTwWF0&t=873.76s)]
*  drug is working. And all of that, it requires highly specialized expertise on the clinical side, [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMQw5WTwWF0&t=879.2s)]
*  on the operational logistics side, on the manufacturing side. There's entire companies [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMQw5WTwWF0&t=885.92s)]
*  that are being built just to create competencies around manufacturing these kinds of therapies [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMQw5WTwWF0&t=890.4s)]
*  because it's so fundamentally different than any of our previous sort of pill-based therapies or [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMQw5WTwWF0&t=895.84s)]
*  even the injectable therapies. It's just a very different paradigm. And so all of that whole [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMQw5WTwWF0&t=901.0400000000001s)]
*  landscape is also something that, again, the current status quo biopharma value chain is just [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMQw5WTwWF0&t=905.44s)]
*  not suited to handle and therefore we need new capabilities to handle it. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMQw5WTwWF0&t=910.96s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. Could you speak to maybe the GLP ones a little bit there just in terms of the [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMQw5WTwWF0&t=915.0400000000001s)]
*  therapies that you just mentioned are curative and that introduces all types of questions around [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMQw5WTwWF0&t=920.72s)]
*  what is a life worth and like you said, who gets access and how does that get kind of rationed over [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMQw5WTwWF0&t=925.28s)]
*  a lifetime? But in the case of something like a GLP one, can you just speak to maybe the logistics [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMQw5WTwWF0&t=932.0799999999999s)]
*  or insurance changes that are required when we're talking about something that is not necessarily [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMQw5WTwWF0&t=937.6s)]
*  curative but certainly helpful and certainly also has downstream effects, right? If someone's no [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMQw5WTwWF0&t=943.36s)]
*  longer obese, like you said, their cardiovascular risk is lower but also the way that they operate [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMQw5WTwWF0&t=948.72s)]
*  in the world, what they're buying, what they're involved in also changes. So what are your thoughts [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMQw5WTwWF0&t=953.92s)]
*  around maybe what needs to happen there? Yeah, so GLP ones are also relatively expensive, [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMQw5WTwWF0&t=958.16s)]
*  cheaper than cell and gene therapies, but we're talking $1,000 a month, roughly speaking, for this [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMQw5WTwWF0&t=963.1999999999999s)]
*  class of drugs. And so tens of thousands of dollars over the course of someone's tenure at a given [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMQw5WTwWF0&t=968.56s)]
*  employer that you'd have to cover with the hope that, again, in that time horizon, you are also [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMQw5WTwWF0&t=973.36s)]
*  going to see the cost savings associated with that person avoiding certain downstream health [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMQw5WTwWF0&t=980.48s)]
*  implications. And so there is probably a certain price point at which it becomes a no-brainer. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMQw5WTwWF0&t=984.48s)]
*  So if you think about something like a high blood pressure drug, which are these pills that people, [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMQw5WTwWF0&t=989.84s)]
*  vast majority of the population in the US is popping these pills on a daily basis, they cost [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMQw5WTwWF0&t=995.36s)]
*  maybe a few dollars per month for the health plan. And so at that price point, it's really a [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMQw5WTwWF0&t=1000.48s)]
*  no-brainer because you know that over a whole population, you'll see the financial benefit, [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMQw5WTwWF0&t=1007.92s)]
*  the threshold for that financial benefit is relatively low. And so there is actually hope [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMQw5WTwWF0&t=1017.68s)]
*  that there's a whole pipeline of cheaper versions of the current GLP one therapies that are in the [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMQw5WTwWF0&t=1022.3199999999999s)]
*  pipeline expected to be approved in the next several years. But between now and then, it's [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMQw5WTwWF0&t=1027.68s)]
*  really that price point that makes it really, really challenging to justify, again, paying [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMQw5WTwWF0&t=1032.1599999999999s)]
*  this annual cost when you're not sure that you're going to actually see the cost savings associated [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMQw5WTwWF0&t=1037.28s)]
*  with it within the time horizon that the person is on that given plan. That makes sense. Well, [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMQw5WTwWF0&t=1042.8s)]
*  maybe as a final question, we are looking to 2024 for this big idea. So I guess I'm going to bunch [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMQw5WTwWF0&t=1049.28s)]
*  a few questions in here. What solutions are you already seeing built? Maybe what also roadblocks [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMQw5WTwWF0&t=1054.96s)]
*  do you expect on the road to implementing some of these changes? And also, where do you think [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMQw5WTwWF0&t=1060.32s)]
*  policy might play a role? What do you see really coming in 2024? Yeah. So the exciting thing is [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMQw5WTwWF0&t=1066.16s)]
*  that we've already seen quite a number of great entrepreneurs who are out there building various [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMQw5WTwWF0&t=1071.28s)]
*  aspects of solutions that address all the different components of that problem space that I just [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMQw5WTwWF0&t=1075.8400000000001s)]
*  described. So there are companies that are certainly innovating on the manufacturing side, [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMQw5WTwWF0&t=1081.0400000000002s)]
*  as I mentioned, to just systematize and really industrialize what today is a highly [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMQw5WTwWF0&t=1085.8400000000001s)]
*  bespoke process to actually produce these cell and gene therapies in a scalable fashion. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMQw5WTwWF0&t=1092.72s)]
*  There are companies who are helping hospitals and physicians deliver the operational and [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMQw5WTwWF0&t=1097.92s)]
*  clinical logistics services related to everything from transporting the drugs to the care management [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMQw5WTwWF0&t=1103.84s)]
*  services that the patients need, both pre and post the administration of these drugs, even things [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMQw5WTwWF0&t=1109.84s)]
*  like hardware for remote monitoring of these patients such that they don't have to stay in [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMQw5WTwWF0&t=1115.68s)]
*  the hospital for many weeks on end. There are companies really addressing the data aspect of [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMQw5WTwWF0&t=1119.92s)]
*  this. So one of the things that I always think about as an ex-product person is imagine as a [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMQw5WTwWF0&t=1126.0800000000002s)]
*  product manager, if you didn't have any closed loop of data on how your product was being used [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMQw5WTwWF0&t=1131.04s)]
*  in the real world or any feedback from your end users, that is unfortunately the state of [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMQw5WTwWF0&t=1136.3200000000002s)]
*  affairs for many drugs that we have on the market today is that once the drug is prescribed and is [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMQw5WTwWF0&t=1140.88s)]
*  out there, there's not really great ways for the manufacturing companies to get feedback back. But [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMQw5WTwWF0&t=1145.36s)]
*  in the case of these really expensive therapies, you obviously it's critical to have some degree of [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMQw5WTwWF0&t=1150.7199999999998s)]
*  feedback loop, both to continually justify the price of those therapies and make sure that they're [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMQw5WTwWF0&t=1156.32s)]
*  working, but also frankly to iterate and just make sure that you understand any of the side effects [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMQw5WTwWF0&t=1161.04s)]
*  and potential implications of those drugs. And so there's companies that are just building [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMQw5WTwWF0&t=1166.08s)]
*  really data infrastructure to enable the collection in a continuous fashion of how these drugs are [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMQw5WTwWF0&t=1169.6799999999998s)]
*  performing post-market. And then the last piece is on the financing side. I think we've seen [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMQw5WTwWF0&t=1174.96s)]
*  both traditional incumbent insurance companies trying to spin up new solutions for this area, [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMQw5WTwWF0&t=1180.64s)]
*  but they still tend to be pretty one-off and not systematic and scalable across the full class of [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMQw5WTwWF0&t=1186.8s)]
*  drugs that could benefit from those approaches. And so we are seeing a number of startups start [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMQw5WTwWF0&t=1192.16s)]
*  to say, okay, how can we design new fintech approaches basically to be able to spread this [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMQw5WTwWF0&t=1196.56s)]
*  risk in a very different way? So all of those things are out there today in what I would call [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMQw5WTwWF0&t=1201.76s)]
*  point solution form. And I think the big opportunity and why this is a hard problem space to go after [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMQw5WTwWF0&t=1207.12s)]
*  is that there is a bit of a cold start problem. To actually build a holistic solution that solves [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMQw5WTwWF0&t=1213.2s)]
*  the entirety of this problem space, you actually need to convene payers, you need to convene [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMQw5WTwWF0&t=1218.48s)]
*  providers, you need to convene manufacturers, and obviously also the patients themselves who require [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMQw5WTwWF0&t=1223.84s)]
*  a ton of services to get this right. And so I think that's that remains sort of the big [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMQw5WTwWF0&t=1228.4s)]
*  unmet need and huge opportunity for entrepreneurs to go after is can you thread the needle on [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMQw5WTwWF0&t=1234.0s)]
*  bringing together these multiple players with a holistic solution that can actually unlock [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMQw5WTwWF0&t=1239.68s)]
*  this cold start problem to be able to address this at scale across the entire industry? [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMQw5WTwWF0&t=1244.24s)]
*  Do you think innovation will be able to basically thread that needle and ensure that people who need [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMQw5WTwWF0&t=1248.72s)]
*  these drugs get them? Or coming back to that question around policy, do you think that there [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMQw5WTwWF0&t=1253.52s)]
*  needs to be a role played there, which basically says that, you know, we need to get these drugs [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMQw5WTwWF0&t=1257.76s)]
*  out to the people that need them? Yeah, I think policy will definitely play a critical role in [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMQw5WTwWF0&t=1263.04s)]
*  the long run. And we already have seen certain, you know, sort of guidance, you know, briefs come [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMQw5WTwWF0&t=1267.92s)]
*  out from various government bodies around this particular issue, a lot of requests for feedback [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMQw5WTwWF0&t=1274.48s)]
*  from the sort of private sector on how they should be approaching this, but I think probably namely [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMQw5WTwWF0&t=1280.56s)]
*  two bodies. So the FDA, I think there's going to need to be a lot of change in terms of how they [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMQw5WTwWF0&t=1285.1999999999998s)]
*  handle approvals of these drugs because they are so different and also ongoing monitoring of these [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMQw5WTwWF0&t=1291.1999999999998s)]
*  drugs to be able to sort of design the right type of approach for these therapies. And then CMS, [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMQw5WTwWF0&t=1295.6799999999998s)]
*  which administers Medicare and Medicaid, the government sponsored insurance programs in our [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMQw5WTwWF0&t=1302.7199999999998s)]
*  country. They generally tend to be at the tip of the spear of any payment innovation for new classes [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMQw5WTwWF0&t=1306.6399999999999s)]
*  of drugs and new classes of services. And so the expectation is that they will likely roll out some [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMQw5WTwWF0&t=1313.92s)]
*  sort of program that, you know, teaches the industry how they should be approaching these [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMQw5WTwWF0&t=1319.68s)]
*  kinds of therapies and financing them. And so, but, you know, we're in an election year. And so I [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMQw5WTwWF0&t=1325.6000000000001s)]
*  think expectations are that that cycle will be slow. However, we are, I think, getting to a tipping [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMQw5WTwWF0&t=1330.16s)]
*  point where both the number of these kinds of drugs that have already been approved, that are [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMQw5WTwWF0&t=1337.6000000000001s)]
*  already on the market, that are already crippling individual companies and employers and insurance [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMQw5WTwWF0&t=1341.12s)]
*  companies and even the manufacturers are already hitting a tipping point where people, you know, [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMQw5WTwWF0&t=1347.1999999999998s)]
*  lots of companies are, you know, potentially going to go bankrupt if they have to pay for these drugs, [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMQw5WTwWF0&t=1351.76s)]
*  if they have even one employee who ends up being eligible for one of these therapies. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMQw5WTwWF0&t=1356.1599999999999s)]
*  And so I do think there is a siren call already from the industry that will sort of ignite a cycle [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMQw5WTwWF0&t=1360.56s)]
*  of innovation, as we're already seeing, as I mentioned, with a lot of startups that are [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMQw5WTwWF0&t=1366.8799999999999s)]
*  spitting up in this space. So I think as most things in healthcare, it'll be a combination of [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMQw5WTwWF0&t=1370.0s)]
*  both sort of top-down regulation and policy combined with some of the bottoms-up activity [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMQw5WTwWF0&t=1374.4s)]
*  that we already see starting to happen from those who are just feeling the pain today [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMQw5WTwWF0&t=1380.0s)]
*  and just need to kick into action. All right. I hope you enjoyed this big idea. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMQw5WTwWF0&t=1383.68s)]
*  We do have a lot more on the way, including a new age of maritime exploration that takes advantage [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMQw5WTwWF0&t=1387.36s)]
*  of AI and computer vision, plus AI-first games that never end, and whether voice-first apps may [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMQw5WTwWF0&t=1393.12s)]
