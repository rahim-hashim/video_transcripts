# The Art and Science of Podcasting with Sriram and Aarthi
**The a16z Podcast:** [March 20, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU)
*  They're like, I want to be Rogan or I want to be Lex or I want to be Alex Cooper. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=0.0s)]
*  I want to the next video. But you can't do that. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=4.08s)]
*  Mr. Beast talks about this all the time. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=5.92s)]
*  You can't be a better Mr. Beast than Mr. Beast. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=7.640000000000001s)]
*  If you listen to this podcast, you're probably an avid podcast listener. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=10.040000000000001s)]
*  Perhaps you've even dabbled with the medium yourself. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=13.52s)]
*  And in a way, it does feel like we're at this interesting inflection point [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=16.4s)]
*  where it's both easier and harder than ever to podcast. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=19.240000000000002s)]
*  It's easier than ever to create, but it's harder than ever to stand out. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=21.88s)]
*  And I feel like this recent tweet from Tim Ferriss really encapsulates things. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=25.48s)]
*  He says, I'm super grateful I started podcasting before you needed to produce [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=29.28s)]
*  a TV show to cut through all the noise and the algorithms. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=32.76s)]
*  April of next year will mark an average of 1.4 plus episodes per week for 10 years. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=36.120000000000005s)]
*  So, look, there are endless creators that we can and probably will bring in [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=41.36s)]
*  to talk about this subject. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=45.0s)]
*  But today we're talking to two creators that decided to go full force [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=46.28s)]
*  into the world of audio peak pandemic. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=49.24s)]
*  You might know them as Sriram and Arthi from The Good Time Show. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=52.0s)]
*  Starting as a hobby, The Good Time Show has grown and since had many guests [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=55.32s)]
*  that you're probably familiar with people like Elon Musk, Mark Zuckerberg, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=58.56s)]
*  Calvin Harris and Naomi Osaka. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=62.080000000000005s)]
*  So in this episode, we get to hear from Sriram and Arthi about their perspective [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=64.04s)]
*  on the world of audio and video. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=67.16s)]
*  We cover things like the sliding scale of entertainment information, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=69.16s)]
*  the difference between an audience and a community, podcast analytics [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=72.56s)]
*  and how those are changing, and even what Sriram has learned [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=75.76s)]
*  from his front row experience at Twitter recently. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=78.68s)]
*  But first, they say that choosing a co-founder is like choosing a spouse. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=81.28s)]
*  But in this case, Sriram and Arthi are already married. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=84.92s)]
*  So I decided to kick things off with a game to see who is pulling their weight [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=87.8s)]
*  in this podcast partnership. Place your bets. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=91.48s)]
*  As a reminder, the content here is for informational purposes only, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=94.8s)]
*  should not be taken as legal business tax or investment advice [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=98.44s)]
*  or be used to evaluate any investment or security [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=101.84s)]
*  and is not directed at any investors or potential investors in any A16Z fund. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=104.44s)]
*  For more details, please see A16Z.com slash disclosures. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=109.16s)]
*  I know both of you are husband and wife, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=117.56s)]
*  so I want to see a little bit of competition between the two of you. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=120.56s)]
*  See who's pulling the weight on this podcast. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=124.16s)]
*  But what we're going to do is I sent you both these buttons. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=126.32000000000001s)]
*  You guys have them in front of you? [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=130.6s)]
*  Yes. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=131.96s)]
*  Individually, press the record button and record your name. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=134.4s)]
*  Sriram. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=138.48000000000002s)]
*  Sriram. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=141.48000000000002s)]
*  Arthi. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=142.48000000000002s)]
*  Sriram. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=143.48000000000002s)]
*  Sriram. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=144.48000000000002s)]
*  Sriram. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=145.48000000000002s)]
*  Arthi. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=147.16s)]
*  Arthi. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=148.16s)]
*  All right, we got it working. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=150.35999999999999s)]
*  OK, what we're going to do is a fun little trivia game [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=151.79999999999998s)]
*  about podcasting and creators. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=155.16s)]
*  And I want to see which one of you knows more about this universe. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=157.04s)]
*  You should have told me this right at the beginning. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=161.12s)]
*  He knows way more about this world than I do. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=162.72s)]
*  We'll see. We'll see. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=164.95999999999998s)]
*  Oh, my goodness. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=166.56s)]
*  All right, so I'm going to read the question and then whoever [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=168.64s)]
*  hits their button first gets to answer. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=171.88s)]
*  If you get it wrong, the other person can answer. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=173.92s)]
*  All right. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=175.72s)]
*  Ready? [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=177.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=178.48s)]
*  All right. OK, so the first question. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=179.48s)]
*  The term podcast is a portmanteau, which means it's a combination [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=181.12s)]
*  of two different words. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=184.6s)]
*  What are those two words? [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=186.24s)]
*  I'll give you one. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=192.12s)]
*  The first one is iPod. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=193.72s)]
*  iPod, OK. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=195.6s)]
*  And casting, I guess. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=197.56s)]
*  Broadcast. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=202.84s)]
*  Yes, yes, Arthi got it. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=203.84s)]
*  Second question. What year was this term coined? [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=205.36s)]
*  I am going to go. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=210.08s)]
*  Say it. Say it. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=211.56s)]
*  You press the button. Say it. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=212.64000000000001s)]
*  Well, it says iPod. It must be post iPod. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=216.12s)]
*  So I'm probably going to say 2004. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=218.36s)]
*  That's right. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=221.20000000000002s)]
*  My God. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=222.20000000000002s)]
*  We're one one. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=223.20000000000002s)]
*  OK, I'm a genius. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=224.20000000000002s)]
*  OK. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=225.8s)]
*  All right. Question three. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=226.60000000000002s)]
*  We're going to do these rapid fire. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=228.16000000000003s)]
*  According to an Edison report, what is the most popular podcast genre? [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=229.28000000000003s)]
*  Comedy. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=234.12s)]
*  Yes, that's right. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=234.92s)]
*  Oh, all right. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=236.48s)]
*  Two, one. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=237.79999999999998s)]
*  OK, so of the people who listen to podcasts, according to Infinite Dial, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=238.64s)]
*  how many do they listen to per week? [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=243.07999999999998s)]
*  How many shows? Three. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=245.04s)]
*  No. Let's see. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=247.0s)]
*  OK, well, I'm going to say if somebody if somebody is. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=248.51999999999998s)]
*  No, no, just say it. Number eight. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=252.32s)]
*  That's right. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=255.76s)]
*  OK, you guys, this is not cool. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=259.84s)]
*  So it's two to we've got three more. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=263.84s)]
*  All right. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=265.52s)]
*  How many downloads do you need per episode, according to Buzzsprout, [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=266.32s)]
*  to be in the top one percent of podcasts and just round that up to the thousand? [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=270.79999999999995s)]
*  What if I want to? [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=275.32s)]
*  Forty five hundred. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=278.2s)]
*  That's right. Yeah. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=279.55999999999995s)]
*  So that's exactly right. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=280.4s)]
*  It's forty five hundred. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=282.2s)]
*  It was in the dark. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=283.23999999999995s)]
*  I know. So I was testing who prepped. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=284.59999999999997s)]
*  That's unfair. I bring in spontaneity. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=287.15999999999997s)]
*  I don't want to come in. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=289.32s)]
*  Spontaneous enough pressing the button. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=291.04s)]
*  Fine. Let's get on with it. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=292.84000000000003s)]
*  All right. Two more. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=294.28000000000003s)]
*  Who is the highest paid creator in twenty twenty two? [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=295.12s)]
*  I'm going to say it. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=298.88s)]
*  Mr. Beast. That's right. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=301.08000000000004s)]
*  OK, so we have one more question. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=303.28000000000003s)]
*  It's Ty. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=305.64000000000004s)]
*  At what age did Jimmy Donaldson, [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=307.76s)]
*  aka Mr. Beast, start YouTubeing? [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=310.24s)]
*  OK, you did it first. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=314.8s)]
*  I'm going to say 16. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=316.44s)]
*  Nope. Let's see who gets it closer. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=318.84s)]
*  Arti, what's your guess? [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=321.11999999999995s)]
*  How old is he now? [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=322.28s)]
*  He's 24. 24, 25, something like that. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=323.56s)]
*  14. That's closer. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=328.11999999999995s)]
*  He started at 13. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=330.03999999999996s)]
*  OK, I think I win. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=331.71999999999997s)]
*  All right, Arti wins. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=335.08s)]
*  It was fun. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=337.08s)]
*  This segment needs some work. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=338.64s)]
*  Talk about it afterwards. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=340.96s)]
*  If I had won, it would have been better. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=343.32s)]
*  But anyway, all right. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=344.67999999999995s)]
*  Lose with dignity. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=345.47999999999996s)]
*  Well, no such thing. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=346.76s)]
*  So as I mentioned before, we are going to be talking about all things [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=347.8s)]
*  audio, creators, communities, social. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=351.16s)]
*  So why don't we just start out? [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=355.28000000000003s)]
*  Because both of you have been podcasting for the last couple of years [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=356.56s)]
*  on your Good Times show, which started in 2020. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=359.64s)]
*  What made you start that show? [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=362.92s)]
*  Was it the fact that you wanted to build a network? [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=364.76s)]
*  Was it just for fun? [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=366.76s)]
*  What was going through your mind at the time? [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=367.96000000000004s)]
*  Kind of a happy accident. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=369.76s)]
*  So this is 2020 December, kind of the thick of the pandemic. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=370.88s)]
*  And we're all working from home. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=374.88s)]
*  We miss seeing our friends. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=376.24s)]
*  We used to go home to India once a year, and we didn't do that that year. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=377.52s)]
*  And, you know, we basically thought, wouldn't it be nice to kind of host [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=382.2s)]
*  like a virtual dinner party kind of thing? [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=386.15999999999997s)]
*  Because we used to host all like these founders at home [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=389.52s)]
*  once a month or so and just have conversations about building [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=392.76s)]
*  companies and startups and stuff. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=395.76s)]
*  And we just didn't do that in person anymore. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=397.59999999999997s)]
*  So we thought, you know, we we could maybe host this as a live audio session. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=400.0s)]
*  We started this on Clubhouse. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=405.24s)]
*  And that's kind of how the whole show started. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=406.84s)]
*  We can't tell you how much it was purely accidental and serendipitous. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=409.15999999999997s)]
*  And in some ways, I think maybe these things have to be. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=413.0s)]
*  I don't think you can set out in something like this [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=415.28s)]
*  because there's so much art and intuition involved. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=417.84s)]
*  It kind of came from this very human core of we're bored. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=421.23999999999995s)]
*  We like talking to people. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=426.64s)]
*  You know, it's really hard to talk to people during COVID. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=428.76s)]
*  And we said, let's have a place where we can have a friendly conversation. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=431.2s)]
*  The first few episodes were not like these, not shows. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=435.36s)]
*  They were really like, you know, how to go fundraise. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=438.8s)]
*  How do you do performance reviews if you're a new manager? [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=441.72s)]
*  Like very like advice sessions. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=444.16s)]
*  And we would bring in experts we knew, our other founders we knew. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=446.40000000000003s)]
*  And we just it was more about giving back to that founder community. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=451.04s)]
*  And we did a lot, a lot of those sessions and was fairly boring. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=454.56s)]
*  It was just very like we thought they were really cool and fun. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=458.28000000000003s)]
*  But like, you know, our parents or whoever would listen in and be like, [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=461.28000000000003s)]
*  what was that? Like, why are you guys talking on this thing? [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=464.76s)]
*  Yeah. So it is really hard when you do one of these to know [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=467.52s)]
*  what is happening on the other side. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=471.08s)]
*  You can't really picture the human being who's listening to it or watching it. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=472.8s)]
*  And what are they going through? [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=477.16s)]
*  But I would say there was definitely inflection point where Arti, [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=478.36s)]
*  I remember the first few weeks, she would get all these GMs from India, from here. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=480.44s)]
*  A lot of women, they would be like, oh, I can't believe you're there. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=484.48s)]
*  And you have Mark Andreessen and Elon Musk. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=487.92s)]
*  And, you know, because your background is my background and I'm here. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=490.04s)]
*  Well, I think one thing that's interesting about podcasting, [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=493.40000000000003s)]
*  it really does feel sometimes like you're searching for a needle [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=495.68s)]
*  and a haystack in terms of what's working. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=498.08000000000004s)]
*  You get all types of feedback. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=500.12s)]
*  Sometimes it's conflicting. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=501.6s)]
*  Podcasting is also kind of notorious for really bad analytics or distribution. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=503.0s)]
*  It really is this maze where you're like, I think something's working [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=507.48s)]
*  because people are listening, but it's really hard to tease out what is working. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=511.16s)]
*  So where would you say the show is now? [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=514.6800000000001s)]
*  Like, what what kind of show are you trying to create? [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=516.24s)]
*  We didn't start out with we want to be creators. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=518.72s)]
*  I see a lot of people who are starting podcasts now where they like, [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=521.7199999999999s)]
*  this is a theme and this is a show. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=524.92s)]
*  And I keep trying to tell them that's fine. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=526.4s)]
*  But there's a very good chance that it's all going to change over time. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=528.68s)]
*  And you might not see success right away with this exact vision that you have in mind. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=531.88s)]
*  You know, if you had told us two years ago, [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=536.92s)]
*  oh, you have to have this like whole setup with lights and everything [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=539.7199999999999s)]
*  and this backdrop and video and all of that, we would have been like, [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=542.68s)]
*  yeah, I don't think so. Like, I just don't think we are that. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=546.88s)]
*  But now, you know, it's given us the time and buffer to just like [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=549.6s)]
*  learn and grow through this and feel comfortable doing what we do. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=552.68s)]
*  And so now I think the show, how would you describe where we are now? [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=556.0799999999999s)]
*  I think many ways to measure it, you know, we can kind of look at the numbers. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=559.4399999999999s)]
*  You know, we often get episodes now which get millions of views. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=562.3199999999999s)]
*  And that's really amazing. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=565.92s)]
*  We really invested into video. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=567.64s)]
*  So we really want to experiment with all different formats, [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=569.0799999999999s)]
*  which is a whole interesting other conversation. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=570.92s)]
*  Also, the one of the interesting thing about podcasts or anything here is [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=572.4399999999999s)]
*  you have to hold two things constant at the same time. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=576.4399999999999s)]
*  One is I think it needs to have some kernel of truth and authenticity to it. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=579.88s)]
*  I've seen so many podcasts fail and they often fail because somebody wants [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=584.16s)]
*  to get out there and be like, I'm going to make a successful podcast. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=587.92s)]
*  And I don't think that is a motivation that sustains you or the audience. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=590.88s)]
*  Well, it's also too broad, right? [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=596.4399999999999s)]
*  It's kind of like someone saying, I want to create a startup. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=597.64s)]
*  It's like, OK, well, what do you want to build? [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=599.88s)]
*  What problem are you trying to solve? What are you excited about? [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=601.76s)]
*  Absolutely right. And it doesn't go anywhere. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=604.04s)]
*  So I think it needs some kernel of truth, which is you have to really care [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=606.0s)]
*  about the topic, you have to care about the topic and talk about it, [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=609.12s)]
*  even if nobody's listening to it. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=611.52s)]
*  And I think the audience can sense, you know, the level of authenticity. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=613.24s)]
*  And in some ways, they have to really start connecting with you [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=616.64s)]
*  as the narrator, the guide, the Sherpa who's going to take them through this. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=620.32s)]
*  And that sort of exists in this fuzzy sphere of human connection [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=623.9200000000001s)]
*  and intimacy and relationships. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=627.52s)]
*  Then there is this other work, which is partnerships, metrics, views, [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=628.88s)]
*  retention, top of funnel, download, right? [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=632.72s)]
*  And it's incredibly quantifiable. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=635.88s)]
*  And there is a game, there is an algorithm that you all need to play to. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=637.4s)]
*  And I think, you know, what we're trying to do is kind of balance both [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=640.6s)]
*  because in other day, you know, we don't do this for a living. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=644.16s)]
*  We kind of do this for fun. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=646.64s)]
*  And unless we enjoy it, this will stop. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=648.04s)]
*  The thing that hasn't really changed is we just we're kind of curious people. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=650.48s)]
*  Even the show, when it started, I think we were just sitting around late night [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=655.12s)]
*  and being like, it's really nice to like have these folks to just talk to them. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=657.96s)]
*  Like, you know, we should just like ask them what they do, [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=662.56s)]
*  how they do what they do kind of thing. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=665.28s)]
*  And that hasn't changed in two years in. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=667.0799999999999s)]
*  And that's the part that I'm really excited about, where every guest, [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=670.52s)]
*  like, you know, yesterday we did an episode and the prep leading to the episode. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=674.1999999999999s)]
*  That's the part we love and enjoy the most because we are like, [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=678.8399999999999s)]
*  it's like this discovering this like this person. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=682.0s)]
*  Like, you know, you've obviously read about them, [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=685.52s)]
*  heard about them, read their books or whatever they've done. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=687.8s)]
*  But then when you have to prep, you really have to like know the individual [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=690.48s)]
*  and put some time and effort into it. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=694.2s)]
*  And I think that we still enjoy that. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=696.1600000000001s)]
*  And we're still very curious about who the person is and kind of showing our audience, [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=698.4000000000001s)]
*  you know, that side of them, whether they're like builders, thinkers, creators, [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=703.96s)]
*  whoever they are, that the most fun for us. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=707.48s)]
*  Well, you know what I'm taking away, [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=710.1600000000001s)]
*  which is something that I've noticed with content for quite some time now is [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=712.0s)]
*  a lot of people, to your point earlier, they're like, I want to create a blog, [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=715.2s)]
*  I want to create a podcast. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=718.24s)]
*  And then once they decide to do that, they think about it [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=719.2s)]
*  too much in terms of what they're creating. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=721.32s)]
*  So as an example, they might say, [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=723.72s)]
*  I want to create an interview style podcast about technology. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=725.28s)]
*  And that's OK. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=728.52s)]
*  But I mean, how many podcasts are there with that exact same what? [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=729.6s)]
*  And I think when you really consider why you listen to a specific podcast [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=734.08s)]
*  or read a specific newsletter, it's how they do it. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=737.5600000000001s)]
*  And if I were to articulate what both of you do really, really well is [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=740.08s)]
*  you make it approachable. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=744.0s)]
*  The podcast feels warm, right. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=745.6s)]
*  And even when you think about the way people articulate [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=747.44s)]
*  why they like a podcast or a newsletter, etc. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=750.4s)]
*  It's it's that how part you never go to someone say, [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=753.24s)]
*  hey, I've got this great podcast. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=755.92s)]
*  And they ask why. And you say, well, they talk about technology. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=757.28s)]
*  No, because there's so many podcasts about technology. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=759.8s)]
*  I say, oh, man, these hosts, they just make it feel so approachable. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=762.3199999999999s)]
*  They're from my hometown or town similar to mine. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=764.88s)]
*  And they they have no ego. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=766.9599999999999s)]
*  They're not afraid to ask, you know, simple questions. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=768.52s)]
*  And so I think that's really important as people consider [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=771.48s)]
*  whether they should pursue a podcast, because technically it's easier than ever. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=774.9599999999999s)]
*  But that doesn't mean that, you know, it's easy to start a podcast. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=779.76s)]
*  And I mean, from that frame, I've been trying to figure this out myself [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=783.52s)]
*  is the sliding scale between what I would call entertainment and information. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=786.72s)]
*  Huberman Lab, I think, hit number one yesterday. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=792.0400000000001s)]
*  I swear you shared that in a chat we're in. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=794.2s)]
*  And I feel like that's very information dense. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=796.24s)]
*  I go into the Huberman Lab podcast and I come out and I'm like, oh, my God, [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=798.4s)]
*  I need to reshape my life. I'm doing everything wrong. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=801.64s)]
*  And then there's other podcasts that, quite frankly, at the end of that [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=804.84s)]
*  podcast episode, I've taken nothing away, but I loved it. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=808.48s)]
*  Right. I truly enjoyed being there. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=812.0799999999999s)]
*  How do you think about that sliding scale with your podcast? [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=815.0s)]
*  You can't separate it from your own personality. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=818.52s)]
*  Right. In the lab, you know, Andrew is amazing at it [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=821.12s)]
*  because he brings to the table one this amazing life experience. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=824.36s)]
*  You should listen to him and he talks about his skateboarding life [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=827.88s)]
*  and he's been in some dark times and overcoming that. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=830.36s)]
*  That part of it infused with the fact that he has this huge academic background [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=832.4s)]
*  is genuinely curious. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=836.4399999999999s)]
*  So one is you're putting yourself into it and you can't really divorce yourself. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=838.04s)]
*  When this show started taking off, I kind of went into this [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=843.52s)]
*  in a sort of analysis of all the great interviewers the last 20, 30 years. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=846.44s)]
*  And I tried to kind of map out, kind of honestly steal from them [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=850.24s)]
*  on like what they were doing well. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=853.32s)]
*  And, you know, I was trying to find some answers for us [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=855.12s)]
*  and what we were trying to do, because you're trying to square a circle. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=857.68s)]
*  You're trying to square a circle of something which is authentic to you, [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=861.36s)]
*  something which is fun for you, something which is in some value to the audience. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=864.84s)]
*  It can be information. It can be entertainment, something which is great [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=869.4399999999999s)]
*  for a guest if you have an interview kind of content, which is like they [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=872.24s)]
*  hopefully have a positive experience about it. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=875.68s)]
*  And something kind of works in terms of the algorithms and numbers. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=877.76s)]
*  And you're trying to square this circle and it seems as impossible equation. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=880.1999999999999s)]
*  And I was trying to go through history on who is going to figure it out. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=884.1999999999999s)]
*  And you realize, first of all, that everyone has their own style. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=887.1999999999999s)]
*  And give you a few examples of styles. Right. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=890.24s)]
*  Larry King. Right. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=892.0799999999999s)]
*  Maybe one of the greatest broadcasters, interviewers of all time. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=893.4s)]
*  If you read his biography, if you read his style, he is all about, [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=896.0s)]
*  I'm going to go in assuming my audience knows nothing about this person. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=898.96s)]
*  And actually, he's famous for doing no prep. Right. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=904.04s)]
*  But it brought it to this amazing purity, which he was like, [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=906.76s)]
*  what the heck are you working on? Tell me what you wrote. Right. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=909.72s)]
*  And because his audience doesn't know either. Right. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=912.12s)]
*  And he could sort of communicate the sort of this honest version of [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=914.8000000000001s)]
*  like some New Yorker on the street, like, I don't know who this person is. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=919.08s)]
*  Tell me what you got. What are you about? Right. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=921.8399999999999s)]
*  And there was an honesty to the conversation. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=923.4s)]
*  Obviously, Larry King was one of the legends that's on one end of the spectrum. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=925.04s)]
*  On the other end of the spectrum, you have somebody like Howard Stern. Right. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=928.52s)]
*  Howard Stern, you know, he's maybe polarizing character, [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=931.3599999999999s)]
*  but one of the things he likes to do is put in amazing research. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=933.88s)]
*  Howard Stern with John Stewart. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=936.64s)]
*  One of his first questions is he pulls out the very first joke [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=937.8399999999999s)]
*  John Stewart ever said in a public setting. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=941.1999999999999s)]
*  And Stewart is bowled over. Right. He's like, how do you ever find it? [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=944.0s)]
*  The other spectrum is sort of the why or the, you know, the format of the show. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=947.1999999999999s)]
*  So, for example, if you're doing a hard journalism show, [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=951.24s)]
*  that you're doing 60 minutes, right. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=953.8s)]
*  I'm going to hold your feet to the fire. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=955.16s)]
*  I'm going to hold you accountable. Right. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=956.48s)]
*  That's one version of things. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=958.4s)]
*  There's another version of things I think is closer to where we are, which is [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=960.0s)]
*  you are doing something interesting. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=963.6800000000001s)]
*  And I want to understand and the audience hopefully understand through me [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=966.0s)]
*  how it is that you do what you do. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=970.6s)]
*  I'm a huge fan of John Le Carre. Right. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=973.28s)]
*  The famous Espenaz writer who tragically recently passed away. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=975.04s)]
*  He hated doing press. He hated talking to journalists. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=977.92s)]
*  He was in France and he met this host for what he thought was some random French show. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=980.84s)]
*  And he was like, God, I hate it. I don't even speak French. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=985.16s)]
*  And this host, his name is Bernard Pivot. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=987.36s)]
*  He hosted basically, let's call it the equal of the two night show in France. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=989.6800000000001s)]
*  I think he still does. And Le Carre was nervous. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=993.76s)]
*  He was like, I hate this. I don't even speak French. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=996.32s)]
*  I'm going to make a fool of myself. I hate the whole end of it. Right. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=999.12s)]
*  In the first 50 seconds. Right. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1001.6800000000001s)]
*  He's like, this is the most amazing conversation I've ever had. Right. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1003.6s)]
*  And Le Carre describes it so well. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1006.32s)]
*  He says it is not because Pivot was good looking, [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1007.92s)]
*  charming, funny, smart, even. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1010.7199999999999s)]
*  He probably was some version of all these things. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1013.4799999999999s)]
*  But the thing was within instantly, he could communicate to the guest was, [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1015.28s)]
*  you are going to be OK here with me. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1019.1999999999999s)]
*  When I saw that, right. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1022.5999999999999s)]
*  And I'm not going to claim we even get close to any of that. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1023.56s)]
*  But I was like, this is what our goal is. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1026.8s)]
*  Like every show, right. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1028.32s)]
*  I want to have the guests be like, I'm going to be OK. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1029.84s)]
*  And I think if you get that, everything else really falls into place. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1032.72s)]
*  You know what? [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1036.2s)]
*  That reminds me of this analogy that I like to use for podcasts specifically, [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1037.04s)]
*  which is it's kind of crazy when you think about it. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1041.04s)]
*  Let's say our podcasts are typically maybe an hour long. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1043.04s)]
*  The listener is with you for an hour every week, maybe more than that. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1046.16s)]
*  And so it's very different than reading a newsletter for five minutes [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1049.64s)]
*  or stumbling upon a blog post randomly online and spending a couple of minutes [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1052.96s)]
*  where you don't even know who wrote it. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1057.1200000000001s)]
*  And so it's a very intimate form of content. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1058.56s)]
*  And so I like to frame it as like podcasts are your best friends. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1061.44s)]
*  And so I think you're right that there's more of a friendship [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1064.1599999999999s)]
*  that needs to be created, not just with the person you're interviewing, [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1068.36s)]
*  but that parasocial relationship with the listener. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1071.9199999999998s)]
*  And so that's where I think, you know, I framed it as entertainment, [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1074.9199999999998s)]
*  but it's this warmth. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1077.36s)]
*  It's this connection that you need to create. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1078.56s)]
*  And I like the framing that you you describe there. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1081.24s)]
*  It's like you're making someone feel comfortable like they want to be there. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1083.32s)]
*  And you can't fake it. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1087.76s)]
*  And sometimes it takes a lot of work. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1088.9199999999998s)]
*  And it's not the same for every person. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1090.6799999999998s)]
*  And a lot of the people have are the very top of the field. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1091.72s)]
*  How can I figure out a system of how to make things work? [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1094.6000000000001s)]
*  And I'm always trying to get that system out of them. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1097.3600000000001s)]
*  I think about it as getting them off their track track. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1100.0s)]
*  Are they how do you think about that? [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1102.4s)]
*  How have you effectively as you're going into these interviews [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1103.88s)]
*  with people who are so media trained and have done so many interviews, [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1106.8400000000001s)]
*  likely a lot of those interviews have the same questions being asked. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1110.76s)]
*  And I found at least listening to both of your shows, [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1114.4s)]
*  like you do somehow find a way to get them off their track. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1117.6000000000001s)]
*  Do you have any thoughts on how you've managed to do that? [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1120.8s)]
*  Our job here is to one, make sure that the guest [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1123.08s)]
*  feels like this is a good use of their time. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1127.72s)]
*  They're here for an hour. They're usually really busy people. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1129.9199999999998s)]
*  Our other job is to, you know, we have all these people [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1132.6399999999999s)]
*  and we know our cohorts of audience who are like listening, watching, [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1136.0s)]
*  you know, the show, they often tend to be, you know, [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1139.48s)]
*  not from the same world that we are, but aspirationally, they want to be here. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1142.9199999999998s)]
*  They're typically founders or aspiring founders. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1146.8799999999999s)]
*  They're young. A lot of them are very geographically distributed. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1150.8799999999999s)]
*  And so for a lot of them, like I think of our job as to be in service of them [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1155.32s)]
*  and to make sure that we are able to bridge the gap between [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1160.24s)]
*  what would they want and what what is interesting to them [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1163.9199999999998s)]
*  and getting the guests to feel like they can convey that [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1166.84s)]
*  in that time frame that they have. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1170.6399999999999s)]
*  It sounds really clinical when I put it that way, but really like an hour [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1172.76s)]
*  every week of somebody spending the time to listen. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1177.84s)]
*  It's a huge investment on their part. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1180.96s)]
*  And we want to make sure that it is actually valuable to them. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1183.44s)]
*  I know what this person is working on or what they're doing [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1186.8s)]
*  or what the day to day looks like or the book that they wrote or anything of that sort. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1191.0s)]
*  But I think it is still worth it to ask the question [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1196.48s)]
*  so that the person who's listening on the other end gets the value out of it, [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1199.6s)]
*  because I can't assume that they know. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1203.9199999999998s)]
*  And so some of the questions might just be like, [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1206.28s)]
*  what advice do you have for founders kind of thing? [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1209.48s)]
*  And it sounds so basic, but sometimes that's kind of where [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1212.1200000000001s)]
*  you get interesting answers and that kind of breaks them out of that mold of [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1218.1200000000001s)]
*  the PR spiel, which is they're here to go launch their book [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1222.5600000000002s)]
*  and they can talk about the book. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1225.76s)]
*  But then I'm like, no, wait, but you did that. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1227.52s)]
*  Why did you start that company? Why did you do this thing? [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1229.76s)]
*  And they're like, oh, wait, you're actually interested in me [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1232.52s)]
*  as a person who did that. OK, let me talk to you about that. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1234.5600000000002s)]
*  I also think about the curse of knowledge, right? [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1237.44s)]
*  You mentioned that sometimes it's the simplest questions [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1239.3999999999999s)]
*  that people get really excited about. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1241.8s)]
*  And I'm sure all of us and people listening have put out content [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1243.32s)]
*  before trying to sound really smart or say, you know, this is so thoughtful. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1247.32s)]
*  I spent two months on this and then it flops. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1251.32s)]
*  And sometimes it's the simplest things that people just really latch onto. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1254.44s)]
*  They're really human things. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1258.28s)]
*  But ultimately, I think what's also important to consider [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1260.0s)]
*  is that a podcast is effectively a product. Right. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1262.8799999999999s)]
*  And so you are getting, even though it is limited with podcasting, [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1265.76s)]
*  some signal back. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1269.28s)]
*  So I want to hear from both of you, because it does sound like you are [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1270.28s)]
*  quite glued into the metrics. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1273.8s)]
*  What are you learning? [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1276.0s)]
*  What are you paying attention to? [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1276.8s)]
*  And what has worked in terms of actually growing your show? [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1277.8s)]
*  You actually have to think of it as a product. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1281.32s)]
*  Who's your market? Who are your customers? [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1283.0s)]
*  What are you building for them? [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1284.32s)]
*  How are you finding them? How are they finding you? [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1285.48s)]
*  How are you getting them to the door? Are they staying? [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1287.44s)]
*  There's just the basic questions of any product, [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1289.6000000000001s)]
*  you know, especially in the consumer world, really go for podcasts. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1292.52s)]
*  Also, and often a famous name can help with that, which is you get an Elon Musk, [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1295.56s)]
*  you know, A R Rahman, who's huge in India. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1299.48s)]
*  A lot of people who have told you who you are will find you. Right. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1301.72s)]
*  But that is a one time value. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1305.04s)]
*  But how do you retain them? [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1307.6s)]
*  And what we have found is retaining them is because they start [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1308.6799999999998s)]
*  to hopefully trust us and they listen to more of our conversations. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1312.9199999999998s)]
*  And, you know, then they go from just top of funnel person to a DAU [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1315.72s)]
*  or WAU in consumer software terms. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1319.32s)]
*  The other thing I think from the product world, we realize, is fast iteration. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1321.8s)]
*  Like we've changed multiple things. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1325.44s)]
*  We try out things all the time about everything from thumbnails [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1327.0s)]
*  to how we handle social, you know, how we trailer the first few seconds [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1330.48s)]
*  of like a retention hook. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1335.6000000000001s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1337.1200000000001s)]
*  Because if you don't try, you don't know what's working. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1337.52s)]
*  I think what Shriram said, which is you get these acquisitive episodes, [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1339.56s)]
*  which are like big guests. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1342.8s)]
*  Like I think A R Rahman for us last year was a really big get. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1344.04s)]
*  He's one of one of the most famous people in India and world over now. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1347.0800000000002s)]
*  But I really look for retention, which is like, you know, [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1352.6000000000001s)]
*  and this is the cliched. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1355.12s)]
*  We came for this guest, but I staying for you both kind of thing. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1357.32s)]
*  And we get comments like this all the time. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1361.12s)]
*  That's kind of when we know we're doing our jobs because [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1363.04s)]
*  people are watching a lot of the episode content. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1366.48s)]
*  Oftentimes we see the average number of minutes a user watches, [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1368.96s)]
*  like anywhere between 12 to 15 minutes of our episode, [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1372.96s)]
*  which is like 25 percent of the episode. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1375.8799999999999s)]
*  We also look for like retention overall. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1377.72s)]
*  Like if you're a user, new user who subscribed, [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1379.76s)]
*  are you coming back and listening to new shows that we're putting together [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1383.32s)]
*  every week and things. So I look for that. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1385.96s)]
*  And you probably know this because you're doing this too. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1387.84s)]
*  You have a very strong intuitive feel for when something is working, [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1389.9199999999998s)]
*  because it's, you know, your email is fired. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1392.8s)]
*  Yeah, your email likes people that you know. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1395.32s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. People that you know. Right. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1398.2s)]
*  And you also the opposite when something totally didn't work. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1399.84s)]
*  And and, you know, it just dead silence. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1402.6799999999998s)]
*  And the hard part sometimes is when that mismatches your expectation [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1405.0s)]
*  or your calibration, when you think something didn't work and totally bombs. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1409.2s)]
*  I was going to say the other direction is brutal. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1412.8799999999999s)]
*  But that too, we've had those. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1415.0s)]
*  And oftentimes it's because we didn't quite understand [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1417.52s)]
*  how to get the best out of this guest. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1422.56s)]
*  Something about the way we had like tried to make [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1424.32s)]
*  this conversation and these points and the communication style work [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1429.48s)]
*  didn't resonate with the listeners. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1433.76s)]
*  Sometimes and I'm more guilty of this in our case often, [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1435.9199999999998s)]
*  we go into the episode already wanting a certain kind of episode. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1439.04s)]
*  OK. And you have this guest. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1443.04s)]
*  You're like and some and some is from it's from a very good place. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1446.6799999999998s)]
*  You had a fan. You know, their work. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1449.2s)]
*  You want to sort of fanboy out over a thing or you're thinking this person [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1451.04s)]
*  expert in X, Y and Z. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1454.44s)]
*  Let's ask them X, Y and Z because they're very good at it. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1455.56s)]
*  And it's going to work with your audience in particular way. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1457.96s)]
*  It's going to work with your team. Yeah. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1459.8s)]
*  And when you do that, sometimes it works. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1461.1599999999999s)]
*  But sometimes it has a certain level of artifice and [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1463.6s)]
*  constraint to what is really a free flowing human conversation. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1468.2s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1473.2s)]
*  I think the audience can feel it. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1474.1200000000001s)]
*  The guests can feel it. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1475.96s)]
*  And then it's hard to describe. [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1477.28s)]
*  But there is something about that. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1479.0s)]
*  And to be honest, I don't have an answer to that. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1480.72s)]
*  Like sometimes you have to because somebody is launching a new book or a new movie. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1482.2s)]
*  You have to ask about it. That's great. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1484.52s)]
*  Right. It's kind of part of the deal because they want to promote it. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1485.96s)]
*  It's amazing. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1487.96s)]
*  Sometimes if you're a fan, you want to ask them about that particular thing. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1489.0s)]
*  And I've tried to get better at it. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1492.16s)]
*  I've tried to give more space and just follow the conversation. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1493.28s)]
*  But it's tricky. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1496.2s)]
*  And to your point, the listener can tell. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1497.36s)]
*  I mean, Shuram and I were talking about this before we started recording. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1498.8799999999999s)]
*  And I had the same thing. I'm new to this role. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1502.12s)]
*  And the first couple podcasts I did, I way overprepared. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1504.32s)]
*  And I did exactly what you're saying, where I was like, there's an arc. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1508.92s)]
*  People want to hear about X from this person. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1511.48s)]
*  I'm going to make sure I get it out of them. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1513.76s)]
*  I'm going to make sure I ask this really amazing, well-crafted question. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1515.32s)]
*  And then to your point, sometimes that works. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1518.8799999999999s)]
*  And sometimes it just feels really fabricated. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1520.92s)]
*  And going back to the analogy of podcasts being people's best friends, [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1523.04s)]
*  imagine showing up to a friend's house and there's some other friends there. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1527.3600000000001s)]
*  And someone is like, we have to talk about this today. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1531.92s)]
*  We have to follow this conversation arc. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1534.72s)]
*  And I think sometimes if people want to talk about that, [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1538.48s)]
*  it's in the news and everyone's excited about it. Great. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1541.1200000000001s)]
*  But when it doesn't feel organic, think about how strange that is in real life. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1543.72s)]
*  It feels the same on podcasts. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1548.64s)]
*  It totally is. And I'll say, [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1550.32s)]
*  sometimes I'm guilty of this. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1552.6399999999999s)]
*  Sometimes I'll do something where I think the underlying psychology is like, [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1554.56s)]
*  I'm going to show you how smart I am about this topic. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1557.56s)]
*  Oh, totally. Sriram loves to do that. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1559.52s)]
*  He loves to do that. He'd be like, [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1562.6799999999998s)]
*  so when you did this and then you followed up with this, [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1565.08s)]
*  in your mind, was this what you were thinking and feeling? [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1568.0s)]
*  Hold on, hold on, hold on. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1571.6s)]
*  I would say the case where it comes from is sometimes when you're a fan, [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1573.9599999999998s)]
*  you meet somebody and you want to show them that you've done the work. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1576.9599999999998s)]
*  I do like a one minute thing of like, well, you obviously did this, [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1579.8s)]
*  and you know, I'm going to hit you with this. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1582.84s)]
*  And then this year you did that and you wrote this and they'd be like, [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1583.84s)]
*  they'd be like, where does he go? [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1588.12s)]
*  And then finally he'd be like, I'm laughing because I do the same. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1590.12s)]
*  Yeah. Well, here's a very surprising thing, which I didn't realize. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1595.1599999999999s)]
*  It surprised me for sure. [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1598.6s)]
*  I was talking to a really famous person about interviews, [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1599.8s)]
*  one of the most famous people in the world. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1602.6799999999998s)]
*  And I was asking them and they said, you know what? [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1604.52s)]
*  When a fan interviews me, right? [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1607.6399999999999s)]
*  One, it's amazing because this person is a fan of your work, your craft, [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1609.96s)]
*  your movie book, whatever. It's great. [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1612.76s)]
*  You feel good about it. But you also feel real pressure, right? [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1614.24s)]
*  Because if that person asks you, right, let's say you're interviewing Michael Jordan, [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1616.92s)]
*  you're like, tell me about, you know, you know, [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1620.0800000000002s)]
*  crossing over Biden Russell and winning the game. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1622.16s)]
*  Yeah. And you're like, God, I've told this story like a hundred times before. [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1623.96s)]
*  This person heard that story. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1626.24s)]
*  I am now on the spot to deliver something because this person is such a fan. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1627.5200000000002s)]
*  Now they have to perform for you. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1631.48s)]
*  But also they have to perform for you. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1633.16s)]
*  But they want to because they are like this person. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1634.96s)]
*  I mean so much to them. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1638.04s)]
*  I need to give them something right. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1639.6000000000001s)]
*  And they need pressure too. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1641.76s)]
*  And pressure is never a good spot for a conversation. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1643.24s)]
*  Shriram comes from this place of like the generosity of spirit, [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1645.92s)]
*  where he just he wants to make this work and you can see the yearning. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1650.0800000000002s)]
*  Let me give you the real secret sauce of podcasting. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1654.56s)]
*  Aarti kicks me under the table here. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1660.72s)]
*  She takes me up going, God, too long for a story. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1663.2s)]
*  She's like, that is me. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1665.88s)]
*  I leave as an exercise, the listener to me. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1667.8400000000001s)]
*  If you can spot the moments in every episode. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1669.92s)]
*  Now I have to know how many kicks there have been in this podcast so far. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1672.48s)]
*  I think you can share. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1675.92s)]
*  I was going to say, I think my secret weapon, [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1681.4s)]
*  which is many podcast hosts secret weapon is your editor. [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1684.3600000000001s)]
*  I think a lot of people who are listeners forget that. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1687.88s)]
*  They're like, oh, my gosh, you were so concise. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1690.04s)]
*  You have such great questions. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1691.72s)]
*  I'm like, you didn't hear the ones I cut out. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1692.72s)]
*  But I want to at least kind of end this segment about podcasting with a question, [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1694.52s)]
*  which I think, you know, to the point of delivering value to listeners, [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1699.72s)]
*  even though it is very much an art, are there any tricks, any growth hacks, [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1703.6s)]
*  anything that was like an 80 20, whether it was something as simple [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1710.24s)]
*  as like choosing the right thumbnails, whether it was choosing to do video [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1713.36s)]
*  instead of just audio, are there any things that maybe a new podcaster [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1716.6s)]
*  should really keep in mind as like, OK, just make sure you check these boxes. [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1720.36s)]
*  So there is an expression which sounds very mean, [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1724.0s)]
*  which is use all parts of the buffalo. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1726.32s)]
*  And so basically what it sounds very mean to me, I'm sorry. [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1729.4s)]
*  But that is the expression. [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1732.92s)]
*  But we do this. [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1733.96s)]
*  We have seen our app of a video file and a bunch of audio files. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1735.44s)]
*  Right. Like that's the thing we have. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1739.16s)]
*  Now, what I think you need to do is to take that [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1740.8799999999999s)]
*  and then repurpose that in every single way for every single platform. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1744.12s)]
*  And somebody like Gary Vaynerchuk does this very well, [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1748.4s)]
*  where he puts a lot of effort to take every bit of content [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1752.4s)]
*  and make it the most native version possible for each platform. [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1754.6s)]
*  So, for example, right. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1758.68s)]
*  That means on YouTube, you have to really into video on audio. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1759.84s)]
*  You want to have amazing sound engineering. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1763.32s)]
*  You want to make it sound good. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1765.08s)]
*  You want to have lead in intros. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1766.6s)]
*  You want to cut it up into short versions for a reels or a tick tock. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1768.08s)]
*  And then you want to extract the text out of it and the learnings [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1771.36s)]
*  and put it on Twitter or on Substack. [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1774.76s)]
*  One of the ways to think about it is your podcast is really hard [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1777.36s)]
*  because you will have a native podcast platform, say just Apple. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1780.84s)]
*  There is no discovery mechanism. There is no algorithm. Right. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1783.36s)]
*  So it's really word of mouth. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1786.1999999999998s)]
*  And a lot of other platforms have discovery mechanisms like, you know, [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1787.6799999999998s)]
*  Twitter, Instagram, YouTube, obviously. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1790.76s)]
*  And the more you are native to what that platform wants, the easier. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1793.1599999999999s)]
*  I think what's important there is we talked about a podcast being kind of like a product. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1798.36s)]
*  If you're founding a company, you're not just like, hey, [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1801.6399999999999s)]
*  we're going to create this product. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1803.32s)]
*  We're going to put it on one distribution channel. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1804.56s)]
*  And we're just going to keep it the same forever. [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1806.48s)]
*  You test a bunch of different things out. [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1808.24s)]
*  You test marketing channels, you test copy, you iterate the product. [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1809.96s)]
*  Another thing I want to hear from you about is this difference [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1812.88s)]
*  between what you might call an audience and a community, something that I think [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1815.96s)]
*  is interesting that you've ventured into recently is these in-person events [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1819.92s)]
*  and really translating what you're doing digitally into something physically. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1824.56s)]
*  Audience is kind of unidirectional. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1828.64s)]
*  A bunch of people listening to your podcast, but a community, [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1831.48s)]
*  there's connections within the communities of listeners to other listeners. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1834.04s)]
*  And then also in reverse from you as hosts back to the community as well. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1837.8400000000001s)]
*  And so how are you thinking about that? [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1841.88s)]
*  That's the goal. That's the long term goal. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1844.16s)]
*  We want to have these cohorts of people when they engage with us. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1846.88s)]
*  It's not just value from our show and our content, [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1850.72s)]
*  but from each other being in that same cohort. [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1853.44s)]
*  That's, I think, the ideal in state for us that day, that evening, [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1856.0s)]
*  when we had people coming in, that's, I think, kind of when it hit both of us, [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1859.24s)]
*  where we were like, this is really cool. [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1862.68s)]
*  We have a couple hundred people here who showed up for no reason [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1865.04s)]
*  other than to just come see us in person and hang out with us. [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1868.6s)]
*  And to us, they were like, wait a second. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1871.8s)]
*  We've kind of gone from just being these podcast hosts who are goofy, [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1873.76s)]
*  getting guests to show up to being like, we can now have these people. [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1878.0s)]
*  And a lot of them there, I think, like 70% of them are founders. [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1882.32s)]
*  And it was great because they all got value from just talking to each other. [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1885.8s)]
*  One of the most interesting pieces I ever read on this topic is [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1890.08s)]
*  Kevin Kelly's legendary 1000 true fans. [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1892.48s)]
*  Basically, the idea is that if you're creating anything of any product, [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1894.88s)]
*  you want to find your first 1000 ideally true fans, right? [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1898.88s)]
*  Who will consume anything that you do and they trust you. [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1902.1200000000001s)]
*  If you do that, you're really off to the races. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1904.32s)]
*  And I think the community really comes from that, which is, [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1906.2s)]
*  are these people connecting to each other? [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1909.6s)]
*  Are they finding value out of just what we do? [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1911.68s)]
*  And look, we are not doing this as a job. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1914.2s)]
*  We really want to do this if people are going to be like, [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1916.96s)]
*  I just helped me build a company. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1920.08s)]
*  This helped me get ahead of my career. [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1922.36s)]
*  When we did this event, a lot of people met each other. [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1923.9599999999998s)]
*  There are no folks who think of doing a meetup even without us. [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1925.9599999999998s)]
*  Will this grow? I don't know. [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1929.28s)]
*  But I think you do need some sort of that kind of goal or mission to fuel you. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1930.32s)]
*  Well, what's your mission in that case? [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1936.36s)]
*  Because you both said you just kind of stumbled into this for fun. [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1938.08s)]
*  It's been going well. You like it. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1941.28s)]
*  But to my knowledge, you're not running ads on it. [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1944.0s)]
*  I don't think you're going to sell to something like Spotify. [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1946.4399999999998s)]
*  And so what is the end state of this? [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1949.28s)]
*  Like, what are you looking towards building this? [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1951.96s)]
*  We really believe that technology entrepreneurship [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1954.56s)]
*  is one of the biggest forces for good in the world. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1958.76s)]
*  In all the ways that you mean the word good. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1963.2s)]
*  And we want to find... [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1966.08s)]
*  It's literally benefited us. [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1967.24s)]
*  Oh, yeah, it's really benefited us. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1968.6s)]
*  We would not have met with our technology. [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1969.8s)]
*  We met online, you know, 20 years ago, our jobs, you know, everything that we have. [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1971.56s)]
*  This is our way of maybe giving back. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1976.16s)]
*  It's not as catchy as other companies' mission statements and stuff, [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1977.68s)]
*  but it works for us. [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1981.3200000000002s)]
*  You know what? I have to ask you guys. [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1983.2800000000002s)]
*  You seem very aligned on a lot of your answers. [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1985.2s)]
*  Like, what do you guys disagree on? [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1989.0s)]
*  You guys are a married couple. [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1991.0s)]
*  I actually I don't know if you guys know this. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1992.5600000000002s)]
*  I have a separate podcast from the A16Z podcast that I do with my husband. [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1994.2s)]
*  And let me just say we don't agree on everything. [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=1998.88s)]
*  Oh, no, all the time, all the time. [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2001.3200000000002s)]
*  We do disagree quite a bit. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2002.96s)]
*  I get kicked under the table a lot. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2004.44s)]
*  I mean, I think also part of it is this. [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2006.84s)]
*  We've known each other for half our lives now. [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2010.08s)]
*  Like last year was a year where we we've known each other for more time [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2012.08s)]
*  than not knowing each other. [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2015.32s)]
*  So I think it's taken us a while to get to this point where [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2016.56s)]
*  we agree on a lot of things on like at least like on an abstract sense of it. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2021.8799999999999s)]
*  But the details of it, we still differ and disagree quite a bit. [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2025.84s)]
*  Oh, yeah, like that's what like part of the magic is, [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2028.9599999999998s)]
*  because we bring such different lenses and this is everything like [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2031.36s)]
*  choice of guests, you know, how does the thumbnail look, kinds of questions. [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2034.28s)]
*  Are we spending too much time on something, not enough time on something [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2037.8s)]
*  or something even broader, like, you know, what should we call the show? [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2040.2s)]
*  You know, and it's kind of a constant discussion and back and forth. [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2043.1200000000001s)]
*  And, you know, and are these often mostly right? [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2045.76s)]
*  Our lenses are different. [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2048.44s)]
*  I'm very left brained as a person. [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2050.48s)]
*  I'm also much more introverted. [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2052.32s)]
*  And I look at it as a very what are they here for? [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2055.04s)]
*  What do we have to convey kind of thing? [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2059.04s)]
*  I look at it in like it has to be really clean, like the narrative in the story. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2061.16s)]
*  I think Shriram is more of like a artist. [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2066.24s)]
*  He's a showman. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2070.04s)]
*  He brings high energy. [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2071.24s)]
*  He's very extroverted. [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2072.8399999999997s)]
*  People love like, you know, you can see them even before we hit the record button. [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2074.92s)]
*  They're already yapping away. [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2079.44s)]
*  They spend 20 minutes just chatting and I'm like, stop, stop, stop. [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2080.72s)]
*  Save this like material for the show. [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2084.3599999999997s)]
*  And they just love being in the room with them and just chatting with them. [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2086.3999999999996s)]
*  I think also like wasn't holding the show honest, right? [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2090.6000000000004s)]
*  Like she be the one which is like, hey, we need to do this for this person. [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2094.48s)]
*  Right. Like this question. [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2098.08s)]
*  She's one often holding me honest and sometimes I often a weird tangent. [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2099.92s)]
*  And I think we balance it out. [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2104.08s)]
*  But yeah, we do disagree a lot. [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2105.32s)]
*  It doesn't show. [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2108.04s)]
*  So I want to ask you about community as well. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2109.8s)]
*  You've been creating these WhatsApp chats with a bunch of creators and they're great. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2112.84s)]
*  And I can't believe I mean, [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2118.6s)]
*  Arthur, you mentioned this like energy that's rerum has, like, [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2120.7599999999998s)]
*  I don't know how you're always posting in there, finding all these things from Twitter or elsewhere. [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2123.48s)]
*  Like, how are you thinking about building those communities? [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2127.84s)]
*  I think that it's kind of been a shift in the way we think about social media and online conversation. [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2130.84s)]
*  So, for example, like 15 years ago, when Twitter first started around 2008 or 2007, [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2136.48s)]
*  you would just come in there and you would post what you had for lunch and it was perfectly fine. [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2142.12s)]
*  And everyone is just kind of a small set of friends. [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2146.2799999999997s)]
*  Nobody's going to dunk you. [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2148.08s)]
*  And then it shows up in the national, you know, you know, what is social media? [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2149.2799999999997s)]
*  What is online community as change in many, many exciting ways? [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2153.24s)]
*  And we've seen the rise of YouTube and then Instagram and then Snapchat and TikTok and then video and, [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2157.08s)]
*  you know, discard and, you know, I can keep going on and on. [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2164.04s)]
*  The types of posts we would do on Facebook is so funny, right? [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2166.84s)]
*  We just be like, you know, going to the store, like meeting a friend. [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2169.68s)]
*  And people liked that. [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2173.96s)]
*  Now it's very different. [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2176.2799999999997s)]
*  The bar is much higher, but it's also bifurcated in a way where you have something like TikTok, [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2177.4s)]
*  which is more topical. [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2181.1600000000003s)]
*  I'd be remiss not to ask you about your experience at Twitter and where you see that evolving [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2182.96s)]
*  or how you see the kind of whole matrix of social, because if people aren't aware, [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2187.6s)]
*  you obviously have had some pretty intimate involvement in the recent acquisition by Elon. [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2191.64s)]
*  At least you got to see kind of you got a front row seat. [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2199.6s)]
*  Well, I think what's happened is, you know, if you go back five, six years ago, [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2202.6800000000003s)]
*  it felt like social media was in a bit of a stasis, right? [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2206.44s)]
*  You had two, three companies which really dominated. [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2208.8s)]
*  I worked for, you know, some of them and you kind of posted in ways where you expected [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2211.32s)]
*  everything was going to be public. [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2216.84s)]
*  But in the last few years, I think you've seen an explosion of innovation and things have shifted [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2218.48s)]
*  in a few dimensions. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2222.28s)]
*  We've moved from a follower graph to now having AI and recommendations drive so much of what we do. [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2223.28s)]
*  YouTube, you know, recommendations drive a lot of it. [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2228.8s)]
*  TikTok, the follower graph almost doesn't matter. [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2231.6s)]
*  It's really the for you page that really matters. [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2234.04s)]
*  The computer is obviously explaining with it. [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2236.04s)]
*  So that's one dimension. [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2237.16s)]
*  The other dimension, I would say, is in kind of the size of the spaces. [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2238.56s)]
*  Mark Zuckerberg was saying, I think some time recently, that so much of the conversation on Instagram [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2243.2s)]
*  is somebody takes an Instagram post and then sends it to a group chat and it sparks off a conversation. [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2247.4s)]
*  So you kind of this public to private space transition happening in ways that just wasn't happening before. [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2251.2s)]
*  Third, I spent all of my day at the job when Arthi is not kicking me under the table, [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2257.24s)]
*  working on crypto. [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2262.64s)]
*  But one of the core ideas behind it is that, you know, power to the people and decentralization. [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2264.52s)]
*  The idea that, hey, instead of one central set of people running everything and calling the shots [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2269.6s)]
*  and having all the economics, how do we do it in a way where these things are no protocols and everyone [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2275.1200000000003s)]
*  has collective ownership? [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2279.6800000000003s)]
*  So there are a bunch of these sort of zeitgeist ships happening. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2280.36s)]
*  And as you said, I was briefly helping Elon at Twitter. [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2283.96s)]
*  I was there on the let it sink in day. [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2288.7200000000003s)]
*  And it now feels like social is active and alive again. [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2291.7599999999998s)]
*  There was a time when you're like, well, I have Facebook, I have Instagram, I have Twitter, [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2296.7999999999997s)]
*  maybe Snapchat and that is that right. [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2301.0s)]
*  That's going to be all the social media anybody ever needs. [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2302.68s)]
*  And that is not true anymore. [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2305.3599999999997s)]
*  Yeah, I think I want to hear your perspective on this idea of the creator economy and specifically [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2306.48s)]
*  the creator middle class. [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2312.2s)]
*  So we've seen the rise of the independent creator over the last few years. [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2313.68s)]
*  And I think in some spaces, you could say text, especially, we've seen independent creators be able [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2318.8s)]
*  to kind of lucratively monetize their followings through that. [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2323.6400000000003s)]
*  Audio is interesting because if you actually look at the top podcasts, the charts, they're all people [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2328.44s)]
*  who had large distribution, who are already successful, who already had reach, who are really [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2334.6400000000003s)]
*  dominating there. [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2340.2400000000002s)]
*  And you could say that's partially because of the discoverability or monetization that exists within [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2341.2000000000003s)]
*  audio. Do you have any thoughts there on whether we're really going to be able to build this [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2344.96s)]
*  quote unquote creator middle class within audio specifically? [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2348.56s)]
*  You are kind of what you measure, right? [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2352.4s)]
*  And with audio, there's just not a whole lot that's measurable right now. [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2354.12s)]
*  A lot of it is just like hidden behind these big black boxes. [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2359.16s)]
*  Right at the beginning, we played this game, you're looking at like 4500 downloads an episode to make it to [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2362.68s)]
*  one percent. So where does the chart fall off? [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2367.08s)]
*  Like what is distribution like? [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2370.2s)]
*  Who's getting that? There's no transparency of metrics. [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2371.72s)]
*  I think if you have better metrics and better discoverability, just helping creators be successful with more [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2374.32s)]
*  tools, I think you're going to get there. [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2379.28s)]
*  But I think the other part of it is at the end of the day, if you're making money through brands or [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2381.52s)]
*  sponsorships or any of these brands need to start seeing value. [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2387.32s)]
*  Right. And I think that feedback loop is not quite there yet where it's like, well, OK, this person talked [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2390.8s)]
*  about this product. [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2397.32s)]
*  They gave a coupon code, the attribution system behind it. [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2398.7200000000003s)]
*  A lot of it is still super early days. [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2401.8799999999997s)]
*  We haven't kind of cracked that feedback loop. [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2404.3999999999996s)]
*  So it's going to happen. [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2406.4399999999996s)]
*  But I think it's just going to be a while. [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2408.08s)]
*  And just like any other social networks, a lot of the top percentile or couple percentile [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2410.4399999999996s)]
*  creators are going to have an outsized kind of return and impact. [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2420.0s)]
*  And then there's this big long tail of folks that you're going to see. [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2423.9199999999996s)]
*  I kind of sort of disagree with you that these people who live audiences, because we have the top charts. [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2427.2799999999997s)]
*  We look at Huberman did not have a large audience, came out of nowhere. [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2432.3599999999997s)]
*  That's true. [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2434.8799999999997s)]
*  We on the top of the charts. [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2436.2s)]
*  Lex Friedman came out of nowhere really to build one of the most popular podcasts around. [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2437.08s)]
*  There are definitely obviously celebrities, for example, Emma Chamberlain has one of the popular [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2442.9199999999996s)]
*  podcasts around. [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2445.96s)]
*  I think you're right that these people didn't have followings, but I think they didn't burst into [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2446.8399999999997s)]
*  the scene. I think the thing that we're missing is it took a really long time for a lot of these folks [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2451.9199999999996s)]
*  to keep chipping away at it. [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2457.0s)]
*  It just looks to us like overnight successes, because it suddenly got into the zeitgeist and [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2458.84s)]
*  everybody's like, Huberman, Lex, and you just hear that in your echo chamber that you are in. [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2462.8s)]
*  But they've been doing this for years now. [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2468.2000000000003s)]
*  I think that's kind of going back to the point of it just takes a while. [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2470.6000000000004s)]
*  Like all of these, like the breakout stars don't break out overnight. [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2474.32s)]
*  It just takes five, six, seven years to get there. [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2477.32s)]
*  Yeah, which maybe somebody listen to this and they want to start their own podcast. [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2479.88s)]
*  I will say, you know, this is amazing stuff. [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2482.6800000000003s)]
*  It's like 90 percent of podcasts don't last episode 20 and the remaining 90 percent don't last [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2484.2000000000003s)]
*  episode 40. That is so true. [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2488.2s)]
*  So if you're doing a podcast, a couple of things. [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2490.3599999999997s)]
*  Number one, you have to really enjoy doing it every single week, because if you don't enjoy it, [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2493.04s)]
*  you will not make it episode 20. [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2497.48s)]
*  You'll definitely not make it episode 40. [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2498.56s)]
*  So you kind of have to look into yourself. [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2500.12s)]
*  Right. I don't look at the numbers because numbers will be zero for quite a bit of quite a bit of time. [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2502.16s)]
*  And that's really hard for people. [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2506.2799999999997s)]
*  Make it to 40 and then you can talk about whether you want to quit or not. [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2507.64s)]
*  Well, that is true, because once you make it to 40, you'll learn so much about the art of podcasting. [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2510.7599999999998s)]
*  What is working? What is not? [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2516.96s)]
*  The other thing I just couldn't tell people, and this was earlier about the product market fit and how we think about a startup is I sometimes see podcasts and they do their very first podcast. [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2518.84s)]
*  They record an entire season before launching. [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2526.36s)]
*  And that is bad because I think what happens is you're getting no feedback. [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2529.44s)]
*  I started this person and they had recorded, I think, like 15 episodes, you know, back to back and they're putting it out. [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2532.88s)]
*  They're going to put off like three, four months. [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2538.04s)]
*  This person, maybe this is really work. [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2539.76s)]
*  But the problem is like when something isn't working, they're not getting the feedback. [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2541.4s)]
*  They only react on it like next year. [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2544.04s)]
*  And that's really hard because you need to react on it week to week. [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2546.64s)]
*  Your OODA loop, you know, your Observe, Orient, Decide, Act, that loop needs to be super short. [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2549.64s)]
*  Put an episode, look at what's happening, change it up the next week, change up the week after. [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2554.16s)]
*  And that iteration cycle by episode 40, you'd be so dramatically better than you were in episode one. [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2558.48s)]
*  Yeah, definitely. [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2564.76s)]
*  I mean, both of you have been founders or have grown companies to significant size. [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2566.04s)]
*  What would be interesting is just to hear from you as people who have created podcasts. [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2572.0s)]
*  And as we've talked about a couple of times here, the infrastructure is not great. [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2575.72s)]
*  We don't really get as much signal as we'd like. [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2580.4s)]
*  The tooling is pretty nascent, at least as we compare it to something like text. [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2583.36s)]
*  If you put your founder hat on, are there certain companies or gaps that you think really need to be addressed that could help podcasters like you and I? [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2588.28s)]
*  There are a few parts to look at this, right? [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2596.08s)]
*  One is the content, the guest booking. [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2598.04s)]
*  We look at the whole funnel of the podcast, right? [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2601.2s)]
*  And if you look at it, there's the initial part, which is the prep, getting the guest booked on our show, [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2604.2799999999997s)]
*  actually hosting the conversation, recording it, the tools for recording it, all of that. [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2609.8799999999997s)]
*  There, if you look at it, initially it used to be super manual. [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2614.24s)]
*  The tools were not that great. [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2616.96s)]
*  Guest booking was like calendly chaos of going back and forth between the three of us. [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2618.92s)]
*  And so a lot of that has gotten a bit more streamlined. [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2624.16s)]
*  Then post recording, we used to struggle with like, okay, transcripts, what do we do now? [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2627.2799999999997s)]
*  Break this into clips so that it's bite-sized and consumable. [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2633.04s)]
*  We want Insta reels. [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2637.04s)]
*  What do we do there? [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2638.9599999999996s)]
*  TikTok has to look different, feel different. [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2640.0s)]
*  Shorts is a little bit different. [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2642.4799999999996s)]
*  Like it has to be under a minute. [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2643.9199999999996s)]
*  Now reels can be a little bit longer. [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2645.9599999999996s)]
*  So you kind of sort of have to figure this out. [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2648.16s)]
*  And now I think tools like Descript has been helpful. [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2649.7599999999998s)]
*  There are lots of other tools that are now coming in and playing a really good role there. [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2652.24s)]
*  And then post, right? [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2656.32s)]
*  Like looking at metrics and stuff. [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2657.48s)]
*  We use Anchor, we use Simplecast, we look at podcast download numbers. [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2659.7200000000003s)]
*  YouTube has been really good. [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2663.6000000000004s)]
*  Like I really like the Studio metrics page. [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2664.76s)]
*  There are a lot of these tools that are now coming in and just getting really good. [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2667.6000000000004s)]
*  And practically like month to month, you're seeing step function changes [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2672.4s)]
*  in what value they're offering. [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2676.48s)]
*  So I do think we are in a really interesting time now. [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2678.0s)]
*  We tried to prep for a couple of episodes by pulling, pushing into ChatGPT. [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2680.88s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2683.92s)]
*  And that was kind of fun because we fed it like a bunch of like, [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2684.56s)]
*  this is an author, these are the books I've written. [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2687.84s)]
*  Hold on, hold on, hold on. [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2689.48s)]
*  Here's what happened. [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2690.48s)]
*  We forgot to prep for an episode. [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2691.96s)]
*  The truth comes out. [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2694.7599999999998s)]
*  And then Arthi at the last minute was like, I don't know what to ask. [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2696.24s)]
*  And then so she fed it into ChatGPT. [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2699.52s)]
*  And we got a bunch of stuff. [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2702.08s)]
*  We were like, it's actually pretty good. [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2703.04s)]
*  I actually sent the questions to Sriram. [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2704.7999999999997s)]
*  And Sriram was like, yeah, these are pretty good. [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2707.64s)]
*  And I was like, I did not come up with them. [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2709.0s)]
*  ChatGPT did. [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2710.48s)]
*  You know, it's so funny. [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2711.6s)]
*  I have to confess. [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2712.44s)]
*  So for the trivia at the very beginning, around half of those questions, [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2713.2000000000003s)]
*  I just asked ChatGPT, what are some interesting, fun facts about podcasting? [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2716.48s)]
*  I came up with a few on my own. [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2721.28s)]
*  But yeah, ChatGPT was my little assistant as well. [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2722.64s)]
*  I think sometimes in the future, it's going to be like, [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2725.6s)]
*  that it's going to be just like, you know, when you buy a product [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2727.52s)]
*  from the supermarket, you are like, you know, what content is going to be like, [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2729.64s)]
*  this was purely human generated. [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2732.52s)]
*  There's only 10% of AI participation in this podcast. [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2734.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2737.16s)]
*  You know, I heard Mark actually talk about this on a recent interview with BJ. [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2737.6s)]
*  And he talked about Mad Men, which is one of the most popular TV shows [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2741.12s)]
*  of, I think, all time. [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2744.96s)]
*  And the writers of the show talked about how they would sit in a room [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2746.88s)]
*  and they would come up with a bunch of different plot lines. [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2751.2s)]
*  And they would come up with them partially because they were like, [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2754.12s)]
*  let's get all the obvious stuff out of the way. [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2756.72s)]
*  Let's just like write what everyone expects. [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2759.3599999999997s)]
*  And Mad Men has now become known for the fact that they actually [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2761.24s)]
*  like you don't know what's going to happen. [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2764.56s)]
*  You think you do. [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2766.0s)]
*  And then it goes, you know, it takes a left turn. [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2766.56s)]
*  And so I think that's another way where even as I was preparing for this [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2768.84s)]
*  interview, I was like, yeah, let's use ChatGPT. [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2773.32s)]
*  Some of it's OK. [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2775.96s)]
*  Some of it's good. [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2776.7200000000003s)]
*  But even the good stuff, like, let me come up with better questions [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2777.48s)]
*  than what it's outputting here. [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2780.8s)]
*  Like, these are the obvious things that everyone expects to ask that I can [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2782.04s)]
*  almost guarantee that a previous interview has asked. [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2785.04s)]
*  And so, yeah, I also think it's a tool to like push us. [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2788.2000000000003s)]
*  It's a good generic baseline, I think. [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2790.7200000000003s)]
*  And I think it's important to see what that baseline looks like so that you [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2793.04s)]
*  can actually like do the work. [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2796.48s)]
*  It's like a medium version of humanity. [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2798.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2801.4s)]
*  If you put it on Google and you had to write up something about this person, [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2801.92s)]
*  you know, what would you get? [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2806.44s)]
*  And it kind of gives you some version of that. [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2807.36s)]
*  Well, the truth has come out for both of us. [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2809.1600000000003s)]
*  We're already using the AI to help with our interviews. [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2811.1600000000003s)]
*  All right. I want to close things out with a question because both of you have had [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2815.1200000000003s)]
*  the very cool opportunity to talk to some of the most impressive people in the world. [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2818.8s)]
*  I mean, Elon Musk, Mark Zuckerberg, Calvin Harris. [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2823.6400000000003s)]
*  So we're talking like across industries or skill sets as well. [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2826.56s)]
*  And something that came to mind as I was thinking about what question to ask you [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2830.36s)]
*  about all these wonderful folks that you've spoken to is something that I've [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2835.24s)]
*  heard Naval talk about, which is being jealous of someone, a celebrity, for example, [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2838.96s)]
*  isn't very productive because if you really think about it, if you really think [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2844.24s)]
*  about every aspect of their lives, like who their loved ones are, like how they [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2846.96s)]
*  spend their day, how wealthy they are or not, ultimately, it's very rare, [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2850.7999999999997s)]
*  if true at all, that you would want to trade every aspect of your life for that [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2855.56s)]
*  person's life instead of just comparing one sliver of it. [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2859.2799999999997s)]
*  But I thought that frame might be interesting to ask you of all the people you've [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2862.72s)]
*  talked to, who would you actually want to trade lives with? [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2866.84s)]
*  Who were you most like? Wow. [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2870.52s)]
*  In every aspect of talking to this person, like their stature, their warmth, [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2872.68s)]
*  their personality, the happiness they bring to life. [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2877.7999999999997s)]
*  Like, was there someone that you were like, wow, this person, you know, maybe [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2880.84s)]
*  unexpectedly has really captured me and I really respect the way that they've [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2883.72s)]
*  led their lives. [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2888.2799999999997s)]
*  Well, that's a very good question. [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2889.56s)]
*  By the way, if I remember the original Naval quote was somebody asked him in a [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2891.6s)]
*  party about Steve Jobs and how would they be Steve Jobs and Naval would tell them [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2894.64s)]
*  that Steve Jobs is dead. [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2898.2s)]
*  Like Steve Jobs would do anything to be you. [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2899.3199999999997s)]
*  And I actually, this is going to sound like a cliché, but in some ways, there's no [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2901.7599999999998s)]
*  real one person you want to be because in crypto, there's a sense of, you know, [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2907.72s)]
*  we talk about proof of work and proof of stake. [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2912.92s)]
*  And when you talk to somebody, you know, like they have done the work. [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2915.28s)]
*  Right. For example, let's say somebody is interested, they'll be like, well, why [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2919.08s)]
*  can't I be I be transplanted into Elon Musk and I have billions of dollars and all [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2922.0s)]
*  these companies and it'd be fun. [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2927.28s)]
*  But Elon Musk is not the Elon's set of a sum of his experiences and all the journey. [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2928.96s)]
*  And that's what makes him uniquely him. [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2933.1600000000003s)]
*  So I don't I don't mean sort of very philosophical about this, but I don't think [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2935.12s)]
*  there's one person I really want to transplant into because I would never be that person. [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2939.64s)]
*  You know, I would be me in living that person. [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2943.56s)]
*  It might be fun for a day or two, but ultimately I would probably get bored because I [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2945.48s)]
*  haven't seen the journey. [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2948.2s)]
*  What I've tried to do is like maybe steal things or been really impressed by things [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2949.12s)]
*  from certain people. [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2954.08s)]
*  They come in different dimensions. [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2955.7999999999997s)]
*  For example, Mark, he's just an encyclopedia of everything. [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2956.88s)]
*  Right. [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2959.68s)]
*  You know, he's off the cuff. [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2959.96s)]
*  He'll quote some like 50 year old book, you know, at which page number. [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2962.16s)]
*  And you're like, how do you have this in your head? [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2965.4s)]
*  Like, you know, this is crazy. [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2966.7999999999997s)]
*  We had like Anders Helzberg, who is a legendary programming language designer. [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2968.0s)]
*  And I think he's worked in one problem for 40 years and just honed that craft. [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2973.04s)]
*  He's the best in that in the world. [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2979.92s)]
*  And there's something so romantic and pure about that notion of like you work on one [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2981.32s)]
*  thing and you're going to be undisputably the very best in the world at it. [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2985.72s)]
*  And every one of these, I'm like, huh, like, could I steal some version of what that [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2991.32s)]
*  person has and apply it to my own life and my own job? [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2995.32s)]
*  Based on your question, I'm like, would I be here or would I be there? [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=2998.0s)]
*  I would rather be here. [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=3001.04s)]
*  You know, we're having the time of our lives just bantering across, me kicking him [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=3002.2400000000002s)]
*  under the table. [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=3006.56s)]
*  Usually we record these. [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=3008.52s)]
*  A lot of these are like late at night. [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=3009.7200000000003s)]
*  Our kids are asleep. [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=3011.2000000000003s)]
*  So we like have like an iPad here. [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=3012.2000000000003s)]
*  These folks are all really great. [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=3014.6800000000003s)]
*  They're very impressive, but they don't have the life that we do. [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=3016.0s)]
*  I would rather do this than anything else. [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=3020.84s)]
*  Which I think, which I think is also a great piece of advice, but I think [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=3022.52s)]
*  when I'm trying to create it, they're like, I want to be Rogan or I want to be [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=3024.7599999999998s)]
*  Lex or I want to be Alex Cooper. [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=3027.28s)]
*  I want to be, I want to do the next CDL, but you can't do that. [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=3029.48s)]
*  And not because you're not talented or capable, but you're not them, right? [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=3031.96s)]
*  They're doing the thing which works for them. [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=3035.96s)]
*  And MrBeast talks about this all the time. [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=3037.7599999999998s)]
*  Like you can't be a better MrBeast than MrBeast, right? [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=3039.68s)]
*  Because it is so native to him, right? [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=3042.64s)]
*  You need to find the thing which works for you and then be the very best at it. [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=3044.7599999999998s)]
*  You can't be better than Alex Cooper and call her daddy than what she does. [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=3048.96s)]
*  You can't be a better Rogan. [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=3052.0s)]
*  So you kind of have to learn from them, but you have to do it your way. [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=3053.24s)]
*  So, you know, steal from them, learn from them, see what's working. [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=3056.72s)]
*  But you have to infuse yourself into it. [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=3059.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=3062.2s)]
*  You know, if you listen to his Joe Rogan episode, there's a part where Joe is [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=3062.68s)]
*  talking to him about him dreaming up thumbnails and this idea where MrBeast [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=3066.7599999999998s)]
*  has worked on coming up with YouTube video titles for years and he prompts him. [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=3070.68s)]
*  He's like, he gives him a word. [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=3076.84s)]
*  I think he says like dog or something. [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=3077.7599999999998s)]
*  And the, the title that MrBeast comes up with in that moment, I was like, [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=3079.12s)]
*  shocked. [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=3082.92s)]
*  It was so good given that his brain had processed it for like a millisecond. [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=3083.36s)]
*  And so to your point, where all these AIs have been trained on a data [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=3088.04s)]
*  site, which is our lives. [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=3092.44s)]
*  And you can't really just copy and paste that to someone else's life. [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=3093.6800000000003s)]
*  Like MrBeast, he's a savant about online video. [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=3098.6400000000003s)]
*  I'll give you an example. [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=3102.2000000000003s)]
*  You watch his interview with Lex Friedman, right? [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=3102.76s)]
*  In the middle, he's like, Lex, while you're talking, all I'm seeing [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=3104.6000000000004s)]
*  is your metrics in video. [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=3106.8s)]
*  He really had him on our clubhouse show, right? [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=3109.04s)]
*  He would, you could see him being like, this part is boring to the audience. [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=3110.7599999999998s)]
*  So there's a part of his brain, which is always like, it's interesting. [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=3113.2s)]
*  Is it boring? [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=3115.52s)]
*  Right. [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=3116.2s)]
*  And it's been trained like a neural net over millions of videos that he's [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=3116.3599999999997s)]
*  watched and he, and he's seen it all the time. [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=3119.8399999999997s)]
*  You cannot compete with him on that, but you'll be the best at something else. [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=3122.2s)]
*  Right. [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=3125.8799999999997s)]
*  Like he can't, you know, MrBeast is not an Indian couple, you know, 20 years [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=3126.16s)]
*  and you know, jobs and so on. [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=3130.3999999999996s)]
*  So you have to be the best. [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=3133.0s)]
*  It's going to sound like, I don't know, some self-help book, but like, you [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=3133.9199999999996s)]
*  have to be the best you possible. [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=3136.64s)]
*  Someone's going to clip that, but no, I couldn't agree more. [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=3139.32s)]
*  And just for listeners, one tip to maybe surface that is if you've ever been in [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=3141.48s)]
*  a situation where someone has asked you, how did you notice that? [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=3146.84s)]
*  That is something that your brain is more trained around than other people. [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=3150.44s)]
*  So for me, I've been a marketer for a while and I'll just be like, [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=3154.28s)]
*  driving down the street and I'll be like, do you see that sign on the back of that [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=3156.6800000000003s)]
*  truck? Like that's genius marketing or like I'll be at the movie and I'll see [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=3159.1600000000003s)]
*  some copy and I'm always pointing this out kind of subconsciously. [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=3162.2400000000002s)]
*  And then people will be like, how did you notice that tiny little thing [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=3165.56s)]
*  somewhere? And I guarantee everyone listening has aspects of that in their [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=3168.4s)]
*  own life where people are just like, dude, like where'd that come from? [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=3172.52s)]
*  Like, why are you paying attention to that? [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=3176.12s)]
*  Because everyone else, they've, you know, they've drowned it out. [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=3177.56s)]
*  But maybe if you're a designer, you notice like the aesthetic within a restaurant [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=3179.92s)]
*  differently than someone else. [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=3182.64s)]
*  And so I think that's that's a wonderful place to end off. [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=3184.08s)]
*  Thank you so much. Both of you, Sriram and Aarti. [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=3186.8s)]
*  This was so fun. [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=3188.8s)]
*  And you know, we'll have to do this again sometime. [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=3189.84s)]
*  There was no almost no kicking. [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=3192.84s)]
*  So what's our kick count at the very end? [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=3194.28s)]
*  Just one. [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=3197.88s)]
*  Yeah. The audience can email us or tweet at us at where that was. [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=3199.08s)]
*  And we leave it as an exercise to the listeners. [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=3202.64s)]
*  Yeah, that's awesome. All right. [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=3204.44s)]
*  Well, thank you so much. [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5L_LD3xpU&t=3205.92s)]
