# How Discord Became a Developer Platform
**The a16z Podcast:** [June 23, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek)
*  That's the story of our kind of creative progress as humanity. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=0.0s)]
*  People build these tools which enables the next group of people [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=6.08s)]
*  to focus on a higher level set of problems. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=10.56s)]
*  Just in the last three weeks since launch, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=14.0s)]
*  developers have built over 20,000 new activities on the platform [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=16.64s)]
*  that's generating four billion minutes of user interaction per day. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=20.8s)]
*  The scale is sort of mind-boggling. What's going on? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=24.400000000000002s)]
*  I think something like 93% of Gen Z plays games where, you know, back when we were kids, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=27.32s)]
*  it was super weird to be playing games. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=32.52s)]
*  We're now seeing some really significant examples of companies being built entirely on Discord. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=34.76s)]
*  Bill Gates once said that a platform is when the economic value of everybody that uses it [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=39.88s)]
*  exceeds the value of the company that creates it. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=44.760000000000005s)]
*  This definition sets a pretty high bar for the few companies that surpass it. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=47.72s)]
*  But one company that does come to mind is Discord. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=52.2s)]
*  What officially started in 2015 can really be traced back to 2009, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=55.64s)]
*  when Discord co-founder and CEO Jason Citron [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=59.96s)]
*  started building tools and infrastructure for games. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=62.84s)]
*  Fast forward to today, and Discord now has over 200 million monthly active users. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=66.04s)]
*  Some even argue that the metaverse may actually be here. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=70.92s)]
*  It just doesn't quite look like The Sims. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=73.96000000000001s)]
*  So in today's episode, you'll get to hear from Jason alongside A16Z general partner, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=76.2s)]
*  who actually sold his company, Ubiquity 6, to Discord in 2021. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=81.64s)]
*  So what did Discord do differently to build such a thriving platform? [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=86.12s)]
*  They discuss everything from community-driven product development, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=89.56s)]
*  how Jason himself went from player to developer, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=92.68s)]
*  and also the focus on extensibility since the very beginning. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=95.24000000000001s)]
*  With Discord's recent release of embeddable apps, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=98.92000000000002s)]
*  what can we expect now that it's easier than ever for developers to build? [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=101.4s)]
*  As a reminder, the content here is for informational purposes only, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=110.68s)]
*  should not be taken as legal, business, tax, or investment advice, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=123.80000000000001s)]
*  or be used to evaluate any investment or security, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=127.24000000000001s)]
*  and is not directed at any investors or potential investors in any A16Z fund. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=129.8s)]
*  Please note that A16Z and its affiliates may also maintain investments [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=134.68s)]
*  in the companies discussed in this podcast. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=138.6s)]

*  I am so excited. Thank you for joining us, Jason Citron, CEO of Discord, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=150.76s)]
*  a former colleague, current friend, and the person who I know who's [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=154.2s)]
*  tried to start Game Studios the most number of times, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=158.51999999999998s)]
*  and ended up building insanely successful platforms along the way. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=163.16s)]
*  Today we're going to talk about all kinds of things [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=167.96s)]
*  focused on developers, infrastructure, the future of the Discord platform, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=170.28s)]
*  but before we get to that, maybe for folks who might not be as familiar with the crazy story [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=173.72s)]
*  that led to here, why don't we go back in history. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=178.60000000000002s)]
*  Let's start at the very beginning. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=181.64000000000001s)]
*  What was the vision for Discord when you first started out? [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=183.88s)]
*  Yeah, so way back in 2012, I was sitting around trying to think about [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=187.64000000000001s)]
*  what could be an exciting business to build, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=194.44s)]
*  and having spent most of my career, in fact all of my career and my childhood, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=197.39999999999998s)]
*  steeped in video games and multiplayer games, I had this hunch that multiplayer gaming [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=202.51999999999998s)]
*  and gaming in general was going to become much bigger than it already was at that time. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=208.6s)]
*  Back in 2012, gaming was pretty big, but it was kind of at the early innings of mobile [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=213.48s)]
*  and still trying to figure out where was gaming going to go, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=219.48s)]
*  and I thought that there'd be an opportunity to build a communications app for people who play [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=223.56s)]
*  games that would span all the platforms and all the devices as gaming would become bigger and more [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=230.52s)]
*  cross-platform. It largely has played out that way. Today in 2024, gaming is the largest form [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=236.84s)]
*  of entertainment, bigger than music and movies combined, growing fast, and people love to play [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=244.36s)]
*  games. It's gone mainstream. I think something like 93% of Gen Z plays games where back when [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=251.72s)]
*  we were kids, it was super weird to be playing games. What were the moments where you were [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=257.48s)]
*  playing games and you went from being a player and a consumer of games as a product to going, [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=263.4s)]
*  you know what, the tools I'm using here could be better. What was the moment where you shifted [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=269.48s)]
*  from being a player to a developer? Well, I fell in love with games when I was a little kid because [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=276.52s)]
*  they were a way for me to connect and spend quality time with people in my life. I remember [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=283.47999999999996s)]
*  sitting with my dad. I must have been four or five years old. This was like late 80s, [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=289.88s)]
*  and he introduced me to this game called Where in the World is Carmen San Diego? [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=294.91999999999996s)]
*  On his old, it was like a Packard Bell computer, and I just remember being so excited about being [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=298.68s)]
*  able to sit with my dad and spend some quality time with him exploring this world and trying to [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=303.4s)]
*  find this crazy lady. Over the years growing up, playing multiplayer games on consoles and then on [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=306.76s)]
*  the internet as that became a thing in the late 90s. Along the way, I met someone who basically [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=313.71999999999997s)]
*  was like, yo, I know how to make video games. A friend of mine, I was like 13 at the time, [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=324.28s)]
*  I was like, no, you don't. You can't just make video games. He was like, no, no, check it out. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=329.23999999999995s)]
*  We went to my computer and he fired up this thing called Cubasic and showed me how to draw a circle [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=332.92s)]
*  on the screen. I was like, oh my God, that's amazing. I can make video games. That was when [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=337.64000000000004s)]
*  I became an engineer and a programmer and I learned how to code. Then fast forward, I went to [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=342.28000000000003s)]
*  school, grew up, and got into an opportunity where I was able to start a company. Through the process [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=349.48s)]
*  of building a game on the iPhone, I actually launched a game the day the App Store opened in [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=355.96000000000004s)]
*  2008. One of the first 50 titles on the App Store. That took off like crazy as we now know, [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=360.52s)]
*  mobile has been the biggest computing platform in the world. Through that journey, [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=366.91999999999996s)]
*  realized that while I had made a fun game, it was called Aurora Faint, the technology that we had [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=370.91999999999996s)]
*  built, which was leaderboards, chat rooms, login, was something that other developers really wanted. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=376.52s)]
*  At the time, many game developers didn't know how to build infrastructure. I had learned how [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=383.96s)]
*  to do infrastructure and also how to make games. We spun out the back end tech and built this [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=388.36s)]
*  social network for mobile gaming. This was probably 2009. It was called OpenFaint. We opened up Aurora [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=393.16s)]
*  Faint. Lesson about branding from that. No one knows how to spell that thing. That was the first [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=398.52000000000004s)]
*  moment when I started building tools and infrastructure for games. That company did pretty [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=403.96000000000004s)]
*  well. Then in 2012, after I had moved on from that, started again building another game. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=410.28000000000003s)]
*  We began as a game studio as well in 2012 called Hammer and Chisel. We started as a game because I [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=418.76s)]
*  thought that the path to building the communications app would be to start with a multiplayer game. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=423.88s)]
*  I had this hunch that core long-form gaming was going to come to mobile in a big way. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=428.2s)]
*  We started building a team-based competitive multiplayer game on iPad at the time in 2012. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=434.36s)]
*  One thing led to another. The game didn't really work out, but through the process, [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=440.52000000000004s)]
*  in late 2014, we started talking about what if we just went to market directly with a chat app for [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=445.08s)]
*  gaming. My co-founder, Stan, had the insight for what that concept could look like. We started [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=450.68s)]
*  building it in January 2015 and then brought it to market in May 2015. That was how it all started. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=457.16s)]
*  There's a theme emerging here where at least twice now you approached building a product as an [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=465.24s)]
*  application developer. You could think of a game as an app. You discovered along the way that there's [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=474.04s)]
*  a bunch of really hard infrastructure, especially when it comes to real-time multiplayer gaming. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=478.20000000000005s)]
*  The history of computing is such that usually real-time gaming is one of the most demanding [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=482.28000000000003s)]
*  infrastructure environments. Then you discovered that there were a ton of infrastructure problems [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=487.40000000000003s)]
*  along the way. Then you ended up actually building those tools for other people to use [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=491.88s)]
*  and have since built one of the fastest growing biggest real-time communication platforms in the [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=496.04s)]
*  world, which is sort of insane to think about the scale of Discord. When you play forward [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=502.2s)]
*  from that moment in 2015 when Discord came out and today, how has the community on Discord helped [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=508.59999999999997s)]
*  shape the roadmap, the people actually using the infrastructure, whether those are users or developers? [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=516.4399999999999s)]
*  Our community, our user base, has been part of the conversation of what we're making from the first [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=523.56s)]
*  day. When we started talking about building Discord, of course we played a lot of multiplayer [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=530.92s)]
*  games ourselves, so we had a good sense for what the product should be and how it should work. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=536.28s)]
*  As anyone who's building a startup knows or building products, you need to make things for [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=542.76s)]
*  people. We're building products in service of other people. When we showed it to them, [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=548.76s)]
*  even just mock-ups, what parts got them excited, which parts seemed confusing. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=552.92s)]
*  Very quickly, once we got a prototype off the ground, we started giving it to our friends and [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=557.0s)]
*  having them try it and seeing what they liked and what they didn't like. Oh crap, we had to rebuild [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=562.36s)]
*  the voice tech three times and we missed an important set of features that we thought maybe [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=567.0s)]
*  was not important, but turns out it was. That was part of the ethos for how we built from the [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=572.0400000000001s)]
*  beginning. Then over the years, we've continued to build products that way in a sense that we [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=578.44s)]
*  always try to come back to what are we hearing from our customers, from our users, and the [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=583.64s)]
*  different types of people who use our products. Then how do we muck that with what are we excited [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=588.28s)]
*  to build for ourselves? Then of course, what do we think will be great for us as a business, [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=594.84s)]
*  because we are a company. Along the way, there have been many, many moments when [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=599.0s)]
*  large shifts have happened in our roadmap because of customers. I'll give you an example. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=606.1999999999999s)]
*  Initially, when we built Discord, it was very focused on being a voice and text chat app for [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=611.7199999999999s)]
*  guilds, people who play games in groups of 15 people. Actually, the max group size on Discord, [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=617.7199999999999s)]
*  I think, was 30 people, maybe 50. It was pretty low. We realized pretty quickly from talking to [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=624.8399999999999s)]
*  people that they wanted to use Discord as almost like an IRC, internet relay chat, [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=631.0s)]
*  public chat room replacement. In that context, what we saw was people were filling their servers [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=636.76s)]
*  up with 50 people. Then they were like, I can't add more people. What's going on? Oh crap. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=641.96s)]
*  We've got to make this work for folks. We invested in raising the cap and adding more [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=646.92s)]
*  infrastructure to support that. Then developers started building moderation bots and extending [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=650.4399999999999s)]
*  these Discord servers with other capabilities that we never even imagined that was made possible [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=657.48s)]
*  because we had an open API powering the platform. Along the way, many of these things happened. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=663.0s)]
*  These communities got big. Generative AI became a big thing on Discord. The crypto community was [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=669.32s)]
*  pretty big for a season on Discord. Throughout all of it, gaming and playing games with your friends [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=677.16s)]
*  and hanging out with your friends was always the main thing that people were doing, even if they [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=682.84s)]
*  would go spend time in a public community or futzing around with Generative AI or something like that. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=687.4s)]
*  I think one of the most underappreciated things about Discord is that the product has found a way [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=693.4s)]
*  to do two things at once that almost no other companies are able to do and businesses and [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=701.8s)]
*  teams are able to do at scale, which is have a singular focus on a particular type of user [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=708.68s)]
*  and their need. In this case, what you said was allowing friends to spend time together [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=715.88s)]
*  while playing games, while also making the platform and the product so extensible [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=720.84s)]
*  for other people to bring their own use cases to the platform. I remember seeing the homepage [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=727.96s)]
*  a couple of years ago. I was talking to Stan and he brought up a screenshot of the first version [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=735.5600000000001s)]
*  of the homepage you guys had put together. On the front page, on day one, you had a call out for [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=742.2s)]
*  integrations and SDKs. You had an open API on day one as part of the hero marketing. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=748.92s)]
*  So clearly you were thinking about making the platform extensible for all other kinds of use [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=754.68s)]
*  cases 10 years ago. Where did that come from? Can you talk a little bit about the challenges of [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=758.76s)]
*  both building a delightful product for users first while also maintaining this extensibility [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=765.3199999999999s)]
*  for other kinds of use cases that you may not have designed for explicitly? [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=769.4s)]
*  Yeah, the extensibility was built in from the beginning. It's cool that you saw that. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=772.76s)]
*  You went back and looked at that. I think if you go to the Wayback machine or the Wayback [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=778.76s)]
*  Archive, I forget what it's called, you can find it still from 2015. The idea was that we knew that [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=782.76s)]
*  people were going to want to build custom integrations with different games as part of [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=788.76s)]
*  thinking about what's a group chat for gaming look like. We were imagining an EVE online [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=796.76s)]
*  corporation, which is a group of people playing this outer space massively multiplayer game. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=800.76s)]
*  Or you were playing Final Fantasy Online, which is a fantasy adventure game. These different games [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=806.76s)]
*  have data and things that you might want to pull into your group chat experience. But we knew we [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=812.76s)]
*  were not going to build all of these things for the hundreds or thousands of games that people [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=820.76s)]
*  care about. That was one thing. We've got to make it so other folks can integrate their custom [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=826.76s)]
*  stuff from their games into Discord. Related to that was this insight that I had from just being [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=832.76s)]
*  an observer in the gaming business for so long, which is that in games there's this concept of [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=840.76s)]
*  modding where people can mod games. What that basically means is a developer will create a game [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=846.76s)]
*  and then often times ship with it the tools they use to make the game. I think id Software popularized [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=852.76s)]
*  this in the early days with Doom. It's kind of the first one I really remember getting big. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=858.76s)]
*  They called them WOD files, this whole scene online where you could go download WOD files. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=862.76s)]
*  Then they started packaging up and selling them. It added a ton of life to the game. Today now [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=866.76s)]
*  when we look at the top titles that people play, a lot of them actually began as community-driven [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=872.76s)]
*  mods like Counter-Strike, Team Fortress, League of Legends, GTA, role playing. Gosh, the list just [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=879.76s)]
*  goes on. Fortnite began as version four of a mod that I think came from a game called Arma 3 many [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=887.76s)]
*  years ago. This idea that give your community tools to create and customize and extend your game or [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=894.76s)]
*  your software and they're going to surprise you and take it in places that you never would have [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=903.76s)]
*  expected. It was just kind of like, to me seemed like that's how you make good software. When we [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=907.76s)]
*  built Discord, it sort of seemed obvious to us that we wanted to create an API that allowed [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=913.76s)]
*  developers to extend Discord to be more creative with it, to do things with it we never would have [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=917.76s)]
*  expected. Some of the things that we expected were connecting to the EVE Online back end so you could [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=922.76s)]
*  have your own forum or pulling in world boss spawns as notifications. But the stuff we never [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=929.76s)]
*  expected was like generative AI. Who could have guessed that? [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=935.76s)]
*  Right. Now we're seeing many years after you made those investments in the craft of designing a [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=939.76s)]
*  delightful API, fantastic tutorials, a great developer experience for people to mod Discord itself. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=946.76s)]
*  We're now seeing some really significant examples of companies being built entirely on Discord. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=952.76s)]
*  The Discord platform has 200 million monthly active users and that's led to entirely new companies [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=958.76s)]
*  being built on top with the open architecture you described. People may be familiar with Mid Journey. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=966.76s)]
*  And there's a few other ones too. Mid Journey is the most famous one. It's like a canonical example of [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=971.76s)]
*  how this stuff happens. We have this open platform where we're allowing developers to customize it [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=975.76s)]
*  and extend it. And I think the Mid Journey folks had been obviously working on their model for a while. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=980.76s)]
*  I think they tried bringing it to market in a few other ways and then they just tried a Discord server [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=986.76s)]
*  and a Discord bot. And then this was an example of exactly what I was talking about. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=990.76s)]
*  I never would have predicted that you would have A, generative AI in the first place. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=994.76s)]
*  Like what a crazy thing that we've created computers that can do these things. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=999.76s)]
*  And then two, that someone would figure out how to take advantage of the magic of a Discord server [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=1002.76s)]
*  and our platform and build such a cool experience. And there's a handful of these now. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=1008.76s)]
*  So yeah, it's been a pretty cool thing to see. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=1014.76s)]
*  You know, Mid Journey is one example of a generative model. It's a text to image model tool. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=1018.76s)]
*  We've also seen an explosion of text to music tools as an example of how extensible Discord is. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=1023.76s)]
*  What other kinds of use cases are you seeing emerge on the platform that you're excited about? [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=1031.76s)]
*  Yeah. The generative AI category is exciting for us. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=1036.76s)]
*  But you know, we really come back to this idea of people mostly on Discord [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=1041.76s)]
*  spend their time hanging out with their friends in these kind of smaller invite-only spaces [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=1047.76s)]
*  with like less than 15 people per se. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=1052.76s)]
*  So in that context, when I think about generative AI tools and using our platform, [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=1055.76s)]
*  I really think about what are developers creating that give groups of friends more fun things to do. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=1060.76s)]
*  And so one really cool thing we see with the generative AI stuff is people take the bots [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=1065.76s)]
*  and bring them into their kind of invite-only servers. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=1069.76s)]
*  And then they can use them to create and explore and work on projects with their friends [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=1073.76s)]
*  in a more kind of private setting as opposed to being in the sort of the public chaos, frankly, [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=1076.76s)]
*  of some of these large servers. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=1080.76s)]
*  But other really cool experiences we see are things like ways to listen to music together. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=1083.76s)]
*  SoundCloud has a really cool bot that you can use to play music when you're in voice chats, for example. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=1087.76s)]
*  And we're working with some other partners to try to bring more music to the platform. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=1092.76s)]
*  There's a bunch of games that people have made that are pretty cool and many more are coming. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=1098.76s)]
*  We just actually launched a couple weeks ago a new kind of set of capabilities for the platform [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=1102.76s)]
*  that will allow developers to go kind of beyond the text box [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=1109.76s)]
*  and build these rich kind of visual interactive experiences powered by HTML5. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=1114.76s)]
*  So you can build a web app and essentially deploy it into the context of Discord. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=1118.76s)]
*  And so we're seeing lots of really exciting stuff starting to get built. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=1122.76s)]
*  Let's spend a couple minutes on that. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=1127.76s)]
*  This is something you and I spent years working on together. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=1132.76s)]
*  Let's take people a little bit behind the curtain of what it took to actually go from the moment [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=1137.76s)]
*  where we realized that developers wanted to express their creativity [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=1142.76s)]
*  beyond just a command line like Interface, which is what bots were initially designed around [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=1147.76s)]
*  the [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=1152.76s)]
*  whole screen really with web apps. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=1157.76s)]
*  Yeah, well, years ago when the bots platform started to get popular, [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=1162.76s)]
*  there was actually a Hack Week project at our company. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=1167.76s)]
*  So we do this thing every year called Hack Week where we basically stop our normal work [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=1172.76s)]
*  and we actually had like tents in our office. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=1177.76s)]
*  It was like a whole cool kind of with food and stuff. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=1182.76s)]
*  And one of the groups that year had the idea of wouldn't it be cool if we added an HTML5 canvas [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=1187.76s)]
*  to our apps platform and then people could make games and do other interesting stuff. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=1192.76s)]
*  And so there was a team that built this and I was always like, that's a really cool idea. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=1197.76s)]
*  But as company building goes, you have a long list of ideas and you have to prioritize when you get to them. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=1202.76s)]
*  So a couple of years later, the time was right to look at the idea and that's when we met. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=1207.76s)]
*  You were actually working on your own startup at the time and we're kind of building this as a standalone project. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=1214.76s)]
*  And after some conversation, it was like, man, we should just do this together. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=1222.76s)]
*  And then we created a team and really formalized this idea of how do we take our platform [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=1227.76s)]
*  from kind of the text-based era into the visual rich interactive experience era. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=1233.76s)]
*  Rather than just opening it up, we actually built a few games ourselves to really test the platform, [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=1238.76s)]
*  make sure that it was designed well, that it worked for players, that the interaction loops were good. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=1245.76s)]
*  And that took a couple of years to sort that all out. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=1250.76s)]
*  Okay, we're ready to open it up. So it's in developer previews. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=1255.76s)]
*  It's been a journey. It's been a fun journey. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=1260.76s)]
*  So I remember one of the most exciting parts of working at Discord was the respect for infrastructure. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=1265.76s)]
*  The company had built its own WebRTC streaming service, had built its own voice and video [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=1270.76s)]
*  and its own real-time comms infra. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=1277.76s)]
*  We built a bunch of serverless networking. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=1282.76s)]
*  And I remember there are these moments in the product engineering cycle when you're building infrastructure [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=1287.76s)]
*  that you inevitably have to ask yourself, well, what is this going to be used for? [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=1292.76s)]
*  And I remember having debates with you about how to answer that question [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=1297.76s)]
*  and prioritize the most important features. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=1302.76s)]
*  Where the team that was working on tools and infra and SDKs for the developers would come in [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=1307.76s)]
*  and jam with you, where you would often roleplay the developer. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=1312.76s)]
*  And you'd come up with ideas for what could be possible in the platform. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=1317.76s)]
*  And then we'd leave the jam session, we'd go back to building the tools and the infra. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=1322.76s)]
*  So today, fast forward, I'm going to ask you to pretend we're in a jam session. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=1327.76s)]
*  So you're building the capabilities SDK, the embedded apps SDK, and now you're a developer. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=1332.76s)]
*  And I'm going to ask you now, what would you like to go build with this entirely new set of capabilities [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=1337.76s)]
*  that you've been handed by Discord? [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=1342.76s)]
*  So I guess the way I think about this is first, what am I going to build? [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=1347.76s)]
*  I try to think about what do I as a consumer want? [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=1352.76s)]
*  They have to take their hat off and then put on their consumer hat. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=1357.76s)]
*  For me, it's sort of like, start to think about what kind of games I might want to play [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=1362.76s)]
*  and how they could fit into my Discord servers in fun ways. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=1369.76s)]
*  For me, I really would love someone to build some multiplayer titles [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=1374.76s)]
*  that don't require a lot of time investment, [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=1379.76s)]
*  really cool moments of storytelling that you can interact with your friends asynchronously around [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=1384.76s)]
*  that sort of weaves into the Discord experience through text and with the visuals as well. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=1389.76s)]
*  I have a small side project I'm working on right now, which is a game kind of like this. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=1394.76s)]
*  It's like an arcade shooter that has kind of a leaderboard mechanic, [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=1399.76s)]
*  but with sort of like a modern kind of roguelike vibe on it. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=1404.76s)]
*  I'm taking both to sort of dogfood and test our platform. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=1409.76s)]
*  Part of this is how I get myself in the mind space of what do our developers want, [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=1414.76s)]
*  what might their customers want so that I can give good feedback to our team who is also doing this [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=1419.76s)]
*  so we can serve people effectively. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=1424.76s)]
*  One of the things that I think you've always been pretty good at doing is asking the question of [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=1429.76s)]
*  what is the best way to do this? [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=1434.76s)]
*  And you're often able to laser in and hone in on these specific capabilities [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=1439.76s)]
*  that are ultimately technical computing primitives, [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=1444.76s)]
*  but exposed to users in a way that allows them to do something with their friends they couldn't do before [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=1449.76s)]
*  in a way that's easier or faster or better or more convenient. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=1454.76s)]
*  So as you're working on crafting your side project right now, [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=1459.76s)]
*  what in your mind are the top two or three things that the Discord embedded platform [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=1464.76s)]
*  that you just launched really shines at that's hard to do elsewhere? [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=1469.76s)]
*  The magic I think is the fact that you have the social context of the space you're in. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=1474.76s)]
*  So it's really, really easy for someone to pick up a title, and then that game can depend on the fact [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=1479.76s)]
*  that there's a group of people that are connected to the person playing it [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=1484.76s)]
*  and you have access to that data in a privacy-safe way. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=1489.76s)]
*  Unlike, let's say, other games where maybe you log in or you get a user to come into your game [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=1494.76s)]
*  and then you have to get them to maybe build a friends list or to invite their friends to play. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=1499.76s)]
*  In the context of Discord, because of the way the games work, they're instant and they have the social context. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=1504.76s)]
*  So you can build a game loop where one person plays and then immediately the result of that play session [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=1509.76s)]
*  is other people get exposed to the game and they can play it [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=1514.76s)]
*  and they don't have to go do anything to be able to really set that up [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=1519.76s)]
*  because the friend brought it into the server. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=1524.76s)]
*  So I think about cool mechanics like leaderboards and challenges and these kind of things that really, really depend on having this group of people [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=1529.76s)]
*  that have access to this shared space both synchronously and then also on the go in bite-sized ways. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=1534.76s)]
*  So it's a different kind of interaction model. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=1542.76s)]
*  So I could open my phone, play a game, and then when I get back to my computer, I could pick it up [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=1547.76s)]
*  and then you could play from your phone when you're somewhere else if you want to come and compete with me [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=1553.76s)]
*  when you have a few minutes in your spare time. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=1558.76s)]
*  I'm not playing around with this title, [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=1563.76s)]
*  but part of what I'm so excited about with these tools is to see the creativity that other people bring. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=1568.76s)]
*  I know what would be interesting to me, but much like when we designed the platform for Discord in the beginning, [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=1573.76s)]
*  so many of the cool things that happened with it I would never have predicted. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=1579.76s)]
*  So I'm most excited to see what people do that I don't even think about. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=1584.76s)]
*  I think it's worth taking a beat there to just recap what you just said. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=1589.76s)]
*  Up until now for a developer to build in a cross-platform experience like that, it takes years. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=1594.76s)]
*  And the end result I think is what you're describing is that a product or an app, [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=1599.76s)]
*  whether it's a game like the one you're building or an on-game like Mid Journey, [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=1604.76s)]
*  can literally go from zero to I think Mid Journey is now at more than 20 million users in the server or about there. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=1609.76s)]
*  I think their public server is about that size. It's pretty large. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=1614.76s)]
*  In essentially less than a year. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=1619.76s)]
*  Yeah, you should write the marketing brief for that. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=1624.76s)]
*  I guess you actually did. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=1629.76s)]
*  You're spot on. I think that's what's so magical about it is the trends that entertainment and gaming in particular [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=1634.76s)]
*  have been on for the last decade are cross-platform. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=1640.76s)]
*  People are more and more expecting games to not be tethered to devices. It's just a screen. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=1645.76s)]
*  You should be able to switch screens and play the same experience. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=1650.76s)]
*  You want your content and your progress to go across those screens. You want your friends and your social graph to go across those screens. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=1655.76s)]
*  You want the things you bought to go across those screens. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=1660.76s)]
*  I think that's what gaming is all about. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=1665.76s)]
*  Gaming too, but what we're trying to do is really package that all together in a really easy to pick up way [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=1670.76s)]
*  where not only do the games have all those things, but we also bring the social graph to the game. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=1675.76s)]
*  We manage Auth4U because it's built into Discord. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=1680.76s)]
*  It gets deployed on every platform that we're on, which is most of them. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=1685.76s)]
*  I'm just excited to see what people can make. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=1690.76s)]
*  That's the story of our creative progress as humanity. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=1695.76s)]
*  People build these tools which enables the next group of people to focus on a higher level set of problems. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=1700.76s)]
*  We've abstracted out some of this infrastructure for folks so people can spend more time on their gameplay [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=1709.76s)]
*  and the creativity of that than futzing around with Auth and building social graphs and all this kind of stuff. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=1714.76s)]
*  One of the most amazing things about building an open architecture is that you get the combinatorial creativity, [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=1720.76s)]
*  the explosion of your primitives, your platform with other tools that may be coming online or maturing at that moment in time. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=1727.76s)]
*  Sitting here in 2024, if you just contrast it to the version of Jason in college who was building his own games [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=1735.76s)]
*  and you hand him all the open infra of Discord's developer platform and the recent explosion in these creative generative models [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=1741.76s)]
*  that can allow you to turn text into images and text into audio and allow code generation and so on. [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=1752.76s)]
*  When you look at how the production pipeline of building an entire experience like a game has changed with generative models [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=1760.76s)]
*  and you combine that with the Lego blocks of Discord, what are the kinds of new game formats [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=1766.76s)]
*  or new types of interactive entertainment that you think are possible today that just weren't possible maybe when you were in college? [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=1772.76s)]
*  There's so much that has changed. It's kind of amazing. You think about it and today, [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=1779.76s)]
*  between the generative AI tools, social and distribution infrastructure like app stores and something like Discord, [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=1786.76s)]
*  plus the modern game engines, we can't leave those out. [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=1792.76s)]
*  The kind of game engine you can get off the shelf today, whether it's Unity, Unreal, Godot, Phaser, all these things, [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=1798.76s)]
*  they're just incredible. If I was to go back when I was in college, which was almost 20 years ago now, [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=1805.76s)]
*  none of that stuff existed. I built games back then and it was like firing up C++ and reading the Droid and stuff. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=1812.76s)]
*  I think it's like building DirectX APIs and spending a week trying to get a window to open with a triangle on it. [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=1821.76s)]
*  I think what ends up happening is because people can be so much more productive and the markets are so much bigger, [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=1826.76s)]
*  I think we're going to start to see more and more games that are focused on more and more niche topics and niche mechanics. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=1835.76s)]
*  Because if you think about it, big games get big budgets, so they tend to be less risky. [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=1840.76s)]
*  Smaller games can be more risky because the budget dynamics are different. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=1850.76s)]
*  You could imagine a world where one developer could build an entire game like Stardew Valley, [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=1857.76s)]
*  which was one developer, but I think it took him five or six years. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=1864.76s)]
*  If you imagine what that means is you may get 10 Stardew Valleys and they may all have different themes and topics. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=1871.76s)]
*  We may all just get more entertainment that's customized to our particular proclivities [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=1878.76s)]
*  because so many more people are making games and so the cost is down and then the markets are bigger. [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=1886.76s)]
*  There's more people than ever who are looking for this stuff. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=1891.76s)]
*  This is also, I think, one of the most underappreciated parts of Discord, [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=1894.76s)]
*  which is it has unlocked, paradoxically, niche at scale. [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=1899.76s)]
*  Through the server context, there are now thousands and thousands of niche communities on Discord [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=1904.76s)]
*  who have then found people who love each of those niches globally. [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=1909.76s)]
*  What always struck me when we were looking at the activity in these servers and what kinds of apps and bots they were using [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=1915.76s)]
*  is the extensibility of the platform allows those niches to do things with the platform [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=1921.76s)]
*  and build a bot or an app that's custom designed for that niche community's use case. [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=1927.76s)]
*  I think there's one you told me about a while ago, which was the Harry Potter fan fiction server, [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=1932.76s)]
*  which had an app that that community had built for the friends who were huge Harry Potter fans [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=1938.76s)]
*  to role play being at Hogwarts, if you remember that one. [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=1944.76s)]
*  If I'm asking you to channel your inner will right, for example, [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=1950.76s)]
*  one of the most successful game genres of all time has been simulation. [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=1954.76s)]
*  The Sims, all the tycoon games that allow people to express this world building desire [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=1957.76s)]
*  where they're able to almost use games as a tool for creativity, [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=1966.76s)]
*  where the game is itself building and creating with other people. [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=1972.76s)]
*  Roblox, of course, has done a phenomenal job at doing that in a pre-genitive AI world. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=1976.76s)]
*  Minecraft. [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=1981.76s)]
*  So there's Minecraft, Roblox, there's the Sims. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=1982.76s)]
*  Given how massive those genres were in a pre-genitive world, [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=1985.76s)]
*  when you give the generative models to a developer plus the insane distribution of Discord, [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=1988.76s)]
*  200 million people on day one, do you think we're going to see a new kind of genre there [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=1993.76s)]
*  of something that blends simulation with real life? [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=1998.76s)]
*  These things are really hard to predict. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=2002.76s)]
*  As someone who makes more on the tools side of things, [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=2004.76s)]
*  what I think is definitely going to happen is that because it's going to be so much easier to create, [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=2009.76s)]
*  we're going to see more random stuff. [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=2016.76s)]
*  So the chances of something interesting happening, I think, are going up. [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=2018.76s)]
*  But the things that cause new kinds of game genres to emerge are oftentimes changes in distribution, [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=2021.76s)]
*  business model, or production capabilities. [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=2028.76s)]
*  And so I think in this moment we're seeing some of these things change. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=2031.76s)]
*  Discord is offering a different kind of distribution mechanism with different context. [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=2036.76s)]
*  Generative AI is definitely changing the landscape for how people produce games today. [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=2041.76s)]
*  And so I think that we're probably going to see something interesting happen. [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=2046.76s)]
*  This is the most fun part of working on dev platforms, right? [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=2052.76s)]
*  You get surprised. [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=2055.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=2056.76s)]
*  The Discord team finally launched in full general availability [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=2057.76s)]
*  after years of crafting and honing the developer experience, the embedded app SDK on March 18th. [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=2062.76s)]
*  And if I have my numbers right, just in the last three weeks since launch, [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=2067.76s)]
*  developers have built over 20,000 new activities on the platform [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=2072.76s)]
*  that's generating four billion minutes of user interaction per day. [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=2077.76s)]
*  The scale is sort of mind-boggling. [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=2082.76s)]
*  What's going on? [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=2084.76s)]
*  Is it resonating so strongly right now? [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=2085.76s)]
*  And what are the top emergent behaviors you were seeing in the first few weeks? [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=2088.76s)]
*  Yeah. Well, I think it's resonating because developers intuitively understand a lot of the stuff we've been talking about. [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=2091.76s)]
*  They're looking for distribution channels with captive audiences on the other side, [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=2098.76s)]
*  with low production costs, so they can explore their own creativity [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=2104.76s)]
*  and build products for themselves and their friends and bring those to market. [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=2108.76s)]
*  And the games industry, I think, is in an interesting situation right now in particular. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=2112.76s)]
*  So this new channel, we thought people were going to be excited about it. [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=2117.76s)]
*  And then at Game Developers Conference a couple of weeks ago when we announced it, [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=2122.76s)]
*  I was actually surprised at how much it resonated with developers. [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=2126.76s)]
*  We had a couple of talks there and the lines were out the door. [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=2130.76s)]
*  So as far as what people are building, a lot of the things that I know folks are working on [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=2133.76s)]
*  have not actually released yet since we opened that up. [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=2141.76s)]
*  So I don't want to say anything that hasn't come to market yet. [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=2146.76s)]
*  But I think that 20,000 number sounds big and it's exciting, [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=2150.76s)]
*  but I think in reality what it signals to me is a lot of excitement and curiosity. [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=2155.76s)]
*  And we'll sort of see how many of those come to market and what that will be. [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=2162.76s)]
*  I suspect that there are probably 20,000 people poking around. [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=2165.76s)]
*  I think there's thousands of them that are actually really making something. [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=2169.76s)]
*  And so I expect we'll probably see hundreds of those things come to market over the next six or eight months. [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=2172.76s)]
*  But without getting into specifics, some of them are interesting new ways to stream games [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=2177.76s)]
*  and some of them are new games and some of them are just interactive experiences, [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=2183.76s)]
*  like ways to enjoy different types of entertainment together. [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=2186.76s)]
*  And some of them are silly things like comic book related projects. [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=2189.76s)]
*  And then there's a lot of stuff in there that I actually haven't even seen because there's so much. [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=2194.76s)]
*  I was talking to a developer at GDC who is working on a Discord embedded activity [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=2198.76s)]
*  that is tinkering with some of these new generative models that you were describing. [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=2205.76s)]
*  And one of the things he crystallized for me, which I think kind of maps the experience we had in the early days [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=2209.76s)]
*  of Mid Journey launching on the platform, was this idea that game development and sort of AI app development [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=2216.76s)]
*  have this very strong similarity in the development process, which is you pre-train a model [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=2224.76s)]
*  and then you put it out with your community. [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=2232.76s)]
*  And then what the community does with the early days of the model and what outputs of the model they prefer [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=2235.76s)]
*  helps you then sort of run a reinforcement learning loop to then improve the model at giving users what they like. [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=2241.76s)]
*  And that's very similar to the game sort of process, right, where you put out a soft launch title, [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=2248.76s)]
*  usually with LiveOps in soft launch, and then you start seeing which parts of the multiplayer experience [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=2253.76s)]
*  your community likes. And then you basically pipe that into future LiveOps releases. [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=2259.76s)]
*  If you had to describe why the Discord platform has found so much success with generative AI developers, [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=2265.76s)]
*  is there fundamentally something similar about the game development production process and AI app development [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=2276.76s)]
*  that is so similar that that's resulted in Discord basically hosting the world's most successful consumer [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=2281.76s)]
*  AI business right now, which is Mid Journey? [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=2287.76s)]
*  Both of those things make sense, but I actually think if you zoom out a little bit, [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=2290.76s)]
*  there's another interesting trend that this is kind of part of, which I think is this idea of consumers [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=2293.76s)]
*  wanting to be closer to the people creating the things that they use in their lives. [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=2299.76s)]
*  And it's actually kind of a broader, I think, dynamic of co-creation with consumers as you're building products. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=2303.76s)]
*  So I think in the case of AI, there's quite literally like a direct feedback loop, [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=2309.76s)]
*  where I think a lot of these models are using thumbs up and thumbs down type reactions on the outputs [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=2314.76s)]
*  to directly feedback and improve the model. [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=2320.76s)]
*  I think in the case of games, it's a little more, it's like a little one step remove, [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=2324.76s)]
*  where perhaps the players are talking with the developers and they're using the products [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=2329.76s)]
*  and they're giving them feedback. And I know a lot of devs use Discord to do early play tests, [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=2333.76s)]
*  and they hop on voice chat and they show off builds and they spend time with their users. [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=2337.76s)]
*  But I also hear just like startups doing it and other companies doing it too, not just games. [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=2342.76s)]
*  I think gaming and AI is kind of at the forefront of this, but we see lots of other tools. [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=2347.76s)]
*  There's like a command line app that I use as an engineer called Warp that has a Discord server. [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=2354.76s)]
*  And they hang out with their community in there and talk about feature improvements [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=2362.76s)]
*  and how to make their product better. And it just goes on and on and on. [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=2365.76s)]
*  And so I think the trend is actually that consumers want to have say and influence [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=2368.76s)]
*  over the products they build. And it actually turns out as a product creator, [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=2375.76s)]
*  having that direct line of feedback with a tight feedback loop with your early adopters [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=2380.76s)]
*  really helps you shape what you're building and make it better. [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=2384.76s)]
*  So it ends up being, I think, this really powerful kind of back and forth, [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=2387.76s)]
*  where you can improve your product, people get excited about it, [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=2391.76s)]
*  you build evangelists, and then when you do go to market and sort of launch, [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=2394.76s)]
*  you have this sort of built-in community energy that can help spread the word around. [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=2398.76s)]
*  And sometimes those things will lead into like Kickstarters and Patreons and other stuff. [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=2402.76s)]
*  So there's this whole sort of like community driven product development thing [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=2406.76s)]
*  that I think Discord is part of or maybe helping drive in some way. [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=2411.76s)]
*  But it's another one of those interesting emergent things, you know, [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=2416.76s)]
*  coming back to the topic of like you build these platforms and these tools with something in mind [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=2420.76s)]
*  and then other interesting things can happen with it. [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=2426.76s)]
*  You know, we again, we really started focused on being a place for people to come together [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=2429.76s)]
*  and play games with their friends. And that is still the bulk of what people do today. [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=2433.76s)]
*  But all these other interesting things happen, right? [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=2437.76s)]
*  Companies setting up servers to do co-development with their consumers like, wow, that's super cool. [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=2440.76s)]
*  Yeah, there's this company that I have the chance to work with as an investor called Luma. [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=2446.76s)]
*  It's a generative AI model that allows people to create 3D assets. [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=2451.76s)]
*  And before they even had a website or a mobile app, they launched as a Discord app. [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=2454.76s)]
*  And I think what that resulted in was like I think in three or four days, [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=2458.76s)]
*  they had 30, 40,000 people in the community show up, half of whom were from the games industry [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=2463.76s)]
*  and half who weren't and started using the model in ways that they didn't expect. [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=2468.76s)]
*  And allowed them to realize that there was a much broader set of users for their tool. [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=2474.76s)]
*  And then that began a dialectic that allowed them to then change the focus or tweak the priority [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=2480.76s)]
*  of what the list of priorities in their product development roadmap, [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=2485.76s)]
*  then ship that to that Discord user base. [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=2488.76s)]
*  And when I saw that happening, I realized, you know, there's this art in software development [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=2491.76s)]
*  of finding product market fit early on, right? [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=2496.76s)]
*  We used to talk about this concept, if you remember, of the highest expectation user, the HXC. [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=2499.76s)]
*  And it is remarkably hard to find HXCs to take time out of their day to get attention of users today, early on. [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=2503.76s)]
*  But Discord is such a phenomenal tool at aggregating these people in one place who care about what you're building. [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=2512.76s)]
*  That then the speed at which you can iterate with them is unbelievable. [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=2517.76s)]
*  Yeah, you know, so our focus really right now, starting with this embedded apps launch a few weeks ago, [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=2520.76s)]
*  is to bring to market the full loop of how do you, as a developer, [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=2526.76s)]
*  like build a sustainable growing business on Discord, right? [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=2532.76s)]
*  And so right now we have all the parts and many of it, much of it is in developer preview [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=2535.76s)]
*  and it's going to be rolling out over the next few months. [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=2541.76s)]
*  And that will begin with, you know, how do you get your game listed in our app directory and in our app launcher, [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=2544.76s)]
*  which sees, you know, millions and millions and millions of people every day, you know, [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=2549.76s)]
*  coming there to find, you know, fun things to do with their friends and ways to customize their server. [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=2553.76s)]
*  And then once they have added your app, how do you make money? [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=2557.76s)]
*  And so, you know, we have in our own titles, we're running, you know, payments and we have payments available to some apps today. [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=2561.76s)]
*  So you'll be able to directly monetize. [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=2566.76s)]
*  If Discord's on a phone, that will run through the phone payment systems on desktop. [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=2569.76s)]
*  We have our own stuff that we've built that you'll be able to plug into. [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=2574.76s)]
*  So you'll get sort of the expected monetization hooks that you'd want out of the box. [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=2578.76s)]
*  And then re-engagement through there and then all the backend, you know, dashboards and reporting and stuff that you'd expect. [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=2581.76s)]
*  So you'll be able to build and launch and monetize and sort of do that whole loop as a developer on Discord. [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=2586.76s)]
*  You know, this is another one of those things where, you know, when we went and talked to a lot of the people who make apps and bots on Discord today, [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=2593.76s)]
*  many of them have been over the years using off-platform payment mechanisms to try to cobble this together, [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=2600.76s)]
*  whether it's just setting up their website and implementing something like Stripe or trying to get people to go to Patreon or whatever. [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=2607.76s)]
*  But all of these things are super high friction for customers where they got to go off platform, log in, do a whole bunch of nonsense, [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=2613.76s)]
*  and then you have to build all this stuff and manage it. [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=2619.76s)]
*  So what we've done is we've created an easy one-click solution inside of Discord that works just like you'd expect any app store to work, [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=2622.76s)]
*  where a consumer can just either purchase a one-time, you know, transaction in your app or make a subscription [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=2627.76s)]
*  so you can kind of decide how you want to monetize your service for whatever makes sense for you. [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=2635.76s)]
*  You know, I think looking back over the 10 years that Discord has been around for, [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=2640.76s)]
*  the story of Discord has been consistently observing what the biggest pain points are of people trying to communicate [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=2647.76s)]
*  and do things they love with their friends and making it just 10 times easier. [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=2655.76s)]
*  And this craft of giving people a way to do what they're already trying to do by sort of duct taping [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=2660.76s)]
*  or combining different tools all in one place while making sure Discord doesn't get bloated, [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=2667.76s)]
*  doesn't become slower, doesn't become more expensive, [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=2672.76s)]
*  has been this remarkable journey of kind of ruthlessly making what people are trying to do already easier and easier in one place. [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=2677.76s)]
*  Yeah, I mean that's the journey of I think most great products. [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=2687.76s)]
*  Like how do you make it so that whatever someone's trying to do is better, faster, and cheaper? [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=2693.76s)]
*  Right. [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=2698.76s)]
*  I mean that's the journey. [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=2699.76s)]
*  So, you know, we often talk about removing objections or reducing friction in the process [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=2701.76s)]
*  for a person who's trying to accomplish something and whether that's an end user who wants to open their app [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=2706.76s)]
*  and be able to quickly message their friends or whether that's a developer who's looking to build and deploy their app [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=2713.76s)]
*  or some creative project they're working on to people. [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=2720.76s)]
*  So we just love that we get the opportunity to wake up every day and help people spend time with their friends [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=2723.76s)]
*  and play games and enjoy life. [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=2731.76s)]
*  I mean that's what it's about. [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=2735.76s)]
*  I can't wait to see what people build. [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=2737.76s)]
*  Me too. [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=2739.76s)]
*  I'm excited with the new platform and maybe we'll check in a year from today [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=2740.76s)]
*  and instead of 20,000 apps it's going to be 200,000 apps. [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=2744.76s)]
*  We'll see. [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=2747.76s)]
*  We'll see. [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=2748.76s)]
*  But you've got some pretty amazing stuff already on the platform and I'm so excited for it. [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=2749.76s)]
*  Unfortunately as a developer to get started on my side project this weekend. [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=2753.76s)]
*  Cool. Well thanks for having me Ange. [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHvUp1rynek&t=2757.76s)]
