# The Future of Prosumer: The Rise of “AI Native” Workflows
**The a16z Podcast:** [June 11, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkOJy8rMlMw)
*  I think there's this big question that a lot of people have around AI, which is, aren't the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkOJy8rMlMw&t=0.0s)]
*  incumbents positioned to win this? They have all the data, they have all the engineers, like they [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkOJy8rMlMw&t=4.0s)]
*  have all the capital. And I think the answer in many cases is that the best and most interesting [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkOJy8rMlMw&t=9.6s)]
*  products are actually new interfaces that are just now enabled due to AI. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkOJy8rMlMw&t=14.8s)]
*  We have seen in the last, let's say, 18 months, two years, a lot of companies start to implement [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkOJy8rMlMw&t=24.240000000000002s)]
*  into their existing products. But it almost feels kind of like a copy paste, like let's just kind of [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkOJy8rMlMw&t=30.72s)]
*  wedge this in here. But you wrote a really great article kind of differentiating between what is AI [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkOJy8rMlMw&t=35.12s)]
*  augmented and what is AI native. Maybe you could just speak to that difference. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkOJy8rMlMw&t=40.88s)]
*  Absolutely. Yeah. And it's something that we think a lot about and are really excited about. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkOJy8rMlMw&t=44.56s)]
*  I think there's this big question that a lot of people have around AI, which is, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkOJy8rMlMw&t=49.120000000000005s)]
*  aren't the incumbents positioned to win this? They have all the data, they have all the engineers, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkOJy8rMlMw&t=53.120000000000005s)]
*  they have all the capital. And I think the answer in many cases is that the best and most interesting [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkOJy8rMlMw&t=58.96s)]
*  products are actually new interfaces that are just now enabled due to AI. So you would build [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkOJy8rMlMw&t=64.4s)]
*  the product differently starting now in 2024 than if you had to take a product invented in 2014 or [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkOJy8rMlMw&t=72.16s)]
*  2015, even honestly 2022 or 2023, and kind of add AI to it. And where a lot of the incumbents [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkOJy8rMlMw&t=78.56s)]
*  get stuck is they can't really cannibalize or put their existing product or platform too much at [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkOJy8rMlMw&t=86.32s)]
*  risk. And so they tack on AI features versus like reimagining what the experience would look like. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkOJy8rMlMw&t=92.47999999999999s)]
*  A great example of this from the prior era would be putting Sears on a website was not better than [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkOJy8rMlMw&t=98.39999999999999s)]
*  Amazon. Amazon was kind of a new business model and a new way of finding and purchasing things that [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkOJy8rMlMw&t=105.91999999999999s)]
*  was enabled by the internet. And I think we're going to see the same thing with AI, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkOJy8rMlMw&t=111.6s)]
*  kind of a new group of legendary companies that are native to this platform shift. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkOJy8rMlMw&t=116.39999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, my favorite example of just kind of like the skeuomorphic gone wrong is like the Zoom happy hour. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkOJy8rMlMw&t=121.11999999999999s)]
*  There's better ways we can connect digitally than just like being in a, you know, box and talking [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkOJy8rMlMw&t=127.84s)]
*  to each other. Okay, so what you talked about in this article are a couple different features where [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkOJy8rMlMw&t=133.12s)]
*  you're already kind of seeing this happen. So maybe we could just go down that list. What's [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkOJy8rMlMw&t=138.4s)]
*  an example of something that you think is AI native? Yeah, I think the biggest one that, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkOJy8rMlMw&t=143.20000000000002s)]
*  you know, most people have encountered so far is a product or a tool that kind of gets rid of the [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkOJy8rMlMw&t=147.52s)]
*  blank page. So this kind of anxious, gnawing feeling that you have when you're starting a project, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkOJy8rMlMw&t=153.04000000000002s)]
*  when you're starting a document or even a work of art of like, how do I get from nothing to [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkOJy8rMlMw&t=158.24s)]
*  something? And so that's the first thing that a lot of AI native companies do really well is they [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkOJy8rMlMw&t=162.96s)]
*  just make the time incredibly short to get from completely blank page to some sort of output that [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkOJy8rMlMw&t=168.16s)]
*  you can iterate on. There's a lot of examples of this in things as complicated as websites. Like [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkOJy8rMlMw&t=174.24s)]
*  there's a company called Durable that's been used to make millions of websites where you can kind of [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkOJy8rMlMw&t=180.4s)]
*  plug in what your company does, a little bit of information, and it gets you a great starting [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkOJy8rMlMw&t=184.96s)]
*  point that then you can use to kind of further iterate on. There's a similar company called [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkOJy8rMlMw&t=190.24s)]
*  Viscom, but it's more in the almost industrial design and engineering space. And you have [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkOJy8rMlMw&t=194.64s)]
*  engineers at real companies, shoe companies, car companies, that are essentially starting with a [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkOJy8rMlMw&t=200.16s)]
*  sketch, like a paper sketch, putting it into Viscom and getting the first attempt at a render. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkOJy8rMlMw&t=205.76s)]
*  And that gets them, you know, 80% of the way there, or at least kind of really lowers the [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkOJy8rMlMw&t=211.6s)]
*  barrier to starting a project. And they can then do kind of a lot of the deeper and more custom work [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkOJy8rMlMw&t=217.2s)]
*  after that. So that's number one. I would say number two that's really native to AI is [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkOJy8rMlMw&t=222.8s)]
*  multimodal. And that means combining different types of inputs and different forms of media [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkOJy8rMlMw&t=230.4s)]
*  to construct a product. One very fun example of this has been HeyGen, which is like a consumer [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkOJy8rMlMw&t=236.08s)]
*  and now enterprise video avatar company. And so they've combined a model that takes photos and [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkOJy8rMlMw&t=244.56s)]
*  videos of you and can map your face and can move your lips and your eyes and everything to make [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkOJy8rMlMw&t=250.72s)]
*  the lip syncing look real with an audio model that then can sound like you as well. And so putting [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkOJy8rMlMw&t=256.8s)]
*  those pieces, those separate pieces together into a net new product. Okay, amazing. So we've talked [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkOJy8rMlMw&t=263.92s)]
*  about two. So the first one was killing the blank page problem. And then we talked about multimodal [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkOJy8rMlMw&t=269.6s)]
*  and also multimedia is something you've mentioned as well. What's the next one? [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkOJy8rMlMw&t=274.72s)]
*  We've been seeing a lot of the best companies build iteration into the product, not just one [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkOJy8rMlMw&t=278.88s)]
*  shot generation. And so by that, I mean, there's lots of products, even we've seen meta release [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkOJy8rMlMw&t=285.12s)]
*  one recently that's like generate an image, which is great. It's exciting. In some ways, [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkOJy8rMlMw&t=290.64s)]
*  it's a little bit of a and I say this lovingly, like gimmicky products, you might use it as like [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkOJy8rMlMw&t=295.68s)]
*  a fun thing to send to a friend or to post on Twitter or something. But you're not likely to [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkOJy8rMlMw&t=300.88s)]
*  do deep work in it. What we're seeing AI native companies do is kind of build all of the [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkOJy8rMlMw&t=305.84s)]
*  iteration tools into the product. So maybe actually that v zero is not exactly what you want. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkOJy8rMlMw&t=313.11999999999995s)]
*  One example would be Pico labs is a video generator. So you can generate your clip, [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkOJy8rMlMw&t=320.71999999999997s)]
*  and then you can actually go in and select specific parts of the clip, specific characters, [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkOJy8rMlMw&t=326.0s)]
*  specific regions and regenerate that. And that's just so much more rich and helpful [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkOJy8rMlMw&t=330.8s)]
*  than having to regenerate a one shot every time. Like a slot machine. Yes. In the former exactly. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkOJy8rMlMw&t=338.0s)]
*  Yes. Versus like, oh, great, I finally landed on something that I'm 95% of the way there. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkOJy8rMlMw&t=345.04s)]
*  Let me fix the 5% instead of like, oh, this one's 95% of the way there. It's not 100. So I have to [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkOJy8rMlMw&t=351.44s)]
*  try again and maybe get something that's 30% of the way there. You're doing that calculus, [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkOJy8rMlMw&t=357.12s)]
*  right? When you get the 95 and you're like, should I just go with the 95? It's not exactly [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkOJy8rMlMw&t=360.96s)]
*  what I want. Or do I go back to the slot machine? Yes. Because there's so much randomness still. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkOJy8rMlMw&t=364.64s)]
*  Yeah. So that's been exciting. A related concept actually, which is kind of our fourth thing that [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkOJy8rMlMw&t=370.08s)]
*  we are excited about with AI native products is kind of refinement in platform. Maybe creating [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkOJy8rMlMw&t=376.08s)]
*  the initial asset gets you a lot of the way there in terms of a final product. But there's always [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkOJy8rMlMw&t=383.6s)]
*  post production on almost anything. There's a company called CREA that allows you to make AI [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkOJy8rMlMw&t=389.84000000000003s)]
*  art. And so once you've kind of sketched the art, generated the image, you can then within the same [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkOJy8rMlMw&t=395.12s)]
*  canvas, take it to an upscaler that then makes the image from what is still hopefully an exciting [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkOJy8rMlMw&t=401.12s)]
*  artwork into something a lot more polished and beautiful. Another example would be 11 Labs. Now [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkOJy8rMlMw&t=408.64s)]
*  you can generate voices on 11. You can put in a script and get the output. But they now have a [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkOJy8rMlMw&t=415.76s)]
*  full product to build out an audio book there. So you don't just have to take the 11 voice and go [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkOJy8rMlMw&t=421.52s)]
*  somewhere else to finish it. You can kind of further refine on the exact version of the product that [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkOJy8rMlMw&t=426.64s)]
*  is useful to you. So in a way, what you're saying is in the AI augmented applications, [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkOJy8rMlMw&t=431.52s)]
*  AI is being added in to the already core feature set versus in this example that you gave with 11 [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkOJy8rMlMw&t=438.32s)]
*  Labs, it's actually the features are being built around the model. They're being built around the AI [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkOJy8rMlMw&t=443.84000000000003s)]
*  application. Yeah. And often the best teams that we see are, there's so many models you can use now, [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkOJy8rMlMw&t=448.72s)]
*  and so many ways you can kind of tune and refine a model. And so the best teams that we see are [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkOJy8rMlMw&t=454.64s)]
*  incredibly thoughtful about like, okay, what are the features? Starting from scratch, if you thought [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkOJy8rMlMw&t=460.72s)]
*  about the most magical version of this product, what are the features of that? And then what can [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkOJy8rMlMw&t=466.64s)]
*  we pick and choose from these different models that allow us to construct that from scratch? [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkOJy8rMlMw&t=471.68s)]
*  Versus again, if you have to use a certain Google calendar, Google's probably not going to invent [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkOJy8rMlMw&t=476.8s)]
*  calendar because they have a massive calendaring product. So they're more likely to maybe find a [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkOJy8rMlMw&t=483.91999999999996s)]
*  model that helps them make Google calendar slightly better versus reimagine what a calendar interface [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkOJy8rMlMw&t=489.59999999999997s)]
*  could look like. Which could have voice or as you're saying, right? It probably looks extremely [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkOJy8rMlMw&t=495.52s)]
*  different than like what a Google calendar looks like right now. Absolutely. All right. So the final [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkOJy8rMlMw&t=499.84s)]
*  one you have is around remixing. What does that mean? We love this concept. It's very fun. I think [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkOJy8rMlMw&t=504.56s)]
*  it's actually core to a lot of AI products now and something that we're seeing get built into all [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkOJy8rMlMw&t=509.91999999999996s)]
*  types of interfaces, which is really exciting. I think it really gets to what is special about AI, [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkOJy8rMlMw&t=515.68s)]
*  which is that you can take anything and instantly make it something else. So you can put your own [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkOJy8rMlMw&t=520.88s)]
*  spin on it. Image generation is the best example. We've probably all taken a prompt from somewhere [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkOJy8rMlMw&t=526.48s)]
*  and put it into mid-journey and maybe tweaked it a little bit. We're seeing people make this a core [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkOJy8rMlMw&t=532.32s)]
*  feature of the product. Another example in photos actually, there's a company called Imagen that's [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkOJy8rMlMw&t=539.36s)]
*  used by a lot of wedding photographers. Photographers can almost build their own [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkOJy8rMlMw&t=545.76s)]
*  models for their editing style, like famous photographers, influential photographers, [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkOJy8rMlMw&t=551.36s)]
*  even just awesome kind of undiscovered talents. Then they can offer those as something that [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkOJy8rMlMw&t=556.3199999999999s)]
*  another photographer can take, use, iterate on, tweak a little bit to make it their own, [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkOJy8rMlMw&t=562.3199999999999s)]
*  but it provides a really exciting kind of jumping off point and something that was not possible [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkOJy8rMlMw&t=567.52s)]
*  prior to AI. Another example we love, a company called Gamma that's a slide deck generator. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkOJy8rMlMw&t=573.6s)]
*  That's the simplest way to say it, but the actual magic of Gamma is that every piece of content is [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkOJy8rMlMw&t=579.9200000000001s)]
*  kind of a block that you can instantly transpose and transform. So maybe you get through the deck [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkOJy8rMlMw&t=586.16s)]
*  and you realize this should be a memo instead, which has happened to me before. Or this should [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkOJy8rMlMw&t=591.76s)]
*  be a landing page instead. Then you can just tell the AI, okay, take this and make it a document [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkOJy8rMlMw&t=596.88s)]
*  instead. That kind of thing is, again, newly enabled because of AI. In the past, you'd have [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkOJy8rMlMw&t=602.16s)]
*  to copy and paste all that text and all those images and probably rewrite it to make it more [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkOJy8rMlMw&t=608.7199999999999s)]
*  appropriate for the different format. Again, that's the type of product that Google is probably [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkOJy8rMlMw&t=613.1999999999999s)]
*  not going to build, or at least is not going to build for a while, and is a real advantage for [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkOJy8rMlMw&t=618.64s)]
*  more native AI companies. We went through five different features or ways that people are kind [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkOJy8rMlMw&t=622.9599999999999s)]
*  of rethinking the way that AI can be really native in applications and not just augmented. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkOJy8rMlMw&t=629.92s)]
*  But we're also early. I love that you gave an example for every single one of these, [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkOJy8rMlMw&t=637.04s)]
*  but what do you think is coming? Because I feel like we're not at the end where there's a lot of [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkOJy8rMlMw&t=641.12s)]
*  exploration to be done. We're seeing a lot of almost one-off tools right now, which again, [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkOJy8rMlMw&t=646.0799999999999s)]
*  don't get me wrong, many of them are amazing. We've seen quote unquote single feature tools, [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkOJy8rMlMw&t=651.92s)]
*  like a background remover, image generator, scale to hundreds of millions of revenue, [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkOJy8rMlMw&t=657.92s)]
*  which is incredible. But now if you're making something with AI, say you're making a movie [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkOJy8rMlMw&t=662.88s)]
*  with AI, you probably have to generate an example image in one place, then take it to another [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkOJy8rMlMw&t=668.0799999999999s)]
*  platform to animate it, then take it to another platform to get a song for it, and then another [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkOJy8rMlMw&t=673.8399999999999s)]
*  platform to get maybe a voiceover or captions or something like that. So we're expecting to see [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkOJy8rMlMw&t=678.8s)]
*  more platforms. Maybe they don't build the model for each of those themselves, but they at least [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkOJy8rMlMw&t=684.0s)]
*  integrate with the best models for each of those and let you do it in one space, whether that's a [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkOJy8rMlMw&t=689.2s)]
*  creative workspace or an actual work workspace if you're making a deck or a document or a strategy [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkOJy8rMlMw&t=695.12s)]
*  memo or something like that. And again, those will probably be incorporate different modalities of [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkOJy8rMlMw&t=701.68s)]
*  input. Like sometimes when I'm writing a blog post, I want to start it in typing and then, [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkOJy8rMlMw&t=707.68s)]
*  you know, I come back to it five hours later, or maybe I'm in an Uber and I have a thought and I [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkOJy8rMlMw&t=716.0799999999999s)]
*  just want to be able to voice dictate that. I think we're going to see more platforms combining [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkOJy8rMlMw&t=720.64s)]
*  kind of different modalities of content, which is exciting. The last thing, and this maybe seems [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkOJy8rMlMw&t=725.8399999999999s)]
*  again, counterintuitive, but we still think there is a lot of use for human content, [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkOJy8rMlMw&t=731.6s)]
*  and it has a lot of value. And a lot of AI platforms now, it's only the AI. And so we [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkOJy8rMlMw&t=738.0799999999999s)]
*  expect to see platforms that allow you to kind of treat human and AI content as almost equal citizens. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkOJy8rMlMw&t=745.52s)]
*  So they allow you to edit. For example, if you shoot, if you're a social media influencer, [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkOJy8rMlMw&t=753.04s)]
*  you shoot a video of yourself. You should be able to edit that video and then add AI generated B [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkOJy8rMlMw&t=758.16s)]
*  role in the same place versus having these live as two different workflows. You do one in this [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkOJy8rMlMw&t=764.0s)]
*  place, you do one in the other, then you have to come together and combine them. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkOJy8rMlMw&t=770.08s)]
*  Nicole Zakem That's so interesting. And I think of something we talked about earlier, Circle, [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkOJy8rMlMw&t=773.2s)]
*  right? Where you have different communities or chats with your AIs and your friends in the same [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkOJy8rMlMw&t=777.9200000000001s)]
*  place. And so you're absolutely right that there's kind of this mixing and matching that maybe [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkOJy8rMlMw&t=783.76s)]
*  is a lot more interesting than one or the other. Nicole Zakem [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkOJy8rMlMw&t=788.3199999999999s)]
*  Totally. It's exactly the same concept. And again, to the point of like a feed of AI content alone [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkOJy8rMlMw&t=790.08s)]
*  is maybe not that interesting. And so we expect to see even more tools combine like the humanness of [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkOJy8rMlMw&t=795.68s)]
*  products with kind of the best of AI to kind of turbocharge the output, the result or whatever [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkOJy8rMlMw&t=801.84s)]
*  you could make with it. Nicole Zakem [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkOJy8rMlMw&t=807.68s)]
*  Yeah, well, I'm so excited. I feel like people sometimes have, you know, the hot take that apps [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkOJy8rMlMw&t=808.72s)]
*  haven't changed much in the last couple years. And so now we're seeing it, you know, those people [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkOJy8rMlMw&t=814.72s)]
*  got what they wish for. And I feel like, you know, my home screen is going to look completely [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkOJy8rMlMw&t=818.72s)]
*  different in six months. Nicole Zakem [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkOJy8rMlMw&t=822.64s)]
*  It has never been more exciting to be in consumer. It's been an incredible platform shift already, [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkOJy8rMlMw&t=823.84s)]
*  I think, back about where we were a year ago in terms of the types of products that were being [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkOJy8rMlMw&t=828.64s)]
*  developed and used to where we are now. And I just can't imagine where we're going to be five [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkOJy8rMlMw&t=834.0s)]
*  years from now given that rate of change. It's been awesome. Nicole Zakem [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkOJy8rMlMw&t=839.12s)]
