Video Description: This month, a16z’s Consumer team released the fourth edition of the GenAI 100 — a data-driven ranking of the top 50 AI-first web products and mobile apps, based on unique monthly visits and active users.

In just six months, the consumer AI landscape has shifted dramatically. Some products surged ahead, others plateaued, and a few unexpected players reshaped the leaderboard entirely.

In this episode, a16z General Partner Anish Acharya and Partner Olivia Moore join us to unpack the latest rankings and explore the key cultural and product moments that brought us to this point.

Which applications are leading the pack — and which ones are quietly on the rise? What do trends like AI video, companion apps, and “vibe coding” reveal about the future of consumer AI? And for the first time, the team also analyzed which products aren’t just gaining users, but generating real revenue.

If you’re looking to understand where we are in the GenAI adoption cycle — and what might come next — this episode offers a data-backed view into one of the fastest-moving corners of technology.

# The Top 100 GenAI Products, Ranked and Explained
**The a16z Podcast:** [March 26, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80)
*  Consumer activity typically lags by six to nine to 12 months, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=0.0s)]
*  what's happening on the research side. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=4.8s)]
*  I think compared to where we're going to be, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=6.5s)]
*  we're still incredibly early. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=8.16s)]
*  So many of these assumptions, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=10.0s)]
*  and that's why their assumptions, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=11.84s)]
*  they seem intuitively correct, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=13.14s)]
*  are going to turn out to be incorrect. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=14.58s)]
*  We are finally on the verge of AI video starting to work, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=16.68s)]
*  to really work. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=20.8s)]
*  It follows the trend of AI decreasing [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=21.68s)]
*  the cost of creation in every way. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=24.02s)]
*  Ninety-five percent of YC companies or something are now [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=26.1s)]
*  building using those tools. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=28.92s)]
*  The App Store is going to be chaos. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=30.680000000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=32.36s)]
*  We're back for the fourth edition of the Gen.AI 100 list. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=36.88s)]
*  You guys have been working hard and tracking the consumer [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=40.400000000000006s)]
*  landscape for years now, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=42.68s)]
*  but specifically for the last two and a half years [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=44.52s)]
*  since we really had that chat GPT moment. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=46.480000000000004s)]
*  Tell me more about how you're tracking that ecosystem [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=48.760000000000005s)]
*  and how that comes through in this list. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=51.160000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, it's super fun. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=52.96s)]
*  This is one of my favorite reports that we put together [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=54.2s)]
*  a couple of times a year. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=56.68000000000001s)]
*  We track the consumer AI landscape through what we do [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=58.16s)]
*  every day, which is like meeting with consumer AI startups [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=61.08s)]
*  that come to pitch us, seeing what goes viral on Twitter. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=63.64s)]
*  But actually there's a whole separate set of companies [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=67.16s)]
*  and products that might be reaching the true mainstream [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=69.67999999999999s)]
*  consumer that might not even be marketing themselves [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=72.5s)]
*  as AI products, but they're kind of powered by [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=75.28s)]
*  and made possible by AI. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=77.68s)]
*  And so the whole original purpose of this report [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=79.48s)]
*  was to see how much overlap is there between those two [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=81.88s)]
*  categories and what is the actual everyday person [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=84.64s)]
*  who might not know that they care about AI [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=88.16s)]
*  using in their day to day. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=91.24s)]
*  That's great. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=92.83999999999999s)]
*  And so talk about the methodology, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=93.67999999999999s)]
*  like what makes it onto this list or not. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=94.83999999999999s)]
*  Cause to your point, there's certain household names [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=96.53999999999999s)]
*  that you might see on Twitter or have that viral moment, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=99.08s)]
*  but I think some people might be surprised to see [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=102.36s)]
*  what made it onto this list. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=104.11999999999999s)]
*  So let's start with the methodology and what it requires. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=105.72s)]
*  Yeah, so it's entirely based on data. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=108.56s)]
*  We have two lists here, the top 50 on web [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=110.96s)]
*  and the top 50 on mobile. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=114.08s)]
*  So the top 50 on web, we use a data provider [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=116.03999999999999s)]
*  called similar web, which tracks every single website [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=118.36s)]
*  globally, and we essentially go down in descending order [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=121.4s)]
*  of how many visits they get each month. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=125.06s)]
*  For this report, it was January, 2025. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=126.84s)]
*  And then we go when we pick the first 50 of those [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=129.32s)]
*  that have the most monthly visits [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=132.07999999999998s)]
*  that are Gen.AI first products. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=134.34s)]
*  We do something similar on mobile, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=136.88s)]
*  but a different data set from sensor tower. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=138.56s)]
*  For mobile, we look at monthly active users on the app. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=141.14s)]
*  And then again, we pick the top 50 that are Gen.AI products. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=144.77999999999997s)]
*  And then for the first time ever, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=148.45999999999998s)]
*  we actually looked at the top 50 on mobile by revenue, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=149.73999999999998s)]
*  which we hadn't done before. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=153.29999999999998s)]
*  And it was a really interesting experiment [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=154.57999999999998s)]
*  because the lists were pretty non-overlapping. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=156.64s)]
*  We've been in this AI ecosystem for a few years now. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=159.1s)]
*  In your eyes, what were the pivotal moments [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=162.94s)]
*  that led up to this point in time where we have, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=165.54s)]
*  like you said, 50 on mobile, 50 on desktop, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=168.01999999999998s)]
*  and a whole lot more in the wider ecosystem? [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=170.34s)]
*  You often say actually, it's usually like the papers [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=172.98000000000002s)]
*  are written and then the models are developed [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=175.54000000000002s)]
*  and then applications are built on top of it. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=177.42000000000002s)]
*  So the consumer activity typically lags [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=179.4s)]
*  by six to nine to 12 months, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=183.1s)]
*  what's happening on the research side. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=185.22s)]
*  So maybe just from like a consumer awareness [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=187.20000000000002s)]
*  or behavioral perspective, there's a couple moments for me. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=190.06s)]
*  Actually mid-journey and character AI [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=193.02s)]
*  both came out before ChatGBT, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=195.18s)]
*  which I think a lot of people don't know, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=197.52s)]
*  but there was maybe these early niche communities [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=198.86s)]
*  of early adopters that were using both of those products [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=201.74s)]
*  in the summer and the fall of 2022 leading up to ChatGBT. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=204.38000000000002s)]
*  And then post ChatGBT, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=208.42000000000002s)]
*  things that just brought AI to consumer consciousness. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=210.48000000000002s)]
*  So even remember Snapchats, my AI, [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=213.9s)]
*  with that little bot that appeared [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=216.98000000000002s)]
*  at the very top of your feed. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=218.42000000000002s)]
*  And like 150 million people used it. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=219.9s)]
*  And for a lot of kind of younger consumers, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=222.16000000000003s)]
*  that was actually probably their first real chance [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=224.28000000000003s)]
*  of having a conversation with an LLM. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=228.02s)]
*  On the image side, I think of the Balenciaga Pope, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=230.34s)]
*  which was also, I think spring 2023. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=234.26000000000002s)]
*  Such a cultural moment. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=237.18s)]
*  It was, and I think it made a lot of people realize [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=238.22s)]
*  for the first time that they should even be interested [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=240.36s)]
*  in AI images because they could be that good [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=242.54000000000002s)]
*  and that convincing. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=245.58s)]
*  The first big AI music moment for me was, [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=246.98000000000002s)]
*  well, the BBL Drizzy song, [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=249.62s)]
*  which I think was spring of 2024. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=251.26000000000002s)]
*  And that also went like mega viral. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=255.26s)]
*  I think one of the moments where creative AI really shifted [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=259.42s)]
*  into almost enterprise consciousness was the end [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=262.74s)]
*  of last year when Coke did their Christmas ad. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=264.84s)]
*  And a lot of that was generated by AI. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=267.74s)]
*  And then of course the DeepSeq launch earlier this year. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=269.7s)]
*  DeepSeq was so interesting because I think it sort of [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=272.5s)]
*  had become settled wisdom that it would be very hard [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=275.3s)]
*  for a horizontal model to get [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=278.38s)]
*  to mass consumer scale quickly again. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=279.98s)]
*  Like ChatGPT had kind of done it [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=282.3s)]
*  and then ChatGPT had become a verb [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=284.7s)]
*  and that opportunity had already been explored. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=286.02s)]
*  And now we see DeepSeq growing as quickly as it did. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=290.02s)]
*  And there's actually a couple [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=292.52s)]
*  of interesting nuances to DeepSeq. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=293.42s)]
*  So one, I think important nuance is the fact [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=294.98s)]
*  that they released their reasoning model for free at scale. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=297.78000000000003s)]
*  So previously you had to use O1 Pro [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=301.86s)]
*  and you had to pay ChatGPT's premium subscription [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=303.98s)]
*  to get access to it. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=307.38s)]
*  The other thing was just the product execution [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=308.66s)]
*  around chain of thought, which we've talked about a lot. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=310.58s)]
*  And I think is pretty well understood. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=312.88s)]
*  But the fact that it showed you its thought process [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=314.4s)]
*  in real time was just super captivating. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=317.24s)]
*  And now something that's become a step that every model takes. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=319.8s)]
*  So I think it just really illustrates how early we are. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=323.14s)]
*  We as sophisticated users and investors are looking [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=327.04s)]
*  for further and further refinements. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=329.88s)]
*  And once in a while, something like DeepSeq comes out [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=331.84s)]
*  of the clear blue sky and just blows away all assumptions. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=334.28s)]
*  That word specifically, assumptions, I think is so key. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=337.24s)]
*  When you talk about these pivotal moments, [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=339.64s)]
*  I feel like you could actually match each pivotal moment [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=341.46s)]
*  with an assumption. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=344.29999999999995s)]
*  Like an assumption being, oh, well, [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=345.34s)]
*  like AI could never trick me into thinking a picture's real [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=347.9s)]
*  when it's not, right? [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=350.7s)]
*  Or I would never actually listen to a top 100 song [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=351.85999999999996s)]
*  that's generated by AI or ChatGPT is cornered the market. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=354.9s)]
*  No one else can penetrate it, right? [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=358.46s)]
*  All of these assumptions that people are like, okay, sure. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=360.14s)]
*  I was wrong about that prior one, [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=362.53999999999996s)]
*  but this one I'm pretty sure about. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=363.94s)]
*  We're seeing just like months being the delta [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=365.76s)]
*  between assumptions being broken. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=369.08000000000004s)]
*  And so to your point on like the arc of the market [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=371.84000000000003s)]
*  or the industry, I could see an argument where people are like, [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=374.92s)]
*  oh, we're actually pretty far along [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=377.76000000000005s)]
*  because we've already like slashed all of those assumptions. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=379.72s)]
*  But then on the other hand, I'm hearing, [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=382.36s)]
*  we still have a long way to go. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=384.28000000000003s)]
*  So kind of maybe put us along that arc [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=385.36s)]
*  if we were to compare to the mobile era or the cloud era [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=389.12s)]
*  or previous technology eras. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=392.36s)]
*  And are we in that early innovator stage still [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=393.76s)]
*  or are we somewhere else? [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=396.68s)]
*  I think we're still very much in the early adopter phase. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=398.8s)]
*  In many of these categories, we're kind of just, [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=402.16s)]
*  I mean, arguably still in like the infrastructure building era [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=405.52000000000004s)]
*  and kind of moving into the application building era. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=408.24s)]
*  It depends on the modality. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=411.36s)]
*  Like now LLMs are, maybe people thought [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=412.68s)]
*  that was a solved problem, but then again, [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=415.12s)]
*  DeepSea came in and upended all of that. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=416.52000000000004s)]
*  There's a lot of things that are definitely not fully solved. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=419.24s)]
*  Like AI video right now can generate great three or five [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=421.96000000000004s)]
*  or six second clips, but hopefully years from now [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=425.24s)]
*  we have AI video that can generate minutes long [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=428.68s)]
*  or even hours long movies. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=430.2s)]
*  And so I think compared to where we're going to be, [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=432.24s)]
*  we're still incredibly early. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=434.72s)]
*  You know, here are two assumptions [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=437.36s)]
*  that I think are interesting because it may turn out [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=438.40000000000003s)]
*  the reality is the exact opposite. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=440.6s)]
*  One is that AI will be very good [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=442.36s)]
*  at transactional interactions, [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=444.84000000000003s)]
*  but humans will still be the ones [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=447.04s)]
*  to build relationships and connection. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=448.44s)]
*  So an example of that would be, [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=450.48s)]
*  what kind of phone calls are AI gonna be best at? [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=452.32s)]
*  And I think the assumption was, well, [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=455.12s)]
*  they'll be great at sort of scheduling and logistics [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=456.4s)]
*  and the exchanging of information facts, [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=459.12s)]
*  but we've heard over and over that in many cases, [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=461.71999999999997s)]
*  the AIs are more human than humans. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=464.47999999999996s)]
*  They just have more patience, more nuance. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=467.15999999999997s)]
*  They're never having a bad day. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=469.79999999999995s)]
*  They're never hung over. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=471.0s)]
*  So that's an interesting area of exploration. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=472.79999999999995s)]
*  You know, the other one that I think is interesting [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=475.56s)]
*  is the idea that humans will delegate work to the AIs [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=477.88s)]
*  and the AIs will do it. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=481.0s)]
*  Like what if the AIs are the ones [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=482.15999999999997s)]
*  delegating the work to us? [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=483.96s)]
*  Perhaps AI is really good at organizing work [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=485.8s)]
*  and we're really good and also get a lot of joy [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=488.28s)]
*  out of doing it. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=490.56s)]
*  So I think so many of these assumptions, [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=491.84s)]
*  and that's why their assumptions, [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=493.84s)]
*  they seem intuitively correct, [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=495.24s)]
*  are gonna turn out to be incorrect. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=496.68s)]
*  Totally, and if we think about the report, [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=498.96s)]
*  maybe one important data point is the fact [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=500.71999999999997s)]
*  that we see so many newcomers still, right? [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=504.0s)]
*  If we were in that later part of the innovation curve, [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=506.24s)]
*  you might expect more stagnancy. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=508.92s)]
*  You might expect to see the same players, [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=511.03999999999996s)]
*  but every time you guys build out this report, [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=512.76s)]
*  we're seeing all of these newcomers. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=514.72s)]
*  In this particular time, the fourth report, [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=516.1600000000001s)]
*  we saw 17 new companies on the web rankings in particular. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=518.6s)]
*  And you actually have this quote where you say, [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=522.52s)]
*  a few unexpected players rewrote the leaderboard overnight. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=523.6800000000001s)]
*  So can you just speak to that [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=527.1600000000001s)]
*  and the movement that we're seeing? [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=528.36s)]
*  One of the biggest trends among the newcomers [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=530.12s)]
*  is we are finally on the verge of AI video [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=532.28s)]
*  starting to work, to really work. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=535.44s)]
*  So we had three new video models on the list this time, [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=537.64s)]
*  Hilo and Kling, which are both Chinese models. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=540.92s)]
*  And then Sora, which was OpenAI's model that was announced, [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=544.72s)]
*  I guess more than a year ago at this point, [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=548.36s)]
*  and finally was released. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=550.08s)]
*  I think we'll see even more of a shakeup here [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=552.0s)]
*  because VO2 is the new Google model [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=554.32s)]
*  that is even next level beyond that [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=556.8s)]
*  from what we've seen in testing. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=559.8s)]
*  And that is probably finally gonna hopefully come out [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=561.0s)]
*  in the next three or six months. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=563.52s)]
*  The other big category of newcomers [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=565.52s)]
*  were these vibe coding products, [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=567.8s)]
*  Cursor made the list, [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=570.6s)]
*  that's more of like an agentic ID for a technical audience. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=571.84s)]
*  And then Bolt made the list, [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=575.9200000000001s)]
*  which is for a non-technical audience [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=577.4s)]
*  where you basically go from a text prompt [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=579.24s)]
*  to a fully functioning web app. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=581.84s)]
*  Even though they made the list, [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=584.32s)]
*  I think we've still seen there's a really significant [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=585.76s)]
*  portion of their users that are people who are in tech [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=589.36s)]
*  and are actually technical, [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=592.16s)]
*  but they might be using something like a Bolt or a Lovable, [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=593.76s)]
*  which made our brink list, which we can talk about, [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=596.96s)]
*  to maybe prototype something easier [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=600.0s)]
*  and then export the code and go and play with it themselves. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=602.12s)]
*  So I think we haven't quite seen the vibe coding products [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=605.2s)]
*  hit the true mainstream user [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=608.16s)]
*  in terms of someone who's never worked in tech [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=610.88s)]
*  or developed an app. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=613.44s)]
*  I love this category. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=614.92s)]
*  It's so fun and it's so satisfying [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=615.92s)]
*  to actually see your ideas come to life. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=618.56s)]
*  I mean, in the case of Bolt and Lovable, [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=620.64s)]
*  sometimes they are just sort of compelling, [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=622.2s)]
*  interactive prototypes more than they are full-fledged [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=625.32s)]
*  products, but that's usually enough [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=628.2s)]
*  to get a feel for whether this is something [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=629.72s)]
*  you want to invest deeper in. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=631.36s)]
*  I mean, it sort of follows the trend of AI [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=633.24s)]
*  decreasing the cost of creation in every way [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=635.36s)]
*  and people just trying more ideas. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=637.88s)]
*  Just think about what that says about the untapped market [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=639.96s)]
*  of people who wanted to build things with code [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=643.6s)]
*  that this is on the top 50 list. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=645.48s)]
*  And I think honestly, both of them haven't had many apps [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=648.96s)]
*  built on them yet that have gone super viral. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=652.32s)]
*  And when that happens, and I'm sure it will, [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=655.4s)]
*  those will become stories of their own, [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=657.76s)]
*  which will then increase awareness of the products [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=659.44s)]
*  of the true mainstream audience. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=661.44s)]
*  I think we're gonna see a really interesting diversity [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=663.08s)]
*  or range of products built on these, [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=666.4000000000001s)]
*  which it might just be like, this is my app [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=668.0400000000001s)]
*  that I just used for my very specific niche pain point, [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=670.48s)]
*  or there might be people who never learned how to code [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=673.8000000000001s)]
*  who want to build a venture scale product [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=676.6800000000001s)]
*  on something like a Bolt or Lovable. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=679.5200000000001s)]
*  And so seeing how that plays out will be very cool. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=681.44s)]
*  Yeah, I think there's two phrases I've heard that I like. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=684.0400000000001s)]
*  One is sort of DIY or personal software. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=687.12s)]
*  It never made sense, economic sense, [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=690.44s)]
*  to design software for one, really. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=692.08s)]
*  The other is disposable software. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=694.64s)]
*  Just as Sunoo and UDO made it possible to make a song [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=696.48s)]
*  just to capture a joke that would be irrelevant the next day, [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=700.0s)]
*  these products make it possible to create a product [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=703.9200000000001s)]
*  or an experience that may have an extremely short shelf life, [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=706.48s)]
*  like 20 minutes or a week or any other time period. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=709.6s)]
*  Let's talk about the Brink List, [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=713.5200000000001s)]
*  because that's completely new to this year's fourth generation. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=714.68s)]
*  So what is the Brink List and why add it? [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=718.52s)]
*  Yeah, so the Brink List is essentially the five companies [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=721.28s)]
*  that almost made the list and were right below the cutoff, [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=724.2399999999999s)]
*  again, purely based on the data. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=726.9599999999999s)]
*  So we pulled the five websites and the five mobile apps. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=728.8399999999999s)]
*  And I think honestly, we were just curious [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=732.56s)]
*  to see what it would capture. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=734.56s)]
*  We didn't quite know. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=736.0799999999999s)]
*  The takeaway for me, it does reflect [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=737.4799999999999s)]
*  how fast things are changing, [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=739.76s)]
*  because there were a couple of companies on the list, [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=741.12s)]
*  like Runway, Otter, UMax, across web and mobile, [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=743.64s)]
*  that have been on the core top 50 ranks in the past, [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=747.12s)]
*  but maybe they got just edged out [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=751.32s)]
*  by DeepSeek launching this time. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=753.16s)]
*  And so they lost their spot for this ranking, [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=755.12s)]
*  but might be on there the next one, [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=757.5600000000001s)]
*  and they still have massive usage. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=758.9200000000001s)]
*  And then the other trend that it caught [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=760.8000000000001s)]
*  was a rise in more recent products, [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=762.36s)]
*  like CREA made the list and Lovable made the list, [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=764.8000000000001s)]
*  that are very much on the kind of consistent upswing. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=767.12s)]
*  And if it continues, we might see them on the main ranks, [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=769.44s)]
*  and they haven't made the main ranks before. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=772.48s)]
*  What did you predict that you would see on the list [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=774.44s)]
*  that you didn't really see there? [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=777.36s)]
*  Were there any surprises on that end? [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=778.52s)]
*  So one thing I thought we'd see more of is style transfer [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=780.36s)]
*  as an approach to scalable video, [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=784.24s)]
*  because style transfer is just a much more tractable problem [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=786.48s)]
*  and has a lot lower cost of inference [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=790.04s)]
*  versus raw text to video. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=793.04s)]
*  But researchers and product developers [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=795.32s)]
*  seem to be really going for it on text to video, [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=798.04s)]
*  and we've seen more of that than I would have expected. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=800.72s)]
*  I think the other things that we didn't see on this list [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=803.24s)]
*  that we have seen at the model level, [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=805.8000000000001s)]
*  so that means maybe they'll be on the next list, [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=807.5600000000001s)]
*  are like consumer voice products. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=809.52s)]
*  There are a few of them, but not a ton of them. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=812.0s)]
*  Some of the new, like the Gemini Flash model [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=815.4s)]
*  that can see what's going on on your screen [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=817.76s)]
*  and interact with you, like I built something to yell at me, [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=820.84s)]
*  like if I go on Netflix or something. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=823.32s)]
*  It's time to get back to work now. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=825.52s)]
*  You've got this and can accomplish all of your goals. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=827.28s)]
*  Or the new OpenAI operator model, [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=830.12s)]
*  which can actually interact with things [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=832.64s)]
*  on the browser level on your computer [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=835.36s)]
*  and get tasks done for you, like pay a bill [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=837.08s)]
*  or make a graphic design or hire someone [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=839.8000000000001s)]
*  to landscape your yard, something like that. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=843.12s)]
*  I think there's always a lag because the models [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=846.1600000000001s)]
*  have to be released to developers [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=848.36s)]
*  and they have to be tuned by the developers, [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=850.88s)]
*  and so it takes a while. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=852.84s)]
*  But I would expect to see maybe an explosion of fun [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=854.12s)]
*  and unique and interesting products built on models [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=858.8000000000001s)]
*  like that on hopefully the next list or two, [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=861.64s)]
*  because it feels like we really have seen an explosion [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=865.12s)]
*  on the model side and it is right there [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=867.36s)]
*  in terms of manifesting at the app's level too. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=870.24s)]
*  So one of the examples of this is deep research, [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=873.76s)]
*  which if you played with it is completely magical, [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=877.4s)]
*  but it's a primitive, right? [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=880.2s)]
*  It's not a product, it's something [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=881.28s)]
*  to build other things with. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=882.52s)]
*  So it's really unclear if deep research is gonna be used [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=884.4s)]
*  to write college theses or is it gonna be used [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=886.72s)]
*  to find the perfect meme to match a joke you wanna make, [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=890.64s)]
*  and that's all gonna be up to the app developers. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=893.4s)]
*  And just to double click on that, [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=895.76s)]
*  because you could see maybe a world where deep research [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=896.96s)]
*  is just this more broad horizontal application, [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=900.52s)]
*  or you could see what you just described [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=903.6s)]
*  where developers are tailoring that [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=905.08s)]
*  to specific end use cases. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=907.1600000000001s)]
*  Are you basically saying that you think the latter [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=909.72s)]
*  is more likely in terms of the progression [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=911.84s)]
*  of these models and apps? [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=913.84s)]
*  Not more likely, but I think it's underexplored. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=915.4s)]
*  If you come to deep research today, [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=917.48s)]
*  you kind of have the blank page problem, [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=918.92s)]
*  and I'd love to see developers create some constraints [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=921.1999999999999s)]
*  that leads to unexpected outcomes. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=925.24s)]
*  Like the known or the prescribed use [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=927.3199999999999s)]
*  of deep research right now [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=930.0799999999999s)]
*  is basically market research reports, [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=931.3199999999999s)]
*  and it's amazing for that. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=933.48s)]
*  I've used it for that a lot of times. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=934.4399999999999s)]
*  But if you try other things, [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=936.8s)]
*  like one day we were trying to trace the origin of a meme, [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=938.28s)]
*  and deep research is like a 100x better version of that, [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=942.0799999999999s)]
*  and you can kind of know your meme website [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=945.76s)]
*  that kind of like goes through the history. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=947.48s)]
*  Yes. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=949.2800000000001s)]
*  And like the etymology or however you describe it, [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=950.12s)]
*  of how a meme comes to be. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=952.4000000000001s)]
*  I mean, that should be an app. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=954.2s)]
*  Yeah, so there's lots of other use cases [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=955.2800000000001s)]
*  that aren't market research reports [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=957.0400000000001s)]
*  that could really benefit from [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=958.76s)]
*  an incredibly obsessive, compelling model [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=961.64s)]
*  that will go and kind of read every website on the internet [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=965.2800000000001s)]
*  until it finds the answer. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=967.88s)]
*  So those are the things that you thought might be on the list, [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=969.44s)]
*  but you didn't actually see there. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=973.0s)]
*  I mean, I think the fact that the vibe coding products, [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=974.6800000000001s)]
*  like the Bolt and the Cursors and Lovable's [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=977.2s)]
*  made the mainstream consumer list is just a testament [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=979.6400000000001s)]
*  to how widely they're used by the technical audience. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=982.44s)]
*  Like they have gotten to saturation so quickly. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=986.12s)]
*  I think Gary Tan had some tweet that like 95% [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=988.32s)]
*  of YC companies or something are now kind of building [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=991.6s)]
*  using those tools. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=994.2800000000001s)]
*  So it's something that nearly every developer now [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=995.12s)]
*  is probably using, which was maybe a surprise to me [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=997.84s)]
*  how quickly we reached saturation. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1000.72s)]
*  We've talked about this, but a continuing surprise, [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1003.0400000000001s)]
*  so I don't know if it counts as one, [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1005.64s)]
*  but I still am surprised every time, [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1006.88s)]
*  is how many companion products are on the list [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1009.52s)]
*  and also how many of them rank so high. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1011.72s)]
*  I think we had three companion products in the top 10. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1014.5600000000001s)]
*  Two of them were NSFW oriented. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1018.36s)]
*  Maybe not surprising when you think about like traffic [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1022.88s)]
*  on the internet in general outside of AI, [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1025.96s)]
*  but a lot of people are even using them [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1028.08s)]
*  as like interactive fan fiction. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1029.72s)]
*  And some of the biggest fan fiction sites in the world [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1032.08s)]
*  are also top 100, top 200 global sites. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1034.12s)]
*  So it makes sense in that way. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1037.6399999999999s)]
*  And then I guess my last surprise would be [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1039.92s)]
*  there's actually quite a bit of consistency [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1041.96s)]
*  in the list over the past four versions. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1044.92s)]
*  There's always new entrants, which is really exciting, [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1048.3999999999999s)]
*  but across the four lists, there's now 16 companies [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1051.48s)]
*  on the web ranks who have made it every single time [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1055.24s)]
*  and have kept the streak going, [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1058.04s)]
*  which is pretty remarkable when you think [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1059.8799999999999s)]
*  of how early we are in AI, but I think a testament [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1062.3600000000001s)]
*  to how those companies have cemented their brands, [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1064.92s)]
*  their products, their kind of, I guess, [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1068.4s)]
*  status in consumer consciousness. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1070.84s)]
*  And I think a testament to the fact that like real businesses [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1074.28s)]
*  have been built in consumer AI already. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1077.1200000000001s)]
*  No, to add to that, one of the surprises for me [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1080.6000000000001s)]
*  on companion was not seeing more multimodality. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1082.8s)]
*  Yes. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1085.48s)]
*  The kind of the first glimmers of that at scale were Grok. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1086.32s)]
*  Grok added a bunch of voices with some real aesthetics [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1089.76s)]
*  and points of view. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1093.28s)]
*  It's a good way to put it. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1094.12s)]
*  Personality. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1095.92s)]
*  Yeah, but it's just interesting that that feels, [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1096.76s)]
*  and of course, characters got voice mode and more, [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1099.4s)]
*  but it feels like character is, and companionship [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1102.28s)]
*  is such a horizontal category. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1105.12s)]
*  There's so much latent demand and it'll really increase [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1106.8799999999999s)]
*  once you have multimodality. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1109.36s)]
*  You know, the other interesting thing is that [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1111.52s)]
*  a lot of the text to code work, [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1113.72s)]
*  my assumption was that there was a small number of people [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1116.24s)]
*  who were creating sites that were heavily trafficked [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1118.84s)]
*  and that explained the rise of them. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1121.12s)]
*  But actually the majority of the traffic, [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1123.1999999999998s)]
*  correct me if I'm wrong here, Olivia, [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1124.6399999999999s)]
*  is from people doing creation, [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1126.04s)]
*  not just consuming other people's creations. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1128.1999999999998s)]
*  So there's just, it really shows how much demand there is [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1131.36s)]
*  to make things, even if people are not that interested [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1133.9199999999998s)]
*  in consuming them. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1137.4399999999998s)]
*  Yeah, you can track the traffic of like apps [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1138.26s)]
*  that people have launched on lovable.app [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1141.08s)]
*  versus visits to lovable.dev, [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1143.3999999999999s)]
*  which is where people go to make lovable products [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1145.9199999999998s)]
*  and like lovable.dev has more usage [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1149.2s)]
*  or more visits significantly than, you know, [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1151.16s)]
*  traffic to lovable.app, [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1153.68s)]
*  which gets back to what I was saying before, [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1155.04s)]
*  like we have not even seen the first wave [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1156.6s)]
*  of viral products built on top of lovable and bold. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1159.8s)]
*  And so when that happens, I think that the awareness [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1162.96s)]
*  of these types of platforms [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1166.68s)]
*  is gonna go significantly up to. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1168.2s)]
*  I mean, the app store is gonna be chaos. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1170.16s)]
*  Yeah, yes. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1172.6s)]
*  It is gonna be chaos. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1173.44s)]
*  We're gonna need an AI just to solve [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1175.04s)]
*  that AI app management problem. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1176.6s)]
*  Completely. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1178.48s)]
*  And I mean, to that end, you talked about the fact [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1179.32s)]
*  that there are some consistent players. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1181.48s)]
*  One of those players is ChatGBT, which we, you know, [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1183.6s)]
*  we've talked about as kind of like the starting gun [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1187.1999999999998s)]
*  of some of this application development. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1189.1599999999999s)]
*  ChatGBT has been at the very top of the list. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1192.1999999999998s)]
*  Has it been that way for every single iteration of this? [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1194.36s)]
*  On web and mobile. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1197.56s)]
*  But maybe what would surprise people is that the traffic [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1199.04s)]
*  to ChatGBT hasn't always been the same trajectory. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1202.08s)]
*  So maybe can you talk about that [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1205.12s)]
*  and what did we see this time around? [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1207.1999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, so it was basically flat for a while, [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1208.04s)]
*  which I think was surprising to a lot of people [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1210.0s)]
*  between February, 2023, basically for a whole year [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1212.84s)]
*  through February, 2024. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1216.36s)]
*  It was essentially flat in monthly visits to the website. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1218.52s)]
*  And I think like at that point, [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1221.1599999999999s)]
*  from the data that I've seen, [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1224.24s)]
*  basically 50% plus of the traffic was students [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1225.7199999999998s)]
*  who were using it for essays or homework problems. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1229.4799999999998s)]
*  But the vast majority of other people, me included, [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1232.12s)]
*  to be honest, had not maybe found a daily active use case [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1234.56s)]
*  for ChatGBT yet. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1237.8s)]
*  And it's completely resurged more recently. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1239.52s)]
*  So they two X'd the number of visits on web since then. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1242.6399999999999s)]
*  They actually made their own announcement too, [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1245.84s)]
*  where they counted across web and mobile. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1248.24s)]
*  And in the past six months, they grew from 200 million [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1250.6399999999999s)]
*  to 400 million weekly active users. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1254.96s)]
*  Which is especially surprising because it took them [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1258.0s)]
*  nine months to double before that. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1261.84s)]
*  And it usually gets way harder to double at scale, [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1263.6s)]
*  not easier. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1266.36s)]
*  I think from our perspective, [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1268.36s)]
*  and if you even plot it on the graph, [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1270.36s)]
*  you can kind of track the increases to the release [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1271.9599999999998s)]
*  of new models that unlock new use cases. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1274.48s)]
*  So like the new O1 reasoning models, the 4.0 models, [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1277.1599999999999s)]
*  which were kind of multimodal for the first time, [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1280.6s)]
*  and then advanced voice mode. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1282.84s)]
*  And then they've also launched new products, [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1284.6399999999999s)]
*  like the operator that can perform tasks on your computer, [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1286.6s)]
*  like Canvas, where you can write more naturally. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1290.04s)]
*  So it's both bringing in like new users who never tried it, [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1292.96s)]
*  and then taking people like me who, [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1296.0s)]
*  honestly I was maybe a weekly, if not less a weekly user. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1298.2s)]
*  Did you find your daily active use case? [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1300.92s)]
*  Yes, and now I'm a daily active, [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1301.96s)]
*  but across several use cases now. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1304.16s)]
*  Like some days I'm driving and talking to it voice mode. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1306.2s)]
*  Some days I'm working on a memo [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1308.92s)]
*  and I'm generating something with deep research. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1310.44s)]
*  Some days I'm doing some random other project [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1312.92s)]
*  and I'm brainstorming ideas with it. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1315.44s)]
*  So I would expect that to continue [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1318.24s)]
*  as they release new models. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1320.64s)]
*  And have you heard from the ecosystem [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1321.48s)]
*  in terms of what more frequent use cases have emerged, [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1323.76s)]
*  kind of like yours in terms of, [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1327.3600000000001s)]
*  if before it was a lot of students writing research reports, [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1328.96s)]
*  are there now, is there a sense of understanding [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1332.52s)]
*  of what those newer use cases are? [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1335.1200000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I think it's gotten better [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1336.96s)]
*  at some things related to coding. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1338.84s)]
*  It's gotten better at data analysis. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1340.28s)]
*  And then, I mean, the reasoning models, [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1342.28s)]
*  it's hard to overestimate because in the past, [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1344.92s)]
*  like you couldn't even rely on Chatubi [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1349.52s)]
*  to tell you how many hours were in strawberry accurately. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1352.0s)]
*  So it was hard to feel good about really tasking [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1354.88s)]
*  any sort of delicate or serious work to it. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1357.2s)]
*  And so I think there are probably a long tail of use cases [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1360.24s)]
*  that people have just migrated over now [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1363.84s)]
*  that they have more confidence in the models. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1365.4s)]
*  What's interesting to add to that is that [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1367.64s)]
*  Claude is not a traditional number two player. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1369.24s)]
*  Typically the number two player has 10% of the market share [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1372.4s)]
*  and just sort of 10% of the product quality. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1375.48s)]
*  And instead Claude sits in this very interesting place [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1378.8799999999999s)]
*  where it seems like it's more beloved [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1381.76s)]
*  by a smaller number of people. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1384.08s)]
*  It's better at creative writing. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1385.8s)]
*  It seems to have more of a personality, [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1388.3999999999999s)]
*  which is interesting because at least I think [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1390.9599999999998s)]
*  it's designed to be more constrained. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1392.36s)]
*  And then it's also strangely much, much better at coding. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1394.6399999999999s)]
*  Yes, yep. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1397.3999999999999s)]
*  Why, I don't know, but it's very interesting to see [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1398.36s)]
*  there's a place for both ChatGPT and Claude [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1400.8s)]
*  and Mr. Hall and potentially other models [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1403.56s)]
*  all to sort of augment each other. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1405.9599999999998s)]
*  To me the really interesting thing about this list [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1409.16s)]
*  when it came to general LLM assistant usage was like, [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1411.44s)]
*  we only had 10 days of data for DeepSeek for January [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1414.8799999999999s)]
*  because it launched at the end of the month. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1418.12s)]
*  And it shot up from literally nothing to number two [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1419.8s)]
*  on the list, 10% of ChatGPT scale on web within a week, [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1423.08s)]
*  a little bit more than a week. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1429.84s)]
*  On mobile, it had even less than that, five days. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1431.0s)]
*  And it was number 14 and if it had had five more days, [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1434.92s)]
*  it would have been number two. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1438.56s)]
*  And the gap is even narrower there [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1439.48s)]
*  between DeepSeek and ChatGPT. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1441.68s)]
*  So again, to Anisha's point, that was a surprise [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1443.72s)]
*  in that we could see kind of a broad-based LLM product [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1447.04s)]
*  go so viral still and capture so many users. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1450.6s)]
*  Yep, and DeepSeek was obviously the story when it came out. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1453.84s)]
*  What have we learned about retention since then? [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1457.8s)]
*  And is that learning specific to DeepSeek [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1460.0s)]
*  or are we seeing that learning applied across the ecosystem? [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1462.68s)]
*  On a retention basis, like how many users [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1465.6s)]
*  are coming back to the app, say exactly 30 days, [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1468.4399999999998s)]
*  exactly seven days, exactly 60 days, [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1472.04s)]
*  it's just slightly below ChatGPT. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1474.84s)]
*  So we're looking at 7% day 30 for DeepSeek [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1476.84s)]
*  and 9% day 30 for ChatGPT. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1480.6399999999999s)]
*  It's too early to call on web [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1484.4399999999998s)]
*  because it's kind of hard to track usage. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1485.9199999999998s)]
*  Part of my theory here is if you look at DeepSeek usage, [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1489.76s)]
*  a lot of it is the US, but a lot of it is China [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1493.2s)]
*  and other countries where ChatGPT is either, [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1496.88s)]
*  is basically you can't use it [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1501.48s)]
*  or they try to make you not use it [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1503.52s)]
*  and you can only get by it with a VPN. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1505.0s)]
*  And so in those markets, it's not ChatGPT [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1508.2s)]
*  versus DeepSeek versus perplexity, [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1511.32s)]
*  it's like DeepSeek versus nothing. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1513.96s)]
*  And so in those markets, I think they have [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1516.24s)]
*  a structural advantage from the retention side [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1518.56s)]
*  that might like skew the overall sample. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1520.88s)]
*  Totally. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1523.5600000000002s)]
*  Next time we should add a different cut for DeepSeek USA. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1524.4s)]
*  Yes, exactly. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1526.92s)]
*  Yeah, geographic breakdown. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1528.2800000000002s)]
*  Talking about trends that we're seeing on the list, [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1531.1200000000001s)]
*  you mentioned AI video before, [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1534.16s)]
*  but anything else you wanna call out there [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1535.48s)]
*  in terms of its presence on the report? [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1536.96s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, two of the video models [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1539.64s)]
*  were Chinese video models, which is super interesting. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1542.0400000000002s)]
*  The models are less copyright sensitive [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1545.2s)]
*  in their training data [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1548.3600000000001s)]
*  and so- It's a great euphemism. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1550.52s)]
*  Yeah, they're maybe more realistic and more prompted here [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1551.96s)]
*  and in the outputs as a result. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1554.9199999999998s)]
*  But also just in China, it's easier to hire people [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1556.48s)]
*  to kind of caption videos. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1559.1599999999999s)]
*  They have maybe a greater volume of researchers [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1560.56s)]
*  doing image and video stuff versus other stuff. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1563.36s)]
*  So that makes sense and I think we might expect [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1565.6399999999999s)]
*  to continue to see, I think Sora in some ways [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1568.2s)]
*  was a little bit disappointing for some people [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1571.36s)]
*  and whereas like the Chinese video models [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1574.32s)]
*  were maybe better than a lot of people expected [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1576.56s)]
*  given the relative lack of capital that they've raised. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1578.8s)]
*  That's right. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1582.6s)]
*  I think an interesting trend is just seeing CREA [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1583.44s)]
*  on the brink list. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1585.44s)]
*  Yes. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1586.32s)]
*  CREA is the single best place to access all the models [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1587.1599999999999s)]
*  and all the tools and the nice thing that they do [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1589.72s)]
*  is stitch all of these things together [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1591.56s)]
*  to make them greater than some of their parts. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1593.36s)]
*  So insofar as we live in this sort of multipolar world [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1595.84s)]
*  of models, image models, video models, language models, [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1599.04s)]
*  there'll be a role for aggregators like CREA [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1602.56s)]
*  to put them all together in a thoughtful way. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1604.52s)]
*  Totally, especially because people who are deep [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1606.2s)]
*  in AI video understand this, but each model is kind of known [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1609.24s)]
*  for being good at specific things like shots of people, [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1612.0s)]
*  shots of landscapes, anime, hyper realistic [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1614.64s)]
*  and so paying, it can rack up very quickly [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1618.52s)]
*  on $20 a month subscriptions if you're paying [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1622.64s)]
*  for 10 or 15 different models independently [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1625.0800000000002s)]
*  versus like having one canvas to work with all of them. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1627.92s)]
*  You also typically use the products together. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1630.2s)]
*  Yes. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1632.1200000000001s)]
*  You know, you usually generate an image in mid-journey [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1632.96s)]
*  or flux and then you take that image and upscale it [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1635.68s)]
*  and then you put it as the beginning frame in a video. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1638.8400000000001s)]
*  So you really wanna like not have the seams [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1641.2s)]
*  between all of those products. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1643.44s)]
*  Completely. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1644.76s)]
*  Are we seeing these video models in particular [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1645.8s)]
*  become more opinionated? [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1648.6000000000001s)]
*  And what I mean by that is like, you know, [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1649.8s)]
*  we see that in image models, right? [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1651.24s)]
*  Where mid-journey might be good at this [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1652.8600000000001s)]
*  and then you might see another model better [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1654.92s)]
*  at something else and people, the users will gravitate [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1657.3600000000001s)]
*  towards either models or applications that provide them [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1660.16s)]
*  with that specificity or opinions. [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1662.8s)]
*  Are we seeing that in video yet? [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1665.24s)]
*  I'd say they're both becoming more opinionated [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1666.4s)]
*  on the model level, but also the applications, [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1668.88s)]
*  the application choices that they're making [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1671.84s)]
*  that even the model companies are making [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1673.68s)]
*  are becoming more opinionated. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1675.52s)]
*  If you've used like a runway or a cling or something, [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1677.28s)]
*  you can now prompt basically the camera angles [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1680.56s)]
*  or the wideness of the shot or all of these things [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1684.52s)]
*  a human cinematographer would do. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1686.8s)]
*  You can prompt how the video kind of sweeps [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1688.88s)]
*  over the surface of a screen. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1691.46s)]
*  And so that's also kind of a big factor in what you use [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1693.68s)]
*  for maybe even different parts of one video, [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1697.3200000000002s)]
*  which is interesting. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1699.3600000000001s)]
*  I mean, the comment specifically, [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1700.6000000000001s)]
*  I still think ideogram is one of the most unique models [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1701.8s)]
*  for sort of what it does, what it's great at, [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1705.68s)]
*  which is text generation, sort of aesthetic that it has. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1708.0s)]
*  It just sits in a very unique place in the ecosystem. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1711.04s)]
*  Yeah, we did an internal competition [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1714.0800000000002s)]
*  where we had to generate a bunch of video, 30 second video. [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1716.98s)]
*  And ideogram was amazing for that [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1720.04s)]
*  because you could not get that layer of specificity [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1721.64s)]
*  anywhere else. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1725.2s)]
*  And then you could then take what was generated ideogram [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1726.0400000000002s)]
*  and put it into another model to animate it or to swerve [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1728.3600000000001s)]
*  or to do whatever you needed to do with it. [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1732.16s)]
*  Well, they also have a fun feature [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1733.0s)]
*  which essentially is image to text. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1734.68s)]
*  So if you have a meme or a copyrighted image [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1737.2800000000002s)]
*  that you wanna replicate or at least be inspired by, [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1739.96s)]
*  you can use their image to text [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1742.76s)]
*  and then use that text as the prompt to create an image. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1744.22s)]
*  I also found that fascinating [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1746.88s)]
*  because I would prompt something. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1748.7s)]
*  And as you learn when you're prompting with AI in general, [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1749.8799999999999s)]
*  you learn that you don't know what you're looking for. [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1752.24s)]
*  And so when I would prompt, [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1754.12s)]
*  ideogram would modify your prompt [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1755.56s)]
*  or generating the image. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1758.32s)]
*  And then you could actually go interrogate that [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1759.4399999999998s)]
*  and be like, oh, that's why I'm getting X, Y or Z. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1761.1999999999998s)]
*  Video actually in general, [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1763.72s)]
*  it tends to be more of a mobile first phenomena, right? [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1764.6399999999999s)]
*  We see tons of even before AI, [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1767.6s)]
*  tons of applications that focus on creators [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1769.56s)]
*  being able to edit and splice video. [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1771.84s)]
*  What are we seeing in terms of the difference [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1773.9599999999998s)]
*  between what's working on mobile [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1775.86s)]
*  and what's working on desktop? [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1777.36s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, it's somewhat obvious, [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1778.64s)]
*  but like a lot of the things that are working on mobile [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1781.0800000000002s)]
*  are either things you wanna use on the go [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1783.7800000000002s)]
*  or where the asset, the underlying asset you're working with [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1785.92s)]
*  is easily captured by the phone. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1789.0800000000002s)]
*  The avatar apps will up on mobile [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1790.6000000000001s)]
*  because you have 10 selfies of yourself [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1791.88s)]
*  sitting on your phone. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1794.1000000000001s)]
*  A lot of the voice first consumer products [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1795.4s)]
*  that we are seeing working actually are on mobile versus web [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1797.72s)]
*  because it's easier and more natural [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1801.8400000000001s)]
*  to talk into your phone for language learning [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1803.44s)]
*  or for companionship or other use cases [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1806.3200000000002s)]
*  than it is to maybe talk into your laptop. [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1808.32s)]
*  And same with homework helper apps. [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1811.6399999999999s)]
*  Those are really blowing up on mobile as compared to web. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1813.52s)]
*  So maybe another interesting breakdown [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1816.36s)]
*  that kind of represents where we are [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1817.76s)]
*  in the innovation curve is not just what is getting views, [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1819.6399999999999s)]
*  but what's actually making money [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1823.4199999999998s)]
*  and how those aren't always one-to-one mirrored. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1825.04s)]
*  What is making money today? [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1827.8999999999999s)]
*  What are we learning there? [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1829.84s)]
*  And is that the same as what's getting traffic? [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1830.84s)]
*  So for the first time we actually ranked the top 50 [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1834.1599999999999s)]
*  by what sensor tower can measure as mobile revenue, [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1836.96s)]
*  which is typically in-app purchases and subscriptions. [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1840.16s)]
*  So probably not ads. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1842.68s)]
*  And we ranked those separately [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1843.94s)]
*  from what has the most monthly active users. [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1845.3200000000002s)]
*  And there was only 40% overlap between the two lists. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1847.46s)]
*  So a lot of difference. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1851.16s)]
*  The surprise to me actually was the main categories [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1852.7s)]
*  are the same in terms of what's making money [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1855.68s)]
*  versus what people are using. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1858.48s)]
*  So photo and video generators, photo and video editors, [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1859.8400000000001s)]
*  beauty filters and beauty enhancer [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1864.8799999999999s)]
*  is massive standalone category. [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1866.6399999999999s)]
*  And then the realm of kind of like chat, GPT, copycat apps, [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1868.28s)]
*  both making a ton of money, getting a lot of users. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1871.6s)]
*  But the companies within those categories [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1874.52s)]
*  are very different in terms of who's making money [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1877.1599999999999s)]
*  and who has the most usage. [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1880.0s)]
*  We actually found, we plotted like revenue per user [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1882.52s)]
*  versus number of users. [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1886.56s)]
*  And we found the apps that had smaller user bases [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1888.28s)]
*  out of this sample set were much more likely [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1891.62s)]
*  to be making significantly more money on a per user basis. [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1894.16s)]
*  So apps like Speak, apps like Otter, [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1897.64s)]
*  captions and video editing. [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1901.0800000000002s)]
*  There's a lot of reasons for this. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1904.0600000000002s)]
*  One is that if you are making a lot of money per user, [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1906.1200000000001s)]
*  you're probably more of a serious prosumer app. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1911.3200000000002s)]
*  And so you've probably actually gated the usage [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1914.68s)]
*  pretty significantly. [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1916.8400000000001s)]
*  Like you have to subscribe to use the product. [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1917.88s)]
*  And so there are companies on here [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1920.76s)]
*  that might be making 50, $100 million in ARR [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1921.94s)]
*  off of only a million users, 2 million users. [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1925.5800000000002s)]
*  So they wouldn't make the ranks ironically enough [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1929.06s)]
*  for monthly active users, but they rank really, really high [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1931.66s)]
*  on a revenue basis, which is exciting. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1934.46s)]
*  And then as anyone who looks at the mobile list knows, [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1937.88s)]
*  there's a lot of maybe for the tech audience, [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1940.78s)]
*  seemingly random products on there of like, [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1943.74s)]
*  I've never heard of this, is this from a startup? [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1945.98s)]
*  And on mobile especially, [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1949.1000000000001s)]
*  there is a very precise game that you can play [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1951.06s)]
*  with like app store ads and other kind of paid, [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1953.5s)]
*  but fairly low cost acquisition channels. [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1957.46s)]
*  And if you're doing this as an indie developer [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1960.7s)]
*  or maybe an app studio running internationally, [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1962.98s)]
*  you're not looking for the 10 X payback of acquisition costs [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1966.42s)]
*  that we might be looking for as venture investors. [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1969.98s)]
*  So if you make back one or two extra money on a user, [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1972.5s)]
*  that's amazing. [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1975.26s)]
*  So you can get to 10 million users mostly by paying for them, [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1976.3799999999999s)]
*  but you're probably not gonna make as much revenue [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1979.66s)]
*  or ultimately as much profit maybe [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1982.5400000000002s)]
*  as some of the companies that are lower usage [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1984.7s)]
*  but higher revenue. [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1987.02s)]
*  And is there a learning there in terms of, [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1988.6200000000001s)]
*  you mentioned how, I mean, by nature, [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1991.02s)]
*  if you start getting certain features [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1993.18s)]
*  or an application entirely, [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1994.8200000000002s)]
*  you are potentially stifling growth of the overall user base. [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=1996.46s)]
*  Is there a learning in terms of how AI founders [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=2000.3400000000001s)]
*  should be thinking about that trade off today? [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=2003.38s)]
*  I mean, I think it depends. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=2005.7s)]
*  Some of these markets are naturally [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=2006.7s)]
*  maybe not mainstream behavior. [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=2009.14s)]
*  Like one example of a category [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=2010.9s)]
*  that did appear on the mobile revenue list [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=2012.74s)]
*  but was not on mobile usage [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=2014.8600000000001s)]
*  was several plant identification apps. [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=2016.74s)]
*  I love those. [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=2019.46s)]
*  Yeah, well, you take a picture, you saved on the plan, [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=2020.3s)]
*  it tells you exactly what it is [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=2022.5s)]
*  if you've seen that plant before. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=2023.9s)]
*  Is that an app that 100 million people will have [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=2025.78s)]
*  on their phones? [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=2028.54s)]
*  Maybe, maybe not. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=2029.38s)]
*  But if you're one of the, [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=2030.5800000000002s)]
*  like I can think of a few relatives who love plants [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=2031.8600000000001s)]
*  or love birds and like, totally, [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=2034.1000000000001s)]
*  they'll pay a hundred dollars a year for that [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=2035.62s)]
*  and they'll use it every day or every other day. [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=2037.26s)]
*  So I think it's more for founders kind of optimizing [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=2039.8999999999999s)]
*  for the type of product you have [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=2042.62s)]
*  and how mainstream it can be. [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=2044.78s)]
*  All right, so there's a lot of information here [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=2046.58s)]
*  that we've covered. [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=2048.2999999999997s)]
*  We've covered desktop, we've covered mobile, [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=2049.14s)]
*  we've covered revenue versus users. [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=2050.86s)]
*  And then we've also talked about the stickiness [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=2053.2599999999998s)]
*  of some of these players, right? [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=2055.2999999999997s)]
*  You said there was, was it 16 that have showed up [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=2056.34s)]
*  every single list. [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=2059.02s)]
*  So what can we learn from the last few lists? [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=2060.7s)]
*  I feel like the biggest thing now being a consumer investor [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=2064.02s)]
*  for close to a decade now, [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=2066.94s)]
*  it's almost like the more you know, [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=2068.42s)]
*  the less you know in some cases, [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=2070.2599999999998s)]
*  cause it all just comes back to the product [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=2071.66s)]
*  at the end of the day. [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=2073.2599999999998s)]
*  Like technologists or investors can have opinions [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=2074.1s)]
*  on the best monetization strategy or the best growth hacks. [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=2077.34s)]
*  But in the end, if the product isn't capturing users' [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=2081.5s)]
*  attention and isn't retaining them, [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=2084.66s)]
*  the business is just gonna be kind of a completely [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=2086.42s)]
*  like leaky bucket of users and users out. [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=2088.58s)]
*  So I would say the biggest, [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=2091.94s)]
*  often we meet with these amazing like PhD researchers, [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=2093.1s)]
*  best in class in the whole world in terms of their [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=2097.42s)]
*  technical understanding of a model or capability. [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=2099.7000000000003s)]
*  And they can struggle building in consumers sometimes [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=2102.78s)]
*  because often the more complicated thing is not actually [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=2105.42s)]
*  the thing that is highest utility, most delightful, [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=2108.46s)]
*  most helpful to a consumer user. [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=2110.82s)]
*  So we always, we never like to be prescriptive [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=2113.58s)]
*  on consumer products, but in general, [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=2116.58s)]
*  we see when teams focus on either the pain point [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=2118.98s)]
*  they're trying to solve or the unique experience [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=2121.66s)]
*  they're trying to create and build towards that. [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=2123.8199999999997s)]
*  And if that means you're actually the old model is better [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=2126.1s)]
*  than the new model, use that. [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=2128.8599999999997s)]
*  If that means it's just one AI feature instead of the whole [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=2130.7799999999997s)]
*  product being built on AI, cause it's not stable enough, [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=2133.8199999999997s)]
*  like do that. [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=2136.46s)]
*  I think in consumer, you really have to kind of let the data, [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=2137.8199999999997s)]
*  the data viewer guide there. [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0_7ffZte80&t=2141.58s)]
