# Flexport Co-CEO Ryan Petersen on ecomm's impact on the supply chain
**The a16z Podcast:** [January 22, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkGF59bf-Tk)
*  What have you seen as the impact really of e-commerce and the internet on the supply [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkGF59bf-Tk&t=0.0s)]
*  chain and on how it works? [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkGF59bf-Tk&t=9.1s)]
*  Yeah, well I think you want to start with the customers, with all of us, and the internet [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkGF59bf-Tk&t=10.6s)]
*  has really put us, you and me and everybody else out there in charge in a way that we've [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkGF59bf-Tk&t=15.08s)]
*  never seen before. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkGF59bf-Tk&t=20.14s)]
*  In the era of mass media, companies only would run a television ad for whatever product they [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkGF59bf-Tk&t=23.14s)]
*  were selling and then they would just kind of pump that down your throat and they only [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkGF59bf-Tk&t=30.3s)]
*  needed to have a limited number of SKUs, whatever was on television basically. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkGF59bf-Tk&t=35.22s)]
*  Customers didn't have a lot of choice. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkGF59bf-Tk&t=39.54s)]
*  They could buy this, you know, the Energizer or the Duracell and there were two choices [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkGF59bf-Tk&t=40.540000000000006s)]
*  for what battery and they happened to be in the stores and so the brands were in control. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkGF59bf-Tk&t=44.24s)]
*  Those who could afford mass media were in control. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkGF59bf-Tk&t=49.84s)]
*  Now with the internet, there's just like a million choices. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkGF59bf-Tk&t=52.64s)]
*  You have every kind of possible brand of battery that's out there. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkGF59bf-Tk&t=55.64s)]
*  A battery is probably a weird case, but still for every product category, there's a million [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkGF59bf-Tk&t=59.04s)]
*  choices. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkGF59bf-Tk&t=62.84s)]
*  Everybody's unique. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkGF59bf-Tk&t=63.84s)]
*  You can get the thing that matches your own personal taste. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkGF59bf-Tk&t=65.22s)]
*  You're in charge as well in that they better have that product now. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkGF59bf-Tk&t=68.24s)]
*  You're not willing to wait a week. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkGF59bf-Tk&t=74.12s)]
*  Like in the Sears catalog era, you could order and you'd get it in three weeks. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkGF59bf-Tk&t=75.72s)]
*  Well, you're going to go out of business if you can't deliver. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkGF59bf-Tk&t=80.56s)]
*  You know, it's becoming two hour delivery, like if you can't deliver two hours. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkGF59bf-Tk&t=83.12s)]
*  And so that is a very different supply chain. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkGF59bf-Tk&t=88.2s)]
*  And what's happened is companies that haven't been able to run a supply chain that's that [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkGF59bf-Tk&t=91.44s)]
*  responsive that can have many, a wider assortment of choices because we're all unique and we [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkGF59bf-Tk&t=94.36s)]
*  want our choices and have it sort of edge cashed to use an internet analogy like a CDN. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkGF59bf-Tk&t=100.4s)]
*  Like you want to have these goods like close to the customer so that it can get there really, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkGF59bf-Tk&t=107.44000000000001s)]
*  really fast. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkGF59bf-Tk&t=111.56s)]
*  In the old world, you could have one distribution center in the middle of the United States [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkGF59bf-Tk&t=112.56s)]
*  and distribute out to your store network from there. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkGF59bf-Tk&t=116.56s)]
*  But it didn't have to be like super responsive to customer demand. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkGF59bf-Tk&t=120.12s)]
*  Customer demand was pretty predictable, kind of always bought the same number of these [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkGF59bf-Tk&t=123.16000000000001s)]
*  batteries or whatever product. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkGF59bf-Tk&t=126.52000000000001s)]
*  And it was, it didn't have to be very agile. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkGF59bf-Tk&t=129.0s)]
*  The modern world all of a sudden, there's this proliferation of brands and it all has [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkGF59bf-Tk&t=131.32s)]
*  to be stored close to the edges. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkGF59bf-Tk&t=135.48000000000002s)]
*  Brands need to have multiple fulfillment centers. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkGF59bf-Tk&t=137.96s)]
*  You need about five fulfillment centers to get two day delivery nationwide. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkGF59bf-Tk&t=141.22s)]
*  And you need probably to do next day, it's more like 16 fulfillment centers and you want [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkGF59bf-Tk&t=145.26000000000002s)]
*  to do same day, well, you need one in almost every zip code, right? [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkGF59bf-Tk&t=150.5s)]
*  If you want to have two hour delivery. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkGF59bf-Tk&t=153.78s)]
*  So that's a really, really different configuration of supply chain. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkGF59bf-Tk&t=155.70000000000002s)]
*  And now you want to be able to get to that world where you're doing same day or next [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkGF59bf-Tk&t=159.58s)]
*  day delivery. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkGF59bf-Tk&t=164.38s)]
*  You now need to load balance your inventory. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkGF59bf-Tk&t=165.54s)]
*  Because if you put too much inventory out there and it doesn't sell, you're going to [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkGF59bf-Tk&t=167.22s)]
*  go bankrupt, right? [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkGF59bf-Tk&t=170.94s)]
*  You're sitting on all this working capital inventory that's not earning a return. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkGF59bf-Tk&t=172.01999999999998s)]
*  Too little and you lose the customer and they'll never come back, right? [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkGF59bf-Tk&t=176.18s)]
*  They buy your competitors brand. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkGF59bf-Tk&t=179.54s)]
*  And so that's the fundamental problem. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkGF59bf-Tk&t=181.38s)]
*  And these logistics teams don't even really, at the typical brand, don't even really know [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkGF59bf-Tk&t=182.7s)]
*  that that's the problem they're solving. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkGF59bf-Tk&t=186.66s)]
*  They're just still used to a world where all they care about is the price of freight. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkGF59bf-Tk&t=189.38s)]
*  And they want to buy the cheapest freight. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkGF59bf-Tk&t=194.54s)]
*  And that's what they think their job is. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkGF59bf-Tk&t=195.73999999999998s)]
*  When their job has become, how do I ensure a customer experience? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkGF59bf-Tk&t=197.17999999999998s)]
*  How do I enable our sales and marketing to have the product in stock so that they can [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkGF59bf-Tk&t=201.73999999999998s)]
*  win those customers, be a growth engine and a customer experience engine? [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkGF59bf-Tk&t=207.82s)]
*  And then how do they empower their CFO to not sit on too much inventory? [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkGF59bf-Tk&t=211.7s)]
*  And so it's a really different proposition. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkGF59bf-Tk&t=216.44s)]
*  And frankly, most of the companies that we grew up with, these iconic brands, have been [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkGF59bf-Tk&t=218.14s)]
*  going bankrupt left and right. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkGF59bf-Tk&t=223.9s)]
*  If you Google retail apocalypse, just look like the number of companies that have failed [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkGF59bf-Tk&t=225.34s)]
*  that are iconic brands that we grew up with, it's really sad, actually. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkGF59bf-Tk&t=231.86s)]
*  And I don't think it has to be that way. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkGF59bf-Tk&t=235.94s)]
*  So one of our, we kind of have dual purpose here. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkGF59bf-Tk&t=237.62s)]
*  One is help the new age of brands rise up and not need to hire this big logistics supply [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkGF59bf-Tk&t=240.82s)]
*  chain team who just pushes paper and just all they care about is the price of freight, [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkGF59bf-Tk&t=245.3s)]
*  that actually is empowered to solve these problems without hiring a big team because [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkGF59bf-Tk&t=251.2s)]
*  you don't need it anymore. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkGF59bf-Tk&t=254.48s)]
*  You kind of outsource that to the cloud. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkGF59bf-Tk&t=255.48s)]
*  That's one aspect of what we do, help these small businesses grow really fast without [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkGF59bf-Tk&t=258.47999999999996s)]
*  the bureaucracy. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkGF59bf-Tk&t=261.2s)]
*  The other is how do you help these enterprise brands, these famous companies transform themselves [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkGF59bf-Tk&t=262.42s)]
*  for a world of e-commerce and not die? [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkGF59bf-Tk&t=266.38s)]
*  I think that both of these are really important missions for us. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkGF59bf-Tk&t=269.44s)]
*  And in some sense, the second one, I think, can almost be harder. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkGF59bf-Tk&t=271.71999999999997s)]
*  And I've heard you say kind of in the past that like one of your goals is to make the [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkGF59bf-Tk&t=275.2s)]
*  supply chain as resilient and reliable as the power grid. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkGF59bf-Tk&t=279.32s)]
*  And it's like one thing to do that in normal times. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkGF59bf-Tk&t=282.52s)]
*  It's another thing to do it as you kind of have like a pandemic occurring. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkGF59bf-Tk&t=287.08s)]
*  You now have like a war in Ukraine that are creating these kind of delays and disruptions [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkGF59bf-Tk&t=290.8s)]
*  and shortages that we read about. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkGF59bf-Tk&t=294.68s)]
*  What will it take to get the supply chain kind of to that point? [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkGF59bf-Tk&t=298.6s)]
*  And in particular, because you're talking about an architectural shift really in the [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkGF59bf-Tk&t=302.12s)]
*  supply chain, what will it take to help those legacy players get there? [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkGF59bf-Tk&t=305.56s)]
*  The fundamental problem in supply chain is that it is that word chain, that there's many [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkGF59bf-Tk&t=311.92s)]
*  companies, in fact, on a typical transaction where we're moving, let's say, a pallet of [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkGF59bf-Tk&t=317.28000000000003s)]
*  goods, cubic meter of goods from a factory in Pica City in Hangzhou, China, to St. Louis, [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkGF59bf-Tk&t=321.36s)]
*  Missouri. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkGF59bf-Tk&t=332.36s)]
*  On a transaction like that, you'll have at least 12 companies that either touch the goods [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkGF59bf-Tk&t=333.44s)]
*  physically or are involved providing capital like a trade finance or a letter of credit, [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkGF59bf-Tk&t=338.67999999999995s)]
*  cargo insurance, bank payments, at least 12 and as many as 20 companies involved in that [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkGF59bf-Tk&t=345.67999999999995s)]
*  transaction. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkGF59bf-Tk&t=353.23999999999995s)]
*  And so you get information bottlenecks. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkGF59bf-Tk&t=354.59999999999997s)]
*  The goods bottlenecks are famous and we see the ships waiting offshore and all the problems. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkGF59bf-Tk&t=358.32s)]
*  But what's happening in parallel is that the data is not flowing, that people at each [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkGF59bf-Tk&t=363.0s)]
*  stage are having to rekey data into a system or not bothering, forwarding PDFs. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkGF59bf-Tk&t=367.2s)]
*  We call it freight forwarding. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkGF59bf-Tk&t=373.6s)]
*  I often joke it should be called freight email forwarding because you're just emailing attachments [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkGF59bf-Tk&t=374.68s)]
*  between all these different companies and trying to wrangle it. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkGF59bf-Tk&t=378.72s)]
*  And so it leads to suboptimal decision making. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkGF59bf-Tk&t=381.68s)]
*  If you had perfect information, you would be able to make sure that that truck is waiting [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkGF59bf-Tk&t=385.32s)]
*  at the airport when the plane lands or at the seaport when the container shows up and [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkGF59bf-Tk&t=391.64000000000004s)]
*  you would get it all dialed in and every truck would be scheduled appropriately and you would [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkGF59bf-Tk&t=396.6s)]
*  be replanning every five minutes so that if there's any delay, you're automatically generating [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkGF59bf-Tk&t=401.04s)]
*  a new plan and reallocating containers. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkGF59bf-Tk&t=406.74s)]
*  Almost none of that can happen because there's not a system. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkGF59bf-Tk&t=409.32s)]
*  It's 12 different companies each running their own IT system or many cases, guys with clipboards [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkGF59bf-Tk&t=412.44s)]
*  in warehouses, like no IT system at all on paper. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkGF59bf-Tk&t=419.16s)]
*  And so there's two possible solutions to this. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkGF59bf-Tk&t=422.68s)]
*  One is a giant mega corporation owns all the assets door to door and creates one IT backbone [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkGF59bf-Tk&t=424.92s)]
*  for everybody. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkGF59bf-Tk&t=431.48s)]
*  The other is use machine learning and data science and make it in the interest of these [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkGF59bf-Tk&t=433.40000000000003s)]
*  asset owners to participate, to come onto the platform. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkGF59bf-Tk&t=437.92s)]
*  Almost like data is the new kind of killer asset. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkGF59bf-Tk&t=441.88s)]
*  It should be. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkGF59bf-Tk&t=445.12s)]
*  You should be able to really generate insights. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkGF59bf-Tk&t=446.52s)]
*  The more transactions that are flowing, the smarter you get. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkGF59bf-Tk&t=448.76s)]
*  How are we going to route this container? [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkGF59bf-Tk&t=451.6s)]
*  Know in advance, oh, you know what? [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkGF59bf-Tk&t=453.84000000000003s)]
*  There's actually a bottleneck in LA right now. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkGF59bf-Tk&t=455.2s)]
*  Let's route it through Oakland. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkGF59bf-Tk&t=457.6s)]
*  Things like this that the industry hasn't been that good at. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkGF59bf-Tk&t=459.68s)]
*  It was really interesting to watch last year. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkGF59bf-Tk&t=461.84000000000003s)]
*  We had 100 container ships waiting off the port of LA and only five waiting off the coast [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkGF59bf-Tk&t=464.16s)]
*  of Oakland here in the Bay. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkGF59bf-Tk&t=468.8s)]
