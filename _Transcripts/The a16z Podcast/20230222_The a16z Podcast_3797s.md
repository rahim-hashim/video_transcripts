# The Challenge of Replicating Reality with Steve Zhao from SandboxVR
**The a16z Podcast:** [February 22, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU)
*  You know, running a startup is hard. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=0.0s)]
*  Running a retail startup during the pandemic is really, really hard. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2.12s)]
*  And running a retail startup during the pandemic [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=5.76s)]
*  while going through Chapter 11 is really, really, really, really hard. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=7.7s)]
*  What would you do if you believed in an idea but no one would fund you? [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=11.1s)]
*  Everyone thought it would fail, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=15.120000000000001s)]
*  and the industry you're in also happened to be going through a nuclear winter. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=16.36s)]
*  Well, today we are talking to Steve Zhao, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=20.56s)]
*  the founder of Sandbox VR, who encountered all of the above. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=23.26s)]
*  In fact, about a year into founding Sandbox, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=26.7s)]
*  he had to double down and invest all of his life savings [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=29.76s)]
*  into this unproven business. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=32.56s)]
*  But seven years after founding and one bankruptcy later, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=34.58s)]
*  Steve now has built the world's leading full-body VR experience [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=37.620000000000005s)]
*  with over 30 locations all around the world. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=41.06s)]
*  In this interview, we get to chat with Steve about the early challenges he faced. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=43.58s)]
*  And trust me, there were many, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=46.92s)]
*  but also how Sandbox survived the pandemic, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=48.72s)]
*  the difficult task of building across hardware, software, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=51.36s)]
*  a new computing platform, and real estate, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=54.32000000000001s)]
*  and also how Steve thinks about the future of VR. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=56.92s)]
*  But before we jump in, I thought I'd give you a glimpse [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=59.92s)]
*  of the full-body experience that is Sandbox VR. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=62.04s)]
*  And instead of trying to explain it to you, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=64.92s)]
*  I thought I'd show you instead. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=67.02s)]

*  Where are we going? [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=97.69999999999999s)]
*  Sandbox VR. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=99.74s)]
*  Have you ever done a VR experience? [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=101.53999999999999s)]
*  No, I haven't. I did one of those games, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=104.34s)]
*  and I think it was a quest you put on or something, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=106.53999999999999s)]
*  but I have no idea. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=108.8s)]
*  I don't know really what this is at all. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=110.1s)]
*  So on a Saturday afternoon, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=112.56s)]
*  I decided if I'm going to do this interview, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=114.62s)]
*  I better go try out Sandbox for myself. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=116.46000000000001s)]
*  We get to this mall, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=119.26s)]
*  and candidly, Sandbox looked a little out of place. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=120.78s)]
*  It was wedged between all of these outdated apparel shops. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=124.38s)]
*  Meanwhile, Sandbox is this new-looking location, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=129.38s)]
*  a futuristic logo shining out front. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=132.56s)]
*  And so we walk in, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=135.46s)]
*  and Sandbox actually has these machines [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=137.66s)]
*  where you check yourself in, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=140.46s)]
*  and as part of that, you input your email, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=142.76000000000002s)]
*  which comes into play later when they send you your recap video. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=144.98000000000002s)]
*  Pretty immediately after, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=149.06s)]
*  we have an assistant come over [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=150.96s)]
*  and bring us to the room that we're doing the experience in. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=153.58s)]
*  So he brings us to this bench [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=157.46s)]
*  and gets us to put on these sensors, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=160.06s)]
*  so one on each wrist and one on each ankle. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=162.96s)]
*  And then you walk into this room. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=166.88000000000002s)]
*  It's completely green, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=168.9s)]
*  kind of like a three-dimensional green screen around you. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=171.07999999999998s)]
*  And then on one wall, there is almost like this closet, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=175.4s)]
*  and this closet has a bunch of different props. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=179.29999999999998s)]
*  You see these fake guns. You see these vests. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=181.7s)]
*  It was actually pretty crazy to see how much gear there was [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=184.98s)]
*  for one single experience. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=188.88s)]
*  Oh, and by the way, each experience was in its own little room, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=190.57999999999998s)]
*  but it was kind of cool because [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=193.94s)]
*  as people were doing the experiences at different times, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=195.84s)]
*  as we were setting up, you could see into another room [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=198.78s)]
*  where someone was doing another experience, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=201.64000000000001s)]
*  and you just see these people running around with all their gear on, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=203.34s)]
*  and they seemed really immersed. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=206.54s)]
*  So the interesting part for me was the onboarding, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=208.38s)]
*  which I thought would be done by the human. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=210.68s)]
*  And although the human did tell you, [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=213.44s)]
*  put on this vest, put on these goggles in this way, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=215.14s)]
*  once you were in the experience, the game itself onboarded you. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=217.8s)]
*  So it got you to touch things with your hands [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=221.18s)]
*  or try things out with your props [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=224.28s)]
*  live within the VR experience [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=227.14s)]
*  to kind of train you on how to use it. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=230.1s)]
*  So that included things like if your partner got stunned by an enemy [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=232.2s)]
*  in order to revive them, [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=237.55999999999997s)]
*  you physically would have to walk over to them, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=239.04s)]
*  put your hand on their shoulder, and revive them. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=241.83999999999997s)]
*  And it also had this box on the ground. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=245.06s)]
*  Of course, it's not a real box, [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=248.29999999999998s)]
*  but when you're in the VR experience, [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=249.89999999999998s)]
*  that box is what you have to stay within [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=251.5s)]
*  because if you exit that box, [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=253.64s)]
*  you run the risk of literally running into a wall [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=256.0s)]
*  because remember, you're in a confined space. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=258.26s)]
*  So from there, we did our experience. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=260.76s)]
*  We chose one called Amber Sky where we were in space [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=262.62s)]
*  and we were kind of on these platforms fighting off the enemies. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=266.96s)]
*  The enemies, by the way, included anything from a spaceship [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=270.56s)]
*  to these little eggs on the ground that would hatch, [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=273.82s)]
*  these creatures that would come and crawl up on you [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=276.12s)]
*  to a standard alien that would come, [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=278.62s)]
*  jump on the platform and try to attack you. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=281.6s)]
*  These creatures felt like they were right there in front of you. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=283.72s)]
*  And speaking of that, one fascinating aspect of this experience [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=287.54s)]
*  was they're bringing you up these elevators [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=291.92s)]
*  and it really does feel like you're moving up, [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=294.32000000000005s)]
*  which of course you're not. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=296.02000000000004s)]
*  But at one point, we literally are brought up the elevators [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=297.48s)]
*  in a way where they separate like this [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=301.34000000000003s)]
*  and it felt like we went from being around a meter away from each other [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=303.88000000000005s)]
*  to maybe 100 meters away from each other. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=308.32000000000005s)]
*  And at the end, it felt kind of strange returning to the real world. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=310.78s)]
*  And maybe the coolest part of the experience [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=315.53999999999996s)]
*  is a couple minutes after you leave, [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=318.17999999999995s)]
*  you get shown a video of you in the experience, [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=321.58s)]
*  both as the VR characters that you were in the game, [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=325.88s)]
*  but also the real-life characters of you running around this green room. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=330.0s)]
*  And it's pretty funny to see. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=334.88s)]
*  You also get a score so you can see how you did relative to your partner [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=336.23999999999995s)]
*  or other people you played with, [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=340.29999999999995s)]
*  and then you get that video sent so that you can share it later. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=342.03999999999996s)]
*  So hopefully that gives you a quick view into what the experience is like. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=345.17999999999995s)]
*  And for me, I was really surprised by how immersed I felt in it. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=349.58s)]
*  I think it's the closest I've felt to being in another world. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=353.4s)]
*  But something that I'd like to see is the extension of new types of games. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=357.94s)]
*  And also, I want a leaderboard. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=362.53999999999996s)]
*  I want to see how I compare to other people. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=365.2s)]
*  I want to go back and I want to improve my game. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=367.48s)]
*  And so I'm very excited to hear from Steve [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=370.44s)]
*  how he's thinking about all those things. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=372.78000000000003s)]
*  All right, let's jump into the interview. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=374.8s)]
*  So Steve, we typically jump right into the founder, [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=376.70000000000005s)]
*  the company that they're building today, [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=381.20000000000005s)]
*  and where that company might be going. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=382.8s)]
*  But in doing research for this episode, you have such an amazing story. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=384.48s)]
*  And I want us to jump right to the beginning [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=388.70000000000005s)]
*  so people get really the lay of the land of where you came from [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=390.88s)]
*  and how you got into the gaming industry. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=394.08000000000004s)]
*  So let's start when you were a kid. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=396.24s)]
*  Your parents were entrepreneurs themselves. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=398.59999999999997s)]
*  And I believe that's also around the time [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=400.59999999999997s)]
*  when your, you could say, love story for games began. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=402.46s)]
*  Could you share a little bit more about how your parents, [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=405.53999999999996s)]
*  also being entrepreneurs, may have influenced you [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=408.46s)]
*  and also where gaming came into play? [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=410.53999999999996s)]
*  You know, I grew up in a Bay Area. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=412.94s)]
*  And my parents were immigrants. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=414.53999999999996s)]
*  And they worked really hard. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=416.26s)]
*  And I remember during the summer, I would follow them to where they work. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=418.09999999999997s)]
*  And it was just a grind every day. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=422.76s)]
*  But over time, I seen how being an entrepreneur, [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=424.76s)]
*  like great things happen, [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=427.71999999999997s)]
*  how they started at my uncle's garage, [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=429.36s)]
*  then they bought their own small warehouse, [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=432.36s)]
*  and then it just grew from there. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=434.65999999999997s)]
*  So my biggest takeaway from being an entrepreneur is it just takes time. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=436.28s)]
*  But it was during those times too when they're busy working [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=439.78s)]
*  that I had to find kind of solace in my own pastime. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=443.18s)]
*  And one of the things I found early in life was just, [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=446.32s)]
*  I was fortunate enough to have a computer pretty early in life. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=449.42s)]
*  And I think I was about the age of 10 years old [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=451.88s)]
*  when they just started creating these funny little games [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=455.08s)]
*  that I would just share with my friends and just kind of go from there. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=457.4s)]
*  Well, that's super early. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=460.04s)]
*  I don't remember what I was doing when I was 10, [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=461.04s)]
*  but I certainly wasn't creating my own games. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=463.34s)]
*  And it sounds like very early on as well, [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=465.78s)]
*  you not just played games for fun, [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=467.5s)]
*  but you started building a business around it. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=469.5s)]
*  So later on when you were in university, you started Blue Tea Games. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=471.74s)]
*  And I want to hear more about what this company was [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=476.38s)]
*  and what specifically inspired you to do that. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=479.98s)]
*  Yeah, so Blue Tea Games was a game development studio [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=482.18s)]
*  that created games online. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=485.74s)]
*  People can download it. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=487.1s)]
*  We call it shareware games back in the days. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=488.38s)]
*  And they would open up the wall, [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=490.38s)]
*  input the credit card into the internet, [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=492.48s)]
*  and they would buy the full game if they liked the first hour of it. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=494.20000000000005s)]
*  So I actually started because of the stock crash of 2001. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=498.58000000000004s)]
*  That was when I went to college. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=502.6s)]
*  My parents, they saved up a nest egg for my tuition, [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=504.84000000000003s)]
*  and everything crashed. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=508.04s)]
*  And they're like, yeah, you're going to have to find work [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=509.46000000000004s)]
*  while you study university. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=512.46s)]
*  So at that time, I saw that internet really took off [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=514.3000000000001s)]
*  and people were actually building games online. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=517.46s)]
*  And I thought that was really fun. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=519.34s)]
*  Like, I didn't know much about it. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=521.36s)]
*  I just love building games. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=522.74s)]
*  And I was thinking, hey, maybe I can put games online [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=524.36s)]
*  and see if people would play it. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=527.7s)]
*  And they did. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=529.64s)]
*  I was like, hey, would people actually want to buy it too? [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=530.74s)]
*  And they also did. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=534.34s)]
*  And it ended up that during that three years in college [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=535.62s)]
*  when I created Blue Team, [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=538.8000000000001s)]
*  that I was able to really fund my tuition, [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=540.0s)]
*  which is building games on the side. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=542.62s)]
*  So this is just after the dot-com crash [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=544.9200000000001s)]
*  when people are really doubting the internet in general, [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=547.3000000000001s)]
*  let alone paying for games. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=550.32s)]
*  I mean, I feel like as I was growing up, [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=551.52s)]
*  it was so rare for people to, for example, [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=553.66s)]
*  buy an app in the app store, even if it was 99 cents. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=555.9s)]
*  So for you to be able to successfully monetize [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=558.66s)]
*  during that period was definitely impressive. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=560.8000000000001s)]
*  And from my research, it sounds like actually [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=563.98s)]
*  some of the games were really successful. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=566.0600000000001s)]
*  One of them, the Dark Parable series, [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=567.7800000000001s)]
*  was downloaded millions of times. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=569.5600000000001s)]
*  And so it sounds like this company was doing relatively well, [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=571.48s)]
*  but ultimately you ended up shutting it down in 2016. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=574.26s)]
*  So what led to that? [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=577.5600000000001s)]
*  I think it was my own stubbornness. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=579.08s)]
*  So we did very well with PC games [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=581.48s)]
*  and we grew to a team of 40 people. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=583.58s)]
*  So the company was completely bootstrapped after college. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=586.98s)]
*  But what happened was in 2009, [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=590.7800000000001s)]
*  that's when the iPhones came [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=593.68s)]
*  and then there was a mobile games industry. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=595.7199999999999s)]
*  And for me, I wasn't fast enough to adapt to mobile games. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=598.38s)]
*  And what we built were casual games. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=602.38s)]
*  And when mobile first came about, [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=605.02s)]
*  it took a lot of the shares away from the PC group. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=607.28s)]
*  So we saw our industry starting to shrink [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=611.78s)]
*  while the mobile industry started to grow. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=614.36s)]
*  So by the time I went to mobile, it was too late. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=617.0799999999999s)]
*  We were just catching up. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=620.56s)]
*  And every year that we went in, it felt like we were further behind. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=621.88s)]
*  So the company just really stagnated into 2016. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=625.4399999999999s)]
*  That's when we saw VR kind of blew up. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=629.74s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, it sounds like you went straight from Blue T Games [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=633.0s)]
*  right into Sandbox, which to me is impressive in a way [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=636.7s)]
*  because after running a company for many years, [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=639.34s)]
*  the reaction of most founders is, let me take a break. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=642.4399999999999s)]
*  And your reaction was actually, no, I see this opportunity. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=645.2s)]
*  I want to go all in on Sandbox. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=648.54s)]
*  And so tell me a little bit more about that. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=651.04s)]
*  What was the vision you had in 2016 that made you say, [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=653.06s)]
*  hey, I need to do this right now? [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=656.6999999999999s)]
*  I think it was the fear of missing out. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=659.0999999999999s)]
*  You know, the painful lesson of missing out during the mobile era [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=661.16s)]
*  was really ingrained. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=665.26s)]
*  It's like, man, I wish I was there earlier. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=666.64s)]
*  So when VR first came about, I was like, [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=668.74s)]
*  okay, this is going to be a consumer headset. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=670.4599999999999s)]
*  Oculus is going to launch and HTC Vive is going to launch. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=672.64s)]
*  We have to get there early. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=676.24s)]
*  So I just decided to dive down and just go with it. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=677.8s)]
*  You know, I think what made it easy for me and my team at that time [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=680.86s)]
*  was also we knew how to build games. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=684.42s)]
*  We built games for multi-platform. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=686.98s)]
*  We knew how to build in Unity, which was used to build in VR. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=688.96s)]
*  And I also had a few folks left in Blue Tea. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=692.32s)]
*  And that's how everything started. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=695.36s)]
*  Yeah, so it sounds like you knew how to create games, [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=697.36s)]
*  but one clear differentiator between what it sounds like you did at Blue Tea [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=699.76s)]
*  and what you then were venturing into with Sandbox [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=704.52s)]
*  is the physical in-person element to it. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=707.36s)]
*  Which we'll get into later because you're doing the software and hardware, [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=710.68s)]
*  which is incredibly hard to do together. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=713.8s)]
*  But what made you specifically make that decision to say, [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=716.88s)]
*  hey, we're not going to just venture into this new platform, which is VR, [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=719.4s)]
*  but we're also going to do that in person? [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=724.14s)]
*  One of the biggest lessons I learned from mobile games [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=726.78s)]
*  is you don't create what's popular today. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=730.4s)]
*  Because by the time you're done, it's going to be 10 months too late. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=734.0999999999999s)]
*  So our job is to figure out what do people want in a year or two. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=738.24s)]
*  So when we started Sandbox VR, it was called a different company at that time, Glow. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=743.34s)]
*  We also created games for the headset because we want to be early, [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=748.24s)]
*  but we also had a second bet, [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=751.64s)]
*  which was what do people really want out of VR in 10 to 20 years? [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=753.66s)]
*  Like really try to project that out and be super, super early for that. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=758.64s)]
*  And for us, it was... [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=763.04s)]
*  I grew up watching The Matrix. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=765.06s)]
*  You can get plugged in and you can be anyone and be anywhere. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=767.28s)]
*  And I thought that VR was that last technological component to create that. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=771.42s)]
*  So we're like, can we actually create a minimum viable matrix? [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=776.22s)]
*  A minimum viable matrix. That's a good way to put it. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=779.86s)]
*  We saw all the pieces and then we think it'll fit. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=783.16s)]
*  And I think people would like it, but it will take time. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=786.62s)]
*  So when we first started the company, it was, okay, let's build a game. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=789.72s)]
*  Let's make sure that the game can make some money. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=794.46s)]
*  Well, we really worked through the idea maze of what that would look like [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=796.66s)]
*  to build a location-based project. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=800.48s)]
*  And for us, it was just hedging. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=802.5799999999999s)]
*  If the games work really well, we can double down on that. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=804.02s)]
*  And if the location works really well, we can double down on that. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=807.06s)]
*  So I didn't even realize that you were pursuing both of these paths in parallel. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=809.78s)]
*  Were there any early data points in either direction [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=814.28s)]
*  that made you think, huh, this is really where we should be betting? [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=817.36s)]
*  I think it was just the nature of how the company was founded. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=820.16s)]
*  When I built BlueD, I moved to Hong Kong [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=823.42s)]
*  and I built a community there. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=825.98s)]
*  I have friends there. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=828.62s)]
*  So when I started to seek out angel investors, I told them, [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=829.86s)]
*  hey, let's try to build games for us. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=833.76s)]
*  It's very organic, right? [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=835.46s)]
*  And we also want to learn what it takes to build in VR. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=837.22s)]
*  So while we're learning how to build content in VR, [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=839.72s)]
*  we can really figure out how to build a platform [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=843.0600000000001s)]
*  that eventually became that location-based component to it. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=845.1600000000001s)]
*  But for us, we also didn't raise that much. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=848.26s)]
*  In the beginning, we raised about, I think, $300,000, $400,000, [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=851.56s)]
*  which might seem like a lot, [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=856.06s)]
*  but if you're building a team that wants to build content [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=857.56s)]
*  and then build a technology platform that's never been done before [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=861.3599999999999s)]
*  and eventually put it into a retail space, [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=864.2199999999999s)]
*  that's not a lot of money to go about. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=866.78s)]
*  So I was, I guess, a little bit naive in the thought that, [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=868.9799999999999s)]
*  hey, we're early enough and we build games [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=871.5799999999999s)]
*  that by the time the game launched, [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=873.78s)]
*  that we can take the profit we earn from the game [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=875.52s)]
*  and we invest back into the platform. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=877.78s)]
*  That was in 2016, and during that time, [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=879.78s)]
*  there was a lot of hype and buzz still around VR. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=882.1999999999999s)]
*  And we launched our game in December, [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=885.6999999999999s)]
*  perfectly timed during the holiday season. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=888.5s)]
*  We went through Steam and we got incredible exposure on Steam [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=891.18s)]
*  and we put our game on the store. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=894.9s)]
*  And we were like the top 20% title, [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=897.8s)]
*  but it didn't generate that much revenue for us. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=901.3s)]
*  And it was the same for a lot of developers at that time. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=905.1999999999999s)]
*  And we're like, oh crap, we're going to run out of money. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=908.4s)]
*  Entering 2017, that was kind of like the start of the VR winter [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=911.3199999999999s)]
*  where funding was very, very difficult [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=915.02s)]
*  because the holiday season didn't really pick up numbers [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=917.52s)]
*  that gave enough trust to the VR market. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=920.36s)]
*  So that just kind of became organic, [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=923.5s)]
*  where it's like, okay, so we cannot really just do games anymore. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=925.72s)]
*  We have to put 100% of our effort behind this full-body platform [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=929.1s)]
*  that we built on the side. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=934.42s)]
*  And it sounds like you did that. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=936.06s)]
*  You went into what you might call this nuclear winter in 2017. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=937.38s)]
*  You had just been working on these digital games. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=942.92s)]
*  It sounds like they had some success, [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=945.76s)]
*  but you were in a way pivoting, [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=947.86s)]
*  but also, as I said, pivoting right into this winter [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=950.1800000000001s)]
*  where the amount of funding that you had raised prior [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=952.72s)]
*  would not hold you over. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=955.66s)]
*  So you made a decision that I think is really emblematic of your journey [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=956.96s)]
*  and the conviction that you've had throughout the years [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=962.82s)]
*  about the platform that you're building. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=965.1800000000001s)]
*  And you put your own life savings into the company. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=967.08s)]
*  Tell me a little bit more about what conviction you had and why [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=970.7800000000001s)]
*  that made you actually decide to take your own life savings [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=975.4000000000001s)]
*  and bet it on this company. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=978.7s)]
*  I didn't want to put my life savings, as that was the first start. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=980.24s)]
*  But entering 2017, we had maybe $100,000 left in the bank. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=983.74s)]
*  And I went back to Masters. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=989.2s)]
*  I went back to Institutionals, also Angels, [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=991.58s)]
*  and it's like, hey, we have this great platform [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=994.5s)]
*  that will one day enable full-body experiences with multiplayer. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=997.62s)]
*  But in a retail setting, it's like, hey, [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1001.4s)]
*  we just need a little bit more funding to kind of bring a demo out. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1004.62s)]
*  And we couldn't get anyone to go for it. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1008.72s)]
*  We're like, okay, this is it. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1011.62s)]
*  So I had this conversation with my friends, my family. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1013.62s)]
*  I have this nest egg that I saved from BlueTeeth. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1018.9s)]
*  Ten years working with BlueTeeth, I saved this nest egg. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1021.32s)]
*  I can put everything into this and just get the demo out [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1023.52s)]
*  and just prove that this is a concept we're building for. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1026.66s)]
*  And of course, I talked to my friends, and they're like, [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1030.2s)]
*  yeah, Steve, don't do it. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1032.5s)]
*  And I talked to my parents, like, yeah, this is really bad. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1033.52s)]
*  So I decided to do it. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1037.32s)]
*  Naturally. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1039.2s)]
*  What we saw in the market and location-based VR [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1041.16s)]
*  was a company that raised a hundred times more money than we did [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1044.16s)]
*  with a product we felt was not in the right direction. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1048.52s)]
*  I think at that time, people that raised a lot of money [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1051.98s)]
*  were about how do you interface with the environment? [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1054.88s)]
*  You can touch the wall, you can feel the heat. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1057.18s)]
*  And we're like, yeah, that's kind of cool. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1059.72s)]
*  But the great thing about games, [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1061.3600000000001s)]
*  it's really about playing a game with each other. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1064.08s)]
*  The game object isn't the environment. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1066.72s)]
*  It is your friends. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1068.76s)]
*  Nobody built for that. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1070.06s)]
*  We knew that people wanted that. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1071.72s)]
*  That was a conviction. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1073.6200000000001s)]
*  So that's when I decided to basically take my life-saving [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1074.6200000000001s)]
*  and put it into a sandbox. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1078.38s)]
*  And I remember the moment I did that was at the bank. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1081.38s)]
*  Even the bank executive was like, [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1083.5400000000002s)]
*  are you sure you want to do that? [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1085.88s)]
*  That's like 95% of your saving. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1087.24s)]
*  I'm like, yeah, let's just go for it. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1089.38s)]
*  But it wasn't done in isolation because at that time, [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1091.0800000000002s)]
*  we were down to a team of six and I had to sit down with them. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1095.7800000000002s)]
*  And I said, like, look, I couldn't get any more funding. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1099.64s)]
*  This is it. I'm going to have to shut down the company. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1102.9s)]
*  But I do have this much money left [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1105.64s)]
*  and I'm just going to put everything in it. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1108.7800000000002s)]
*  But if I do that, I will need all of you [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1110.6s)]
*  to be fully committed to go for this. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1113.6799999999998s)]
*  Now, if you're not, that's okay. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1116.28s)]
*  And I'll just shut the company down. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1118.1s)]
*  But if I'm going to do this, we're going to fight for it. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1119.78s)]
*  And then we sat down in a circle and everyone gave the vote. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1122.24s)]
*  Fortunately, everyone agreed to fight on [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1125.8799999999999s)]
*  for the next six months to make it happen. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1127.8999999999999s)]
*  That's amazing. I have to ask you. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1130.1799999999998s)]
*  It sounds like you and your team maybe saw something [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1132.08s)]
*  that other people, whether it be investors, [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1134.24s)]
*  whether it be other founders, didn't see at the time. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1136.58s)]
*  And there are many reasons to say that this won't work, right? [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1139.54s)]
*  As I mentioned before, you're doing both hardware and software. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1143.54s)]
*  You also are focusing on a social element, [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1147.04s)]
*  which means that you don't only need to convince one person, [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1149.04s)]
*  you need to convince many people to show up. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1151.84s)]
*  You are doing so at a time [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1154.36s)]
*  where this technology platform being VR is kind of unproven. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1156.6399999999999s)]
*  It's in its early days. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1161.34s)]
*  And so there are, again, many reasons to say, [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1162.6599999999999s)]
*  you know what, this maybe sounds like a good idea, [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1164.8s)]
*  but in reality, it's not worth pursuing. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1167.16s)]
*  So was it just seeing that certain other companies [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1169.8600000000001s)]
*  had raised so much money [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1172.92s)]
*  and were not delivering on the promise that you knew you could? [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1174.0800000000002s)]
*  Or what other data points were you paying attention to [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1176.5600000000002s)]
*  to say this is really worth pursuing? [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1179.48s)]
*  For us, it was the intuition of having built games for so long. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1181.96s)]
*  Once you do for a time, [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1187.3200000000002s)]
*  there's just intuition about what could be really fun. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1188.8200000000002s)]
*  It just came from that. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1191.76s)]
*  For me, it was able to kind of see that with just amount of funding, [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1193.16s)]
*  we can actually bring a demo [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1196.58s)]
*  and then from there be able to show what exactly this is [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1198.04s)]
*  and get people on board. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1200.6s)]
*  In the beginning, it was a demo, [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1201.9399999999998s)]
*  but we end up not just building a demo. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1203.4399999999998s)]
*  We actually built a full product. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1205.54s)]
*  And I think it just made it much easier [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1207.74s)]
*  by the time that it was launched. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1209.34s)]
*  So tell me about that demo, [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1211.54s)]
*  because I went to a sandbox recently, [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1212.6999999999998s)]
*  and it's this large room. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1214.74s)]
*  There are so many different cameras. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1216.24s)]
*  There's an entire closet of different tools that you use. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1217.8799999999999s)]
*  You're wearing a vest. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1222.1s)]
*  There's someone there helping you. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1223.78s)]
*  And so tell me about the challenge [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1225.04s)]
*  and how you solve that challenge of getting, [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1227.84s)]
*  as someone might say, an MVP. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1230.6s)]
*  It's a lot easier to create an MVP [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1232.06s)]
*  of a software site that aggregates a bunch of data. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1233.86s)]
*  An MVP of Sandbox VR sounds quite difficult. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1236.94s)]
*  Yeah, so we didn't have any vests. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1241.06s)]
*  We didn't have any custom props. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1243.86s)]
*  We didn't have the nice space [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1246.3s)]
*  that you guys went into back in the days. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1247.6s)]
*  What we had back then was just $200,000, [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1250.26s)]
*  $300,000 with six people with a life line of six months left. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1253.66s)]
*  What we did was we had to hard code everything. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1257.38s)]
*  Forget about elegance in your software, [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1260.92s)]
*  because we have to bring this out. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1263.52s)]
*  But also within that really tight constraint, [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1265.76s)]
*  the biggest thing that we had to solve was, [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1268.3600000000001s)]
*  with retail businesses, you pay for what you get. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1270.92s)]
*  If you put your product in a nice location [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1274.28s)]
*  with a lot of foot traffic, it's going to be very expensive. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1277.1200000000001s)]
*  The rent is going to be insane, [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1280.88s)]
*  and the landlord would have to see your balance sheet [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1282.16s)]
*  to be able to judge if you can actually be there. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1284.52s)]
*  We did not have that luxury. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1287.66s)]
*  So we were figuring out, [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1289.48s)]
*  how do you bring people into a place with very little foot traffic? [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1290.98s)]
*  It was during that moment that we created the highlight video. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1296.98s)]
*  It's like, how can you get people to become marketers of your products? [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1300.26s)]
*  Well, we saw Escape Room share photos, [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1305.16s)]
*  but can we push that 10x? [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1308.92s)]
*  It's like, what if we couldn't experience [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1311.54s)]
*  where you can show how much fun they had, [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1313.08s)]
*  but by the time they leave, they can have that video [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1316.1s)]
*  and share it with their friends and family, [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1318.48s)]
*  so that we can build this word of mouth? [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1320.58s)]
*  So that product was created during this really intense time [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1323.0s)]
*  that came about of trying to solve for our real estate. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1326.98s)]
*  Like, how do we get a cheap rent place that works? [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1331.1s)]
*  And that's what we did. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1333.84s)]
*  We ended up getting a location in Hong Kong. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1334.84s)]
*  Even though Hong Kong has 7 million people, [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1337.58s)]
*  we were able to find a building with zero foot traffic. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1339.82s)]
*  And the rent was insanely cheap. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1343.76s)]
*  You know, the water pipes were broken, and we were on a 16th floor. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1345.8s)]
*  There was no outside signage. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1350.0s)]
*  People don't know about us. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1352.3999999999999s)]
*  And we're like, okay, this is the perfect place [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1354.2s)]
*  because this is the only place we can afford. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1356.56s)]
*  Something that has also come up for me as you're talking [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1359.0s)]
*  is the fact that you're marketing [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1361.8s)]
*  a fundamentally new experience for most people. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1364.2s)]
*  If you open a mini golf course, [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1366.9199999999998s)]
*  you can say, hey, it's Steph's Mini Golf. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1368.92s)]
*  And people, for the most part, know what they're getting. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1370.8600000000001s)]
*  They know what kind of experience. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1373.72s)]
*  But a new location-based VR experience is new. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1375.66s)]
*  It's even hard to articulate what that is to someone, [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1379.6200000000001s)]
*  and there's no expectation linked to it. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1382.6200000000001s)]
*  So how did you go about those very first early days [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1385.42s)]
*  of opening the store and getting your first customers in there? [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1388.26s)]
*  We grounded it based on the skate room. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1391.9s)]
*  We called it a hyper-reality skate room, [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1393.7s)]
*  which seems to work. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1396.3600000000001s)]
*  People have played a skate room, [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1397.46s)]
*  like, okay, which is a VR component to it. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1398.88s)]
*  So that was our initial way of getting people in. [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1401.82s)]
*  And it's really funny because once they come out of it, [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1404.26s)]
*  they're like, this isn't a skate room. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1407.02s)]
*  I don't know what this is, [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1409.8600000000001s)]
*  but I'm going to tell my friends about it. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1411.16s)]
*  So the education part was hard, [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1413.1200000000001s)]
*  but the moment they saw the videos [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1414.66s)]
*  and the moment they share it [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1417.06s)]
*  and they saw their friends having fun, [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1418.76s)]
*  like that's when the viral loop really kicked off. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1421.02s)]
*  Yeah, I loved the video at the end, [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1423.18s)]
*  and I'm impressed that you thought to include that [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1425.06s)]
*  at the very early stages. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1427.4199999999998s)]
*  So what happened then? [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1429.48s)]
*  If you had these early customers, [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1430.8799999999999s)]
*  people are starting to share. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1432.82s)]
*  What was that early traction like? [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1434.4199999999998s)]
*  We got a little bit lucky. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1436.4199999999998s)]
*  So in the beginning, we didn't do much advertisement. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1437.6799999999998s)]
*  We had some media reporters come in, [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1441.56s)]
*  and they brought some customers. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1443.36s)]
*  They loved it. They tell their friends. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1445.12s)]
*  But there has to be a certain volume of folks [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1446.58s)]
*  who come in to really kick in. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1449.46s)]
*  But one of the reporter did a social media post, [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1451.52s)]
*  and it blew up, and it went viral. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1455.54s)]
*  And that kickstarted the viral engine [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1458.8200000000002s)]
*  where people just booked in mass, [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1460.88s)]
*  and that led to more and more people booking. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1463.04s)]
*  So what happened was pretty soon, [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1465.3200000000002s)]
*  we booked out our space 100%, 100 days in a row. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1467.44s)]
*  And it was really insane [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1472.54s)]
*  because when we first started building this business, [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1473.88s)]
*  I have a good friend of mine who've done skate rooms. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1476.52s)]
*  He said, look, if you can get to 50% occupancy, [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1479.16s)]
*  you're doing well, Steve. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1483.24s)]
*  But based on your business, [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1484.66s)]
*  even if you get to 100%, it's still a tough business. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1486.0s)]
*  And that's what we've done. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1489.3000000000002s)]
*  We have people skip work and come to play sandbox. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1490.5s)]
*  We had a few people delay their flights [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1493.66s)]
*  so they can play sandbox. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1496.44s)]
*  And pretty soon, people knew about our product, [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1498.64s)]
*  and that's how we're able to actually get [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1501.5s)]
*  our first seed institutional round done. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1503.8600000000001s)]
*  So you got this round done. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1506.16s)]
*  Feels like you're finally hitting the traction [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1507.62s)]
*  you're looking for. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1509.6599999999999s)]
*  And this is one of the reasons I love your story [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1510.9599999999998s)]
*  is that there was just so many roadblocks [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1513.6999999999998s)]
*  that emerged out of nowhere. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1515.8s)]
*  And the next one for you sounds like it was the pandemic, [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1517.7199999999998s)]
*  which is pretty fundamental to your business [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1520.6599999999999s)]
*  because it's an in-person business. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1523.3s)]
*  And so tell me about that. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1525.36s)]
*  How did you stay alive during this period? [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1526.6s)]
*  Yeah, it was tough. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1529.1s)]
*  People would say during a recession, [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1530.26s)]
*  companies will lose revenue by 30% to 60%. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1531.9199999999998s)]
*  For us, we lost 110% of our revenue [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1535.3799999999999s)]
*  because not only did people... [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1538.86s)]
*  We couldn't open any of our stores, [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1540.9799999999998s)]
*  so there was no sales, [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1542.58s)]
*  but we also had to refund everyone that booked. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1543.6599999999999s)]
*  And the outcome was that we had a great team, [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1547.4799999999998s)]
*  but we were trying to raise that series B [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1550.76s)]
*  during the early 2020, [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1554.36s)]
*  and we had about three months of runway left. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1555.82s)]
*  So we had to let go most of the folks. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1558.9599999999998s)]
*  We let go about 80% of our team. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1561.26s)]
*  That was very difficult. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1563.1799999999998s)]
*  There were a lot of great people at the team [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1564.78s)]
*  that we wanted to keep, but we couldn't. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1566.3799999999999s)]
*  So how do we make it work? [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1568.52s)]
*  I think to a degree, it was the same thing [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1570.3799999999999s)]
*  that I've done early in Sandbox, [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1572.68s)]
*  where we sat down and tried to get all the stakeholders [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1575.48s)]
*  to agree to fight on. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1578.62s)]
*  I mean, it was much bigger this time. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1580.32s)]
*  It was getting the investors that backed us like, [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1582.08s)]
*  hey, this is what we're going to do. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1585.3799999999999s)]
*  This is how we're going to survive it. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1586.92s)]
*  Do I have your support? [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1588.42s)]
*  Getting the people that remain in the team [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1589.68s)]
*  to get the support, [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1591.66s)]
*  getting the secured creditors, [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1592.92s)]
*  and unsecured creditors like, [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1594.6799999999998s)]
*  hey, we need to make sure Sandbox [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1595.98s)]
*  have a long enough runway so that we can all survive, [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1598.82s)]
*  and just creating a very big plan out of that. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1602.78s)]
*  Now, the challenge was we couldn't convince everyone, [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1605.86s)]
*  and because of that, we had to go through Chapter 11. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1610.08s)]
*  We needed protection to get through that phase. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1614.1799999999998s)]
*  So in order to survive that whole ordeal, [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1617.28s)]
*  fortunately, we got great investors kind of helping us, [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1620.1799999999998s)]
*  including Andreessen, to kind of give us a lifeline. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1622.9s)]
*  But part of that plan was also getting folks [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1626.18s)]
*  that we borrowed money from the debt holders [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1628.9s)]
*  to really extend our line, [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1630.7s)]
*  and then going through Chapter 11 to work with the landlords, [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1632.44s)]
*  unsecured debt holders, [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1635.0400000000002s)]
*  to find a way to make this all work out. [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1637.0400000000002s)]
*  I mean, one of the most challenging parts of the pandemic, [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1639.8000000000002s)]
*  I think, for everyone was the idea that [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1642.8400000000001s)]
*  we didn't know when it was going to quote, unquote, end. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1645.2s)]
*  And I think that would be particularly challenging [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1647.94s)]
*  with your business, as you said, [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1649.74s)]
*  because you didn't go from 100% of sales to 70. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1650.94s)]
*  You went from 100 to zero, [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1655.04s)]
*  and it was unclear when things would tick back up. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1656.5s)]
*  So was there a point during that process where you thought, [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1659.3s)]
*  well, A, we should maybe just shut this down [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1662.3600000000001s)]
*  because we're not sure when things are going to bounce back, [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1664.7s)]
*  or B, fundamentally pivot it? [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1667.9s)]
*  We did. That was the first thing we talked about is, [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1669.8s)]
*  how can we pivot? We don't know how long this is going to last. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1672.66s)]
*  But there were a few reasons why we didn't go through that route. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1675.3s)]
*  Number one was we knew fundamentally we had a great product. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1679.44s)]
*  Before the pandemic, people loved sandbox. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1682.06s)]
*  So for us, as long as we can survive it, then it'll work. [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1684.6000000000001s)]
*  But the bigger telling point was, [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1688.7s)]
*  the pandemic impacted every country differently. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1690.8600000000001s)]
*  For example, we saw that in China, [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1694.44s)]
*  things were opened up very quickly. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1696.7s)]
*  Although there's a lot of rules in place, [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1698.76s)]
*  it felt like it was pretty normal. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1700.3600000000001s)]
*  We're like, okay, why don't we pick countries [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1701.64s)]
*  that weren't really impacted by the pandemic, and we start there? [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1704.3600000000001s)]
*  And whenever other countries open up with the U.S., [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1707.68s)]
*  then we'll go back there again. [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1709.92s)]
*  So that was our strategy, [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1711.48s)]
*  really just making sure we have the runway to kind of just hibernate. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1713.5600000000002s)]
*  You know, there was for a long time, [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1719.0600000000002s)]
*  like me and some of the core executives, we didn't take salary. [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1720.88s)]
*  People had to take time off so that, you know, [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1724.48s)]
*  they can control how we spend. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1727.52s)]
*  It was really tough, but we just decided to fight on, [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1728.72s)]
*  just focus on the countries that we can open in. [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1732.5600000000002s)]
*  Yeah, I've mentioned this a few times throughout our chat, [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1735.0s)]
*  but just, you know, if I were to have designed a business [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1737.54s)]
*  that I thought maybe would have one of the hardest times throughout a pandemic, [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1740.38s)]
*  it would be something like Sandbox VR. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1744.28s)]
*  It has the social element, it has the in-person element, [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1746.18s)]
*  but you made it. You made it through the pandemic, [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1749.68s)]
*  and I'm curious to know how post-pandemic things have shifted, [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1751.68s)]
*  whether it's that people are more interested [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1756.08s)]
*  in some of these digital, physical experiences. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1759.18s)]
*  Maybe this impacted your ability to get long-term leases [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1762.66s)]
*  as different other businesses are shifting, [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1765.3600000000001s)]
*  but also just interested in how you've marketed yourself as you've come back. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1768.24s)]
*  You know, running a startup is hard. [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1772.94s)]
*  Running a retail startup during the pandemic is really, really hard. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1775.0400000000002s)]
*  And running a retail startup during the pandemic [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1778.64s)]
*  while going through Chapter 11 is really, really, really, really hard. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1780.64s)]
*  And when times get very tough, [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1784.2s)]
*  one thing that we learned is we have to be very selective on where we focus. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1786.44s)]
*  And where we focus, we have to be looking for outsize outcome. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1790.86s)]
*  We were measuring everything against profit, against sales, [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1794.56s)]
*  but really about the margin. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1798.9399999999998s)]
*  So, like, one example would be [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1801.0s)]
*  when we get the highlight videos that customers get, [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1804.3999999999999s)]
*  we've learned that if you were able to hand them the video before they leave, [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1807.36s)]
*  they have a 10x chance of just talking about it, sharing it, going about it. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1812.4399999999998s)]
*  But it takes us about 15 to 20 minutes to generate the videos [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1816.6999999999998s)]
*  so people could be leaving before they actually get the video. [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1820.3s)]
*  So for us, it's like, how do we shrink that 20 minute down to two minutes? [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1823.62s)]
*  So we allocated the product team entirely to solving that one thing. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1827.3s)]
*  But we knew that the outcome was going to give us much more high shareability, [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1832.32s)]
*  and we measured that afterward, and it really worked. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1835.76s)]
*  So that was just one facet of many, like a dozen core things we've done [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1838.6s)]
*  that really turned the company around. [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1843.1599999999999s)]
*  So fortunately, in early 2021 with the vaccination, [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1845.12s)]
*  there was a huge pent-up demand for people to come out, [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1849.4399999999998s)]
*  and when they did, oh boy, did they really go to sandbox, [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1852.52s)]
*  and everything just worked. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1856.08s)]
*  And the market, actually, there was a market shift too, [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1857.82s)]
*  where we were able to really renegotiate all the rent [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1860.72s)]
*  that we had for existing location, but also for new locations. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1864.58s)]
*  Not only that, we were able to convince Landlord to fund our project entirely, [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1868.32s)]
*  because we had no capital. [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1873.82s)]
*  So we had to find a way to create a win-win situation [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1875.52s)]
*  where the landlord is willing to bet a company [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1879.68s)]
*  that had been through the pandemic, that had been through Chapter 11, [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1882.68s)]
*  and say, you know what, we're going to give this company all the money [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1886.8799999999999s)]
*  so they can be in our place. [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1890.24s)]
*  And we're able to convince them on that. [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1892.92s)]
*  How does that work? [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1894.74s)]
*  Generally, in the US, Landlord will give something called a tenant allowance. [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1895.98s)]
*  Usually, they would fund retail tenants a certain percentage [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1900.12s)]
*  so that they can build up their place. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1904.28s)]
*  Usually, what we've gotten before, it was about 5 to 10%. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1906.3799999999999s)]
*  So we've made it work because we're able to show data point during a pandemic. [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1910.54s)]
*  For example, we're able to open in our Chicago location. [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1915.6399999999999s)]
*  And during that time, we were in a mall that had zero foot traffic, [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1920.48s)]
*  but 100% of our customer booked ahead online. [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1926.1399999999999s)]
*  And that was because of our marketing strategy of our highlight videos. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1930.5s)]
*  I mean, we have stories where we actually had to meet people at the parking lot [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1935.4s)]
*  to take them to sandbox because they would get lost in an empty mall. [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1940.02s)]
*  But we were doing tremendously well. [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1944.02s)]
*  People wanted to go out. [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1946.2s)]
*  Fundamentally, what we're trying to solve [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1947.5s)]
*  is for people to have a great time together. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1949.66s)]
*  And that is made no more important than during the pandemic [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1952.8600000000001s)]
*  of how important it was. [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1956.22s)]
*  So we share these data points, [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1957.36s)]
*  and then we're able to convince a few landlords to take a bet on us. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1959.82s)]
*  And then once that happened, [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1963.2199999999998s)]
*  we were able to get more and more landlords to take bigger bets on us. [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1964.4199999999998s)]
*  That's how we survived the pandemic. [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1967.9799999999998s)]
*  Yeah, and it reminds me, I think Apple, in many occasions, [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1970.28s)]
*  gets cheaper leases because, yes, these Apple stores [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1973.6799999999998s)]
*  are almost just these central locations that attract so much foot traffic [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1976.26s)]
*  that it's beneficial to the landlords of these malls, et cetera, [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1980.52s)]
*  to offer those deals. [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1984.76s)]
*  So it's great that you're seeing something similar. [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1986.46s)]
*  Something you mentioned, though, about sandbox as really... [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1989.72s)]
*  Sandbox being this place where people socialize and come together [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1993.78s)]
*  reminded me of just the idea of competition. [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=1998.16s)]
*  Like, what do you compare sandbox to? [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2001.42s)]
*  And I can think of many examples, you know, maybe a movie theater, [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2003.96s)]
*  maybe something like Topgolf, [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2007.66s)]
*  maybe something purely digital like Friends playing in Fortnite. [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2009.58s)]
*  So I guess from your perspective, [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2013.62s)]
*  where does sandbox fit in that competitive matrix? [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2016.32s)]
*  Who are your core competitors, [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2019.1399999999999s)]
*  and what are you really challenging that exists today? [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2020.84s)]
*  We do think of ourselves as carving a brand-new market, [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2024.08s)]
*  but if we were to take the close example, [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2027.6399999999999s)]
*  what we do want to become is the new movies. [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2030.12s)]
*  When we think about the movies, it's a pretty passive experience, [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2033.02s)]
*  and the outcome doesn't change when you watch a movie, [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2036.28s)]
*  and you probably do it not many times. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2038.9399999999998s)]
*  But for us, it's a very highly active experience [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2041.4s)]
*  that, depending on who you go with, the outcome can change [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2045.0400000000002s)]
*  when you play the experience. [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2047.9s)]
*  And there's a huge social media component to it [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2049.44s)]
*  where you can actually express yourself [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2052.4s)]
*  and be able to share that digitally with other folks. [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2054.0s)]
*  And structurally, it's like the movies, [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2056.1800000000003s)]
*  because you come in and there's different experiences that comes out, [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2057.8s)]
*  and you will chase for the next experience. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2061.2000000000003s)]
*  We're starting to have experiences that are starting to hit box office numbers. [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2063.98s)]
*  Our titles are starting to hit theatrical releases, [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2067.48s)]
*  the average U.S. theatrical domestic box office release revenue. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2070.4s)]
*  And as we scale, there will be a day [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2075.38s)]
*  where we could see sandbox experiences even being a rival [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2077.6s)]
*  to some of the box office movie hits. [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2081.3s)]
*  And is that the plan? [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2084.1800000000003s)]
*  Because I could see a couple different ways [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2086.28s)]
*  that you could approach the business, [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2088.5s)]
*  one of them being you just focus on creating one great game [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2090.1800000000003s)]
*  that people come back to. [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2094.0s)]
*  And when they come back, they want to beat their previous score, [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2095.7400000000002s)]
*  they want to go back with a new friend, see how it's different. [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2098.18s)]
*  Or maybe another path, which sounds more similar to what you're describing, [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2100.98s)]
*  is having a suite of different experiences. [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2104.7s)]
*  Every time I go back, I'm trying something new, [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2107.24s)]
*  kind of like the movies, right? [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2109.8399999999997s)]
*  You don't often, unless it's something like Avatar, [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2111.2799999999997s)]
*  you don't want to go see something again. [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2113.7s)]
*  And so from your own perspective, [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2115.44s)]
*  but also from maybe the consumer behavior that you're seeing, [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2117.94s)]
*  which one of those scenarios, per se, [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2121.14s)]
*  do you think more so fits what you're trying to do with sandbox? [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2123.8399999999997s)]
*  Well, definitely the latter. [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2127.34s)]
*  We do see people come back for new experiences [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2128.54s)]
*  that they can share with their friends and family. [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2130.9s)]
*  There is a very small subgroup that would chase a high score. [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2132.44s)]
*  And we've seen people play our zombie experience over like 12 times [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2135.7000000000003s)]
*  just to get a certain outcome. [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2140.2400000000002s)]
*  What really engages people, what we've learned that's surprising about sandbox, [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2142.0s)]
*  is it's really something, [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2145.54s)]
*  it's an experience that you guys want to delve into that you guys can share. [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2147.86s)]
*  And the outcome of that is people come to sandbox [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2152.86s)]
*  because they want to build a relationship with someone. [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2155.16s)]
*  So a date night, it's extremely popular in sandbox. [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2158.3599999999997s)]
*  Or they want parents having a fun time with the kids [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2162.2599999999998s)]
*  in a way that's very shareable. [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2165.08s)]
*  Or people haven't seen in a long time. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2166.8799999999997s)]
*  So we want to keep doing that, [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2169.08s)]
*  but with different worlds they can be in with different characters. [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2171.18s)]
*  That's great. And in a perfect world, [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2173.58s)]
*  you could have endless resources and launch a new game every single day, [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2175.3199999999997s)]
*  and they'd all be amazing, [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2179.42s)]
*  and there'd be this endless suite of games that people could try out. [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2180.62s)]
*  But obviously, there's a resource constraint. [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2183.88s)]
*  And so tell me a little bit more about [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2186.84s)]
*  how you think about the rollout of new games, [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2189.1s)]
*  and also the amount of resources it takes to build a new game. [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2191.94s)]
*  I think you have six right now. Is that correct? [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2195.7400000000002s)]
*  Yeah, that's correct. [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2197.94s)]
*  So generally it takes about 12 months to build a title. [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2198.84s)]
*  Internally, three months of pre-production, [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2201.58s)]
*  nine months of production work. [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2204.48s)]
*  But we also work post-production to make sure things look, [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2205.7000000000003s)]
*  goes according to plan or any changes that we make [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2208.78s)]
*  while it's live to the audience. [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2211.04s)]
*  So the way we think about content is, [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2212.9s)]
*  in the beginning, we have to build everything ourselves [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2215.86s)]
*  because it doesn't exist. [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2218.3s)]
*  But over time, other people can build on our platform. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2220.06s)]
*  That if you're a VR game developer, [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2223.9s)]
*  over time you can find it more lucrative to build on sandbox [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2225.6s)]
*  than other options. [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2228.82s)]
*  So how we scale location is a factor of that. [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2230.62s)]
*  The more locations we have, the more tickets we sell. [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2233.56s)]
*  The more tickets we sell, [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2236.1s)]
*  the more third-party developers interested in us. [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2237.06s)]
*  So in the beginning, we built a lot of locations ourselves. [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2240.02s)]
*  And we've proven this to be a very lucrative retail business model. [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2243.9s)]
*  And over time, franchising will really kick in [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2247.6s)]
*  and really bring sandbox all across the world. [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2250.02s)]
*  Once you have that, then you can start needing developers [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2252.0s)]
*  that, you know, with this unique skill set to bring that [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2254.5s)]
*  either local content or IP branded content [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2258.0s)]
*  that they're really good at or genres they're amazing at [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2260.72s)]
*  and just create this ecosystem. [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2263.62s)]
*  Yeah, it feels like in your early days, [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2265.52s)]
*  you've leaned pretty heavily on the build versus buy options. [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2268.4s)]
*  You built your own platform. [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2273.62s)]
*  You built the content on top of your platform [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2275.0s)]
*  when others in a similar scenario might have chosen to borrow, right, [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2277.42s)]
*  or buy from another company, [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2281.8s)]
*  whether it's the technology, whether it's the IP. [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2283.62s)]
*  And so tell me about that. [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2286.26s)]
*  And specifically, tell me about the IP aspect of things [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2287.3s)]
*  because it does sound like you're starting to do partnerships. [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2289.7200000000003s)]
*  I think one of your titles was in partnership with Star Trek. [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2291.8s)]
*  We had to build because we wanted to get experience perfect. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2295.02s)]
*  We wanted full body experience. [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2298.66s)]
*  And, you know, we couldn't just take, say, a VR game [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2301.12s)]
*  that's for the consumer headset with controllers [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2304.8s)]
*  to work where you have to use the full body [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2308.36s)]
*  and you have to play with someone in the same space. [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2311.22s)]
*  It wouldn't really take advantage of that platform [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2313.56s)]
*  and wouldn't be a great experience we thought [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2315.8s)]
*  that it would drive people to our location. [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2317.6s)]
*  It was built really out of necessity. [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2320.7s)]
*  But once we've proven that, [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2322.72s)]
*  we can actually share that news with other brands. [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2324.52s)]
*  Like, hey, wouldn't it be awesome to be in the Star Trek universe, [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2327.3599999999997s)]
*  to be a cadet where we can be in each of different planets, [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2331.22s)]
*  and you can use a tri-quarter and go from there? [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2333.66s)]
*  You know, at that time, it made a lot of sense. [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2336.7s)]
*  We did a lot of shooting experiences in the beginning [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2339.1s)]
*  because you had to wear a bulky VR backpack [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2341.16s)]
*  and you're pretty limited. [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2344.2999999999997s)]
*  But now with wireless streaming, [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2346.3599999999997s)]
*  it actually enables a lot more different genres [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2348.72s)]
*  that we can utilize. [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2352.9399999999996s)]
*  I think an analogy that we would use is [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2354.74s)]
*  what sound is to silent films [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2358.58s)]
*  is what the wireless streaming is to our VR platform. [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2361.74s)]
*  Because once you add a sound, there's a genre [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2365.3199999999997s)]
*  that wasn't possible before that you can utilize now. [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2367.7799999999997s)]
*  So with wireless streaming, there's a lot more mobility, [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2370.9399999999996s)]
*  there's a lot more movement, [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2374.18s)]
*  and you can create experiences [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2375.8399999999997s)]
*  where every part of your body movement matters. [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2377.1s)]
*  And that is why we decided to partner with Netflix on Squid Game. [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2380.04s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2384.04s)]
*  What a great partnership. [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2385.58s)]
*  Thank you, thank you. [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2387.68s)]
*  It's a great... [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2388.84s)]
*  It shows a lot of trust in us, Netflix, [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2390.7400000000002s)]
*  to be able to give us one of the best IDs. [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2392.84s)]
*  But I think it's also a good marriage [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2395.5s)]
*  in the sense that we can really create a great experience [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2397.9s)]
*  where you have multiple people in the same space [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2402.14s)]
*  where you can collaborate or even sabotage one another [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2405.2s)]
*  moving freely in a shared space. [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2408.3199999999997s)]
*  So not only do we get to work with a great IP, [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2411.9199999999996s)]
*  but also we're able to create an experience [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2414.22s)]
*  that fully utilizes our platform. [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2418.2s)]
*  I think that's so important to your point [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2420.72s)]
*  about what the technology enables, [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2422.5s)]
*  because I actually, I was too scared to watch Squid Game, [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2424.62s)]
*  but I know the premise and I know some of the games within Squid Game, [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2427.62s)]
*  and some of them would just be inherently underserved [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2430.66s)]
*  if they were done in, you know, even a VR headset [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2434.0s)]
*  if you didn't have access to your hands, [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2436.7s)]
*  because one of the games is where you're kind of like cutting open [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2438.32s)]
*  a shape within a cookie, for example. [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2441.32s)]
*  You can do that with your mouse or your keyboard, [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2443.9s)]
*  but it's not the same. [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2445.82s)]
*  And that's something that I really was impressed by [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2446.96s)]
*  when I went to Sandbox, which is, as you said, [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2449.5s)]
*  it's like a full body experience. [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2451.36s)]
*  There's haptics on your vest. [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2453.2s)]
*  You know, if my partner got killed, [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2456.1s)]
*  I go, you know, restore him with my hand. [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2458.22s)]
*  And so there was just so many aspects where it was like, [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2461.12s)]
*  you are fully in this experience. [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2463.12s)]
*  And I also think another element of VR, [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2465.44s)]
*  which is probably my favorite [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2467.64s)]
*  from the few in-person VR experiences I've done, [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2470.3199999999997s)]
*  is the ability for you to truly immerse yourself. [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2474.8199999999997s)]
*  And what I mean by that is to start experiencing emotions [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2477.94s)]
*  like fear or joy [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2480.92s)]
*  that I don't think I've experienced to the same degree in other games. [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2483.42s)]
*  To give a quick example, [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2487.08s)]
*  the first time I ever went to a VR experience was in Japan, [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2489.08s)]
*  and they get you to walk across this balance beam in VR, [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2492.34s)]
*  and they get you to jump to grab this. [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2495.6600000000003s)]
*  There's like a helicopter with a ladder hanging down. [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2498.76s)]
*  And really, you're about four inches off the ground on this balance beam. [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2502.1000000000004s)]
*  But because of the immersion that happens, you get scared. [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2505.96s)]
*  You're like, oh, gosh, I don't know if I can make this jump, [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2510.3s)]
*  because in VR, there's a big city below you. [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2513.54s)]
*  And the same experience I did at Sandbox, [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2517.1000000000004s)]
*  there was this point where they raised both of us up, [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2519.86s)]
*  but we went in different directions. [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2521.9s)]
*  And it truly felt like I was then 100 meters away from my partner [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2523.86s)]
*  instead of, you know, in reality, we were one meter away. [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2527.92s)]
*  So I don't know, I'm just sharing that experience, [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2531.3s)]
*  because I do think your point about the actual technology [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2533.5s)]
*  enabling concretely new experiences is really important, [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2536.7200000000003s)]
*  and Squid Game seems like one of the best options [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2540.9s)]
*  to actually pursue that with. [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2543.52s)]
*  It's really interesting, [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2545.26s)]
*  because when we first started Sandbox, [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2546.96s)]
*  and the first experience we built was a zombie experience [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2549.7599999999998s)]
*  called Deadwood Mansion. [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2552.42s)]
*  We were inspired by, you know, Resident Evil Left 4 Dead, [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2553.66s)]
*  and those titles generally is a very male-dominated experience [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2557.08s)]
*  that people love to put. [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2561.52s)]
*  But when we launched that, [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2562.3599999999997s)]
*  we were surprised that half the audience were female. [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2564.42s)]
*  And we asked our customers, like, [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2567.06s)]
*  hey, what do you think of our experience? [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2568.96s)]
*  And for them, they said, hey, it doesn't feel like a game. [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2570.56s)]
*  It felt like real life. [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2572.8199999999997s)]
*  It felt like I'm a star of my own, [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2573.96s)]
*  me and my friends are stars of our own movies, [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2575.48s)]
*  and we're transported into this world. [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2577.3199999999997s)]
*  So we end up that we didn't create just a gaming experience. [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2579.66s)]
*  It felt like an experience of a consumer product. [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2583.06s)]
*  The insight that we took from this was that the believability, [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2585.68s)]
*  once you hit a certain level, it just click, [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2591.16s)]
*  and it just becomes real life. [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2593.96s)]
*  And that's the reason why we built what we've done, [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2596.06s)]
*  because when we first started out with the consumer VR headset, [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2598.48s)]
*  we still know that we were in a game, [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2602.18s)]
*  because when you put on your headset, [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2603.66s)]
*  okay, you look at your body, you don't see your body, [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2605.3799999999997s)]
*  you look at your controller just two floating joysticks, right? [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2607.3799999999997s)]
*  And you can't really move in your space, [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2610.8999999999996s)]
*  and then if you're next to another player online, [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2612.64s)]
*  you can't really physically interact with them. [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2615.04s)]
*  But you put them in sandbox, they forget they're in assimilation. [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2617.7s)]
*  And there are many times we would get complaints about noise. [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2622.48s)]
*  I remembered in the early days, [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2626.98s)]
*  we worked with IMAX to bring sandbox into New York space. [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2629.58s)]
*  It was right next to the theater. [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2633.3399999999997s)]
*  And we found out that we had to shut our store by 5pm. [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2635.1s)]
*  I was like, why? [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2638.82s)]
*  And they said, well, because people were screaming so loud [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2640.16s)]
*  that all the theaters around could hear random screaming. [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2643.16s)]
*  And they tried everything. [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2646.62s)]
*  They put mattresses, they tried to muffle all the time. [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2647.96s)]
*  It did not work. [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2650.12s)]
*  You don't get that unless you create something [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2658.26s)]
*  that's very real and believable. [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2660.3s)]
*  It felt very real. [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2662.56s)]
*  I actually avoided the zombie tracks when I went [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2663.56s)]
*  because I was scared of how real it would be, [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2667.58s)]
*  and I instead went with the space option. [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2670.46s)]
*  But on this note of truly immersing people [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2673.7599999999998s)]
*  and almost replicating reality in a way, [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2677.16s)]
*  what does that take? [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2681.08s)]
*  I saw it for myself, but just for listeners, [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2682.46s)]
*  how many cameras are required? [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2684.56s)]
*  How many props? [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2686.96s)]
*  What is really going into this experience [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2688.62s)]
*  that makes it fundamentally different [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2691.08s)]
*  from, let's say, an Oculus headset? [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2692.5s)]
*  It starts with outside-in technology [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2694.68s)]
*  because in a shared space, [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2696.98s)]
*  it needs to be tracked from the environment [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2698.7s)]
*  rather than from the headset, [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2701.2799999999997s)]
*  which is inside-out technology, [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2703.54s)]
*  which is tracking from a single camera within a headset. [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2705.5s)]
*  Because once you have that, [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2709.58s)]
*  then it's building a very low-lacency environment [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2711.7s)]
*  that tracks your full body. [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2714.74s)]
*  And low-lacency is really important [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2717.7s)]
*  because when you play an experience [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2719.54s)]
*  and it kind of stutters a bit, [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2721.5s)]
*  then you remember that you're in a simulation. [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2725.24s)]
*  So for us, being able to have really streamlined, [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2727.24s)]
*  wireless, low-lacency experience, [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2730.04s)]
*  that's full body. [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2731.8s)]
*  And once you hit that level [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2733.56s)]
*  and that physical element [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2735.7s)]
*  of being able to interact with your friends, [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2737.44s)]
*  that's when you start to believe that this is real life. [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2739.66s)]
*  I definitely was surprised that I didn't get a headache either [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2742.54s)]
*  because I know that can be a feature, [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2745.94s)]
*  or I guess a bug in this case, of other VR experiences. [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2747.9s)]
*  And I get car sick probably 50% of the time. [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2751.0s)]
*  And so I'm very susceptible to that feeling, [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2753.3s)]
*  but I went through the whole experience [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2756.42s)]
*  and never had one inkling of that. [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2758.2000000000003s)]
*  So that was surprising. [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2760.2200000000003s)]
*  But what I guess differentiates Sandbox [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2762.2200000000003s)]
*  in being able to build this low-latency environment? [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2765.02s)]
*  Yeah, so when we first started out, [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2768.4s)]
*  it doesn't work. [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2772.1000000000004s)]
*  When we've got the headsets and then we've got the cameras [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2773.8s)]
*  and then we try to put everything together, [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2776.42s)]
*  it's a very buggy experience. [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2778.14s)]
*  Back in the days when we'd go out to try other VR locations, [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2780.7200000000003s)]
*  it was really buggy too. [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2784.62s)]
*  And I think for a lot of folks, that felt like it was okay [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2786.52s)]
*  because, hey, that's just what VR is. [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2790.54s)]
*  But even as a small company back in 2017, [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2792.84s)]
*  with the limited resources, we cut corners. [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2796.64s)]
*  One thing we never cut was the fidelity of experience [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2799.34s)]
*  because for us, the end product we wanted to do [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2802.82s)]
*  was to have someone believe that they're in real life. [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2805.74s)]
*  And to do that, it cannot stutter at all. [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2808.6s)]
*  So we have to be very precise on how we do our tracking [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2812.54s)]
*  and how we do the streaming, [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2817.64s)]
*  which also led to some of the patterns that we had early on, [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2819.54s)]
*  which was we're able to create this prediction algorithm, [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2821.9599999999996s)]
*  which actually allows people to be able to move and be in VR [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2825.64s)]
*  even if they're being blocked. [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2829.4599999999996s)]
*  So that was one component to it. [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2831.66s)]
*  And the other component was we're able to batch the data [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2833.96s)]
*  how we send wirelessly so that if things doesn't go well, [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2836.56s)]
*  you will still have a very smooth experience. [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2840.88s)]
*  So in a way, the technology that we created [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2844.1600000000003s)]
*  was like how we ran our startup. [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2846.46s)]
*  Like when things don't go well, we find a way to make it go well. [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2848.02s)]
*  I've touched on this to an extent already, [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2851.32s)]
*  but I just want to hear your perspectives specifically [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2853.1600000000003s)]
*  on this idea of building both hardware and software. [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2855.36s)]
*  People often say that building hardware just on its own [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2858.7200000000003s)]
*  is like building on hard mode, [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2861.56s)]
*  and you've decided to integrate both. [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2862.88s)]
*  You've integrated real estate into the equation. [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2864.36s)]
*  And so curious to know about if we start looking forward [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2867.06s)]
*  in terms of sandbox, [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2870.48s)]
*  how do you think about the business evolving? [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2872.08s)]
*  Where are you focusing? [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2874.42s)]
*  Is it about opening up a bunch of new locations? [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2875.46s)]
*  Is it about extending the content variety that you have? [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2878.1600000000003s)]
*  Is it about getting better deals with your real estate partners? [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2881.48s)]
*  How do you think about the evolution and where to prioritize? [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2886.82s)]
*  Yeah, to answer your first question, building hardware is really hard. [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2890.68s)]
*  Fortunately, in the beginning, we didn't have to worry about hardware [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2893.9s)]
*  because everything was off the shelf. [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2897.88s)]
*  So all we had to do was make sure the software works really well [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2899.64s)]
*  with all the hardware that we've used. [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2903.04s)]
*  We got very lucky in that respect. [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2904.94s)]
*  And over time, we started building our own haptic wands and wireless props. [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2907.0s)]
*  And in the future, we do want to invest deeper into hardware [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2912.98s)]
*  to have a more integrated product. [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2916.6s)]
*  In terms of how we want to see our future and how we grow, [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2918.4s)]
*  it's just continue to do everything that we do, [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2921.26s)]
*  but really to double down on our content. [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2924.9s)]
*  You know, I always see us in movies. [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2928.2200000000003s)]
*  In the first five years of sandbox, [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2930.42s)]
*  it's like it's a silent film of our VR product. [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2932.7000000000003s)]
*  And now that we just created wireless streaming, [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2936.4s)]
*  now we can add sound to it. [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2939.1600000000003s)]
*  So now we have all these genres that we can explore, [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2941.0s)]
*  that we can provide for our audience. [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2944.86s)]
*  And over time, we'll figure out what that color is. [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2946.82s)]
*  We can add the color to our black and white sound film [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2949.88s)]
*  and then build even more genres of experience [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2954.2400000000002s)]
*  that can utilize that and just grow from there. [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2956.82s)]
*  As you expand your content mix, [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2959.7200000000003s)]
*  I'm also curious to know if you plan to [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2961.44s)]
*  or are thinking about venturing outside of the social realm. [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2963.48s)]
*  So it sounds like that is the priority, that is the focus. [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2966.84s)]
*  But as an example of when I went, [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2970.38s)]
*  I asked my husband, who was the person I went with, [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2972.7400000000002s)]
*  if he would go again, he's like, yes, this was great. [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2975.9s)]
*  But I would love an experience like this to work on my surfing. [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2978.38s)]
*  That's something that he's trying to get better at today. [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2982.2400000000002s)]
*  But the problem with surfing is that you have to wait for the waves. [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2984.84s)]
*  You know, you can go out in a day and the waves aren't good [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2988.78s)]
*  and you can't get the experience that you're looking for. [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2991.38s)]
*  But you can imagine in an equivalent VR experience, [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2993.88s)]
*  you could have waves nonstop. [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2997.6s)]
*  You don't have to wait for the next one. [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=2999.38s)]
*  You don't have to paddle out. [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3000.6s)]
*  And you can really, I guess, condense the learning period [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3001.88s)]
*  to get better. [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3005.88s)]
*  And so that's just one example of where VR could be [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3006.9s)]
*  a more educational resource instead of a social resource. [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3010.5s)]
*  And so how do you think about that if you plan to expand your content mix? [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3013.8s)]
*  Do you think that that might actually expand past social? [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3018.4s)]
*  We do, we do. [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3021.84s)]
*  And I think it's how we started the company, [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3023.1800000000003s)]
*  always hedging on different bets. [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3025.1800000000003s)]
*  So one of the things we're doing is actually we're creating, [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3027.8s)]
*  we're rebuilding our operating systems so that it's white labeled, [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3031.1s)]
*  that other developers can actually build on top of our system. [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3035.1s)]
*  That if you want to learn surfing, it might not be in sandbox, [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3039.12s)]
*  but it might be somewhere else. [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3042.2599999999998s)]
*  But someone can leverage our technology to create a full body experience [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3043.8199999999997s)]
*  that allows people to be on a board and be able to surf [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3046.72s)]
*  and just train at different type of temple [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3050.22s)]
*  to replicate how the waves are. [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3053.06s)]
*  We'll see how that goes, [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3055.46s)]
*  but we do understand that what we have is beyond just our business. [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3056.7599999999998s)]
*  And we do want to support how the ecosystem can change over time. [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3061.5s)]
*  Speaking of the full ecosystem, [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3064.72s)]
*  since we've already kind of ventured into the future of VR, [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3066.3799999999997s)]
*  I have to ask about broadly the sentiment of VR being a new computing platform. [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3069.8199999999997s)]
*  And as you mentioned, when you started sandbox in 2016, [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3075.8799999999997s)]
*  it existed back then, so we're now in 2023. [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3080.12s)]
*  And I think there have definitely been some impressive strides in the industry, [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3083.12s)]
*  but the challenge that many people would make about VR [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3088.2799999999997s)]
*  is that it still remains in this zone of novelty. [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3091.8999999999996s)]
*  And so I guess the way I pose the question is, [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3094.8399999999997s)]
*  how do we change VR from being a novelty to a necessity? [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3097.48s)]
*  We have to really double down on content [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3102.64s)]
*  in a way that can really extrapolate the power of VR. [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3105.18s)]
*  Because if we look at, say, the consumer VR market, [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3109.3999999999996s)]
*  what you're competing with is not us. [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3112.48s)]
*  You're competing with Fortnite. [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3114.58s)]
*  You're competing with your console, your PlayStation 5, [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3116.48s)]
*  your mobile phone. [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3120.5s)]
*  Does someone entering their home want to put on their headset before anything else? [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3121.92s)]
*  So to do that, you're going to have to have a 10x content [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3126.3s)]
*  that can drive people to really want to put on their headset [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3129.62s)]
*  the moment they get home. [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3132.0s)]
*  And that's a very hard thing to do, [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3133.0s)]
*  but I feel like over time we'll get there. [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3134.86s)]
*  But it has to be a content that's just really native to VR, [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3138.2s)]
*  that cannot be replicated across the phone or the PC or the TV screen. [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3141.0s)]
*  And I think people have been trying to figure out what that is, [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3146.5s)]
*  and eventually they're going to get it, [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3148.46s)]
*  and more people will start using consumer VR headsets. [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3150.32s)]
*  When I think about how we're positioned, [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3153.48s)]
*  like out of home VR, say, compared to in-home VR, [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3156.0800000000004s)]
*  I think what we're seeing is the evolution of accessibility in consumer VR. [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3160.02s)]
*  You're seeing that VR headsets are not being plugged into the PC anymore. [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3165.52s)]
*  Consumer headsets are being very lightweighted. [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3170.1400000000003s)]
*  And over time, just might be a headset that you can actually take outside [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3172.34s)]
*  and go wherever you go, very highly accessible. [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3175.48s)]
*  Now, to do that, which is fine, is they sacrifice immersion, [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3178.2799999999997s)]
*  like deep immersion for it, [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3182.08s)]
*  which might be okay for the product lines you're building. [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3184.18s)]
*  For us, we're going to double down on immersion. [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3186.7999999999997s)]
*  We're going to make it as real as we can [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3189.14s)]
*  and just do a lot of tricks in our bags we haven't used yet. [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3191.08s)]
*  So if you want to have a great experience with your friends or family [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3194.8399999999997s)]
*  and to be really absorbed in the world, that's where Sandbox lives. [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3199.8399999999997s)]
*  That's interesting because you're basically saying [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3205.24s)]
*  that you don't feel like you're competing directly with an Oculus, for example. [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3206.9s)]
*  You're competing, actually, as we discussed before, [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3211.9s)]
*  more so with the movie theater. [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3214.02s)]
*  Would you say that's an accurate depiction? [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3216.52s)]
*  Yeah, we're definitely in the out-of-home realm [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3219.02s)]
*  that is different from what the knees are in home, [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3221.42s)]
*  which kind of makes sense because when you think about out of home, [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3225.4s)]
*  the audience and knees are different, right? [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3229.36s)]
*  Usually when it's out of home, it's like you want to invite other people to go with you. [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3231.96s)]
*  There might be a reason to go, [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3236.06s)]
*  and you really want to cater to that reason and make it really worthwhile. [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3238.06s)]
*  And whatever you have that's out of home must be 10x of what you can get at home. [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3241.82s)]
*  Otherwise, people will just do this at home. [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3246.52s)]
*  So you can say movie theaters, [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3249.82s)]
*  but to a degree, it's any type of experiential that's outside. [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3251.66s)]
*  But I wouldn't say it's directly in competition. [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3255.96s)]
*  I say it's more like we're working together to just bring people outside. [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3258.92s)]
*  And if we know anything about the pandemic, [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3263.06s)]
*  that is really important for people to go out and socialize. [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3265.28s)]
*  I agree, and I love that you're adding to the matrix of things [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3269.5200000000004s)]
*  that you can do with friends, [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3272.76s)]
*  which aren't just eating and drinking. [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3274.96s)]
*  And that's been a little qualm of mine recently, [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3277.0800000000004s)]
*  which is when I look at what I do with my friends, [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3279.32s)]
*  and I think many people are similar, [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3281.96s)]
*  that's the tendency is to just go, [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3284.78s)]
*  hey, let's go for dinner, let's go for drinks. [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3287.1600000000003s)]
*  I also grew up loving games [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3288.98s)]
*  and loving the activity of solving a problem with friends [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3290.6200000000003s)]
*  or doing a sport with friends. [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3294.26s)]
*  And I've found as I got older, [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3296.0800000000004s)]
*  that became either less available or just less obvious, [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3297.96s)]
*  less of the habit that people had. [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3301.6600000000003s)]
*  And so I love that this is an opportunity [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3304.42s)]
*  to venture back into that realm in person. [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3306.46s)]
*  But I think recently I saw a number [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3310.0200000000004s)]
*  where Sandbox has sold maybe a million tickets in the last year or so. [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3311.92s)]
*  What do you think it would take for Sandbox to go from 1 million to 10 million [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3317.5600000000004s)]
*  or even 100 million in a year? [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3321.46s)]
*  Is it just the content matrix that you mentioned before, [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3323.48s)]
*  or is it some other thing? [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3326.06s)]
*  Maybe it's the generation that grows up with Sandbox, [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3327.82s)]
*  maybe it's the price point. [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3330.62s)]
*  What do you think it would take to 10x the business? [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3332.48s)]
*  For us, it's just getting more locations, [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3334.92s)]
*  because at the end of the day, [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3337.36s)]
*  it's a retail business that's constrained by space and time. [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3338.76s)]
*  So as long as we can solve that, [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3341.86s)]
*  then we can have more people playing Sandbox. [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3344.12s)]
*  And with more people playing Sandbox, [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3346.36s)]
*  we can have the acceleration that we need. [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3347.86s)]
*  And what we basically need to convince people to build for Sandbox [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3350.54s)]
*  is to show that first, this is a great product [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3353.98s)]
*  that people love all over the world. [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3356.22s)]
*  And that is a very great business for people to run [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3358.64s)]
*  that can generate a healthy return. [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3361.62s)]
*  I'm curious to know throughout the journey [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3363.48s)]
*  from when you first started Sandbox to today, [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3365.08s)]
*  which were different places, [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3368.72s)]
*  are you surprised by anything? [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3370.72s)]
*  Have you seen anything in the consumer behavior, [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3372.34s)]
*  the buying behavior, [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3375.38s)]
*  the way that people interact with the product itself [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3377.2599999999998s)]
*  that has surprised you in terms of, [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3380.66s)]
*  you know, this is a little different to my original vision, [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3383.2999999999997s)]
*  but I'm leading into this, [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3385.6s)]
*  and it's helping me build my business in a better way. [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3386.9399999999996s)]
*  When we first started, [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3389.74s)]
*  we thought that we created, say, a VR escape room, [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3390.8999999999996s)]
*  that that was going to be the extent of what we built, [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3394.1s)]
*  and that it turns out that, [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3397.14s)]
*  I guess, it's more of a product [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3400.7999999999997s)]
*  that is shared on many different occasions. [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3403.74s)]
*  We've seen people hold bachelor and bachelor parties. [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3406.56s)]
*  We've seen, obviously, birthdays, people out of town, [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3409.46s)]
*  people just want to, you know, date nice. [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3412.98s)]
*  It's just a lot of reason to use Sandbox [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3415.72s)]
*  as a way to have fun and celebrate. [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3417.92s)]
*  We even done a wedding proposal for a couple in Sandbox [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3421.16s)]
*  because that's when they first met. [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3426.16s)]
*  They actually went and played in Sandbox. [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3427.86s)]
*  So it became kind of like a conduit for people [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3429.96s)]
*  to really meet and have a great time [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3434.02s)]
*  and get to know one another. [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3435.04s)]
*  So that was really surprising for us. [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3436.84s)]
*  And I think another facet that we found surprising [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3439.18s)]
*  was when we did the highlight videos, [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3441.84s)]
*  we thought, great, this is something [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3443.72s)]
*  that will work really well. [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3445.02s)]
*  People share on Facebook. [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3446.32s)]
*  You know, I'm at that generation [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3447.98s)]
*  where Facebook is still a big deal to me. [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3449.04s)]
*  Nowadays, people are splicing our videos [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3450.82s)]
*  and putting it on TikTok, [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3453.38s)]
*  and we're getting like 10 million views to 15 million views. [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3454.68s)]
*  And it turns out that what we created [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3457.68s)]
*  was sort of an expression [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3460.62s)]
*  that they can use to showcase themselves [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3462.64s)]
*  and the light that they have. [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3466.5s)]
*  And we're like, wow, we can really provide more of that [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3468.4s)]
*  over time and how we can really amplify that. [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3472.2599999999998s)]
*  Yeah, and I love that that was such an early addition [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3474.7999999999997s)]
*  to the Sandbox product. [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3478.0s)]
*  And so it's fascinating to see how that's continued on [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3480.14s)]
*  throughout so many years. [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3483.44s)]
*  Yeah, like we couldn't have done that [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3484.74s)]
*  without that trial period of running out of money [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3486.14s)]
*  and figuring out how can we get people to come to a location [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3490.06s)]
*  that has no foot traffic. [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3493.58s)]
*  So constraint breeds creativity. [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3494.92s)]
*  I think that's a great place to end off, [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3497.06s)]
*  but I will give you the mic, Steve, [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3498.66s)]
*  if there's anything else that you want to mention, [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3500.2799999999997s)]
*  maybe particularly for founders who are in those early stages, [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3502.46s)]
*  they may be hitting similar roadblocks. [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3505.86s)]
*  They may be asking the question [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3507.58s)]
*  of whether they should continue on, [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3509.96s)]
*  whether they should pivot. [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3511.42s)]
*  And I think, again, your story is just so emblematic [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3512.52s)]
*  of what the startup journey can be like [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3515.96s)]
*  versus from the outside, it can look like an overnight success. [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3518.7799999999997s)]
*  So yeah, any final parting thoughts there? [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3522.38s)]
*  From my experience, I think sometimes kind of throwing, [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3524.96s)]
*  let's say, spaghetti on the wall [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3529.38s)]
*  is something that some founders might do, [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3531.12s)]
*  trying to figure things out. [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3533.46s)]
*  To a degree, that's important, [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3535.18s)]
*  but once there's enough conviction behind it, [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3536.7599999999998s)]
*  the need to be able to grind and persevere [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3539.98s)]
*  on a few focused area, [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3542.68s)]
*  I can't stress how important that is. [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3545.36s)]
*  I mean, when I think about us, pre-product market, [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3548.0s)]
*  I mean, there were a lot of things we could have done. [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3551.78s)]
*  We could have like amplified our hardware. [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3553.88s)]
*  We could have made better design on our store. [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3556.0s)]
*  We thought those were cool, but those aren't game changing. [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3560.58s)]
*  We had to figure out how do we get people to come to our store [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3563.9s)]
*  without foot traffic, right? [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3566.98s)]
*  That was one place that we doubled down on [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3569.5s)]
*  and we created a shareable experience, [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3572.2400000000002s)]
*  like a highlight video, [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3575.24s)]
*  because it was very easy for us to just stop at a photo. [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3576.2599999999998s)]
*  It's easy to take a photo, but we thought, no, [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3580.7599999999998s)]
*  we have to do something the world has never seen before. [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3583.24s)]
*  So we had to do not just a video, [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3586.24s)]
*  but a video that's the places real life with VR. [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3588.14s)]
*  But that's not good enough because we also have to dig deeper [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3592.16s)]
*  and find what are the biggest elements [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3595.24s)]
*  that people would react the most to, right? [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3597.9399999999996s)]
*  And so we created a game based on those elements [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3600.9599999999996s)]
*  and we captured those elements. [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3603.04s)]
*  And we thought, that's not good enough. [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3604.56s)]
*  We have to be able to, once you've seen the video, [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3606.04s)]
*  make sure that you can download the video right away. [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3609.54s)]
*  So that level of depth on that one facet [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3612.06s)]
*  was critical to our success. [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3615.6s)]
*  So that was our pre-product market phase. [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3617.64s)]
*  And during the pandemic was the post-product market phase [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3619.5s)]
*  where we've learned that there's only a few levers [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3623.24s)]
*  that really changes the profit margin of the business. [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3626.9s)]
*  It's just figuring out what those levers are [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3629.84s)]
*  and just doubling down on it in a very deep way [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3631.66s)]
*  to get the margins up. [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3634.68s)]
*  And I think that's really important in an environment like today [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3636.46s)]
*  when fundraising is really hard [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3638.66s)]
*  and getting to profitability is key for companies. [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3640.12s)]
*  I think I heard you say in another interview [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3644.22s)]
*  that your locations are profitable, [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3646.3599999999997s)]
*  or at least when you're opening up new locations. [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3649.12s)]
*  And to me, that's really impressive [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3650.8599999999997s)]
*  because I think if people were to guess [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3652.06s)]
*  based on the scope of the business, [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3654.06s)]
*  even though that you're many years in, [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3656.2599999999998s)]
*  that with all the hardware required, [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3657.58s)]
*  that it wouldn't be profitable. [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3660.12s)]
*  But is that right? [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3661.18s)]
*  Yeah, every location that we open up [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3662.12s)]
*  in about within two months of operations are profitable. [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3664.12s)]
*  There are some locations that the profit margin [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3667.42s)]
*  is comparable to a software company. [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3669.92s)]
*  That's incredible. [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3671.92s)]
*  And I think for us, the reason why I think we're able to do that [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3673.16s)]
*  is we've created a product that people didn't know they want [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3678.3599999999997s)]
*  and we're able to charge a price point [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3683.16s)]
*  that we felt like was fitting to the product. [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3685.66s)]
*  It's $50 to $60 per person per ticket. [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3687.42s)]
*  But when we look online and people ask about the price, [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3690.26s)]
*  it's totally worth it. [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3692.86s)]
*  Yeah, as we talked about before, [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3694.38s)]
*  this idea of an in-person VR experience [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3696.26s)]
*  that wasn't a comparable category. [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3699.76s)]
*  And so you got to set the pricing terms for that category [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3702.32s)]
*  based on the value you delivered. [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3705.86s)]
*  And honestly, I'm sure you've done a bunch of testing on this, [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3707.2200000000003s)]
*  but it wouldn't surprise me if you could charge $80 or $100 [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3710.5600000000004s)]
*  for a visit because it does feel fundamentally different [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3714.1800000000003s)]
*  than, let's say, a $20 movie experience. [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3716.5200000000004s)]
*  For us, it was a very organic process. [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3719.58s)]
*  We started at $30, and then during the weekend, [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3721.98s)]
*  it was booked out two, three weeks in advance. [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3724.86s)]
*  So we try to control the volume and we adjust it. [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3726.82s)]
*  And it kind of peaked around $38, $40, [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3729.96s)]
*  and then the pandemic happened. [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3732.86s)]
*  And then we made all these changes to the product, [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3734.56s)]
*  and then when the world reopened up again, [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3737.08s)]
*  we've seen the same pattern, [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3739.12s)]
*  but now we're able to organically adjust it to $50 to $60. [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3740.18s)]
*  And to us, the way we think about our product [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3744.16s)]
*  is we want to create a $1,000 product. [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3746.32s)]
*  That's kind of like the direction, [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3749.0s)]
*  and if they're paying like $60 for it, [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3750.8s)]
*  then it's a great time for them. [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3753.2400000000002s)]
*  So that is kind of how we're thinking and how we're iterating, [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3755.54s)]
*  is how do you create something that's so valuable [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3758.98s)]
*  that they think they're getting a good deal as they try Sandbox? [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3761.44s)]
*  Absolutely, and you're seeing that [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3765.28s)]
*  based on the bookings being completely full. [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3766.6s)]
*  And I'm sure people are going to be very excited to see [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3769.8s)]
*  what happens with your new Squid Game partnership, [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3772.58s)]
*  so we can look forward to that. [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3774.68s)]
*  Yeah, we can't wait. [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku3WblzI-OU&t=3776.2400000000002s)]
