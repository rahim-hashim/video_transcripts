# The Road to Autonomous Vehicles: Are We There Yet?
**The a16z Podcast:** [June 22, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTvlFko51YE)
*  We are in San Francisco. We're not taking you to some, you know, a little test facility in a desert to show you that [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTvlFko51YE&t=0.0s)]
*  Most vibrant cities in the planet, that's where we are in the journey. We're fully autonomous where we need to be [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTvlFko51YE&t=11.4s)]
*  Self-driving is here. I think if I was a human driving there like I don't know what would happen [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTvlFko51YE&t=17.16s)]
*  And you're asking me doesn't get boring for you afterward [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTvlFko51YE&t=22.36s)]
*  I love seeing your excitement and we are not the only ones who have noticed that get just noticing that we don't have a driver [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTvlFko51YE&t=25.16s)]
*  I love seeing so many people when they look inside [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTvlFko51YE&t=31.68s)]
*  Today I got to ride fully autonomously with Waymo's chief product officer Saswat Panigrahi [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTvlFko51YE&t=37.44s)]
*  Who's actually been on this journey since 2016? [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTvlFko51YE&t=44.120000000000005s)]
*  We discussed so much [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTvlFko51YE&t=47.68s)]
*  Including the five levels of autonomy [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTvlFko51YE&t=50.0s)]
*  Fully autonomous as you can see nobody in the front seat no expectation of a human to take over [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTvlFko51YE&t=52.0s)]
*  the infamous lidar versus video debate saying you love lidars and hate cameras or vice versa is saying you love one wavelength [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTvlFko51YE&t=57.44s)]
*  Versus the other wavelength right? It's not a fundamental thing [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTvlFko51YE&t=66.12s)]
*  Regulation user experience the role of AI in all this but especially the question if autonomy is truly here [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTvlFko51YE&t=69.64s)]
*  Now what? [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTvlFko51YE&t=79.68s)]
