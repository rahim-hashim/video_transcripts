# Unlocking Creativity with Prompt Engineering
**The a16z Podcast:** [March 09, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk)
*  It's still quite hard to describe things with words. Designers, yeah, when they go and work, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=0.0s)]
*  when they do work for clients, like it's one of their pet peeves because clients are like, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=4.08s)]
*  they don't like it, but they can't explain why. With every new technology, some jobs are lost, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=8.24s)]
*  while others are gained. And while people often focus on the former, in this episode, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=12.64s)]
*  we're highlighting the ladder, a highly creative role that emerges alongside AI, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=16.56s)]
*  the prompt engineer. Until AI can close the loop of its own, each tool still requires a set of [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=21.2s)]
*  prompts. And just like a composer feeds an instrument a set of notes to play, a prompt [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=26.08s)]
*  engineer feeds the AI a map of what to produce. And if we know anything from music, it's that [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=30.72s)]
*  composing great music takes great skill. So in this episode, we dive into the emerging [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=35.519999999999996s)]
*  importance of prompting, the early learnings and how to do it effectively, and also where this [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=39.68s)]
*  field might be heading. And we do so with Guy Parsons. Guy has been an early mover on the [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=44.239999999999995s)]
*  text image AI space, having written the Dolly 2 prompt book in July of last year. So will the [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=48.72s)]
*  prompt engineer be more like the highly sought after DevOps engineer, or a proficiency like [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=53.68s)]
*  Excel that you find on every resume? Listen in to hear Guy's take. By the way, we're thinking of [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=58.24s)]

*  Guy, welcome to the show. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=98.96s)]
*  Thank you for having me. I'm excited to be here. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=100.08s)]
*  Let's take a step back. When we originally reached out to you, it was around six months [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=101.76s)]
*  ago, and you had just written something called your prompt book. Why don't you give everyone [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=105.68s)]
*  a little bit of an idea of what that prompt book was, what it is now, and also what prompted you [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=110.48s)]
*  to want to write it in the first place? This was in the initial heyday of Galley 2, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=116.48s)]
*  which was like OpenAI's text to image model. They rolled it out to a few test people at a time. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=121.84s)]
*  They were super cautious about how it might be misused, how it could end up having a backlash, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=129.76s)]
*  all these kinds of things, which then only increased the sense of people wanting to get [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=135.92s)]
*  their hands on this thing. At the time, this was pre things you might think of now, stable diffusion, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=140.39999999999998s)]
*  mid-journey predated those by some small margin and seemed way ahead of anything people had tried [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=146.23999999999998s)]
*  using before. If you've used a text to image AI by now, you know it's basically a text box. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=152.88s)]
*  It all comes down to what you type in. It doesn't have buttons and all the kind of controls you [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=158.79999999999998s)]
*  might expect when you log into something like Photoshop. The question then becomes a lot of [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=163.84s)]
*  people, once mine goes blank, or you don't actually know the name or the words of what you're trying [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=168.72s)]
*  to type in. If you've actually been to art school or you're up on your art history or your design [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=174.72s)]
*  language, then you've probably got a head start on everyone else. On places like Twitter and Reddit, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=180.88s)]
*  there are people posting these amazing images, but because of the nature of social media, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=185.52s)]
*  it's all lost. I started trying to collect these cool examples and these cool terms people were [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=189.28s)]
*  using to create these amazing visual effects. I started putting everything in essentially a [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=194.4s)]
*  slide deck. By the time I'd copied and pasted all these cool things, I'd seen there was 80, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=199.52s)]
*  100 slides long, something like that. Then I rather grandly called it a book and shared it [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=203.76s)]
*  online. It's just a jumping off point for people to realize the kind of stuff at the time that these [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=210.32s)]
*  were just about becoming capable of. Obviously, now the capabilities are even more advanced. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=215.04s)]
*  Definitely. We'll get into that because within six months, it's crazy to see how these tools, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=222.07999999999998s)]
*  the way people are using these tools, how that's all changed in a matter of, again, just six months, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=227.76s)]
*  it feels like yesterday when we didn't even have access to this. This idea that these are tools, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=232.88s)]
*  and just like any other tool, person A versus person B may not get the same result. They may [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=237.92s)]
*  not have the same understanding of how to leverage the tool. Before we get into maybe the tips and [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=243.84s)]
*  tricks that you've learned, I just want to give the audience a broad sense of how much time you've [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=250.0s)]
*  spent within the bowels of mid-journey, dolly, stable diffusion. If you could give an estimate, [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=255.52s)]
*  how much time do you think you've spent mastering this idea of prompting? [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=262.8s)]
*  I wouldn't say I'm a master in any sense. It's so engaging and interesting to experiment with these [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=267.12s)]
*  tools. In the last six months, sure, a couple of hundred hours. What I really admire is people [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=275.68s)]
*  that are using these tools to create this real body of work where they really pursue a direction [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=281.6s)]
*  to discover what's possible. I saw a thread where I think it's in mid-journey, you can get it to tell [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=289.76s)]
*  how many prompts you've ever done. There are people in the thousands, hundreds of thousands. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=295.44s)]
*  I appreciate how humble you are, but I think it's one of those scenarios where again, we're [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=301.03999999999996s)]
*  six months in. A parallel is when there's a new coding language and then you see people write [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=305.03999999999996s)]
*  job descriptions for developers looking for someone with five years experience when that [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=311.03999999999996s)]
*  particular language has only been around for six months or a year. Yes, I don't think anyone could [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=315.28s)]
*  definitively say they're an expert in prompt engineering, partially because it's only been [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=320.88s)]
*  around for so long, but I do think you've at least shared a lot more than the average person [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=324.8s)]
*  in this space. Given your experience with these tools, I'm curious if you see a parallel skill [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=330.56s)]
*  set where you can compare prompt engineering to. Is it similar to learning to code? Is it similar [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=336.64s)]
*  to being able to storytell effectively? Is it similar to being able to process numbers in an [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=342.40000000000003s)]
*  Excel sheet? Is there a parallel skill set where it reminds you of something you've done before? [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=349.36s)]
*  I think there was an era, I don't know if we're still in it, where there was a certain category [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=356.16s)]
*  of person who could consider themselves good at Googling stuff. Do you know that there's this [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=360.16s)]
*  thing where you can type in file type this and find this thing? There's this big debate over whether [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=366.0s)]
*  especially in text to image, is there really any artistry to it? For me, I'm not so sure because [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=371.44s)]
*  I'm no artist, but there's definitely something. It's almost about discovering an image that's [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=377.84000000000003s)]
*  already out there. You've just got to find the words that summon it forth as if you're navigating [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=382.56s)]
*  an infinite Pinterest of things that haven't quite existed until you manifested them. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=388.32000000000005s)]
*  To that point, we have so much information online. I feel like that is a skill set even [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=393.84000000000003s)]
*  before these AI tools. I used to work on a product called Trends and that really was about using the [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=398.16s)]
*  right tools like subreddit stats or hrefs or other data sets online and learning to parse them and [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=403.44s)]
*  learning to surface what other people find interesting. Let's get into the nitty gritty. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=409.44s)]
*  You wrote this prompt book, you've been playing around with these tools for quite some time. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=415.2s)]
*  Are there certain learnings, maybe the 80-20 approach of becoming a good prompt engineer [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=418.8s)]
*  in terms of things that you think are really valuable to understand? Maybe it's the prompt [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=425.04s)]
*  length. Maybe it's using certain modifiers within your prompt. Maybe it's just a framework for [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=430.08s)]
*  thinking about prompting. Is there anything that's surfaced that you think would be really [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=436.08s)]
*  valuable to someone who's just starting out with prompting? [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=439.76s)]
*  I think if you've never used one before, the best way to explain how they work is to always describe [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=443.03999999999996s)]
*  something as if it already exists. Imagine that it's an image in some kind of downloadable clipart [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=450.79999999999995s)]
*  library or it's on a photography gallery and someone's written underneath, [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=457.76000000000005s)]
*  oh, this is a fine example of a modern photography shot. Those are the kind of [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=464.40000000000003s)]
*  descriptions that you're trying to mimic to tell these kind of tools what you're looking for. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=470.0s)]
*  It also gives it a natural sense of why these tools are bad at some things and the kind of [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=476.24s)]
*  prompts that don't really work. If there's an archive image of some women celebrating [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=481.76s)]
*  on the steps of a church in 1972, it would have that kind of caption, but they never go, [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=490.8s)]
*  the woman on the left is wearing a yellow hat. The woman on the right is wearing a red hat. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=499.03999999999996s)]
*  They just don't go into that because you can see it. Ironically, they often describe generally [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=505.03999999999996s)]
*  what the image is about, but not how you would draw it step by step. That's why these tools are [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=509.6s)]
*  less good at saying, I want this thing over here and then that thing next to it and then something [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=515.0400000000001s)]
*  on top. That thing should be much bigger because in the real life, that's not how images are [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=519.36s)]
*  described in language. That's a really good point, though, because that's how these AIs were trained. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=524.32s)]
*  I think Dali trained on 600-plus million images and they're using that alt text from online of [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=528.72s)]
*  saying, again, that descriptor. I've never thought about it that way, but actually training yourself [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=534.0s)]
*  to become a good prompter by reviewing the inputs to the tool, which I've never done this before, [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=539.2s)]
*  but I can imagine someone literally going online and reading the alt text on different images and [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=546.96s)]
*  going, ah, this is how this was described. This is how an AI might interpret my future prompt. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=551.0400000000001s)]
*  I think to your point also, it's something that I've learned from my very limited set of prompting, [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=556.24s)]
*  is just the level of detail that you need with your prompt. When I first started, I'm like, [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=560.0s)]
*  monkey wearing a hat. You don't even realize until you start prompting the many iterations [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=565.84s)]
*  that could come from that. You have one image in your head, but then you get back all of these [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=571.36s)]
*  different results and then you end up looking on different prompt search engines or libraries [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=576.24s)]
*  and seeing what other people are doing. You're like, this prompt is like 200 words. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=581.9200000000001s)]
*  I would have never thought to do that. For now, yeah. I think there's something to be said. I think [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=586.5600000000001s)]
*  the longer they are, there's definitely diminishing returns. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=592.24s)]
*  As I went through your prompt book, there were so many different ways that you could describe a [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=596.4s)]
*  shot. You could say a different camera angle. You could say a time period, as you just spoke to. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=600.24s)]
*  You could say a specific type of artistry or even a specific artist. I know there's some controversy [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=606.08s)]
*  around using specific artists' work to train your new images, but let's look forward to today. I [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=611.76s)]
*  feel like as we talked about, six months later, these tools have evolved a lot. Are there any [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=618.8s)]
*  different ways that you can prompt today or leverage these tools that didn't exist six [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=624.24s)]
*  months ago that are really important and maybe extending the way that you can use them? [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=630.3199999999999s)]
*  Paul Anthony 100%. The main one, and these things are changing over time, [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=634.8s)]
*  I might say, but now there's increasingly tools where you can prompt with an image. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=639.8399999999999s)]
*  Again, that's almost like an entire new field of exploration because it's not combining the image [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=644.56s)]
*  with your words in the way you would expect something like Photoshop to do it. It's not [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=652.56s)]
*  collaging them together. The results can be really surprising, really unexpected, [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=659.5999999999999s)]
*  probably quite difficult to control. But then you potentially have interesting opportunities like, [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=664.16s)]
*  okay, I can make a load of abstract stuff using my brand colors or something that's important to me, [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=669.12s)]
*  photos of me, who knows? Then I'm going to use that and multiply that baseline, that visual base [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=676.64s)]
*  with custom other prompts. Then everything will have this lightness. Then of course, [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=683.76s)]
*  the big thing that happened since the days of the prompt book and so on was that huge spike in [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=689.6s)]
*  interest in selfies, like the lenses and the profile picture.ai. There were a dozen of them, [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=695.2s)]
*  which was just prompting with your face, basically. Prompting with 20 selfies and being like, [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=702.5600000000001s)]
*  yeah, I want to see more of this guy because it's me, obviously. Then within the image to image [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=708.1600000000001s)]
*  space, you've now got other startups that are doing interesting things where, okay, give us [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=713.9200000000001s)]
*  10 core images and that will generate you infinite versions of that based on the modifiers that you [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=718.0s)]
*  want to see. There's all kinds of that. That's a really interesting space that's going to [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=723.44s)]
*  probably power the next generation of how people, especially consumers, interact with these products. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=727.36s)]
*  One way that maybe you could put it is that when we first got access to these tools, you were really [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=733.84s)]
*  starting from scratch. You didn't even have the prompt libraries available to you. You were just [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=738.6400000000001s)]
*  like, okay, I have this image in my head. But today, you not only have those libraries, you also have [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=742.72s)]
*  images that you can input. You're not starting from scratch. You have a baseline of, as you said, [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=747.36s)]
*  maybe it's brand colors, maybe it's a certain style. Instead of having to articulate that [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=751.68s)]
*  yourself, you can just say, hey, here's what I want. But to your point, sometimes it's hard to [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=756.8s)]
*  control because you're trying to say something to the AI. You're trying to say, I want this output. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=762.9599999999999s)]
*  You don't always get it. Something I want to ask you about is how you've learned to rein that in, [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=768.64s)]
*  to really get a higher throughput of images that you want versus images you don't want over time, [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=775.04s)]
*  because something that's interesting about these AIs is that they are a little bit of a black box. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=780.96s)]
*  You can't understand every little piece that went from your input to your output. You can't find two [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=786.0s)]
*  in it in the same ways as maybe some other skills that we've learned in the past. How have you learned [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=793.9200000000001s)]
*  to actually become a better prompt engineer given that black box nature? I think another aspect is [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=798.72s)]
*  you and I both type in the same thing. It's not going to make the same picture because it starts [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=804.08s)]
*  from this random cloud of noise and your cloud of noise is different to mine. Then it's slowly [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=810.72s)]
*  turning these clouds more and more into something that looks like orangutan in a tuxedo. That's [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=816.1600000000001s)]
*  really frustrating when you're testing things because was it good or did you just get lucky? [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=822.8000000000001s)]
*  Alternatively, if you're not seeing what you expected, should you just hit it again and again? [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=828.8000000000001s)]
*  Then when you see someone else has made something really cool, did they do something really clever [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=833.76s)]
*  or is it like a persistence? I have found myself in that exact spot where I [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=836.88s)]
*  have an idea for what I want. It's not something that is super important where I need to nail it. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=843.2s)]
*  I just need it close enough and I'm getting these results and they're getting a little closer and [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=848.96s)]
*  closer and closer. I have found myself in that spot where I'm just like, let's just generate it [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=853.2s)]
*  again. If I do this enough times, I'll eventually get to something that's workable. Do you have any [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=858.08s)]
*  thoughts there in terms of how you don't end up in that spot where you're just hoping [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=863.52s)]
*  for a better image? You're pulling the AI slot machine, if you will? [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=869.36s)]
*  No. I think unless you've seen, unless you have evidence and I think over time, [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=874.4s)]
*  there will be more. I think it's why some of these other tools and communities are so important, [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=879.92s)]
*  where you see lots of other people's work. If you can see someone else has done it, then you're like, [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=885.68s)]
*  okay, I know. Ideally, you can also see the prompt they use and work out how they did it. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=890.48s)]
*  Even if not, then you're like, okay, I can get there. Also, you run into these things where [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=896.0s)]
*  you think it's the most simple thing and then you're like, it doesn't know what a hot dog is. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=900.8s)]
*  It just doesn't understand the rules of what physically can and can't that look like. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=907.28s)]
*  You're like, try again. It's like now the sausage is at right angle and the [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=914.88s)]
*  bun has ears because it's starting to throw in some dashed aesthetics. Then you're like, [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=919.52s)]
*  minus, minus, no, no dashing. That's the limitation of where the technology [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=927.04s)]
*  is at the moment, which is it's amazing until you're trying to do something very specific. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=931.92s)]
*  Especially if you want to do something very specific, this also to a very high [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=938.0799999999999s)]
*  or professional standard. Well, I'm glad you even mentioned the negative queries. That's something [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=943.52s)]
*  I think a lot of people don't know is that you can say, hey, AI, I don't want this. It doesn't [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=947.6s)]
*  always manage to still generate what you're looking for, but there's also almost these glitches. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=952.24s)]
*  One of them that is infamous now is hands. You can generate these beautiful images of these [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=958.08s)]
*  Instagram looking models and you can put them in all these different backgrounds and you're like, [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=964.24s)]
*  wow, this is amazing. Then it's always like, well, look at the hands, which is kind of funny. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=969.28s)]
*  I feel like it's the perfect manifestation of how technology always is much better in one direction [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=973.52s)]
*  when it's invented, but there's always these things that need to be iterated on. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=980.0s)]
*  Are there other things worth knowing about, whether it's these negative prompts, whether it's [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=985.28s)]
*  these glitches that are still in the matrix? What would you call out from your, again, [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=990.56s)]
*  many hours of being deep in these tools? I think it depends on the model. One example [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=994.64s)]
*  was when Dali came out, it's not very good at understanding that it's drawing things in a square. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=999.68s)]
*  So if you're drawing a person, it's often going to have its feet and its head cut off because it's [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=1004.24s)]
*  seeing those in portrait photos. But one thing you could do with Dali is you can actually upload [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=1009.84s)]
*  an image to do variations of. And if you upload an image that's just a little white border, [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=1015.04s)]
*  then it knows that nothing can go there. And that kind of encourages it, forces it to kind of think [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=1020.48s)]
*  inside the box, if you will. But then of course, you have now tools like Mid Journey, who've been [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=1026.48s)]
*  iterating on their text to image model a lot more aggressively than OpenAI, who understandably, [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=1031.44s)]
*  I think maybe have some other things in the cooker, which have now grown that into the model itself. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=1037.76s)]
*  So when you type things in, it knows it's a square and actually it will sometimes do quite clever [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=1044.24s)]
*  things in order to fit it in that space. So if you ask for kind of like a group selfie of three [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=1048.64s)]
*  people, on something like Dali, that's going to be cut off at the end because it's used to seeing [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=1053.1200000000001s)]
*  someone taking like a disposable camera photo. Whereas Mid Journey is clever enough to know that [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=1059.1200000000001s)]
*  one of them kind of needs to be standing behind the other or leaning in from the side. So it's [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=1064.96s)]
*  kind of clever how they've managed to solve that composition problem within the AI, which then, [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=1068.8000000000002s)]
*  you know, the prompt engineering thing, I think, is just understanding the possibilities and the [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=1074.8s)]
*  limitations of where you are at the moment. Meanwhile, there's these other people who are [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=1078.64s)]
*  doing some like very technically serious work to kind of make those limitations kind of no longer [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=1083.76s)]
*  relevant. Yeah. Well, I'm glad you brought up the differences between these different tools. So if [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=1089.44s)]
*  we talk about just stable diffusion, Mid Journey and Dali, I feel like are three that a lot of [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=1094.4s)]
*  people are familiar with. Would you liken the ability to prompt within each of these more like [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=1098.16s)]
*  the difference between Excel and Google Sheets, where if you know how to use Excel, you really [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=1104.88s)]
*  can drop right into Google Sheets and it's relatively straightforward. You might have to [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=1110.3200000000002s)]
*  switch up your shortcuts a little bit or learn one little thing here and there, but for the most part, [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=1114.4s)]
*  you can again drop from one to the other. Or would you liken them more to learning to speak [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=1120.4s)]
*  different languages? It's not that different. I think the principles are like very similar [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=1125.76s)]
*  and then the nuances are slightly different. So I think now if you went from like Dali to Mid Journey, [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=1131.2s)]
*  it would be like amazing. And then if you went back in the other direction, you'd be like, [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=1138.72s)]
*  it doesn't do what I want, but that's because Mid Journey is doing so much of the heavy lifting [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=1142.72s)]
*  to help you make something really good. If you are using the tools to create some like very specific [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=1147.12s)]
*  effect, imagine that I guess you have a very complicated Excel formula that would not have [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=1152.56s)]
*  the exact same output in the other tool because they're trained on a different set of images, [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=1158.1599999999999s)]
*  stable diffusion, I think some 5 billion and then a smaller set of like 12 million for the [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=1165.04s)]
*  what does nice look like, fine tuning that's happened on the top and how they've optimized [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=1170.1599999999999s)]
*  it. They have made different creative decisions there. It's maybe like driving a different car. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=1173.9199999999998s)]
*  Like if you like floor the accelerator and different and then do this in various different [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=1178.48s)]
*  cars, some are going to take off, some are going to trundle along. It's a good analogy. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=1184.08s)]
*  Do you also find that, I mean, we've talked already about this idea where sometimes it's [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=1188.72s)]
*  pretty easy to get to that 80%, but then that final 20%, the real refinement to get to exactly [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=1193.28s)]
*  what you pictured in your head or exactly what you want and didn't picture in your head, [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=1199.36s)]
*  sometimes requires another tool. And so have you found, I've heard some people are using [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=1203.4399999999998s)]
*  Facetune or different AIs to take it to the final level, or I guess you could also use in-painting [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=1208.24s)]
*  and out-painting a little more discreetly. So how have you found the relationship of maybe one tool [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=1214.1599999999999s)]
*  to the suite of other tools that exist out there? I think there's lots of exciting crossovers. Actually, [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=1219.6s)]
*  I kind of think it's a big opportunity for like the Photoshop's of this world, because those are [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=1226.9599999999998s)]
*  tools that presuppose you have some kind of original image to manipulate. Whereas now, [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=1230.96s)]
*  there's a huge amount of raw but maybe not perfect material for people to work with. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=1235.8400000000001s)]
*  There's lots of things also that I've been trying to do in prompting that are actually more easily [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=1241.04s)]
*  achieved in other tools. So you can, you know, spend ages trying to get this kind of vintage [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=1246.24s)]
*  film look. But if you're like an Instagram influencer, you'll know, which I'm sure you are, [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=1250.08s)]
*  but there's loads of iPhone apps that are out there just to like give all your photos that kind [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=1255.44s)]
*  of like dreamy, you know, vintage film look. Yeah. I mean, I think back in July, when you first wrote [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=1261.3600000000001s)]
*  your prompt book, you had a requested feature list for Dolly 2. And I feel like potentially some of [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=1268.16s)]
*  those have been implemented. I haven't cross-referenced them. But are there things [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=1274.08s)]
*  that are on your new list of, hey, these tools are great, but they're missing x, y, z, or they're [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=1278.88s)]
*  lacking in these areas? This would be top of my list to see improved on. You know, I think we're [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=1286.32s)]
*  going to see like more models come out. I mean, the fact that stable diffusion is kind of open [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=1292.88s)]
*  source means that lots of other things are going to be built on top of that. And I think it's going [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=1298.4s)]
*  to be really exciting to see some of the directions that people take that in either kind of on a [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=1302.64s)]
*  individual sort of prosumer level, people building their own models to create their own stuff, [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=1308.1599999999999s)]
*  more likely some bigger organizations, you know, training it for like specific purposes. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=1313.36s)]
*  The whole challenge and the whole opportunity, I think at the moment was like, how do you go [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=1318.6399999999999s)]
*  beyond the text box? How do you go beyond this like just blank rectangle to create something [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=1322.72s)]
*  that is more user-friendly, that's more inspiring, that's more how people think? Because on the one [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=1329.9199999999998s)]
*  hand, if you're not an artist, the ability to describe things with words is definitely a big [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=1336.8s)]
*  step forward. But if you think about the next layer, is it still quite hard to describe [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=1342.1599999999999s)]
*  things with words? Designers, yeah, when they go and work, when they do work for clients, [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=1347.28s)]
*  like it's one of their pet peeves, because clients are like, they don't like it, but they can't [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=1351.44s)]
*  explain why or what they want different. They're like, oh, I want it to be more, [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=1355.84s)]
*  do you know what I mean? Like more, and they're like, I don't know, I don't know what that means, [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=1360.3999999999999s)]
*  which is basically the position these AI models are in. So I think you're going to see, could you [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=1364.4s)]
*  see like a conversational interface? Can you do the generations fast enough that you're always [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=1368.8000000000002s)]
*  showing people multiple options, possible new directions, almost like in a sort of multi-dimensional [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=1373.44s)]
*  space where it's like, do you want to take it more this way or more this way? Part of the prompt book [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=1380.16s)]
*  is, I didn't know what metaphysical painting or code of Chrome or these things were, but those at [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=1384.24s)]
*  least have names. Once you know the name, you're like, oh, that thing, okay, it's cool, I didn't [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=1391.12s)]
*  know it was called that. But there's probably other aesthetics, right? Other styles that we don't have [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=1395.04s)]
*  actually words for. It's like, you know, that kind of gritty, but like modern gritty, like almost like [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=1400.8799999999999s)]
*  shiny gritty, like the grit has a shine on it. And probably I can make you a mood board of that. And [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=1405.6s)]
*  you'd be like, oh yeah, like that's a thing, but there's no word for it. If you can create ways of [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=1410.56s)]
*  unleashing the inexplicable, the undefinable, which is what at the end of the day, like visual [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=1416.72s)]
*  art, that's the exciting thing about visual art is to express things or moods or things that you [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=1423.76s)]
*  can't quite put into words. You totally have my mind spinning thinking of different ideas. A couple [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=1428.8s)]
*  of them that came to mind, one of them is just a better onboarding experience, but one where you're [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=1434.24s)]
*  guiding the new prompter to understand how all these things might fit together to your point, [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=1439.9199999999998s)]
*  like try this. Oh, look at what you got here. Oh, did you notice how when you use these two [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=1444.88s)]
*  prompts together, this one kind of overshadows the other. Maybe there's a third word that's the [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=1449.3600000000001s)]
*  synonym of this. And I think you've kind of done this on your own by just going through and prompting [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=1453.3600000000001s)]
*  like crazy, going through these different prompt libraries and trying to sort through the signal [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=1459.6000000000001s)]
*  from the noise. But I do think any one of these models or maybe something built on top of them [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=1464.48s)]
*  could have just a much better onboarding experience. And then I also, in terms of these [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=1469.44s)]
*  visual styles, I mean, it reminds me of you mentioned Instagram. A lot of Instagram [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=1473.92s)]
*  influencers for a period of time were selling these filters because they had figured out the [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=1478.48s)]
*  precise tuning of every little variable, which sounds easy, but I had tried to do it myself. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=1484.72s)]
*  I never managed to create good lightroom filters, but people had and they would sell them. And so [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=1491.52s)]
*  I wonder if you'll see the same thing where maybe someone creates a zip file of a mood board and [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=1496.64s)]
*  then they train the AI in some way that does make it, I guess, play nice with that particular [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=1503.04s)]
*  concept that you can't distill necessarily into a single term. Someone did a paper on it. And I [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=1508.6399999999999s)]
*  think it's almost kind of what led to that selfie craze, which was you don't need to put photos of [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=1513.84s)]
*  Steph in that original 600 million training data or wait for the next time we do that again for it [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=1518.24s)]
*  to teach it what you look like. There's this kind of embedding trick where you can show it like a [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=1524.96s)]
*  bunch of photos of you and then you can refer to you as, and it knows how to recreate that. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=1531.04s)]
*  And there was also an interesting thing in the same paper, but it hasn't really been used or [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=1535.84s)]
*  commercialized in the same way, which is to do that with style. So rather than show it, yeah, [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=1540.24s)]
*  this is what this person looks like. It's like, this is what the style of blah, blah, blah is [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=1545.36s)]
*  called. Here it is. And then off you go, which obviously has all kinds of potentially shady [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=1548.56s)]
*  legal connotations. But let's assume this is all lovely art we've made ourselves. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=1553.12s)]
*  To the idea of honing in a style, I do wish there was a version of the product where I could go and [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=1558.48s)]
*  like we've talked about, maybe upload certain brand images or certain brand colors, and then have it [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=1565.6000000000001s)]
*  iterate with me where it shows me a bunch of images. And I say, it's okay, but I want a little [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=1570.72s)]
*  more of this color. I want it X, Y, or Z. And then we keep doing that to the point where I get a bunch [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=1575.68s)]
*  of images where I'm like, yes, this is the style. You can lock that in. You lock it into a variable [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=1581.3600000000001s)]
*  that you can then plug into future prompts. There's some people out there that have like [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=1586.08s)]
*  some people that have been like sharing it to do themselves. They've like managed to like lock in [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=1590.3999999999999s)]
*  like a particular look. And now like every blog post they have on their lovely, you know, [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=1593.76s)]
*  content marketing thing is like, oh, it's always the same kind of thing. And that's like pretty [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=1598.48s)]
*  cool. But we haven't seen that always built into the like foundation models yet as like a way of [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=1602.56s)]
*  interacting with it. And then there are some a couple like a few startups like Scenario, [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=1608.32s)]
*  which is doing it for like game assets. And then like Leonardo, which is like more multi-purpose, [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=1613.44s)]
*  I think, or is just positioning itself that way, which is again all about, can you like control [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=1618.24s)]
*  things down to like consistent look? What we've talked about so far is this idea of controlling [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=1624.0800000000002s)]
*  the AI. But I also like to think about the ways that when you work with these different models, [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=1629.2s)]
*  you learn more about whether it's art, learn more about your own creativity or how you think about [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=1634.0800000000002s)]
*  these images. So the example that it reminds me of is in chess when we finally built the bots [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=1640.48s)]
*  that were better than humans in chess. Not only were we surprised by the fact that that could [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=1648.08s)]
*  happen, but we were also surprised by all of the different openings or moves that humans in their [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=1652.32s)]
*  thousands of years playing chess had never considered that were better than some of the [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=1658.8s)]
*  moves that even the best chess players in the world had used. And so have you seen any of that, [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=1664.32s)]
*  even from a personal experience level, like where you're in these tools and you're playing around [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=1669.2s)]
*  and you again, you're learning with the model, if that makes sense, it's almost surfacing things [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=1674.32s)]
*  that you had never considered before. I like that. I think what you're touching is that whenever [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=1679.92s)]
*  you're using these tools, you have these two modes, right? Where you're either like waiting [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=1684.0800000000002s)]
*  to see what it shows you, or you kind of visualizing it in your mind and you're like, no, not that, [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=1690.0s)]
*  but if you just let it take you where it wants to go, then you're suddenly like, I have no idea [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=1695.44s)]
*  what I'm looking at. But apparently I'm here, you can do all kinds of with them. Valley, there's like [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=1700.56s)]
*  this variations tool. So you just get it to show an image and it will be like, here's four more that [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=1705.04s)]
*  are kind of the same. But obviously, over time, it starts to, if you leap and leap and leap and leap, [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=1711.12s)]
*  you end up on this like, completely bizarre visual journey. It's very psych. It's like, yeah, like a [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=1715.9199999999998s)]
*  psychedelic dream. It's fun to play around in these tools. But ultimately, while there is a market [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=1721.6s)]
*  for just interesting art in the world, a lot of this will need to ladder back into, whether it's [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=1728.7199999999998s)]
*  blog post sharing images, whether it's creating the next sneaker design that you end up selling. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=1735.28s)]
*  Are there areas that you've seen really emerge from this where people are using these tools today [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=1741.52s)]
*  and applying them to, again, what someone might call a practical use case? And in addition to maybe [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=1748.24s)]
*  what you've seen so far, are there other areas where you're excited to see this be applied? [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=1754.16s)]
*  Sure. It's interesting, isn't it? Because I think especially given the tenor of the conversation [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=1758.24s)]
*  around these tools and the ethical and legal aspects therein, I suspect that when you, [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=1766.88s)]
*  to an extent, when you see these things used, especially in prominent contexts, [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=1775.76s)]
*  they might not be advertised as such. Much is like green screen, right? When green screen is [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=1779.6s)]
*  used in films, you shouldn't be like, that is an amazing use of green screen. You should just be [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=1783.6s)]
*  like, oh my God, he's dangling off a thing. This must have cost millions. So I think when we see [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=1788.08s)]
*  AI tools used in lots of contexts, not that it's just covered up, but they might also be just a [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=1796.24s)]
*  narrow part of the creative process. I raised this point online, I think that you were making, [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=1801.68s)]
*  which is like, well, where's this all going? Will it ever make images good enough? And will other [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=1805.76s)]
*  people want to look at them? Because it's not like we have this huge history of logging in [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=1810.3200000000002s)]
*  to social media and looking at just abstract pictures like, oh, a horse on a surfboard. [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=1814.8s)]
*  Things tend to have a grounding in reality, right? That's what makes them viral or interesting. It's [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=1822.88s)]
*  a real thing that happened. But then someone was like, no, maybe it won't be that it's going to make [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=1827.36s)]
*  content so good that it's better than Netflix or better than Instagram or better than, [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=1832.8799999999999s)]
*  it's the hobby of doing it. That's the entertainment. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=1837.6799999999998s)]
*  Well, I mean, there are skills out there to your point where writing, as an example, [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=1841.1999999999998s)]
*  some people just like to write. And whether other people read it, doesn't matter, they actually [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=1845.36s)]
*  enjoy the process. And so I definitely could see an entertainment angle. But I do think that, [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=1850.32s)]
*  to an extent, even with writing as an example, a lot of people really hate writing. And a lot of [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=1856.1599999999999s)]
*  people find value in the money that they get paid to write, or the writing is used within a script, [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=1860.56s)]
*  which then is published on Netflix. And so it's like, how is this stuff used in the wider world, [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=1866.7199999999998s)]
*  whether it's on an e-commerce website, whether it's actually one day integrating with 3D printing [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=1872.32s)]
*  and the stuff that you generate in mid-journey then can actually be printed into a real life [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=1878.9599999999998s)]
*  product that you sell. This isn't just a gimmick. This isn't just a toy. [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=1883.68s)]
*  There's this very high level debate around kind of artistry, I suppose, and as if everything is [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=1887.28s)]
*  either going to be like in the Louvre or, am I saying that right? In the Tate, I'm from London, [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=1894.64s)]
*  or in the bin. But ultimately, if you look around just any space that you're in and look [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=1901.52s)]
*  at everything that has a visual component or a design component, there's so many different levels [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=1909.04s)]
*  at which we engage with art, like the pattern on a cushion, the warning label on the coffee maker, [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=1916.8799999999999s)]
*  the sausage dog on a card. They're all different things. And there's some things where the human [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=1926.32s)]
*  touch is literally the point. But other things, it's like a soothing pattern to look at, [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=1934.0s)]
*  to say that your wall isn't just gray. And so there's all kinds of layers in between. And I [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=1939.2s)]
*  think we'll see them used more and more. So the final thing I want to ask you about [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=1943.12s)]
*  is how this all fits into the wider skill set that people might have. So on one hand, [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=1946.96s)]
*  I can see how there might be an argument that this idea of the prompt engineer is going to be [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=1953.36s)]
*  one that only few can do really well. People are really going to master this skill set [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=1959.04s)]
*  and they're going to be much more valuable than the people who don't know how to prompt well. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=1963.76s)]
*  But then I can also see an argument where, as you said, maybe this gets abstracted and we have great [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=1967.36s)]
*  UIs where truly it becomes the type of thing where basically anyone can do it and anyone can do it [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=1972.24s)]
*  pretty reasonably well. And it just becomes similar to being able to write and read. These are just [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=1977.36s)]
*  fundamental, elemental skills that are in everyone's skill sets. They're taught in schools. [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=1984.4s)]
*  Where do you sit with that in terms of how you see this progressing? Is it worthwhile [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=1989.52s)]
*  you could also position the question as to become an excellent top 1% prompt engineer or is it like, [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=1993.92s)]
*  oh, everyone should kind of have this in their toolbox? [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=2001.12s)]
*  Well, that depends. I think on the one hand, there's obviously every incentive for the people [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=2003.76s)]
*  that make these foundational tools to make prompt engineering, for instance, not a thing because [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=2012.0s)]
*  they want everyone to be able to do it right. Again, if you look at the most recent model of [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=2018.48s)]
*  mid-journey version 4, if you like stuff that would not have been even possible six months ago, [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=2022.24s)]
*  you can literally do the thing where you type in a kind of a review example. But I remember [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=2027.84s)]
*  because I posted one, someone was arguing about it and I was like, look at this space stuff. I [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=2032.16s)]
*  just typed in space duck and it's like this amazing astronaut duck. And he said, there's no way you [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=2036.8s)]
*  just type that in. So I went back and checked and I was like, no, I lied. I actually typed in a [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=2041.28s)]
*  really cool space duck. But at the same time, with any material, like artistic or otherwise, [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=2045.04s)]
*  if you push things to the boundary, there's always going to be someone that explores everything [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=2051.04s)]
*  that's possible or just iterates and iterates and iterates on something. They're obviously going to [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=2055.12s)]
*  explore further on the map of what's possible than someone that isn't. So I don't think it will [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=2060.48s)]
*  become this necessary skill that everyone needs to have. But I do think it will become like some [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=2064.96s)]
*  people that are expert wood whittlers or really good at animating hair or whatever. The people [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=2070.48s)]
*  that develop a real passion for whether that's just creatively or out of curiosity to see what's [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=2077.2s)]
*  possible will be there and will do some of the most amazing things. And then there's also the [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=2083.4399999999996s)]
*  secret prompting, I guess. A copywriting thing would be the obvious example at the moment. [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=2090.48s)]
*  You think you're typing something into a UX, but really there's something else wrapping that in a [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=2095.12s)]
*  prompt and then sending it to a foundational model. So there's probably going to be some [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=2100.3199999999997s)]
*  people whose job is to come up with that layer of thing that the consumer or the average person [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=2105.2s)]
*  is never seeing. And they think they're just talking to the AI, but really they're talking [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=2111.8399999999997s)]
*  to this thing that then adds a little bit of zhuzh to it and then tells the AI that. [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=2116.16s)]
*  This is going to be a tangent, but it reminds me of I just listened to a Reply Al episode where [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=2122.24s)]
*  they were trying to... Someone had remembered this song from his childhood and they were trying to [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=2126.96s)]
*  figure out what it was. You've heard this episode. If people haven't, it's one of the best episodes. [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=2131.2s)]
*  The only one, but it was so famous. Isn't it such a good listening? [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=2133.92s)]
*  Yes, but it reminds me of... Do you remember in the episode, they find this lady who is [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=2138.4s)]
*  a music producer, but she is a music producer for specifically people who want to create music like [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=2145.12s)]
*  the bare naked ladies. Yes. It's like people have jobs like this. When you grow up and you're in [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=2150.56s)]
*  school and they tell you, you could be a doctor one day, you could be a teacher one day. They don't [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=2156.32s)]
*  tell you, you could be a music producer for musicians that want to sound like the bare [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=2160.24s)]
*  naked ladies. It makes me wonder or think about what specific niches are people going to go into [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=2164.0s)]
*  within this realm of problem engineering. Maybe you specialize, as you said, in hair, maybe in [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=2169.8399999999997s)]
*  hands, maybe in something for enterprise SaaS companies. I don't know. It's hard to predict [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=2175.04s)]
*  at this point since we're so early, but yeah, I think you're right that there's going to be, [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=2180.9599999999996s)]
*  I guess, a bimodal nature to it. It does seem like the tool that's going to be on everyone's [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=2186.48s)]
*  desktop, but it does also seem like there is this opportunity to become, as someone might say, [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=2192.3199999999997s)]
*  a 10x prompt engineer. I think that's interesting, isn't it? Because that's such a tech world [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=2197.9199999999996s)]
*  metaphor, the notion of 10x. It even implies there's a scale where you can have one and [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=2202.16s)]
*  therefore you can have 10 of it, which in the record industry, do people talk about being a 10x [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=2207.7599999999998s)]
*  record recording engineer? Obviously, some recording engineers are famous and better than [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=2214.88s)]
*  others and there's all this kind of talent. But I don't know if people are like, yeah, [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=2220.4s)]
*  I'm a 10x. But yeah, just like producers and all the kind of people that go into making, I think, [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=2224.08s)]
*  music or film, that huge list of people you see at the end of every movie, where you discover a [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=2229.6s)]
*  whole new world of careers that you might have had. I'll unfortunately never be a best boy, [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=2235.52s)]
*  but I'm still hoping to be a gaffer. Then there'll be all those kinds of jobs, I think, [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=2240.32s)]
*  in the creative AI industry. Your point on the spectrum of what is 1x and what is 10x, [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=2244.2400000000002s)]
*  it reminds me of what is the most popular piece of, you could say, art or imagery that is shared [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=2250.48s)]
*  online? What comes to mind for you there? I don't know. You said that as if you know the answer. [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=2258.6400000000003s)]
*  Well, I have an answer. I want to see what comes to mind for you there. [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=2267.52s)]
*  Photos of parties? [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=2272.32s)]
*  So I don't know if this is actually the most, but what comes to mind for me, at least as someone who [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=2275.68s)]
*  spends a lot of time on Twitter, is memes. Memes are the most basic kind of imagery ever. It's [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=2279.84s)]
*  literally an image with some capitalized text tossed on it. Your point just reminded me of this [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=2288.24s)]
*  idea where art especially is subjective and what people like and resonate with is not necessarily [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=2294.96s)]
*  the most refined or extravagant, precise type of imagery, which you can generate in some of these [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=2301.92s)]
*  text to image tools, but it doesn't necessarily mean that people are going to resonate with it. [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=2308.88s)]
*  Exactly. Until they invent an AI that can do 10x memes, which is the last thing we need. [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=2313.6s)]
*  All right. Well, this was really fun. Loved hearing about where you see this industry, [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=2320.48s)]
*  this skill set moving. We will definitely share the prompt book link in the show notes because [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=2327.2s)]
*  I think people can benefit from seeing the different types of modifiers that you can include in a [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=2332.32s)]
*  prompt and also a link to your social because you're constantly sharing new hacks, new things that [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=2336.8s)]
*  you're discovering. But yeah, any other places that people should look to find you or your work? [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=2342.08s)]
*  You can find me on Twitter at guip. You can find my substack when I finally post [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFsbWAC4_rk&t=2347.2799999999997s)]
