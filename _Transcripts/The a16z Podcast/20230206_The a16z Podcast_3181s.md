Video Description: After a16z announced our investment into Adam Neumann’s new company, Flow, it felt like almost everyone – whether it was other VCs, founders, or journalists – had something to say.

But the one person that you didn’t hear from was Adam himself.

In this never-before shared footage from a16z’s American Dynamism Summit in Washington DC, Adam Neumann sits down with Marc Andreessen and David Ulevitch, to discuss the opportunities that have emerged from post-pandemic shifts in both work and home, and what Flow is doing to address that.

# Disrupting the World's Largest Asset Class with Adam Neumann
**The a16z Podcast:** [February 06, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA)
*  I just want you to know that it's part of the game to get punch. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=0.0s)]
*  And the question is not, are you going to get back in the game? The question is, is when? [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=3.12s)]
*  Back in August, after A16C announced our investment into Adam Newman's new company, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=9.28s)]
*  Flow, it felt like almost everyone, whether it was other VCs, founders, or journalists, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=13.120000000000001s)]
*  had something to say. But the one person you didn't hear from was Adam himself. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=17.52s)]
*  And this never shared before footage from our American Dynamism Summit back in November. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=21.76s)]
*  Adam sits down with A16C co-founder Mark Injreessen and A16C venture general partner [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=26.0s)]
*  David Ulovich. They start by discussing why Adam's chosen to step back into the arena, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=30.88s)]
*  but also why Flow? That leads into the inevitable conversation around how the pandemic [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=35.68s)]
*  fundamentally shifted both work and home as they touch on A16C's move to the cloud, cities as [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=40.32s)]
*  startups, and ultimately what it might take to disrupt the world's largest asset class. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=45.84s)]
*  We also get an inside scoop into how Adam is thinking about the four pillars of Flow, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=50.24s)]
*  from technology to financial services. Finally, this video was recently published alongside our [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=54.48s)]
*  full library of American Dynamism Summit recordings, which you can find at A16C.com. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=59.36s)]
*  Thank you, gentlemen, for being here. I'm going to just jump right into it. Those of you that have [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=74.64s)]
*  heard Adam and Mark speak know that they have a lot to say, and they're very smart. So we [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=79.67999999999999s)]
*  aren't going to waste any time. Adam, three years ago you stepped down from your role as CEO of WeWork, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=84.32s)]
*  one of the most well-known real estate companies ever created. You could have sailed off into the [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=90.47999999999999s)]
*  sunset. A lot of founders do that, hang out in the Mediterranean. But you decided to start another [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=95.52s)]
*  company again. You're not naive. You know it's hard. You know that there's a lot of attention on you. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=99.75999999999999s)]
*  So how did you decide that you wanted to chase and build a new impactful company and chase a big [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=105.75999999999999s)]
*  vision and dedicate your time to building? Why get back in the game? Get back in the arena? [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=111.76s)]
*  First of all, thank you for having me. Thank you, Mark. Thank you, David. I apologize about the [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=116.48s)]
*  sandals. I broke my toe. I'm supposed to wear different shoes. You know, when I stepped down [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=121.52000000000001s)]
*  three years ago, the first thing I actually did was I took a moment. And I just wanted to take a [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=128.8s)]
*  second and think of the successes, but also think of the mistakes and the lessons and all the different [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=135.44s)]
*  things that I did and that we did as a team. And even though I was very proud of what we built, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=140.56s)]
*  I really felt like there was a lot of thinking to do. And that was sort of my first thing. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=146.24s)]
*  As that was happening, I started building a family office. And with my family office, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=150.8s)]
*  we invested in about 50 venture investments. We did private equity investments. We did liquid [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=154.56s)]
*  market trading. And each one of those things taught me something new that I wasn't aware of [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=160.32s)]
*  before. Liquid markets actually taught me about Wall Street. And as I was sitting with the team [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=164.96s)]
*  and we were doing different investing and listening to earning calls, I was like, oh, wow, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=170.48000000000002s)]
*  that's what you guys are listening to and that's what's interesting for you. And that gave me a [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=174.88s)]
*  perspective that I didn't have before. When I was sitting with entrepreneurs, as we did our venture [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=178.72s)]
*  investing, the first part when you invest and write the check is a lot of fun. But then comes [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=183.60000000000002s)]
*  the part where you're talking to them and listening and they have problems. And I got to give advice [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=188.0s)]
*  to these entrepreneurs and they didn't always listen. And I was like, okay, that's how it [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=192.8s)]
*  feels when an entrepreneur doesn't listen. I was like, okay, I got that. And that taught me a lot [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=199.28s)]
*  and actually made me understand Mark and Ben and venture capital more. And as we're doing all of [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=204.72s)]
*  this, and this is now COVID is happening, this is March 2020, we were looking at real estate [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=210.56s)]
*  because it's something we care about. And we just felt that there was going to be an opportunity in [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=215.52s)]
*  multifamily. It was a simple trade. It was cap rates were at 4.8 and we thought they were going [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=219.44s)]
*  to compress and we saw interest rates and we thought there was an opportunity. So we decided [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=224.16s)]
*  to go as a family office very deep into multifamily. We bought approximately 4,000 apartments. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=228.8s)]
*  And as we're doing that, I started walking these buildings. And even though initially it was a [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=234.72s)]
*  trade, I started feeling like there was something more that can be done. I started feeling like the [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=241.12s)]
*  residential experience is not what it should be. And just to backtrack this a little bit, [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=246.32000000000002s)]
*  so going backwards again to 2019, we're stepping down and now it's early 2020. As the whole thing [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=251.52s)]
*  is happening, and maybe you wouldn't be surprised, but the phone is not ringing as much as it used to [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=258.0s)]
*  be just a few months before. I got a phone call from Mark and we never met. And Mark introduces [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=263.2s)]
*  himself. Hello, I'm Mark Andreessen. I know you are Mark. Thank you so much for calling me. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=270.56s)]
*  And he sort of, we're having a discussion, we're talking about something, but very quickly turned [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=275.84s)]
*  to Mark asking, we saw them. How are you doing? And I told him this and that and this and that. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=279.84s)]
*  And he says to me, oh, you're still in that stage. And I was like, this was on the phone. I said, [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=285.04s)]
*  Mark, what stage is that? And he goes, the stage where you believe everything the media says. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=291.68s)]
*  And I said, well, I'm not in that stage. And I know we built a great company. And of course, [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=297.52s)]
*  I don't believe, but you know, they are saying quite a lot of things. And Mark says to me, [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=301.84s)]
*  Adam, we don't know each other, but let me tell you something about venture capital [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=306.56s)]
*  and high growth companies. And the bigger the venture, the bigger the growth, what I'm about [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=310.47999999999996s)]
*  to tell you is more true. It's hand to hand combat. Anybody who doesn't know that venture [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=314.32s)]
*  is hand to hand combat doesn't actually understand or has never done it before. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=319.2s)]
*  And when you fight, once in a while you get punched. And he said, I guarantee you, [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=323.12s)]
*  because he was very nice, he said, a lot of our companies use your products, not just in the US, [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=327.35999999999996s)]
*  but all over the world. And he said, I guarantee you that for every mistake you made, there's a [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=331.2s)]
*  hundred things that you did right. And I just want you to know that it's part of the game to get [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=335.44s)]
*  punched. And the question is not, are you going to get back in the game? The question is, when? [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=339.44s)]
*  And just so you know, you have a friend here that you've never met before, but we've been tracking. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=346.24s)]
*  And if you ever decide to do anything, then call us. And now fast forward. Well, I'll say one more [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=350.4s)]
*  thing about it, because it was very meaningful. I hung up the phone and I still remember this. I [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=357.92s)]
*  walked to Rebecca, my wife, and I was like, I just had the most amazing phone call. This guy, Mark [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=362.08000000000004s)]
*  Andreessen, and I explained to her who Mark is, called me and basically was very encouraging and [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=367.92s)]
*  gave me a different perspective to look at what just occurred. And she thought it was amazing. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=372.88s)]
*  And I thought it was amazing. And Mark, I don't know if I've ever had the chance to actually tell [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=379.52000000000004s)]
*  you, it was a meaningful moment for me. And I really appreciate it. And fast forward now, a year [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=383.2s)]
*  and a half, we kept these buildings that we bought ended up being a really good trade and everything [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=390.56s)]
*  that we thought was happening was happening. And we started building this brand. It didn't have a [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=395.2s)]
*  name yet, but we started building this business and we saw all this opportunity, which we'll talk [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=399.36s)]
*  about a little bit later. And around February, we spoke again and Mark asked me what's up. And I [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=403.2s)]
*  told him what was happening and that we've been developing and the business by this point is over [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=410.32s)]
*  a year old and we've been doing more and more and we started building technology and we bought a [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=414.32s)]
*  company and we did a few different things. And Mark said, why don't you come and present it to the team? [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=418.64s)]
*  And we went and we met the team. And the first thing I noticed when we all met is that the Andreessen [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=423.76s)]
*  Horvitz team was not like the venture capitalists that I was used to. And I had quite a lot of [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=432.08s)]
*  experience with venture capital before. And it didn't feel like investors. It actually felt like [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=436.16s)]
*  businessmen, like entrepreneurs. And I actually asked, I just asked Mark behind the stage, I said, [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=441.44s)]
*  how many partners do you have that are entrepreneurs? And he said 20. And I gotta tell you that's very [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=445.52000000000004s)]
*  different from other businesses. And as we're having the discussion, one of Mark's partners asked me, [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=450.24s)]
*  Adam, are you raising money? And I said, I'm not sure. We're gonna build this one on our own. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=456.64000000000004s)]
*  I'm not sure because one of our lessons was you gotta choose your partners really carefully. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=460.88s)]
*  And he said, well, maybe you should consider us. Let us look into the business and see if it's [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=465.12s)]
*  interesting. And if so, maybe you should consider us. And then DG led a very rigorous diligence [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=468.72s)]
*  process. And they asked us a lot of questions and learned everything about our business. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=475.2s)]
*  And as we were getting to know Andreessen, I realized that these are the kind of partners that [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=480.0s)]
*  I was always looking for, but never really knew that existed. So to answer your question, [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=484.32s)]
*  I was always building it, but building it with a partner was something that only happened because [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=491.36s)]
*  of this team and because of the way I met them. And I can just tell you the way the first board [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=496.47999999999996s)]
*  meeting and one minute afterwards, Mark called me and said, Adam, can I give you some feedback? [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=500.64s)]
*  I said, of course, Mark. He said, well, when your team said this and this and this, I don't agree [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=504.64s)]
*  with that. Let me tell you why. And here's the experience I have. And here's what I want to [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=508.96s)]
*  warn you from. So I welcome the feedback. I'm so excited to be a partner. I'm excited to be back [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=512.56s)]
*  in the game, not alone, but with the team. And we're just getting started. But the future is [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=517.84s)]
*  there's a lot of potential. That's awesome. And I will say there's a whole bunch of venture [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=523.6s)]
*  capitalists in the room. And we are all very happy that we work exists so that our portfolio [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=529.2s)]
*  companies are not signing these long-term leases in this dynamic world that we live in. And they [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=533.12s)]
*  get to go into the offices they want to be in in the right cities at the right time. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=537.2s)]
*  So we're going to talk more about Flow and the new business in a moment. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=540.5600000000001s)]
*  Mark, I want to shift to you. You and I have talked about housing for a long time, [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=544.88s)]
*  long before this investment. It's something you've thought about for a long time. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=549.0400000000001s)]
*  Why is housing important? Why is it particularly relevant? Why is it even a part of American [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=553.76s)]
*  dynamism? Yeah, so there's a critique of Silicon Valley and the tech industry that, you know, [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=558.4000000000001s)]
*  on various days, sometimes I agree with, sometimes I don't. But there's a critique that basically [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=563.9200000000001s)]
*  says, look, you guys have done a great job. Silicon Valley's done a great job over the years [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=567.9200000000001s)]
*  at the really unimportant things. And so, you know, you've consumed electronics and video games [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=571.2s)]
*  and media and e-commerce and it's all great, it's all fine, it's all good. And by the way, [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=577.76s)]
*  we do those things, we're very proud of our efforts in those spaces. And we actually think [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=582.5600000000001s)]
*  they're very important. But, you know, basically they're small slices of GDP. And then if you look [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=587.2800000000001s)]
*  at basically the GDP pie chart, which is also the consumer spending pie chart, the things that people [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=592.48s)]
*  spend money on that really matter in their lives, there's basically three really big ones, [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=597.84s)]
*  healthcare, education and housing. And if you look at kind of all the economic statistics by sector, [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=602.1600000000001s)]
*  healthcare, education, housing are basically increasing in terms of cost at a much faster [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=608.08s)]
*  rate than all the others. And they're the sectors where the tech industry has had the least impact [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=613.2800000000001s)]
*  historically. And, you know, and of those, the biggest one is housing, right? It's sort of the [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=618.72s)]
*  housing is the single biggest, you know, kind of thing that most families spend money on. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=622.48s)]
*  And so, you know, it's really central, you know, from that standpoint, you know, it's very central [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=626.4000000000001s)]
*  from an economic standpoint in the life of a family because, right, there's this, you know, [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=631.5200000000001s)]
*  very big question, which is, you know, if you, you know, if you own, there are, you know, potentially [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=634.8800000000001s)]
*  big downsides because you might be stuck, you know, in one place where maybe you don't want your family [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=639.2s)]
*  to be for the next 30 years because maybe opportunity shifts around. You know, but if you rent, [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=643.12s)]
*  you don't necessarily, right, build up equity by default, you know, with the way that most [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=647.44s)]
*  department offerings work. So, you know, there's big economic consequences. There's also big social [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=651.9200000000001s)]
*  consequences and political consequences, right, which is, you know, and this is something that's [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=658.64s)]
*  kind of been deep in the American character for, you know, for many decades, but this idea that if [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=662.64s)]
*  you basically, if you have a sense of commitment, if you have a sense that you are actually invested [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=666.5600000000001s)]
*  in the place where you live, you are more connected to the society, you're more connected to the [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=673.6800000000001s)]
*  culture, and then ultimately you're more connected to the politics, you know, to the polity, to the [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=678.24s)]
*  political body. And so, you know, there's been long-running policies in the United States to [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=682.88s)]
*  encourage homeownership. Now, it turns out those can be overdone, they can end up with problems, [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=688.24s)]
*  and we saw a lot of the problems that kind of, you know, came out of that approach and, you know, [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=692.32s)]
*  kind of the historical approach in the 2008 financial crisis, but nevertheless, there is like [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=695.6800000000001s)]
*  a very kind of big, deep, meaningful, you know, kind of sense of identity that comes with housing. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=699.28s)]
*  Why does this matter, you know, kind of from a broad standpoint? So the reason I think this [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=704.32s)]
*  matters so much is because geography is so central to economic opportunities, right? So basically, [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=709.76s)]
*  take a step back, the role of cities, right, in human society. So like, cities are a human invention, [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=717.76s)]
*  you know, there were many hundreds of thousands, millions of years where, you know, people were [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=723.12s)]
*  running around without, you know, in clans and tribes not forming into cities, then about 4,000 [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=727.36s)]
*  years ago, cities were basically invented and people started to cluster that way. Why were [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=732.0799999999999s)]
*  cities invented? A bunch of reasons, but one of the big ones is there's an economic payoff to being [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=737.8399999999999s)]
*  in a city, and the way that it works is if you are, you know, if you have a certain level of [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=742.56s)]
*  productivity and you're in a rural environment, you don't have many opportunities to work with [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=747.3599999999999s)]
*  other people, right, who are highly productive. If you move to a city, all of a sudden you're [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=751.1999999999999s)]
*  surrounded by lots of other people who are highly productive, and all of a sudden there's a catalytic [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=754.8s)]
*  effect, basically this positive feedback loop that forms where kind of everybody, because we're [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=758.88s)]
*  productive, and so basically, cities are basically the foundation of modern economic growth. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=763.04s)]
*  Economists call this the agglomeration effect, which is basically if you like, slant people [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=769.68s)]
*  together, you know, sort of, you know, you can get a lot of good things out of that. You know, the [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=773.12s)]
*  West developed, you know, the story of the West is the story of cities and the creation of all these, [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=779.36s)]
*  you know, these amazing cities, and then, you know, over the last 50 years, you know, that kind [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=784.24s)]
*  of trend has gone into hyperdrive, and you've had this emergence of what economists call superstar [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=789.44s)]
*  cities, where you've got these specific cities like Washington DC, New York City, Boston, San [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=793.2s)]
*  Francisco Bay Area, Los Angeles, you know, and then, you know, internationally, London and Tokyo and [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=798.08s)]
*  Singapore and so forth, and Paris, that are kind of these cities that are like irresistible draws [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=802.96s)]
*  for people who are, you know, highly ambitious and want to be around a lot of other highly ambitious, [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=807.6s)]
*  highly productive people. It turns out as a result of that superstar city clustering thing, [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=811.28s)]
*  there's been a bifurcation in the housing market, right, where basically those superstar cities, [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=816.0s)]
*  they become, you know, basically occupied. At some point, you know, people end up with a political [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=820.3199999999999s)]
*  agenda, and then they stop building housing, right, and so the places where people want to go and want [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=823.8399999999999s)]
*  their kids to go are very difficult to get to. The San Francisco Bay Area is like, you know, a classic [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=828.56s)]
*  example of this. You know, San Francisco last year, like, authorized, I think, 6,000 new housing units, [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=833.1999999999999s)]
*  right, which it was just like an absurdly low number relative to the demand for people who want [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=837.68s)]
*  to move there. And then the places that do not have this kind of clustering, agglomeration, [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=841.76s)]
*  superstar city effect, you know, they build plenty of housing, but there's not as much opportunity [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=846.4799999999999s)]
*  there. So heading into COVID, you just, you saw this incredible bifurcation, and you saw it in [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=850.7199999999999s)]
*  the American economy, and you see it in American politics, where basically you're either in a city, [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=855.1999999999999s)]
*  you buy a home, you know, you've kind of got that little commitment, you've got that level of [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=858.8s)]
*  opportunity for you and your family, right, or you're in a more rural environment, and you're [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=862.56s)]
*  basically stuck, and you don't have access to good jobs, and your kids are not going to have, [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=866.4s)]
*  like, high tech jobs, and it's, you know, basically you're going to have a lower quality of life. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=869.52s)]
*  This was becoming a very big issue. This became a very big issue, by the way, for us, because we [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=874.48s)]
*  were kind of, we were basically getting stuck in the geographic confines of Silicon Valley. Like, [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=878.24s)]
*  our companies were, like, penned in, and it was becoming very hard for companies to grow in that [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=882.24s)]
*  area. And then basically, you know, a horrible tragedy struck that turned out to also be, in some [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=885.84s)]
*  ways, a miracle in terms of, I think, the long-run consequences, which is COVID, right, and, you know, [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=891.36s)]
*  none of us would have hoped that COVID would have happened, and it has been a horrible tragedy for [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=896.08s)]
*  many people, and I think, you know, broadly for our society. But nevertheless, COVID was a system [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=900.72s)]
*  shock, right, that caused all big companies to basically instantly move online in a hard cutover, [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=905.44s)]
*  you know, in kind of a way that I never imagined was possible. It was also an instant proof that [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=911.12s)]
*  companies really can run, at least for some time, they can actually run online, right, basically, [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=916.08s)]
*  like, no big company actually stopped operating as a consequence of this dramatic shift from [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=921.2800000000001s)]
*  in-person to online. And then all of a sudden, like, that opened the door to, you know, every CEO, [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=925.4399999999999s)]
*  every manager, every entrepreneur, every investor thinking, oh, okay, the post-COVID world is not [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=931.8399999999999s)]
*  going to be like the pre-COVID world. The post-COVID world is going to be an opportunity to rethink [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=937.4399999999999s)]
*  and reinvent how companies are organized. It's going to be an opportunity to reinvent how [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=941.1999999999999s)]
*  industries are organized. It's going to be an opportunity to reinvent, you know, how geography [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=944.8s)]
*  works, right, what the role of cities is. It's going to be an opportunity to spread the economic [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=948.56s)]
*  activity from cities much more broadly, you know, potentially throughout the country. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=953.36s)]
*  You know, every employer, every company, every CEO here, you know, is having some version of [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=957.44s)]
*  this conversation, you know, with their own company. We talk about this with our founders all the time. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=961.6s)]
*  And then there's a corresponding question that's opened up, which is how are people going to live? [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=966.16s)]
*  And some people are going to continue living the way that they were. Some people are going [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=970.08s)]
*  to undertake a radical change in how they live, and they're going to, you know, they'll go remote, [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=973.36s)]
*  and all of a sudden, you know, you go remote and you have access to, you know, thousands of jobs [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=977.12s)]
*  anytime you want, which is a totally new phenomenon. And then there you now have the [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=980.88s)]
*  opportunity to rethink how families live, right? And so, you know, is it necessary for ambitious [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=985.84s)]
*  kids to leave the place where they grew up in order to have access to first-class economic [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=990.56s)]
*  opportunity? In 2019, the answer to that was frequently yes. Today, maybe not. And so, and, [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=994.64s)]
*  you know, I should also say, like, there's no, like, this is not a zero or 100% thing. This is [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=1000.56s)]
*  not, like, a hard cutover. It's not like the whole world goes remote or stays remote, right, [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=1004.72s)]
*  which is not what's happening. But there's this moment in time that we're in right now, [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=1007.76s)]
*  which is, like, we can actually rethink and reinvent how companies are organized [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=1010.64s)]
*  and how work happens, and then we can also reinvent how people live and give people a [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=1015.2s)]
*  lot more options in how that happens. And so I think basically the presumptions that have [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=1018.64s)]
*  underlied the whole structure of how the housing market works and how the industry works and how [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=1023.2s)]
*  people live and work, I think it's basically all up for grabs. I think we have about a five-year [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=1027.76s)]
*  window, I think, as a society to kind of figure out what this means and how to adapt. Yeah, [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=1031.76s)]
*  let me pause there. That was awesome. Perfect answer. Which is a good segue to where I want [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=1035.76s)]
*  to go into, which is we have seen work become more dynamic. People now sometimes go into an [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=1042.72s)]
*  office some days a week, sometimes they go in for a couple months and they go to a different office [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=1048.64s)]
*  in a different city. You know, like, WeWork was quite equipped for this kind of dynamic work [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=1051.84s)]
*  lifestyle. What are the lessons that you have learned from WeWork that you're going to apply [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=1056.96s)]
*  to flow or things that maybe you didn't do at WeWork but you thought about that you're going [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=1061.52s)]
*  to apply to flow, particularly around sort of this changing way people live and work and how [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=1066.4s)]
*  people, as we get to rethink the way that we sort of organize ourselves and bring ourselves to work [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=1071.6s)]
*  into home? So I think you're right. I actually think flexible work is more relevant today than [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=1076.96s)]
*  10 years ago. I actually think it's a better idea today than it was. The obvious lesson is community. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=1084.32s)]
*  I think Corona, I think on top of everything that Mark just said, and I'm not going to repeat any [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=1090.56s)]
*  of it, but that's the data that pushed us into being as interested as we were in this category. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=1094.32s)]
*  But on top of all of that, we, for a lot of time, I think a lot of people argued, Howard Schultz [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=1099.36s)]
*  used to say Starbucks is the third place. I remember once having an argument with him. I told him, [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=1104.24s)]
*  WeWork is the third place. He was like, Starbucks is the third place. Well, I think the first place [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=1108.8s)]
*  turned out to be the third place. I think the home is the most important thing. I think COVID [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=1113.76s)]
*  taught us that. I think you can take your work into your home, but you can't take your home into [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=1118.8s)]
*  your work. And that's affecting a lot of change. Also to put the little numbers behind what Mark is [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=1124.48s)]
*  saying, 70% of 35 year olds and young girls are currently renters. They don't actually buy. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=1128.96s)]
*  And this number is not because of the interest rates that have been going up over the past [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=1135.44s)]
*  six to 10 months. This is a number from 12 months ago. And we believe that that number is actually [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=1139.2s)]
*  only going to grow. So 70% are renters. You said it's a big piece of their spend. It's about a [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=1144.3999999999999s)]
*  third of their total wallet. So you have this huge asset class, largest in the world. 70% of its users [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=1149.6s)]
*  are renters. It's a third of their spend. And yet they're not getting an experience that is actually [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=1155.9199999999998s)]
*  up to par. Not to talk about the financial. You mentioned, Mark, that they're not creating any [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=1161.52s)]
*  equity and they're not creating any equity. And when you put those two things together, you see a [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=1165.12s)]
*  real challenge. And what it's going to do, and we're already seeing it, people are starting to [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=1169.36s)]
*  work where they live and not just live where they work. And therefore you're starting to see [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=1173.76s)]
*  these movements between cities. And you can even say without becoming too political, but we're in [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=1177.68s)]
*  the heart of politics, maybe some of the results in midterms now showed Democrats that were [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=1182.4s)]
*  actually traveling to new cities and moving to different places. A lot of things are shifting. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=1187.44s)]
*  And the way we live has an opportunity right now to change. Because I think if we weren't clear about [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=1192.4s)]
*  it before, how important the home is, everybody's reminded. And a great home and a great experience, [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=1197.28s)]
*  an elevated experience is more important than ever before. And then work has to accommodate. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=1202.96s)]
*  And Mark and I actually think, see the world a little differently about what if our, is every [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=1208.96s)]
*  company going to be a remote company or in-person company? But the answer is obviously hybrid of the [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=1213.52s)]
*  two. And as you think through, well, how am I going to solve work? And how am I going to solve [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=1218.4s)]
*  the future of where people live? What I see is an opportunity to really affect that change. And [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=1223.44s)]
*  it's exciting that we're in DC because this is one of the places where opportunities like this [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=1229.4399999999998s)]
*  become a reality. If I could put a point on something that Adam said. So there's sort of this, [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=1233.9199999999998s)]
*  there's Richard Florida that analyzes these things, talks about what he calls the creative class. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=1239.6799999999998s)]
*  Just kind of, say upper middle class, it's us, it's our kids, right? It's sort of highly educated [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=1243.9199999999998s)]
*  kids who are going to basically go into a knowledge or creative profession of some kind, right? Work [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=1251.6799999999998s)]
*  at a keyboard as opposed to what they're doing, doing some form of manual labor or manufacturing. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=1255.68s)]
*  And of course, this is not most of the economy, but this is sort of the upper middle class, [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=1259.6000000000001s)]
*  in many ways the cultural vanguard for the country. They define a lot of the trends. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=1264.4s)]
*  And so there's this experience, right, that I'm sure a lot of us have had and a lot of younger [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=1269.8400000000001s)]
*  people we know have had in the last, especially 20 years, really 20, 25 years, the sort of thing [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=1274.3200000000002s)]
*  where you grow up at home, you then go to college, you spend your time at college for more years. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=1280.08s)]
*  And you're on this campus environment and it's, and everybody knows, college is kind of education, [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=1288.56s)]
*  it's kind of adult daycare. It's got all the food and entertainment, it's this whole contained [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=1293.1999999999998s)]
*  environment, it's a social environment, it's a dating environment, right? It's kind of this whole [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=1299.6799999999998s)]
*  thing. Putatively you're an adult, but you're living in a dorm and there's like an older adult [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=1303.6s)]
*  down the hall who's taking care of you, right? So you're not really fully an adult. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=1308.72s)]
*  And so you're in that environment. And of course, 50 years ago, you'd leave that environment and you'd [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=1313.44s)]
*  go to work in an office, you'd buy a starter house and you'd be on your sort of traditional [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=1318.4s)]
*  American middle class path. Over the last 20, 25 years, it became very common to have this idea of [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=1322.8s)]
*  the corporate campus, right? And sort of Google maybe really kind of crystallized that in the [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=1328.48s)]
*  culture. Basically this idea that a company's facility where everybody came every day was going [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=1334.08s)]
*  to basically be a continuation of the college campus experience. And that led to kind of this [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=1339.9199999999998s)]
*  perk bonanza, right? So you'd have this whole thing go to this campus and it's like gourmet [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=1345.12s)]
*  food 24 hours a day and it's like they'll do your dry cleaning and they'll walk your dog and there's [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=1348.3999999999999s)]
*  swimming pools and there's the pink, you know, these campuses still exist. They're all 100% [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=1352.08s)]
*  converting all the tennis courts to pickleball courts because of course that's what everybody's [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=1357.04s)]
*  doing, right? So there are these, you know, it basically is a self-contained environment and the [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=1360.16s)]
*  theory of it, right, was if we can get people, you know, especially these young people, like inculcate [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=1364.3200000000002s)]
*  them, keep them in this kind of college campus kind of environment, then they'll basically, [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=1368.4s)]
*  they'll work more, right? We'll get more out of them because they'll be here more often. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=1371.52s)]
*  You know, it was basically everything up to not usually including the actual bed, [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=1375.68s)]
*  although sometimes people would sleep under their desk like Elon Musk. But everything, you know, [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=1380.0800000000002s)]
*  sort of short of that. And so as a consequence, you'd have this thing where sort of young adults [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=1386.0s)]
*  kind of stayed in this corporate campus environment and then as a consequence, they had this incredible [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=1389.6s)]
*  community, right? They had this incredible environment, right, where they have, you know, [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=1393.36s)]
*  all these friends, co-workers, colleagues, you know, their, you know, their teammates, other people [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=1397.6799999999998s)]
*  who work at the same company, they're going to lunch, going to dinner, doing the whole thing. And then, [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=1401.76s)]
*  and then by the way, it also turns out it's the, it's just like the college campus, it's the dating [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=1405.1999999999998s)]
*  pool, right? And so, you know, it's basically if you work for, you know, for the Google campus or [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=1408.7199999999998s)]
*  the Facebook campus, like where you're going to date, probably somebody who also is there because [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=1414.3999999999999s)]
*  you're there all the time together. And then you basically like drop COVID into that model and you [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=1417.76s)]
*  just like detonate it, right? Which is, which, which is what's happened, right? And then all of [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=1421.92s)]
*  a sudden, the experience of a kid going through that all of a sudden, it's like, nope, nope, [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=1425.6s)]
*  you don't get that. What you get is you get to sit in your studio apartment, right, in front of your [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=1428.8799999999999s)]
*  laptop, right? And good luck, right? And you're like cut off from everything else. And like, [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=1432.8s)]
*  you've got DoorDash, but then you've got Tinder and like, that's your life. And like, [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=1436.24s)]
*  that is not the same thing. And so, and then, you know, to Adam's point, like a lot of these [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=1441.2s)]
*  companies now we're thinking, okay, we're going to have people come back in the office two days a [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=1446.16s)]
*  week, three days a week, or we're going to have them come back and shifts or this or that. But, [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=1448.8000000000002s)]
*  you know, the spirit is like Elvis has left the building for these kinds of environments. Like, [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=1452.24s)]
*  this is not the way that most companies are going to operate. And so all of a sudden, the focus on [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=1456.24s)]
*  where you live, the focus on what, you know, are you literally by yourself? You know, do you have [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=1461.0400000000002s)]
*  roommates? Are you in a small, you know, complex? Are you in a big complex? Do you, do you have any [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=1466.0800000000002s)]
*  sense of connection whatsoever? Do you know who your neighbors are? You know, most people historically [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=1471.1200000000001s)]
*  live in apartments. I don't think they generally would even know who their neighbors are, right? [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=1475.12s)]
*  The guy next door is just the guy next door. You'd feel no connection. By the way, there would [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=1477.84s)]
*  be no overlap where you lived and the people you worked with would have no overlap, right? Because [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=1482.7199999999998s)]
*  there was no point. You didn't worry about whether there were other people who you worked with who [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=1486.2399999999998s)]
*  were in your same apartment complex because you were seeing them at work all day. And so do you [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=1489.52s)]
*  have anything in common with the people you're in the building with? And so there's this sort of [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=1493.12s)]
*  whole model that an entire generation grew up with that has all of a sudden been detonated. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=1498.32s)]
*  Yeah, and I don't know, maybe it's radical. I think the idea of sitting in the apartment in [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=1502.88s)]
*  front of the screen with door, dash, and tender is not a good life. And so that opens the door [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=1506.4s)]
*  for reinvention. We don't think, we know it's not a good life because we've heard, even in the office, [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=1511.04s)]
*  so you gave Google as an example, Google was inspiration for us that we work. Our point was, [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=1516.16s)]
*  well, why can't small businesses have this great campus, have this great energy? And that was the [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=1520.64s)]
*  beginning. I remember when we tried to sell Google and be like, can we, we could take some of your [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=1524.8000000000002s)]
*  staff. They're like, you can't take our staff. We're Google. We invented this. We ended up taking [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=1528.64s)]
*  some of their staff. Quite a lot, actually. But that same serendipity feeling that you feel when [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=1532.72s)]
*  you go, when you were to go in an office and connect to this belongs in a home in a fun way, [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=1542.72s)]
*  way more than it ever belonged in an office. And when you think of these apartment buildings, [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=1547.68s)]
*  and it is a little sad. It's sad that there's an apartment building with 400 apartments, maybe six, [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=1551.44s)]
*  700 people with a swimming pool and a kitchen and a gym and all these amenities that when you, [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=1556.1599999999999s)]
*  if anybody here has ever been in a multifamily, you do this amazing tour. They show you all these [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=1560.56s)]
*  amenities spaces. You never see anyone there. You then move into the building and you, not everyone, [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=1564.8799999999999s)]
*  but a lot of people live the life that Mark is describing. And that's sad because I don't think [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=1569.84s)]
*  human connection thrives. I actually think, I'm so happy we're here face to face. And COVID was [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=1574.8799999999999s)]
*  obviously a horrible thing, but also a miracle at the same time. It's a miracle that we're all here [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=1580.1599999999999s)]
*  face to face because this connection is so much more meaningful. And why doesn't, why don't people [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=1584.56s)]
*  deserve that in the home? And again, I go back to that number. It's a third of their wallet spend. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=1590.6399999999999s)]
*  As Americans, we're used to actually for anything we spend, if it's 2% of our wallet spend, 1% of [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=1594.8799999999999s)]
*  our wallet spend, many companies that you guys invest in, it's all branded. It's always an [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=1599.76s)]
*  uplifting experience. If someone doesn't do good enough experience, then the next person comes [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=1604.24s)]
*  and elevates it. And yet in residential, and we can talk about why, but in residential never happened. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=1608.3999999999999s)]
*  And because it never happened, and because it's so difficult to disrupt, it actually didn't care. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=1614.3200000000002s)]
*  And what ends up happening is that renter is not getting a good deal, neither the experience or the [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=1618.8s)]
*  financial transaction. And again, that renter is the majority of the young adults. Yeah, I think [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=1623.68s)]
*  COVID was the first time a lot of people, especially under the age of 40, 50, first time [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=1629.68s)]
*  they ever got to know their neighbors, or they never had to. And their proxy for community probably [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=1635.44s)]
*  was the workplace. And like you said, we're never going back to that. Whatever our new normal is, [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=1640.08s)]
*  it's not the old normal. I'm just going to give you a thought about that. It's an American thing [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=1643.84s)]
*  that they never had to. In other countries, where I grew up in Israel, there's no such thing, [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=1647.1999999999998s)]
*  you don't know your neighbors. When you don't have salt, you go to your neighbor's door, [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=1650.8s)]
*  you knock on the door, they don't answer. You open the door, it's locked, you know where the key, [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=1654.0s)]
*  you open it up, you go and you take the salt, you never bring it back. Then they go back, [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=1658.32s)]
*  there's no salt, oh, Adam took it. And it's this community. Here we call the police. [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=1662.56s)]
*  They come in four hours. It's true. Or San Francisco, maybe never. Yeah. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=1670.56s)]
*  You guys said that, they said that, I didn't say anything. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=1675.28s)]
*  Okay. But the point is that it's such a natural thing for people living together to connect. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=1678.24s)]
*  And yet we live in a world where even when people are in the same building, they don't talk to each [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=1685.04s)]
*  other in the elevator. When I came to the United States and used to say hello to everyone in the [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=1689.4399999999998s)]
*  elevator, people thought I was weird. And I thought it was weird that you wouldn't say hello, wouldn't [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=1693.52s)]
*  you want to know who is living there? And we have a lot of little things and we haven't talked about [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=1698.88s)]
*  really flow yet. There's a lot of different ideas that we have. But the simple one is when people [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=1704.64s)]
*  tour a building, always the tour, the leasing agent tells you about all the amenities. I would [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=1709.68s)]
*  like the leasing agent, who's not even going to be called a leasing agent, to introduce you to a few [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=1714.4s)]
*  residents who actually like living there. Let them tell you why this is a great building and if it's [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=1718.4s)]
*  a fit for you or not a fit for you. And that tiny little thing I just said is so small. And the fact [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=1723.2s)]
*  that it doesn't exist actually, and a lot of people ask me, Adam, how come this didn't exist before? [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=1728.16s)]
*  It doesn't exist in my opinion because buildings are full anyway. There's a shortage of supplies. [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=1733.2s)]
*  You spoke a little bit about zoning. There's, and the numbers varies, but between three to five [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=1738.16s)]
*  million apartments and single-family homes missing right now in the U.S. And that number grows by [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=1743.76s)]
*  hundreds of thousands of units a year. And so there's a shortage of supply, there's an over [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=1748.48s)]
*  demand, and no one really needed to do it. And because the landlords didn't need to do it, it [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=1753.44s)]
*  didn't happen. And when you think of prop tech companies and technology, I was talking to Steve [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=1757.52s)]
*  Case before for a second about prop tech and a little bit about all the different innovations, [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=1761.76s)]
*  when you think, well why haven't people solved this problem before? Most prop tech companies come in [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=1766.56s)]
*  and solve a point solution. They have this one solution, but then they need to take that solution, [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=1771.84s)]
*  convince the landlords who are not even interested in buying anything because they're making money [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=1776.4s)]
*  anyway, go to these old ERP systems, connect to the back of these systems, then get the users. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=1780.4s)]
*  It's very difficult, which is why the way we want to tackle it is actually vertical. I almost think [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=1785.84s)]
*  it's the only way. Excellent. We're going to come back to that in the vertical software stack for [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=1790.56s)]
*  prop tech and flow in a minute. Mark, you know, we came out, Ben had a big blog post about how we've [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=1796.8799999999999s)]
*  moved our headquarters to the cloud. We have decoupled the geography of the firm. So I guess [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=1804.0s)]
*  the first question is like, two parts. Talk a little bit about the thinking about moving to the [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=1809.84s)]
*  cloud. Why did we do it? And then talk about how it's gone. And then I'll keep you honest if I agree. [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=1814.24s)]
*  Yeah, so this has been very dramatic. I mean, look, for every employer, every company, [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=1820.48s)]
*  this has been dramatic. We've had our version of it. And for us, it's been very dramatic, [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=1823.76s)]
*  which is we made a very deliberate decision when we started our firm in 2009 that we were really [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=1827.2s)]
*  deeply going to invest in the office, and in particular in one office. And so we were kind [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=1831.28s)]
*  of semi notorious in the industry. We only ever had one office. The office was in Menlo Park, [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=1835.36s)]
*  California. You know, this is actually controversial even in the Bay Area because there are lots of [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=1839.52s)]
*  startups who are actually in San Francisco. Lots of the younger people who work for us lived up in [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=1844.08s)]
*  San Francisco. And we said, you know, sorry. And everybody every year was like, we've got to put [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=1847.4399999999998s)]
*  up an office in San Francisco. And we're like, nope, single office. Everybody's going to be in [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=1851.12s)]
*  the office. And the reason for that was we wanted the beehive effect. We wanted people, when they [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=1854.56s)]
*  walk in, both the people who work for us but also the people who are visiting us to really feel like [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=1859.1999999999998s)]
*  they were tapping in energy. They were seeing lots of other interesting people. This was the [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=1862.72s)]
*  kind of environment and the kinds of people they'd want to be around. So we put a really big emphasis [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=1867.12s)]
*  on that. We were in there every day, all day, working together, the whole thing. The whole thing [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=1872.4s)]
*  you get from a high functioning office environment. And then like everybody else, in March of 2000, [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=1877.44s)]
*  we shut that down and we went completely online. And like everybody else, we were shocked that we [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=1882.48s)]
*  were able to continue to run the firm. You basically keep everything going over Zoom and Slack [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=1887.68s)]
*  and so forth. And so kind of off in the way we went. We actually then actually had an incremental [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=1895.2800000000002s)]
*  process. And the two weeks to crush the curve turned into two months, turned into two years. [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=1900.08s)]
*  So like everybody else, we're trying to figure out how long this is going to last. We start doing [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=1905.52s)]
*  polls of our employees and we did a poll six months in and some people were like, I can't wait to get [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=1908.8s)]
*  back to the office. Some people were like, wow, I don't know. 12 months, the numbers moved. 18 [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=1913.52s)]
*  months, the numbers moved. And then we had one poll where it was basically like 100% of the young [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=1918.32s)]
*  parents were like, if you guys want to go back to the office, good luck. We're getting different jobs. [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=1923.28s)]
*  It's like I get to spend time with my kids. I get to be here in the morning. I get to be here at [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=1928.48s)]
*  night. By the way, I'm working from home 12 hours a day or whatever. I'm more productive than ever. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=1932.24s)]
*  But I am not going to do the two or three hour daily commute from South San Jose or from San [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=1937.68s)]
*  Francisco or from the East Bay to go to Menlo Park. I'm just not going to do it anymore. And so that [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=1944.8799999999999s)]
*  perked our ears up because it's like, okay, that's interesting. And then the other conversation we [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=1950.0s)]
*  had was basically what's going to happen to our companies and to our industry. And so it's certainly [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=1954.88s)]
*  not the case that all of our companies are going, they're certainly not all going fully remote. And [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=1959.44s)]
*  we actually have quite a few companies that have actually elected to actually stay very office [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=1963.1200000000001s)]
*  centric, which is actually a very interesting counter programming thing that some people are [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=1966.24s)]
*  doing now. But generally speaking, our companies were indicating that they were going to become [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=1970.0800000000002s)]
*  more flexible and they were going to really start to spread out. And then the industry just felt [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=1973.8400000000001s)]
*  like it was going to expand. And we were seeing a lot of founders who were frustrated being in the [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=1977.8400000000001s)]
*  Bay Area basically left over this period and they went to other places and they started companies. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=1982.08s)]
*  And so we basically decided we can't be in the business of partnering with people who are building [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=1986.0s)]
*  the future if we're not living in the future ourselves. And so we basically said, we'll just [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=1990.48s)]
*  do a hard reset. We'll become sort of remote centric or sort of virtual centric. I just approved a [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=1994.6399999999999s)]
*  request. We still have our office because it's on a long term lease. We converted it to hoteling. [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=2001.4399999999998s)]
*  And I just signed off yesterday on converting my former office into apparently the new lounge. [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=2007.44s)]
*  So I'm very excited to visit the new hangout space. And so basically what we decided is, [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=2014.56s)]
*  so basically we're going to keep offices basically as places for people to go when they need a place [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=2022.88s)]
*  to work, for teams to be able to meet together. We're also actually letting our founders use our [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=2027.68s)]
*  offices more, which is actually helping them figure out how to kind of adapt through this. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=2031.76s)]
*  And then we're going to expand basically, actually the WeWork model being ahead of its time, [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=2035.92s)]
*  we're going to have more smaller offices and more locations. And so we've opened formally in, [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=2040.96s)]
*  what have we announced so far? At least five, maybe six. Which ones have we announced? LA, [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=2046.64s)]
*  Menlo, SF, Miami, New York, New York 2, New York 3. I think that's it for the moment. Yeah, [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=2052.64s)]
*  yeah, we'll have more in the future. So yeah, we're going to accommodate. Now we're a [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=2063.6s)]
*  investment operation, not a product company, so we don't have assembly lines or software [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=2069.92s)]
*  production. So we have a simpler version of the problem, but we're letting our teams decide [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=2075.04s)]
*  basically how to distribute. So we have some teams that want to be in person. We have some [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=2079.28s)]
*  teams that want to be remote. And I would say, I think it's, oh, so we're doing all that. So the [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=2083.04s)]
*  way basically the firm runs now is we basically run the firm remote. Like all the formal meetings [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=2087.36s)]
*  are on Zoom. Everything is kind of equalized kind of that way. But the teams are free to cluster [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=2091.2s)]
*  whenever they want. And then we have a very big focus on two things. One is off sites. And so [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=2096.08s)]
*  every team is expected to get together on a frequent basis, and we really invest in that. [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=2102.24s)]
*  And then a lot more travel. And so I'm traveling. My steady state I think is going to be traveling [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=2106.24s)]
*  at like 4x the number of days that I used to travel. And all of a sudden it's even higher [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=2111.6s)]
*  impact than it used to be to actually show up someplace and actually be there in person. [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=2116.96s)]
*  So for us, it feels like a real broadening out of what a firm like ours is capable of doing. It [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=2121.2s)]
*  feels like a way to basically accommodate scale because we definitely felt bottlenecked where we [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=2125.68s)]
*  were. And so I think it's a way to run. Look, I think to Adam's point, we're feeling our way [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=2131.2s)]
*  through it. I think a lot, like I would say especially this, I talked to a lot of big company [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=2136.3199999999997s)]
*  CEOs, and I think they're all, and I think they would generally agree with this, they're all in [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=2139.9199999999996s)]
*  an intermediate state. They're all in some hybrid state where they kind of have a lot of vestiges [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=2144.08s)]
*  of the old model because they've got the offices they've got and they've got the employees that [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=2149.52s)]
*  live in the certain places. But they've also, they know that they can't go back to the way things [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=2153.04s)]
*  used to be. So they've all got some hybrid remote virtual thing. It's usually a two or three day [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=2156.4s)]
*  week thing. It's not working really well. They've got this big question of do they also hire remote [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=2160.32s)]
*  employees? Because if they do, then it brings up the issue of the current employees is why can't [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=2165.04s)]
*  they become remote? And then they've got, they basically all have to reinvent all the communication [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=2168.64s)]
*  flows, all the management systems. And then they've got this fundamental question for their people, [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=2173.84s)]
*  especially all the new hires, right? And you know, we're now, we're going to be on five years in [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=2177.84s)]
*  here pretty quick. And so there's an entire generation of kids coming out of school that [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=2181.36s)]
*  are going to go to work for these companies and they're going to have a different set of both [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=2184.7200000000003s)]
*  expectations and issues. And so this is why I think we're still at the beginning of the change. [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=2187.76s)]
*  I think we're three years into probably a 10 year process. And I think the level of reinvention is [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=2192.4s)]
*  going to be actually quite staggering from here. Yeah, I think that's right. I think we've [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=2196.8s)]
*  managed through it very well. We actually materialize where we need to and have a lot [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=2202.32s)]
*  more FaceTime. You know, I think, I mean, I see you all the time outside the office and I think [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=2206.56s)]
*  we get much more concentrated, focused time together to actually be productive. And it's, [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=2212.72s)]
*  you know, the hallway track is okay at the office, but it's a little bit superficial of how was your [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=2218.64s)]
*  weekend? What did you do? When you go to an offsite, it's just much more focused and conscientious [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=2223.12s)]
*  about what is important to us? What went well? What are we not doing? What do we want to be doing? [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=2227.36s)]
*  So my takeaway is that when we are together, it actually is way more productive. You know, [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=2232.16s)]
*  not that I don't care about your weekend. I do care, but, you know, it's not as important as [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=2235.84s)]
*  talking about the next 10 years of the firm. Yeah, I call this the barbell, right? So it's, [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=2240.1600000000003s)]
*  because everybody always asks, what about the water cooler moments? And I'm like, God, I hated [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=2244.48s)]
*  the water cooler moments. Like, I mean, like to have to stand there and like talk about the football [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=2247.76s)]
*  game. Like I can't, I can't. Temporary seems like a wonderful guy. I can't do this. It's very deflating. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=2252.7200000000003s)]
*  I'm going to have to, I'm going to have to push back on my partners a little bit. Okay, go ahead. [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=2260.48s)]
*  And yes, please go ahead for an investing firm. I accept. And I already said, you guys are not [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=2268.2400000000002s)]
*  just investors, you're partners in a business, man, an entrepreneur, and it's, it's factual. [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=2274.6400000000003s)]
*  I strongly feel, and Mark asked you what's important about this conference. And he said, [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=2279.84s)]
*  it's important to think a little bit how the future is going to look. Just an opinion. I've [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=2284.4s)]
*  been in a few offices. I strongly feel that the serendipitous connections, those, those, [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=2288.56s)]
*  so the water cooler is boring. They're interesting when you're building a company [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=2296.24s)]
*  and it's getting exciting and a new idea is coming and the whole team was supposed to go home [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=2300.48s)]
*  and it's 8pm and everybody told their husbands, their wives and their kids were being there in [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=2305.44s)]
*  30 minutes. And then someone went to the bathroom, sorry for the example, and comes back like, [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=2309.84s)]
*  I have it. And they say this thing that solves the entire problem. And everybody gets so excited. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=2314.72s)]
*  And before you know it, it's 2am. And we just moved the business forward, not by a week, [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=2320.56s)]
*  but by a year. And now it's 2am. It's very late. Everyone's sleeping already. Well, let's go out [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=2325.52s)]
*  and grab a drink. And now everybody's hanging out. And before you know it, you just had one of those [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=2329.7599999999998s)]
*  nights. That's a month. That's this moment in the life of a business that then you look back and [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=2333.8399999999997s)]
*  say, I know that day when it all changed. That special piece cannot happen on Zoom. [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=2338.72s)]
*  I think human potential is in the cloud, I believe it, but human interaction is happening right here. [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=2345.3599999999997s)]
*  And I actually think if you look 10 years forward, the companies that are going to make the effort [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=2351.4399999999996s)]
*  now to be face to face, now we can describe what face to face is, there are many ways to do it. [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=2355.2s)]
*  But the companies that are actually going to do the face to face, I think when we look back, [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=2359.6s)]
*  five years, maybe even 10, are going to be the winners. Obviously, I agree that the huge ones [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=2363.2799999999997s)]
*  who don't know what to do with themselves, that's an opportunity for incumbents to come. But when I'm [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=2367.76s)]
*  thinking of startups and new businesses, even strong new businesses, with my team, we're fighting for [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=2372.0800000000004s)]
*  that face to face time. And every time we're together, the excuse of having this event brought [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=2377.1200000000003s)]
*  a few of us together and three things came up about the business is we're thinking about just [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=2382.6400000000003s)]
*  what we're going to talk about. And I think that's priceless. Now take that because we agree that the [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=2386.48s)]
*  office is a challenge. Bring that back into your home. You're back in that multifamily building. [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=2391.92s)]
*  Why not have those connections there? Why shouldn't you meet here? And it makes a lot more sense for me, [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=2396.4s)]
*  by the way, that I'll meet my wife or my husband in the apartment building when I went downstairs [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=2400.32s)]
*  to the pool than I do in the office. So both of those things work really well. And from a business [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=2404.4s)]
*  point of view, I can do business there also. And then maybe there should be a co-working space. There [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=2409.04s)]
*  should be an office and maybe enterprises are going to look. So if enterprises need to do culture, [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=2413.28s)]
*  and if culture is not going to be in the office anymore, then maybe there's a new hybrid that has [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=2417.84s)]
*  to do with the home put together with an office space. Then I'll give one more thought that I have. [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=2421.6800000000003s)]
*  I think the fact that you guys have seven offices is the future. So I do think it's smaller offices [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=2426.16s)]
*  and centers. But it's going to be very hard for me to be convinced that not bringing people together [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=2430.96s)]
*  and not having human connection is in our nature. I don't think we're built to look at the screen. [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=2436.72s)]
*  And I think that one day when we're all much, much older and we're sick and we're on our deathbed, [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=2442.64s)]
*  and we're looking at ourselves and we have that moment of realization and we say, well, [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=2449.04s)]
*  how much time in my life did I spend with my loved ones and with people I really care about? [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=2452.72s)]
*  And how much time of my life did I spend in front of a screen? If that answer in front of a screen [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=2457.2799999999997s)]
*  is too big, I am not sure how we're going to feel that second before it's all over. [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=2462.24s)]
*  Look, I think we would all agree that you have to know what inning you're in, [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=2466.16s)]
*  sort of what time it is in your company. And there's definitely moments that matter where [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=2470.0s)]
*  you all want to be in a room working together. And if we do that, we would agree with that for sure. [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=2472.7999999999997s)]
*  So actually, let's talk about that. And you've kept a lot about flow close to the vest. [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=2477.9199999999996s)]
*  Give us a little bit about the vision. You've given us a little hint throughout your answers here. [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=2482.0s)]
*  But what are you really hoping to build with flow? [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=2485.6s)]
*  I actually thought because we were talking so much that I was going to keep it under my vest one more day. [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=2488.64s)]
*  Oh, yeah. Well? [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=2493.04s)]
*  I thought I was going to get away with it. [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=2493.7599999999998s)]
*  Well, first of all, same reason about keeping it under our vest. It's not that we've actually [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=2496.56s)]
*  been keeping it under our vest. It's that one of the many lessons that we learned from the past is [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=2500.56s)]
*  talk is cheap. We just want to build. We just want to it's a heavy lift and we just want to get to [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=2506.08s)]
*  work. So we had no reason to say anything. I met a nice person here earlier today who I think said [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=2511.68s)]
*  something about me when he was talking before. And I said, you know, that's not true what you said. [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=2517.28s)]
*  He goes, but that's what the media said. And I was like, well, I never spoke. [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=2521.6s)]
*  That's right. The media has never mischaracterized him either. So he then told me, he said, you know, [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=2525.36s)]
*  I'm not sure I buy into flow. I said, well, I never spoke about that either. [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=2529.92s)]
*  And in a very simple way, we want to create an elevated experience for the resident. [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=2533.68s)]
*  And we want to find a way to share with the resident a portion of the value that they create. [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=2541.44s)]
*  I'll give that a moment. We want to elevate their experience. We talked about the buildings. We [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=2548.7200000000003s)]
*  talked about everything that's happening. I actually think I don't think it's an easy job. [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=2553.04s)]
*  I think it's very hard, but I do think the bar is low. You just make a little more connections. [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=2556.48s)]
*  You just make it a little bit more real. You pay attention to the people running it. [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=2560.56s)]
*  You maintain it the right way. You leverage technology to actually make things work. [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=2564.16s)]
*  Instead of using nine apps, you use one. You do simple things and you elevate the experience. [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=2568.0s)]
*  But then the more complicated part is you find a way to share a portion of the value [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=2572.72s)]
*  with the resident itself. And that's the vision. And because we said that it's a majority of the [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=2578.32s)]
*  young adults and because Mark said that that's how people saw a few numbers behind that, for 80 [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=2587.2s)]
*  years, owning a home used to be the way that was the majority of us creating equity. And 60% of [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=2592.7999999999997s)]
*  Americans today, in average, their equity is in the home. That is the majority of equity. [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=2599.68s)]
*  So if we're correct and 70% are renters and that number is only going to go up, well, where are [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=2604.3999999999996s)]
*  they going to create equity? And if they're going to be renters for 10 years, 20 years, when you go [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=2609.3599999999997s)]
*  into these apartment buildings, and it's true about single family, but for today we'll talk [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=2614.56s)]
*  about apartments. If you're going to go into these multi-family buildings and you're going to have [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=2618.08s)]
*  this disconnected experience that you just said, but you're not only going to be there for two [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=2622.08s)]
*  years and then get married and move to home, you're going to be there for 20. That sounds [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=2625.76s)]
*  soul-crushing. And therefore you have to solve both of the sides. Can I ask myself the next [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=2629.76s)]
*  question? Sure. Adam, how are you going to solve both of the sides? That sounds really good, [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=2636.88s)]
*  but what are you actually going to do? Great question. Thank you. Thank you for that great [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=2640.16s)]
*  question. Well, we have four pillars as we're looking at the business today. We have the first [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=2643.28s)]
*  one, which is a branded technology-first management company that actually runs the buildings. [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=2651.28s)]
*  We have an asset management or real estate fund or real estate company that actually owns the [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=2657.28s)]
*  buildings. And something cool about our new business, we actually own buildings together [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=2662.2400000000002s)]
*  already. One of the biggest words that Mark and Ben used, as I said before, is alignment, alignment, [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=2666.2400000000002s)]
*  alignment. So for perfect alignment, we contributed into this business, at least as much as Andreessen [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=2671.68s)]
*  contributed into this business. And I'm very excited about it. And it's amazing to feel like that. [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=2677.6s)]
*  And then we have a financial services company. So number one, management company, branded [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=2683.4399999999996s)]
*  technology-first. Number two, real estate asset management, a company that can buy real estate [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=2689.04s)]
*  and asset manage real estate. Number three, financial services. And the fourth pillar is [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=2694.0s)]
*  this mechanism that's going to take some of the value and share it with the value creators. [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=2698.96s)]
*  And what we get so excited about the vision of Flow and the business of Flow is that it's actually [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=2703.6s)]
*  a flywheel. If we can actually create a better experience in the building, then the building [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=2709.2s)]
*  performs better and makes a higher NOI. If the building makes a higher NOI, then we'll be able [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=2713.68s)]
*  to raise more money and buy more buildings. If we buy more buildings, then we'll be able to run more [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=2718.7200000000003s)]
*  buildings and have more users in those buildings. And those users are going to start using our [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=2723.44s)]
*  financial services. Now, the reason they're going to use the financial services, the first thing you [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=2727.92s)]
*  do in buildings is you charge rent every month. And that's 35% of their total wallet. So that [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=2732.16s)]
*  payments company that's charging your rent already has a real relationship with the user. [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=2738.16s)]
*  If that financial services company is going to do what we want it to do and create services that [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=2742.7200000000003s)]
*  are actually meaningful, we call it, we think of it as financial wellness, and give services that [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=2747.04s)]
*  are actually meaningful, then that again is going to drive more users. And then if we are able to [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=2751.2000000000003s)]
*  take this value creating mechanism and share with the residents a portion of the value, [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=2756.16s)]
*  it's going to make them feel ownership. And it's not just ownership, I feel like I'm part of [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=2761.7599999999998s)]
*  something. It's I actually own part of something. And again, the word ownership is a very complicated [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=2766.08s)]
*  word, especially in this place. But if there's perceived value, and if that value appreciates [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=2771.52s)]
*  over time, then I feel like I'm part of a community. And a very funny example that we like to give is [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=2776.3999999999996s)]
*  if you're in your apartment building, and you're a renter and your toilet gets clogged, [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=2782.56s)]
*  you call the super. If you're in your own apartment, and you bought it and you own it and [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=2786.48s)]
*  your toilet gets clogged, you take the plunger. And it's the difference when feeling like you own [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=2790.88s)]
*  something to just feeling like you're renting from being transactional to actually being part of a [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=2796.4s)]
*  community. And our vision is to bring it all together. And just one more example of just to [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=2801.36s)]
*  put it into numbers. Average churn in property management, so average churn in multifamily in [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=2806.32s)]
*  this country is 50%. It means a user stays in average for two years. If the user now enjoys [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=2812.08s)]
*  their experience more and feels like they have a portion of the value and chooses to stay a little [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=2818.48s)]
*  longer, and that average churn goes down from 50% to 40%, without getting too deep into the numbers, [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=2822.96s)]
*  the NOI of the building will go up by approximately 5%, which increases the returns of the building [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=2830.48s)]
*  for those LPs, for the investors, by 500 basis points, which in real estate is an unheard of [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=2836.4s)]
*  number. And by tackling this challenge vertically is what Flow is planning to do. And as I said, [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=2842.56s)]
*  we're just getting started. Excellent. I'm going to wrap us up with a sort of combo question for [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=2852.0s)]
*  both of you. Are there any model cities that are sort of doing this right from a regulatory [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=2858.0s)]
*  standpoint, from a building standpoint, from a community, neighborhood standpoint? And then [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=2863.76s)]
*  part two is sort of what role does government have to play in sort of facilitating and improving [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=2868.4s)]
*  either home building, home ownership, and all these components? So we'll start with Mark. [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=2874.88s)]
*  Mark, yeah. Well, look, cities were start-ups at one point, right? So every city was a start-up. [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=2881.44s)]
*  And there's incredible stories, if you go back far enough, like creation of cities, [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=2889.2000000000003s)]
*  like Los Angeles or Washington, DC, for that matter. In the 20th century, that kind of went, [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=2893.36s)]
*  at least in the West, that kind of went out of fashion, became sort of an intractable thing to [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=2900.08s)]
*  try to do. There were some entrepreneurs who thought hard about it and gave shots at it. So [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=2904.1600000000003s)]
*  Walt Disney, right? Walt Disney had a whole vision. The Disney Company to this day has these planned [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=2908.48s)]
*  communities that kind of come from that. Walt Disney actually had this vision for, [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=2914.32s)]
*  actually had this thing called Epcot, the experimental prototype city of tomorrow. [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=2918.6400000000003s)]
*  You can see it in the museum. In San Francisco, if you go to the museum, you can see it. [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=2925.04s)]
*  Oh, is that right? Okay, yeah. [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=2928.56s)]
*  The whole thing. I think they still have the Epcot, the part of Epcot that got built, [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=2929.36s)]
*  I think, is still in Florida. So you can go visit, I think, the remnants of Epcot. So this is like [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=2933.04s)]
*  a sort of futurism from the 60s in Disney's mind. He passed away, and he wasn't able to [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=2938.88s)]
*  fully develop Epcot, but he was kind of reaching in this direction towards the end of his career. [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=2945.68s)]
*  And then there are other examples in the US. It's probably, what is it, Irvine took a big swing at [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=2950.64s)]
*  this and actually has been very successful. And then Venice Abbot Kinney in LA created the Venice [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=2955.8399999999997s)]
*  Canal as a sort of a planned community. So there are various ideas like this. It's been a long time [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=2963.7599999999998s)]
*  since somebody's really taken a hard swing. And so basically what you have are legacy systems. [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=2970.16s)]
*  You've just got this sort of entrenched, complicated power kind of system, local homeowners. [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=2974.96s)]
*  I mean, it almost seems deterministic that if a city becomes successful, basically the local [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=2980.48s)]
*  homeownership, whatever political base, devotes itself to preventing the construction of new [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=2984.4s)]
*  housing. And it seems like a real trap. So I'll add to what Mark is saying, but if a city was [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=2988.08s)]
*  a business, and it's an old business, and it's 30 years old, then you're going to say, [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=2994.64s)]
*  forget that business. We're going to start a new one. We're going to fund it. We're going to start [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=2998.2400000000002s)]
*  it. And we're going to take over. The problem with cities, they're built. So to go into a city [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=3001.2799999999997s)]
*  now and change, let's just start with something very simple. Most of the city is concrete and [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=3007.2799999999997s)]
*  roads where cars are driving. And there are so many new solutions. And you can already talk today [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=3011.3599999999997s)]
*  about what's happening. And anybody who knows New York City. And so when Uber was getting bigger [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=3015.9199999999996s)]
*  and bigger, how the yellow taxis started disappearing was an unbelievable experience. [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=3019.9199999999996s)]
*  And how the medallions that used to cost a million three sudden. So it is a very challenging thing [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=3024.48s)]
*  to actually reimagine a city when it's already built. And there's things you can do it. When [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=3030.32s)]
*  you look at these buildings, the single standing villages, yes, a building with 400 apartments, [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=3034.4s)]
*  we can reimagine what happens inside of it. But reimagining a city is a big undertaking. And [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=3038.56s)]
*  actually one of the only places actually in Saudi Arabia where I know some of the team members were [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=3044.4s)]
*  just there, they're actually going for it. So there are places in the world right now. And [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=3048.8s)]
*  it's very innovative. And it's very impressive that they're doing it, that people are actually [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=3053.6000000000004s)]
*  trying to build new cities. But the answer to that and sort of how government can help, [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=3058.16s)]
*  there are technology companies right now, construction companies, there are different things. [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=3063.12s)]
*  There's a construction company here called Icon that's using technology that the government is [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=3067.2799999999997s)]
*  going to need to partner with them at some point because they have found ways to build a home [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=3072.56s)]
*  in four days that used to take a year and a half. And as you can do more and more of those things, [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=3076.72s)]
*  what we're going to do is, I believe through innovative technologies, be able to build it [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=3083.12s)]
*  fast enough to give people the courage to go and build the new ones. But to go into the old ones [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=3087.04s)]
*  is very hard. A crazy idea is office now, everything that's happening in office. Can you go and convert [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=3091.84s)]
*  some of these dead offices into some new ideas? You could think about that. And I think the role [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=3096.88s)]
*  of government has always been very important for this country. I think for us at Flow, and this is [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=3101.7599999999998s)]
*  another lesson from the past, we used to think and I used to think we had to own everything. [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=3105.84s)]
*  I think the category is so big that the only way we're going to achieve anything is through [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=3110.56s)]
*  partnership, partnership with government, partnership with current players, and partnership [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=3114.56s)]
*  with new players that are going to come. And I think it's the only way to solve this problem. [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=3119.36s)]
*  And I'll finish by saying that I actually think the housing crisis that we described might be one of [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=3123.84s)]
*  the biggest challenges that the US is facing today. But the reason it's hard to understand it, it's [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=3128.96s)]
*  because if you really want to get it, it's five to 10 years down the road. The problem with housing, [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=3133.92s)]
*  it takes five to 10 years. And Mark, I agree with your assumption that we have about five years [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=3138.64s)]
*  to do something really big about it. And all I can tell you is I think we have the right team [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=3143.92s)]
*  to give it a shot. Excellent. Well, thank you both for being here. This is a great discussion. [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=3150.16s)]
*  We're going to wrap up and get everyone out of here and party tonight. Good. Thank you. [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=3155.84s)]
*  Thanks, everybody. [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=3159.92s)]
*  As a reminder, this conversation was part of A16C's American Dignism Summit in Washington, [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgK9KW9APfA&t=3168.32s)]
