# The Truth Behind Salary Transparency
**The a16z Podcast:** [September 21, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0QaLDVBzz4)
*  Starting in 2016, states started enacting laws requiring that companies post their pay ranges. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0QaLDVBzz4&t=0.0s)]
*  And now at least 10 states require it, with over a quarter of the U.S. labor force covered by salary transparency legislation. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0QaLDVBzz4&t=6.5600000000000005s)]
*  And as all of this is happening, a lot of companies are playing catch-up. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0QaLDVBzz4&t=15.0s)]
*  So in today's episode, we'll discuss how people are reacting to these new laws, the misunderstandings that do exist, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0QaLDVBzz4&t=19.400000000000002s)]
*  and also how companies can set themselves up to not just survive, but thrive in this new environment. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0QaLDVBzz4&t=25.72s)]
*  And we do that together with two people from A16Z's People Practices Team. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0QaLDVBzz4&t=32.04s)]
*  Shannon Schiltz, operating partner leading A16Z's People Practices Team, and Brandon Cherry, partner on the same team. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0QaLDVBzz4&t=36.32s)]
*  Let's get started. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0QaLDVBzz4&t=43.480000000000004s)]
*  As a reminder, the content here is for informational purposes only, should not be taken as legal, business, tax, or investment advice, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0QaLDVBzz4&t=45.519999999999996s)]

*  So pay transparency, I feel like this is a new-ish concept. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0QaLDVBzz4&t=72.48s)]
*  Maybe 10 years ago, certainly 20 years ago, pay was not very transparent. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0QaLDVBzz4&t=85.04s)]
*  And so you guys have both been working in this industry for a while. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0QaLDVBzz4&t=89.64s)]
*  Tell me a little bit more about how you've seen that change, maybe that information asymmetry, especially in the last few years. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0QaLDVBzz4&t=92.84s)]
*  You know, it's funny that you say that. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0QaLDVBzz4&t=99.36s)]
*  I was just trying to think of what year pay transparency became a thing. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0QaLDVBzz4&t=100.67999999999999s)]
*  I think it was 2010, because that's 13 years ago. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0QaLDVBzz4&t=105.0s)]
*  So before any of this was truly enacted in law. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0QaLDVBzz4&t=107.67999999999999s)]
*  It became more of a cultural thing, right? [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0QaLDVBzz4&t=110.52s)]
*  And it became very much a Silicon Valley thing, too, that people should just be, you should feel confident with what you pay each employee. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0QaLDVBzz4&t=112.39999999999999s)]
*  And if somebody else finds out about it, you should be able to justify it. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0QaLDVBzz4&t=121.39999999999999s)]
*  And historically, that was generally reserved for government jobs, teachers. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0QaLDVBzz4&t=124.60000000000001s)]
*  You get a master's degree, you get this much more, this many more dollars. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0QaLDVBzz4&t=130.04s)]
*  There was like real clarity. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0QaLDVBzz4&t=133.6s)]
*  And it was structured around achieve this or do this or have this. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0QaLDVBzz4&t=135.04s)]
*  You get more money. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0QaLDVBzz4&t=138.48s)]
*  But in non-government, non-education industries, it was probably a widely known secret that people talked about their compensation. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0QaLDVBzz4&t=139.6s)]
*  It just decided that we're going to bring it to the front so that there's actually insight and rational thinking around how much [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0QaLDVBzz4&t=148.16s)]
*  you're paid and why, which was really powerful for employees. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0QaLDVBzz4&t=154.48s)]
*  Yeah, it is powerful. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0QaLDVBzz4&t=157.95999999999998s)]
*  I mean, it seems like a no brainer that that should exist, that companies should think critically about how their compensation is structured. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0QaLDVBzz4&t=158.76s)]
*  But to your point, that's not always the case. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0QaLDVBzz4&t=165.48s)]
*  But now it may be forcibly the case because there are new laws in some states, not all, where they are required when you when you post a job to have transparent ranges. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0QaLDVBzz4&t=167.67999999999998s)]
*  And so let's talk about that. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0QaLDVBzz4&t=178.56s)]
*  What have you seen in terms of some of the legislation or the rules that are now in place that kind of force companies to think a little bit harder about this? [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0QaLDVBzz4&t=179.76s)]
*  And I think it was 2016 was the first time the law came out that if you are interviewing a candidate, they can ask for the pay range for the role. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0QaLDVBzz4&t=187.76s)]
*  And you have to be able to within 24 hours share with the candidate what the pay range is. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0QaLDVBzz4&t=196.92s)]
*  And that, I think, was 2016. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0QaLDVBzz4&t=202.28s)]
*  And I remember when that happened, like we worked with a lot of our portfolio companies on thinking through what is your pay structure. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0QaLDVBzz4&t=204.48s)]
*  And then it's just been a slow and steady progression of around compensation, around equality of compensation. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0QaLDVBzz4&t=210.4s)]
*  The interesting thing is, is there is this law of pay transparency. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0QaLDVBzz4&t=218.92s)]
*  If you think about the best practices on how to build a company, the earlier you think about putting a compensation structure in place, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0QaLDVBzz4&t=222.52s)]
*  the stronger and healthier your company is because you have consistency, not fairness, consistency. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0QaLDVBzz4&t=231.0s)]
*  My favorite. I love to differentiate there. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0QaLDVBzz4&t=236.44s)]
*  Wait, maybe you can actually differentiate. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0QaLDVBzz4&t=238.68s)]
*  Like, what is the difference there that you see? [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0QaLDVBzz4&t=240.48s)]
*  Well, you people will say, like, I don't think it's fair that that person is making what they're making. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0QaLDVBzz4&t=242.16s)]
*  Well, let's dive into what that role is, the scope, the impact, the influence, what is the role. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0QaLDVBzz4&t=246.96s)]
*  That's what someone's being comped against. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0QaLDVBzz4&t=255.84s)]
*  When somebody comes and says, my comp's not fair compared to that person, you should be able to come back and say, no, for each role, [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0QaLDVBzz4&t=258.16s)]
*  we are benchmarking against this data and we target the 50th percentile. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0QaLDVBzz4&t=265.0s)]
*  That's consistency. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0QaLDVBzz4&t=270.44s)]
*  That might mean this role makes $100,000 a year and this role makes $80,000 a year. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0QaLDVBzz4&t=271.88s)]
*  But an employee comes talking about fairness. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0QaLDVBzz4&t=277.24s)]
*  You don't get a lot of people saying, you know what, I don't want a merit increase. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0QaLDVBzz4&t=280.56s)]
*  That's too much money for what I'm doing. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0QaLDVBzz4&t=284.32s)]
*  Not many people will say that. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0QaLDVBzz4&t=286.12s)]
*  And so what a company needs to have in place are those conditions for success that will enable them to react and respond to pay transparency. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0QaLDVBzz4&t=287.8s)]
*  If you've got a comp philosophy that tells you how you look at the competitive market, [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0QaLDVBzz4&t=295.08s)]
*  how you position yourself against the competitive market, [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0QaLDVBzz4&t=299.32s)]
*  a leveling architecture that clarifies where a role sits in the career progression of any potential job, [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0QaLDVBzz4&t=301.92s)]
*  you can then lean on that to drive a consistent conversation with the backstop of that consistent infrastructure. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0QaLDVBzz4&t=309.56s)]
*  And then it clarifies and sort of codifies how the company thinks about compensation relative to their employees. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0QaLDVBzz4&t=316.44s)]
*  And as opposed to having this black box ambiguous way in which compensation is set, [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0QaLDVBzz4&t=322.08s)]
*  it sort of... [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0QaLDVBzz4&t=327.08s)]
*  To trust. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0QaLDVBzz4&t=328.96s)]
*  It is. It limits cross-employee competition. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0QaLDVBzz4&t=329.8s)]
*  The outcome is incredibly beneficial to companies. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0QaLDVBzz4&t=333.28s)]
*  It's just painful to be able to articulate it if you don't have those things in place. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0QaLDVBzz4&t=337.15999999999997s)]
*  Companies are now having to react to some of these changes in law. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0QaLDVBzz4&t=341.56s)]
*  And I'm just so curious to hear what you're seeing in terms of the reactions. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0QaLDVBzz4&t=345.28s)]
*  Are they abiding? Are they struggling to catch up? [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0QaLDVBzz4&t=349.84s)]
*  Some are just saying we're going to be in a wait and see. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0QaLDVBzz4&t=353.03999999999996s)]
*  We're going to see how enforceable these laws are, how much audits are taking place, what becomes of this new law. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0QaLDVBzz4&t=355.76s)]
*  There's companies that are saying we're just not going to do it, so we're not going to post our jobs. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0QaLDVBzz4&t=364.59999999999997s)]
*  Because that's the most visible thing that's come out of it, [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0QaLDVBzz4&t=370.2s)]
*  is you have to have a salary range posted with your jobs. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0QaLDVBzz4&t=373.0s)]
*  Yep. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0QaLDVBzz4&t=376.23999999999995s)]
*  And then the third piece is you have companies that are saying you could make between... [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0QaLDVBzz4&t=377.71999999999997s)]
*  This role pays $65,000 a year up to $2.5 million a year, right? [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0QaLDVBzz4&t=381.79999999999995s)]
*  And somewhere in there, we're going to pay someone. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0QaLDVBzz4&t=386.96s)]
*  And so I would say those are probably the three things that we see companies doing. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0QaLDVBzz4&t=390.08s)]
*  Absolutely. Those are three choices companies have. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0QaLDVBzz4&t=394.12s)]
*  There's just a lot of concern over making sure that not only do they understand how to comply from a regulatory standpoint, [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0QaLDVBzz4&t=396.44s)]
*  but also what does this do to our employee population? [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0QaLDVBzz4&t=402.6s)]
*  Like who's going to see this? How is this going to work? [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0QaLDVBzz4&t=405.32000000000005s)]
*  And if we do have $60,000 to $2.5 million, are we prepared? [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0QaLDVBzz4&t=408.36s)]
*  And do we have the ability to say, no, for you it's 60, for other people it's 2.5. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0QaLDVBzz4&t=413.24s)]
*  How do you have that conversation? [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0QaLDVBzz4&t=418.84000000000003s)]
*  But for every company, it's going to be very specific to where they're located, the kinds of employee populations they have, [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0QaLDVBzz4&t=420.92s)]
*  how clear and how strong their infrastructure is, and how they feel like they're prepared to have those conversations. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0QaLDVBzz4&t=427.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0QaLDVBzz4&t=432.64000000000004s)]
*  And again, it goes back to the basics, right? [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0QaLDVBzz4&t=432.96000000000004s)]
*  If you have the structure. So for us, it was relatively straightforward. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0QaLDVBzz4&t=434.68s)]
*  We have the structure here. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0QaLDVBzz4&t=438.84000000000003s)]
*  And so we could post roles and put a salary range out there. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0QaLDVBzz4&t=440.6s)]
*  We set it up so we can defend it. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0QaLDVBzz4&t=445.72s)]
*  The interesting thing that happens, though, is again, the number of times that somebody sees a job posted [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0QaLDVBzz4&t=448.8s)]
*  and thinks, well, that's what I do, but I don't make that. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0QaLDVBzz4&t=456.12s)]
*  You have to be ready to have those conversations and get your managers ready to have a conversation on why actually this is a level above you. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0QaLDVBzz4&t=459.47999999999996s)]
*  And you can progress into it. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0QaLDVBzz4&t=466.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0QaLDVBzz4&t=467.76s)]
*  But that's not where you're at right now. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0QaLDVBzz4&t=468.36s)]
*  And that's a hard conversation. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0QaLDVBzz4&t=470.24s)]
*  All right. Let's start to think about how companies actually build this because a lot of companies don't have this in place or just in the early innings. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0QaLDVBzz4&t=471.59999999999997s)]
*  And so if you are a company that, let's say, has I think the California threshold is 15 employees and all 15 of those employees have been hired in disparate ways, paid in disparate ways, [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0QaLDVBzz4&t=479.28000000000003s)]
*  there's no sort of underlying strategy or structure. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0QaLDVBzz4&t=489.68s)]
*  Like, how do you even go about thinking about how to start setting that up? [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0QaLDVBzz4&t=492.92s)]
*  The three core tenets are what we've talked about before. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0QaLDVBzz4&t=496.6s)]
*  You need to be able to articulate your philosophy on compensation. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0QaLDVBzz4&t=499.36s)]
*  Not everybody is going to be able to compete with a $10 billion in revenue publicly traded company on a cash basis. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0QaLDVBzz4&t=503.24s)]
*  So you need to own the philosophy that you believe will drive the kinds of outcomes that you want as a company. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0QaLDVBzz4&t=510.28000000000003s)]
*  So your compensation philosophy in terms of how you define your competitive market, companies of your size and scale, and where you position against that competitive market data is really important. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0QaLDVBzz4&t=515.28s)]
*  That sets the tone for then how you think about driving market data through your comp philosophy to determine those ranges. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0QaLDVBzz4&t=524.72s)]
*  The other element is your leveling architecture, how you define what it means to be an early career employee versus a seasoned individual contributor versus a first time manager versus a seasoned leader. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0QaLDVBzz4&t=531.76s)]
*  That's your leveling architecture. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0QaLDVBzz4&t=542.16s)]
*  So between your philosophy and your leveling architecture and the third party market data that you use to determine that relationship, [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0QaLDVBzz4&t=543.56s)]
*  you can set your ranges very consistent with what you should be providing to candidates and articulate to current employees when they request. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0QaLDVBzz4&t=550.92s)]
*  I think one thing that many companies would be maybe scared of is developing this system. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0QaLDVBzz4&t=559.24s)]
*  And then again, as we talked about, it impacts employees who are already there, not just new employees. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0QaLDVBzz4&t=567.0s)]
*  So should there ever be exceptions? [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0QaLDVBzz4&t=572.6s)]
*  I feel like this is something that comes up as different managers are talking about top talent. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0QaLDVBzz4&t=575.36s)]
*  You hear about the 10x engineer. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0QaLDVBzz4&t=579.5600000000001s)]
*  Can they really fit into something so structured like that? [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0QaLDVBzz4&t=581.48s)]
*  When I talked to portfolio companies about performance management. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0QaLDVBzz4&t=585.4s)]
*  The thing I always talk about and it comes back to compensation a lot of times, especially around equity, [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0QaLDVBzz4&t=588.52s)]
*  which is there is a top 10% of your organization that isn't just the best performer, but they're critical. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0QaLDVBzz4&t=592.96s)]
*  And what I mean by critical is if they left tomorrow, something stops working. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0QaLDVBzz4&t=599.64s)]
*  Single point of failure. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0QaLDVBzz4&t=605.08s)]
*  Single point of failure. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0QaLDVBzz4&t=606.08s)]
*  And that like those ranges like they might not fit into a range, but pay transparency says why? [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0QaLDVBzz4&t=607.76s)]
*  Why is this a one off? [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0QaLDVBzz4&t=614.9200000000001s)]
*  And you can justify it. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0QaLDVBzz4&t=618.3199999999999s)]
*  And so this is where I always go back to the fairness versus consistency. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0QaLDVBzz4&t=619.92s)]
*  Consistency is consistency. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0QaLDVBzz4&t=623.52s)]
*  If you define critical talent as being above range, that's being consistent. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0QaLDVBzz4&t=625.28s)]
*  Like you have to be classified as that type of individual. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0QaLDVBzz4&t=630.0s)]
*  And this happens in companies all the time that like their software architect, their designer, [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0QaLDVBzz4&t=633.1999999999999s)]
*  their person that is like doing something that's so incredibly critical that everything stops. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0QaLDVBzz4&t=640.76s)]
*  And so as long as you're working it into your overall philosophy, it's still consistent. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0QaLDVBzz4&t=646.4s)]
*  You know, a lot of times we'll talk about the building the ranges. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0QaLDVBzz4&t=651.48s)]
*  It's not done in a vacuum. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0QaLDVBzz4&t=653.4s)]
*  Shannon's brought up an incredibly important point. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0QaLDVBzz4&t=654.48s)]
*  The consistency is really about the design and the process that you use to determine where you sit. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0QaLDVBzz4&t=657.0s)]
*  The flexibility comes in other tools that the HR ecosystem should have in place. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0QaLDVBzz4&t=663.52s)]
*  Things like performance management, assessment of talent, assessment of candidates. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0QaLDVBzz4&t=667.36s)]
*  Those are the things that give you the flexibility and the freedom to say, [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0QaLDVBzz4&t=671.76s)]
*  this person is a single point of failure. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0QaLDVBzz4&t=675.68s)]
*  The opportunity cost of losing this person and their criticality to this company, [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0QaLDVBzz4&t=677.1999999999999s)]
*  commands that we have to make sure that we put them in a position to retain them. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0QaLDVBzz4&t=683.04s)]
*  And so the consistency in the application of the data and the design of the compensation infrastructure is incredibly important. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0QaLDVBzz4&t=686.4s)]
*  The application is where you need to be able to recognize the flexibility that's necessary to grow and run a business. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0QaLDVBzz4&t=693.12s)]
*  So we always try and get companies to do it before they're like 50 employees. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0QaLDVBzz4&t=700.4399999999999s)]
*  And this has actually helped us, right? [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0QaLDVBzz4&t=703.64s)]
*  Pay transparency would be much easier. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0QaLDVBzz4&t=705.7199999999999s)]
*  And we've always said to people, the bigger your organization, the harder this project is. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0QaLDVBzz4&t=707.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0QaLDVBzz4&t=711.0799999999999s)]
*  So the first thing you do is you have to remove all the humans from the project. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0QaLDVBzz4&t=711.5999999999999s)]
*  What do you mean by that? [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0QaLDVBzz4&t=715.64s)]
*  Like the names and the actual human beings. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0QaLDVBzz4&t=716.4399999999999s)]
*  And you build the infrastructure of how many levels are we going to have? [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0QaLDVBzz4&t=720.28s)]
*  What scope and what is it typically? [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0QaLDVBzz4&t=725.16s)]
*  It's years of experience. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0QaLDVBzz4&t=727.16s)]
*  It's scope. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0QaLDVBzz4&t=729.4799999999999s)]
*  It's impact. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0QaLDVBzz4&t=730.28s)]
*  It's influence. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0QaLDVBzz4&t=731.3199999999999s)]
*  Freedom to operate. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0QaLDVBzz4&t=732.28s)]
*  These are all the different pieces that you put into a leveling criteria. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0QaLDVBzz4&t=733.92s)]
*  Okay. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0QaLDVBzz4&t=737.2s)]
*  And then from there, you build out different levels. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0QaLDVBzz4&t=737.72s)]
*  You then pull in your market data. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0QaLDVBzz4&t=742.0s)]
*  Right? [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0QaLDVBzz4&t=743.88s)]
*  You identify who are our peers, what's our market data. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0QaLDVBzz4&t=744.48s)]
*  Then you go through the process of once you have all of that structure, you start leveling people just off of the leveling criteria. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0QaLDVBzz4&t=747.08s)]
*  And you always find folks that are either way above range or way below range. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0QaLDVBzz4&t=754.16s)]
*  I guess final question is we're talking about these smaller companies who at the beginning, it's just like the founders trying to figure this out, piece together data from PAVE or somewhere else. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0QaLDVBzz4&t=760.76s)]
*  And at what point is it really the time where you should be bringing in someone like yourselves to figure this out? [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0QaLDVBzz4&t=768.64s)]
*  Your early stage, you just have to get you have to get stuff done. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0QaLDVBzz4&t=776.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0QaLDVBzz4&t=780.0s)]
*  And then you get to like, I would say, you know, we have early stage companies, we have, you know, our venture, which is A, B, C rounds. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0QaLDVBzz4&t=780.76s)]
*  Right. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0QaLDVBzz4&t=790.12s)]
*  And then we have growth. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0QaLDVBzz4&t=790.4s)]
*  And I would say it's typically once they're once they're getting a good infusion of money and they're going to start scaling on hiring that it's like, this is a great time. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0QaLDVBzz4&t=791.76s)]
*  It doesn't have to be complex, but put something in place so that you you feel like you're being consistent. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0QaLDVBzz4&t=802.9599999999999s)]
*  We hear companies say, well, this feels very limiting. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0QaLDVBzz4&t=810.24s)]
*  And then the ranges aren't necessarily rules. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0QaLDVBzz4&t=813.12s)]
*  They're guideposts. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0QaLDVBzz4&t=816.84s)]
*  And more importantly, they surface the trade off decisions that you make as a company along the way. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0QaLDVBzz4&t=818.44s)]
*  And instead of just making decisions without understanding the consequences of those decisions, your compensation infrastructure, your ranges, your leveling criteria all give you an idea of when you're making guiding principles to get you to where you should be. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0QaLDVBzz4&t=823.12s)]
*  And then you can you can say, OK, we choose to do this. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0QaLDVBzz4&t=837.36s)]
*  We need to make sure that we understand why. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0QaLDVBzz4&t=840.0s)]
*  And then and then we're good with that because this is a key hire where we have looked for this role for 12 months and have not been able to fill it. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0QaLDVBzz4&t=842.52s)]
*  And now we're going to. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0QaLDVBzz4&t=849.8s)]
*  And I would say even more importantly, I would say it's less we've looked for this role for 12 months. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0QaLDVBzz4&t=850.64s)]
*  It's like this new technology is swooping in and we actually found someone that knows how to do it. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0QaLDVBzz4&t=855.9599999999999s)]
*  Right. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0QaLDVBzz4&t=862.52s)]
*  You don't want someone who's just everyone's negotiating and you're paying whatever somebody negotiates because there's like a lot of there's a lot of bias around that. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0QaLDVBzz4&t=864.48s)]
*  But there are going to be points in time like never in a million years did I think that we would see how the market was increasing as it was pre 2022, half of like the second half of 2022. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0QaLDVBzz4&t=872.76s)]
*  You never had to move your ranges. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0QaLDVBzz4&t=885.84s)]
*  Your midpoint might move. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0QaLDVBzz4&t=888.3199999999999s)]
*  We were in a set. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0QaLDVBzz4&t=890.04s)]
*  We were in a constant progression of like you have to move your ranges almost every year because the market was dictating. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0QaLDVBzz4&t=891.0s)]
*  So it's it's being flexible again, guiding principles, not laws. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0QaLDVBzz4&t=897.8s)]
*  And one of the biggest red flags is if you find yourself I call it vapor lock. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0QaLDVBzz4&t=902.3199999999999s)]
*  I don't know what the right term is, but like spinning on should the range be plus or minus seven percent or five percent. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0QaLDVBzz4&t=907.4s)]
*  You know, and you're a 30 person company. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0QaLDVBzz4&t=915.1999999999999s)]
*  It's not a good use of time. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0QaLDVBzz4&t=918.72s)]
*  And you're and it's and it's great to see that kind of passion around the around that conversation. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0QaLDVBzz4&t=919.8s)]
*  But if you spend 10 weeks trying to figure out exactly how your ranges should be built and you're a 20 person company, you should know that it's likely going to change in 12 to 18 months. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0QaLDVBzz4&t=924.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0QaLDVBzz4&t=934.76s)]
*  And so right back at it again, the guiding principles point and and also the evolution point. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0QaLDVBzz4&t=935.16s)]
*  It's it's important to have a way in which you define those things, but recognizing that that range will change or your leveling architecture will change or the types of programs. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0QaLDVBzz4&t=942.28s)]
*  You might roll a bonus plan at some point on top and you don't need to move the base salary ranges as much because you've got the performance management infrastructure. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0QaLDVBzz4&t=953.4s)]
*  So it's a multivariable equation. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0QaLDVBzz4&t=960.36s)]
*  And it's also important to to balance the time that you dedicate to this process with sort of the return on that investment. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0QaLDVBzz4&t=962.8s)]
*  All right. That is all for today's video. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0QaLDVBzz4&t=971.04s)]
*  However, if you enjoyed it, we have a lot more where it came from. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0QaLDVBzz4&t=972.9599999999999s)]
