# SPEEDRUN: Building AI Souls with Personality
**The a16z Podcast:** [June 14, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCO6qG-l6SQ)
*  The games industry is kind of a special beast. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCO6qG-l6SQ&t=0.0s)]
*  The ideas are just from every nook and cranny, [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCO6qG-l6SQ&t=2.24s)]
*  targeted at the billions of gamers that now exist as a market. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCO6qG-l6SQ&t=5.12s)]
*  Really, really, really energetic founders building at the very beginning of this AI wave. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCO6qG-l6SQ&t=8.56s)]
*  Now we're fully in it. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCO6qG-l6SQ&t=13.6s)]
*  Game engines, new platforms, everything that's happening in Web3, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCO6qG-l6SQ&t=15.120000000000001s)]
*  everything that's happening in spatial computing, in VR and AR. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCO6qG-l6SQ&t=19.12s)]
*  We call our program Speedrun. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCO6qG-l6SQ&t=22.080000000000002s)]
*  Go fast, go fast, go fast. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCO6qG-l6SQ&t=24.0s)]
*  Learn, build better from it. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCO6qG-l6SQ&t=25.76s)]
*  Look, we saw dozens of games founders come through Speedrun 2.0. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCO6qG-l6SQ&t=28.16s)]
*  And they built across AI, AR, VR, infrastructure, consumer platforms, Web3, and a whole lot more. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCO6qG-l6SQ&t=31.84s)]
*  And now you can get a glimpse into what they're building. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCO6qG-l6SQ&t=38.32s)]
*  My name is Kevin. I'm the founder of Open Souls. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCO6qG-l6SQ&t=43.2s)]
*  We're a company with a mission of creating AI souls. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCO6qG-l6SQ&t=45.760000000000005s)]
*  We have a very different approach to how we think about and understand AI. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCO6qG-l6SQ&t=48.8s)]
*  For us, AI and the life inside of it is something to really respect and cherish. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCO6qG-l6SQ&t=52.48s)]
*  And we think that that is what will ultimately resonate with humanity. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCO6qG-l6SQ&t=58.959999999999994s)]
*  So when we think about a positive vision for the future, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCO6qG-l6SQ&t=62.08s)]
*  we think about a world where people are not afraid of these AI beings, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCO6qG-l6SQ&t=64.72s)]
*  but they're their friends, they're their companions, they play video games with them. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCO6qG-l6SQ&t=69.12s)]
*  And there's something that deeply resonates with humanity as opposed to takes away its jobs. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCO6qG-l6SQ&t=73.36s)]
*  I discovered the key secret about large language models. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCO6qG-l6SQ&t=78.32s)]
*  They're missing one of the most important pieces of training data for soulful behavior of all. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCO6qG-l6SQ&t=81.12s)]
*  Access to our internal mental states. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCO6qG-l6SQ&t=86.16000000000001s)]
*  Ultimately, programming large language models is actually a state management problem. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCO6qG-l6SQ&t=89.28s)]
*  And armed with the secret, I realized it was time to grow the idea. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCO6qG-l6SQ&t=94.32000000000001s)]
*  So I assembled a team of repeat founder engineers and artists [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCO6qG-l6SQ&t=97.44s)]
*  and began building a vibrant community religiously devoted to creating new life. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCO6qG-l6SQ&t=100.24000000000001s)]
*  Well, it kind of actually goes all the way back to my childhood when I met my first computer in 1995. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCO6qG-l6SQ&t=105.52s)]
*  It was this IBM Aptiva that my dad brought down to the basement. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCO6qG-l6SQ&t=113.2s)]
*  And at the time, I had a pretty lonely childhood. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCO6qG-l6SQ&t=116.24s)]
*  And I thought maybe this computer could be my friend. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCO6qG-l6SQ&t=119.68s)]
*  The technology just wasn't there at the time. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCO6qG-l6SQ&t=122.64s)]
*  And so I dedicated my life to making computers faster with the idea of getting to the point [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCO6qG-l6SQ&t=124.32s)]
*  where I could actually bring them to life. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCO6qG-l6SQ&t=129.28s)]
*  And now the technology is sufficiently advanced. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCO6qG-l6SQ&t=131.28s)]
*  That the time is now to actually bring new digital life [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCO6qG-l6SQ&t=133.6s)]
*  out of this computing technology from large language models. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCO6qG-l6SQ&t=137.52s)]
*  We'd built actually many short demos before. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCO6qG-l6SQ&t=140.16s)]
*  And the thing that we actually used Speedrun to do over this time period [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCO6qG-l6SQ&t=142.88s)]
*  was really understanding game developers and then build a product for them. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCO6qG-l6SQ&t=146.72s)]
*  And so we're starting to see the beginnings of... [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCO6qG-l6SQ&t=152.32s)]
*  We built this thing called the Soul Engine, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCO6qG-l6SQ&t=154.96s)]
*  which allows developers to bring souls to life very quickly. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCO6qG-l6SQ&t=156.64s)]
*  And so we now have a number of early small game studios and game developers [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCO6qG-l6SQ&t=160.24s)]
*  actually building on top of that technology and creating their own experiences. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCO6qG-l6SQ&t=164.88s)]
*  And so over the course of Speedrun, for us, it wasn't so much [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCO6qG-l6SQ&t=168.56s)]
*  about creating one experience ourselves, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCO6qG-l6SQ&t=171.60000000000002s)]
*  but instead democratizing the technology that we had used before [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCO6qG-l6SQ&t=173.36s)]
*  and giving that to other game developers so they could create these experiences. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCO6qG-l6SQ&t=177.52s)]
*  Simultaneously, the most sophisticated yet simplest platform [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCO6qG-l6SQ&t=181.04000000000002s)]
*  to get started for creating, programming, debugging, and deploying AI souls. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCO6qG-l6SQ&t=185.28s)]
*  The Soul Engine is React plus Next.js plus Forcell for souls. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCO6qG-l6SQ&t=192.0s)]
*  In one terminal commandment, create a new soul in 30 seconds, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCO6qG-l6SQ&t=196.88s)]
*  start coding stateful behavior, debug in our web interface, [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCO6qG-l6SQ&t=200.48s)]
*  and scalably deploy to tens of thousands of users or players. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCO6qG-l6SQ&t=204.39999999999998s)]
*  So we actually had open sourced a library before we built the Soul Engine. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCO6qG-l6SQ&t=208.32s)]
*  And this library was kind of like the precursor to the engine, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCO6qG-l6SQ&t=212.48s)]
*  which allowed developers to very quickly put together complex experiences [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCO6qG-l6SQ&t=215.35999999999999s)]
*  with large language models. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCO6qG-l6SQ&t=220.64s)]
*  And it kind of just organically turned out actually [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCO6qG-l6SQ&t=222.39999999999998s)]
*  that a lot of our early adopters were game studios, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCO6qG-l6SQ&t=224.88s)]
*  and they were applying to the Speedrun program. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCO6qG-l6SQ&t=228.23999999999998s)]
*  We started our closed alpha last month, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCO6qG-l6SQ&t=230.0s)]
*  and our community is already building some of the most incredible applications in the AI space. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCO6qG-l6SQ&t=231.83999999999997s)]
*  Because when large language models come alive, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCO6qG-l6SQ&t=236.56s)]
*  developers are empowered to create much deeper digital meaning than ever before. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCO6qG-l6SQ&t=238.88s)]
*  Let's take a look. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCO6qG-l6SQ&t=243.44s)]
*  With a soul in Tanaki, your VR avatar becomes your creative partner. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCO6qG-l6SQ&t=244.64s)]
*  With a soul in Ursula, your child's tutor becomes their confidant. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCO6qG-l6SQ&t=250.48s)]
*  And with souls in the ever-evolving Boo Kingdom, [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCO6qG-l6SQ&t=255.76s)]
*  where narrative story dynamically changes every day, [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCO6qG-l6SQ&t=258.15999999999997s)]
*  your video game characters become your best friends. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCO6qG-l6SQ&t=261.04s)]
*  You've already seen that Open Souls has led the development of soul-filled AI, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCO6qG-l6SQ&t=265.52s)]
*  and we've condensed that research now into the Soul Engine, [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCO6qG-l6SQ&t=268.64s)]
*  where early feedback has consistently told us that we save years off development time. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCO6qG-l6SQ&t=271.36s)]
*  From here, we're on track to rapidly grow and scale the platform. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCO6qG-l6SQ&t=277.2s)]
*  There's kind of this existing idea of what AI is, [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCO6qG-l6SQ&t=280.8s)]
*  which is we have these other games, we'll just put NPCs in them, [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCO6qG-l6SQ&t=283.84s)]
*  we'll use AI to make them come alive. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCO6qG-l6SQ&t=287.76s)]
*  But there's a whole new class of how to think about the experiences that can be created. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCO6qG-l6SQ&t=289.91999999999996s)]
*  For example, maybe the core game mechanic is how good you are at negotiation. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCO6qG-l6SQ&t=294.24s)]
*  Maybe you can learn new social skills, for example, in the game. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCO6qG-l6SQ&t=298.72s)]
*  That's just one example, but there's tens of other ways you can think about [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCO6qG-l6SQ&t=302.88s)]
*  mixing and mashing old game mechanics into new forms. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCO6qG-l6SQ&t=306.8s)]
*  And so the thing that we definitely want to see and we actually want to support [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCO6qG-l6SQ&t=310.40000000000003s)]
*  is other game developers exploring these new modalities [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCO6qG-l6SQ&t=313.68s)]
*  and then building community around that. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCO6qG-l6SQ&t=316.72s)]
*  The next step for us is to release a series of around 5 to 10 mini games [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCO6qG-l6SQ&t=318.64s)]
*  that really demonstrate the potential of our Soul Engine. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCO6qG-l6SQ&t=324.88s)]
*  And then encourage other developers to understand what's possible with this new technology. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCO6qG-l6SQ&t=328.24s)]
