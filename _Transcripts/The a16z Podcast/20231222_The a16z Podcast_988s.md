*  our investments, please see a16z.com slash disclosures. I'm Angela Strange, a general [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTHDPupEWa8&t=91.6s)]
*  partner on the A16Z FinTech team. And I think in 2024 will be a significant rise of the developer [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTHDPupEWa8&t=101.44s)]
*  as the buyer in financial services. Historically, financial services infrastructure purchases were [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTHDPupEWa8&t=108.72s)]
*  mostly driven by the economic buyer. What's my ROI? Or the business lead? Does this solve my use [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTHDPupEWa8&t=114.48s)]
*  case? But there is now a third increasingly influential constituent, the developer. Look no [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTHDPupEWa8&t=119.76s)]
*  further than Moves' growing FinTech Developer Conference and associated 4,000 strong community. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTHDPupEWa8&t=125.92s)]
*  In tandem, developers at larger financial institutions and insurance companies are [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTHDPupEWa8&t=132.0s)]
*  becoming more influential in buying decisions. The rise of a developer as buyer in financial [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTHDPupEWa8&t=136.08s)]
*  services companies of all sizes favors new entrants. For FinTech companies that pride [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTHDPupEWa8&t=140.4s)]
*  themselves on a great developer experience, this will play to their advantage. FinTechs are already [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTHDPupEWa8&t=145.84s)]
*  prioritizing the creation of developer sandboxes to let customers try before you buy and are even [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTHDPupEWa8&t=151.52s)]
*  open sourcing parts of their solutions. The developer buyer would, of course, prefer to get [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTHDPupEWa8&t=156.96s)]
*  a sense of how the product works prior to implementation. But isn't that strategy also [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTHDPupEWa8&t=162.64s)]
*  better for everyone? For larger financial institutions selling their infrastructure, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTHDPupEWa8&t=167.44s)]
*  appealing to the developer will be a new muscle that may require improvements in product [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTHDPupEWa8&t=172.07999999999998s)]
*  architecture, including up-to-date documentation. Still, it's clear these institutions are [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTHDPupEWa8&t=176.0s)]
*  recognizing the need to influence the developer as well. All right, Angela, I watched your talk [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTHDPupEWa8&t=181.67999999999998s)]
*  from FinTech DevCon a few years ago that documented this shift, this multi-generational shift from [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTHDPupEWa8&t=186.79999999999998s)]
*  marble to code. I love that line. And the ability also for almost any company to participate in this [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTHDPupEWa8&t=192.16s)]
*  financial ecosystem, not just banks. I think it'd be great if you could touch on that history to [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTHDPupEWa8&t=197.68s)]
*  really set the stage for this important new buyer being the developer. Yeah, if you ask most people [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTHDPupEWa8&t=203.12s)]
*  who has influence in the $25 trillion financial services industry, they'd probably say the finance [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTHDPupEWa8&t=209.28s)]
*  leads or the lines of business leads. And what's happening now is there's a third very influential [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTHDPupEWa8&t=216.0s)]
*  constituent, which is the developer. And this has dramatic implications not only on how financial [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTHDPupEWa8&t=222.08s)]
*  services are built, but then also the services that we receive as consumers and businesses. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTHDPupEWa8&t=228.32000000000002s)]
*  And I think any time you talk about a big shift like this, it's sometimes helpful to walk through [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTHDPupEWa8&t=234.32000000000002s)]
*  super briefly what have been the big eras, just to underscore the importance. And this is where the [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTHDPupEWa8&t=240.16000000000003s)]
*  marble to code framing came from. And so you think not that long ago, banks were built out of marble [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTHDPupEWa8&t=246.96s)]
*  and they were only concerned with keeping physical money safe. Fast forward to recent history, [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTHDPupEWa8&t=255.68s)]
*  the mainframe arrives, banks obviously have to keep virtual money safe. Those mainframes are still [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTHDPupEWa8&t=261.52s)]
*  where 99% of dollars in the US are settled. So the trend that we've been talking about over the last [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTHDPupEWa8&t=266.48s)]
*  several years has been the shift to as a service. And so it's taking some of the elements of the [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTHDPupEWa8&t=274.24s)]
*  banking stack and making them such that financial services moves from something that traditionally [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTHDPupEWa8&t=279.52000000000004s)]
*  only banks could do to now something that any company can do. Examples, Lyft can add bank accounts [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTHDPupEWa8&t=285.2s)]
*  for its drivers or Procore can add payments and bank accounts for their plumbers. And what has [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTHDPupEWa8&t=291.68s)]
*  happened is any developer at one of these companies and even at the banks has discovered that even [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTHDPupEWa8&t=297.68s)]
*  though we have these as a service layers, there's still a lot of stitching that needs to go on to [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTHDPupEWa8&t=302.72s)]
*  put these things together. And then to say the obvious, developers are very smart. So anytime [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTHDPupEWa8&t=309.76000000000005s)]
*  they find themselves building something over and over again, they will find a way to automate that [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTHDPupEWa8&t=314.64000000000004s)]
*  and oftentimes open source it. And so we're starting to see all of these very well used prolific [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTHDPupEWa8&t=320.64000000000004s)]
*  open source libraries that are solving what used to be esoteric problems, but that are used by [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTHDPupEWa8&t=328.96s)]
*  millions of developers all around the world. And so this force shift is taking the as a service layer [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTHDPupEWa8&t=334.96s)]
*  and exploding it even further so you can think about it as almost having Lego for banking. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTHDPupEWa8&t=342.08s)]
*  These different composable blocks that all fit together in different kinds of ways. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTHDPupEWa8&t=347.91999999999996s)]
*  And then the added bonuses, many of those are open source. And so the smartest people from all [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTHDPupEWa8&t=352.0s)]
*  around the world can contribute to these, making them even stronger and even better. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTHDPupEWa8&t=356.64s)]
*  Amazing. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTHDPupEWa8&t=360.8s)]
*  So what does that do? You can build way better products much faster. And it's starting to attract [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTHDPupEWa8&t=362.08s)]
*  some of the smartest engineers are now working on financial services products. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTHDPupEWa8&t=368.96s)]
*  I love that. And I think maybe it'd be helpful for the listeners if you could give a couple [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTHDPupEWa8&t=373.28s)]
*  examples of those financial services infrastructure products that you say were previously driven by [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTHDPupEWa8&t=377.84s)]
*  the economic buyer or the business lead that now you think are really being influenced by these [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTHDPupEWa8&t=384.16s)]
*  developers. Let's use the example of payments. If you're providing a operating system for any [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTHDPupEWa8&t=389.20000000000005s)]
*  type of business, it's a very natural extension that you might want to add payments. And traditionally, [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTHDPupEWa8&t=395.6s)]
*  payments will expand the dollars that you are able to get from your customers. It's going to give you [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTHDPupEWa8&t=403.52000000000004s)]
*  more margin. It's going to make people stickier. It was a very economic decision that this is the [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTHDPupEWa8&t=409.04s)]
*  right thing to do. And so let's pick the infrastructure. And I think what has happened [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTHDPupEWa8&t=413.52s)]
*  is companies that have done this historically have then ended up with, well, now we have one [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTHDPupEWa8&t=418.88s)]
*  system that helps us accept the money. We have another system that helps us store the money. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTHDPupEWa8&t=424.0s)]
*  We have a different system that helps us disperse the money. Now, when we're trying to create these [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTHDPupEWa8&t=428.08s)]
*  good user experiences, again, we're stitching these things together. So to use an example of [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTHDPupEWa8&t=432.0s)]
*  Move, which is the company that has started this large developer conference, [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTHDPupEWa8&t=437.52s)]
*  if you can provide composable blocks of all the different things that you want to do in payments [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTHDPupEWa8&t=441.52s)]
*  without any of these middle layers together, engineers are able to build much better products [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTHDPupEWa8&t=447.36s)]
*  and much more seamless experiences. And then as a result, they are becoming very influential in the [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTHDPupEWa8&t=453.52s)]
*  buying decision because it's going to drive the revenue and the product experiences that these [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTHDPupEWa8&t=461.2s)]
*  companies are able to do. Absolutely. And anytime we see a shift in who the buyer is, that naturally [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTHDPupEWa8&t=466.4s)]
*  also influences the way products are built. And so maybe you could speak to that, right? If we now [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTHDPupEWa8&t=473.03999999999996s)]
*  see this buyer, how does that ultimately influence how these products are expected to be built and [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTHDPupEWa8&t=477.91999999999996s)]
*  maybe also how they're expected to be sold? I used to work with this great VP of Engineering, [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTHDPupEWa8&t=483.59999999999997s)]
*  and I was on the product side. And what I loved the most is anytime I could come up with the best [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTHDPupEWa8&t=489.35999999999996s)]
*  product experience versus some of my counterparts who'd be like, well, yeah, this is hard to build, [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTHDPupEWa8&t=495.28s)]
*  this is not. His expression was always like, well, it's just software. We can build anything. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTHDPupEWa8&t=500.55999999999995s)]
*  And in financial services and payments, that hasn't always been the case because you've just [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTHDPupEWa8&t=504.47999999999996s)]
*  been limited by how things are stitched together, what systems you can tap into. But if you can [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTHDPupEWa8&t=510.55999999999995s)]
*  imagine, come up with the absolute best product experience. And there's some really unique, [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTHDPupEWa8&t=517.4399999999999s)]
*  different ways to integrate financial services into software platforms. And if you could have [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTHDPupEWa8&t=522.48s)]
*  the most composable bricks of how to do that, then you can drive the best user experiences. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTHDPupEWa8&t=528.48s)]
*  And so I think the product first thinking that's happening in financial services is very much [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTHDPupEWa8&t=534.16s)]
*  coming to the forefront, both on the consumer side and on the business side, because now we have this [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTHDPupEWa8&t=539.04s)]
*  just great composable architecture. So where do larger financial institutions come into this? [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTHDPupEWa8&t=544.24s)]
*  Because they're not necessarily known as being the most technically savvy or the most composable [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTHDPupEWa8&t=551.12s)]
*  code. I mean, I think something that you mentioned in your talk that we referenced at the beginning [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTHDPupEWa8&t=556.4s)]
*  is that 40% of bank code is still in COBOL, which is pretty legacy. I think you even said that it's [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTHDPupEWa8&t=560.72s)]
*  not really being taught very widely anymore. And so how does that fit together? How do we square [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTHDPupEWa8&t=567.04s)]
*  that circle of these larger financial institutions and this walk towards something a little more [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTHDPupEWa8&t=573.28s)]
*  technologically driven and with developers at the center of that? Yeah, so the most off-site [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTHDPupEWa8&t=579.52s)]
*  statistic, which I think has stayed very constant, is just the level of banking infrastructure has [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTHDPupEWa8&t=585.76s)]
*  been around for a long time. COBOL is an old language. There's a lot of code written in COBOL. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTHDPupEWa8&t=592.56s)]
*  It is very hard to find COBOL developers right now. There's also a lot of legacy software. Much [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTHDPupEWa8&t=596.4s)]
*  of financial services is built on enterprise software that has been around since the 60s, [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTHDPupEWa8&t=603.84s)]
*  70s, and 80s. And the narrative has been that banks are never going to rip a lot of this out. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTHDPupEWa8&t=609.6800000000001s)]
*  It's just way too risky. And I think that is starting to change. I did this talk in 2021, [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTHDPupEWa8&t=615.6s)]
*  and there was already a ton of momentum towards developers. It's now almost 2024, and there's an [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTHDPupEWa8&t=623.9200000000001s)]
*  entirely new platform shift that's driving even faster change, which is generative AI. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTHDPupEWa8&t=630.4s)]
*  And there's a lot of talk in financial services around the risks that are posed by generative AI. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTHDPupEWa8&t=636.88s)]
*  There should be more talk around what are the risks of not moving quickly enough towards this [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTHDPupEWa8&t=642.64s)]
*  site. And I think we're already seeing that a lot in financial services and in insurance. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTHDPupEWa8&t=648.56s)]
*  CEOs from top down are really rethinking their strategy. How can they leverage this platform [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTHDPupEWa8&t=655.2s)]
*  shift? And so how does that impact financial services infrastructure? I think it's challenging [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTHDPupEWa8&t=661.2800000000001s)]
*  this notion that some of this infrastructure will never be replaced. Because I think what we're [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTHDPupEWa8&t=666.8000000000001s)]
*  seeing is, take a loan origination system, for instance. There's been new loan origination [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTHDPupEWa8&t=670.96s)]
*  systems, and it's been very hard to get that new tech in. But I think one of the reasons was the [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTHDPupEWa8&t=675.6s)]
*  new tech was better, but probably not 10x better. Whereas now with gen AI, it's like, great, we've [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTHDPupEWa8&t=680.96s)]
*  reimagined the workflow. It's going to take you one tenth as many people because if you take an [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTHDPupEWa8&t=687.6800000000001s)]
*  AML system, for instance, we're going to automatically write the SAR reports for you. And so the products [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTHDPupEWa8&t=694.24s)]
*  that are able to come along are so much better that it's challenging the notion that some of [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTHDPupEWa8&t=699.6s)]
*  this old software is just never going to go. And so I think that's point one. Point two on COBOL, [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTHDPupEWa8&t=702.5600000000001s)]
*  like, does it make sense to entirely rewrite systems in days past? Probably not. But if you [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTHDPupEWa8&t=710.72s)]
*  look at GitHub co-pilot, depending on the engineer, that's 30 to 100% increased productivity. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTHDPupEWa8&t=717.44s)]
*  So one school of thought is like, well, now you could just rewrite it faster. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTHDPupEWa8&t=725.36s)]
*  But you can imagine a world where LLMs get so good that you could feed in large portions of code [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTHDPupEWa8&t=729.04s)]
*  written in COBOL, and they would spit out the same amount of code or the same functionality of [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTHDPupEWa8&t=734.0s)]
*  said code in a different language. And we're not there yet, but the space is moving so quickly that [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTHDPupEWa8&t=739.76s)]
*  this change in this shift is very much going to change some of these notions that have been [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTHDPupEWa8&t=745.52s)]
*  around for a very long time. Totally. It's a very foundational shift. And maybe one other shift I'd [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTHDPupEWa8&t=749.4399999999999s)]
*  love for you to touch on are the regulatory shifts happening at the same time. We did an episode [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTHDPupEWa8&t=754.3199999999999s)]
*  recently where we talked about how different jurisdictions are implementing open banking or [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTHDPupEWa8&t=759.92s)]
*  sandboxing. And I'm curious to know how you think those also fit into this trend [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTHDPupEWa8&t=764.48s)]
*  of the increasing involvement of the developer. Yeah, I think the open banking trends in particular [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTHDPupEWa8&t=769.28s)]
*  is pretty interesting. And the US is a little bit different than some other countries like the UK [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTHDPupEWa8&t=777.12s)]
*  and even Brazil that have an open banking mandate from the government that banks have to share their [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTHDPupEWa8&t=782.64s)]
*  data. And so you can think like, okay, does it make sense for every bank by themselves to independently [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTHDPupEWa8&t=788.8s)]
*  develop and maintain and do all of these different types of APIs? Or is that an opportunity for [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTHDPupEWa8&t=795.3599999999999s)]
*  broader open source projects, broader standards such that it becomes a lot easier for financial [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTHDPupEWa8&t=802.16s)]
*  institutions to maintain some of these open connections and a lot easier for other companies, [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTHDPupEWa8&t=808.7199999999999s)]
*  other software companies to connect into them? I think just to round things out, I think it's very [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTHDPupEWa8&t=815.36s)]
*  exciting that the developer is playing a greater role. But maybe the question that listeners are [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTHDPupEWa8&t=820.5600000000001s)]
*  asking themselves is how does this ultimately impact me? How does the customer ultimately see [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTHDPupEWa8&t=825.52s)]
*  different kinds of financial services with this developer role becoming more prominent? What do [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTHDPupEWa8&t=831.28s)]
*  you think this does really to the kinds of products that can be created? Yeah, I think this is the most [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTHDPupEWa8&t=837.28s)]
*  exciting part, right? Like you can talk about infrastructure, but really what does better [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTHDPupEWa8&t=843.36s)]
*  infrastructure do? It enables better consumer and better business experiences. Yeah, I can think of [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTHDPupEWa8&t=846.88s)]
*  a couple examples, right? Like there's still two billion people that are underserved from a financial [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTHDPupEWa8&t=853.12s)]
*  services point of view around the world. And there's many reasons for that. But one of the reasons is [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTHDPupEWa8&t=859.36s)]
*  that if you want to stand up banking infrastructure with all the software and especially in the US, [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTHDPupEWa8&t=866.72s)]
*  it's going to cost you $10 to $30 a month just to keep the lights on. And that makes sense if [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTHDPupEWa8&t=871.76s)]
*  you're going to get a mortgage and you're going to get all these different types of products, [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTHDPupEWa8&t=879.6s)]
*  but it doesn't if you're going to have a low balance account. And so if you now have, [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTHDPupEWa8&t=882.24s)]
*  and there are several examples, open source cores where you can just grab the software for free and [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTHDPupEWa8&t=886.56s)]
*  build around it, you can imagine a very low maintenance cost of financial services, which [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTHDPupEWa8&t=892.16s)]
*  will open access to many more people. And so that's one theme I'm excited about. And then the [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTHDPupEWa8&t=897.6s)]
*  second is financial services might have more edge cases than any other industry around, right? Like [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTHDPupEWa8&t=904.08s)]
*  the number of different ways that you can pay and different payment types and different sites, like [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTHDPupEWa8&t=910.64s)]
*  it's just, it's huge pain, right? And so if you take, there's now an open source ACH library, [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTHDPupEWa8&t=913.6800000000001s)]
*  and engineers from banks are running trillions of dollars through this library and catching all of [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTHDPupEWa8&t=920.4s)]
*  these edge cases and fixing it. And so like just stuff is going to work better, right? If everyone [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTHDPupEWa8&t=925.6s)]
*  incorporates this hardened library that the best people against the world are testing against, [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTHDPupEWa8&t=931.12s)]
*  all of us are going to have better products over time. All right. I hope you enjoyed this big idea. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTHDPupEWa8&t=937.0400000000001s)]
*  We do have a lot more on the way, including a new age of maritime exploration that takes advantage [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTHDPupEWa8&t=941.28s)]
*  of AI and computer vision, plus AI-first games that never end, and whether voice-first apps may [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTHDPupEWa8&t=947.0400000000001s)]
*  finally be having their moment. By the way, if you want to see our full list of 40 plus big ideas [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTHDPupEWa8&t=953.44s)]
