# Glenn Loury on the Cover Story and the Real Story  Conversations with Tyler
**Conversation with Tyler:** [February 08, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p_8tdVSTf8Q)
*  Hello everyone and welcome back to Conversations with Tyler.
*  Today I'm here with Glenn Lowry who needs no introduction.
*  Glenn, welcome.
*  Thank you, Tyler.
*  Good to be with you.
*  Would you like to start with economics or with music?
*  Why don't we start with music?
*  I'm not sure what you have in mind, but I'm game.
*  Let's try some music questions.
*  Let's say that your view is the Glenn Lowry worldview where writ large is a political
*  movement.
*  What would the music be for that movement?
*  It would be bebop era jazz, late 50s, early 60s.
*  It would be Charles Mingus.
*  It would be Miles Davis.
*  It would be a young John Coltrane.
*  It would be a young McCoy Tyner.
*  It would be Thelonious Monk.
*  It would be in that space.
*  And why is that music the correct association with your political movement?
*  Oh, actually it's an association with my life story and upbringing and it was like the coolest
*  and the hippest.
*  I was born in 1948, so I was like 14 years old in 1962 and stuff was happening and my
*  uncles and cousins and whatnot and everybody was listening to this stuff.
*  And I would just import that into my political movement.
*  There's no politics in that music that I'm aware of, but should we be looking for politics
*  in music?
*  Well, I think it's whether we're looking for politics in you, right?
*  Okay.
*  Let's say we take the more narrowly Chicago R&B tradition, Curtis Mayfield, Childlights,
*  Jerry Butler, Major Lance, the Dells, right?
*  Does any of that become the music of your movement?
*  Yeah, that's in a different register.
*  I'm dancing now rather than sitting back nodding my head to the exquisite improvisational runs.
*  I'm dancing to that and I'm dancing with a girl, so it's going to be romantic.
*  It's going to have all of that kind of adolescent stuff in it.
*  But yeah, I could get to Curtis Mayfield and Childlights.
*  And Motown too, which was right down the street from Chicago.
*  It was sort of part of the same world.
*  Why has Stax faded more than Motown with time for listeners?
*  That's an economist question, isn't it?
*  I actually don't know the data well enough to answer that.
*  But everyone still knows Diana Ross, The Supremes.
*  Otis Redding is somewhat known, but a lot of the Stax sound was maybe too gritty or
*  not polished in the right way.
*  It's not played in music as often.
*  I think that's my impression.
*  Yeah, or Smokey Robinson or some of these others.
*  But I don't know.
*  I mean, this is beyond my knowledge.
*  I wanted to credit the organizational and marketing genius of Barry Gordy at Motown as
*  part of the story.
*  But it might be that it was too gritty.
*  What about the sound of Philadelphia since we're going back?
*  I mean, there were other R&B studio dynamics that were going on, and they haven't all fared
*  as well as Motown has done.
*  And I agree with that.
*  I'm not sure why.
*  Al Green still turns up in movie soundtracks, I notice, but a lot of the rest of it, maybe not.
*  Did you ever see Jackie Brown?
*  That early Quentin Tarantino film, Jackie Brown?
*  Of course.
*  Yeah, it has a, isn't it a TSOP soundtrack?
*  I believe so.
*  We'd have to ask GPT, right?
*  GPT?
*  Or Google.
*  Oh, okay.
*  These days it's GPT.
*  I'm still in Google, man.
*  I got to get with it.
*  Should we listen to Michael Jackson with the same emotions as we did before?
*  Or is he cancelable?
*  I don't know how you cancel Michael Jackson.
*  I mean, you probably listen with something firing in the back of your brain about warning,
*  warning, but you still listen.
*  The songs seem much sadder though, right?
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah, they do.
*  But the pop icon Michael Jackson, it wasn't just the lyrics, it wasn't just the tune,
*  it was the whole thing.
*  It was the performance, it was the dancing.
*  It was the tragic arc of this celebrity life.
*  It happened that I was in Bogota, Colombia teaching summer school when Jackson died.
*  And our host took us out to one of these four hour lunch extravaganza's at a restaurant
*  out in the countryside that it was beef, beef, beef and more beef.
*  And it just kept coming.
*  All of the wait persons were dressed as Michael Jackson impersonators and there were big screens
*  playing Michael Jackson videos everywhere you looked.
*  And this was in Colombia.
*  But such was the force of Michael Jackson's celebrity and musical genius and personality.
*  I don't know, I don't have a problem listening to Michael Jackson, although you're right.
*  I don't hear it being played on the radio.
*  At what age would you let your daughter listen to Prince's Dirty Mind album?
*  I'm going to tell you, I don't know what's in Prince's Dirty Mind album.
*  Well, this is from the title of the album, perhaps you have some idea, right?
*  And I'm going to acknowledge, while I do have two daughters, they're in their 50s.
*  So the time when I can have anything to say.
*  Are they old enough?
*  I think they're older than that.
*  But nowadays, can you really control what your daughters listen to?
*  If you tell them, I think in some cases it has an impact, at times a negative or reverse
*  impact, right?
*  But words matter.
*  Would you put it on in front of them?
*  Maybe you should tell them if you don't want them to listen to Prince, that they have to
*  listen to Prince, that it's a mandatory rite of passage to listen to Prince.
*  That might get them to not listen.
*  Do you ever enjoy bluegrass music?
*  What's the whitest stuff you listen to a lot and really like?
*  You know, I don't listen to as much music as I used to.
*  And you know, I'm partial to jazz, blues.
*  I work out Monday, Wednesday, Friday with a trainer who has a small studio with a good
*  sound system.
*  We listen to hip hop.
*  We listen to blues.
*  We listen to a lot of blues.
*  Bluegrass?
*  Now, I love a brilliant banjo solo as much as the next guy.
*  I mean, I can really get with it when it comes up in the soundtrack of a movie that I'm watching
*  or whatever.
*  But I wouldn't have gone out of my way to find it.
*  It's just something that comes across my screen.
*  So I'm not very knowledgeable at all about bluegrass or about country for that matter.
*  Do you like the movie Deliverance?
*  Speaking of banjo solos.
*  It's been a long time since I've seen it again.
*  But you know, yeah, it was disquieting at a very deep level.
*  I'd like to go back and revisit your early career in theoretical economics.
*  Let's see what some of your current thoughts are on those pieces.
*  Are you game?
*  Okay.
*  Yeah, I'm game.
*  Do markets exhaust natural resources in the ground too rapidly or too slowly under competitive
*  conditions?
*  What's your current view?
*  Well, in that you haven't internalized the environmental externality, I'd say probably
*  if I had to answer that question too rapidly or too slowly, too rapidly.
*  Because there'll be too much of the environmental externality now, whereas you should spread
*  it out over time.
*  Is that the implicit belief?
*  Well, no, just my thought, my thought process was that the price level, the initial price
*  level would be higher.
*  The theory tells us that the price is supposed to rise at the rate of interest or something
*  like that because the supplier can substitute supplying today versus supplying tomorrow.
*  So he has to anticipate a return in price terms that's comparable to what he'd get if
*  he sold it all today.
*  So I don't know that anything about the environment influences the rate of increase of prices
*  and the pure theory of pricing of natural resources, but the level is too low.
*  So should we be happy when a lot of those resources perhaps are held by monopolies?
*  Because the monopolist will restrain output, right?
*  And that brings us closer to an optimum or not?
*  Well, I think that's worth exploring.
*  The quantitative magnitudes probably matter.
*  Maybe the monopolist's monopoly is so strong that he overshoots in terms of internalizing
*  the kind of Puguvian tax that you'd want to slap on to the market price in a competitive
*  environment.
*  So it might be the monopolist is too much of a monopolist, but at least it's worth,
*  I think, thinking about.
*  I think a greater than relying on monopoly would be having a government that could estimate
*  what the right non-priced external cost of the use of the fuel is and then slap that
*  tax on, but that's a political impossibility.
*  Sure.
*  And governments very often subsidize, say, fossil fuels more than they tax them.
*  Now, here's a 1979 release from Glenn Loury.
*  Are larger small firms better at innovation?
*  What do you think these days?
*  I think that that was a nice little paper, the QJE circuit in 1979.
*  I was proud of it.
*  I took this problem that guys like Mike Shearer, the distinguished IO guy at that time, or
*  Mort Kamey, and other people had been worrying about its market structure and innovation.
*  What's the relationship between the two?
*  I had a nice little stick-figured model where I could analyze that issue, but I never got
*  beyond an industry with identical firms, and there were either N of them or N plus one
*  of them.
*  That was my parameterization of competition.
*  More firms, more competition.
*  I didn't get it at all into real industrial organization, which would have to do with
*  oligopoly and a size distribution of firms in the industry and so on.
*  And I'm trying to remember what I had to say about the relationship between number of firms
*  and rate of innovation.
*  I think the rate of innovation is increasing in the number of firms, but I think that's
*  what I found.
*  It's a long time ago, Tyler.
*  When you were researching those papers and writing them, what did you see then as your
*  career trajectory?
*  What did you think what the 72-year-old Glenn Lowry would be?
*  I thought, this is by the way before Glenn Lowry becomes at all political, I was just
*  an applied theorist.
*  I was a student of Bob Solow, Peter Diamond, MIT in the 1970s.
*  I thought I was just going to write papers more or less like that for the rest of my
*  academic life.
*  I thought getting into a top five journal and getting elected a fellow of the econometric
*  society and getting grants from the National Science Foundation was the be-all and end-all
*  of my professional life.
*  I was at Northwestern in my first job in the late 70s.
*  Get this.
*  The year that I was hired, Roger Meyerson was also hired in the theory group at Northwestern.
*  The next year, Bank Holmstrom showed up.
*  The following year, Paul Milgram showed up.
*  Leonid Hurwitz was always around because he and Stan Ryder were very close buddies.
*  Leo was up at Minnesota, but he was always around at conferences and seminars and stuff
*  like that.
*  I was right there at the birth of mechanism design and information economic and the revolution
*  in theory of auctions and bargaining and stuff like that that was going on in my midst.
*  I didn't appreciate fully at the time the extraordinary and revolutionary character
*  of the developments in economic theory that I was in the midst of.
*  I was still using my differential calculus and just trying to write down these little
*  silly models.
*  I didn't have deep questions.
*  That's what I'm trying to get to.
*  There are several Nobel laureates in your list of names, as you know.
*  Yeah, that's what I'm saying.
*  When you meet promising young economists today in graduate school, is your first thought,
*  oh, let the person stay on that path and be the next Roger Myerson?
*  Or do you a bit want to shake them and say, well, I want more of you to go the Glenn Loury
*  way and be public intellectuals or some of the other things you've done.
*  What's your gut reaction to that?
*  No, I don't do that.
*  I want them to get jobs.
*  I want them to have a successful launch.
*  I want to get them focused on a question and writing.
*  Now, I must say, I'm not advising very many graduate students these days and haven't for
*  some years now, but I want to get them focused on producing a dissertation that's marketable.
*  I want them to ask a good question.
*  I want them to use rigorous methods appropriate to the high standards that we have.
*  But these days, my kind of applied theory life that I took up more or less successfully
*  in the decade after I left graduate school is passe.
*  Everybody is calibrating and estimating and they're looking for a natural experiment or
*  a quasi natural experiment or whatever it is.
*  I wouldn't advise a young graduate student to follow in the path of writing papers like
*  the papers that I wrote because A, they're not going to get in the AER and B, you want
*  to get a job.
*  You want to be able to sell yourself.
*  But I confess to being a little bit alienated from the profession these last years, especially
*  as my public intellectual profile has risen.
*  I don't spend that much time worrying about what to tell graduate students.
*  I don't teach graduate students.
*  I used to teach microeconomic theory to our first year PhD students, but two years ago
*  I stepped aside from that.
*  We have like eight theorists in our department and the younger full professors weren't able
*  to get at the graduate students in the first year.
*  There are eight of us and there's only those two courses.
*  I thought it was time for me to make room for some other people to teach theory to our
*  graduate students.
*  So, I'm not doing very much interacting with graduate students these days.
*  What's your favorite Thomas Schelling story?
*  Okay.
*  This is a story about me as much as it is about Tom Schelling.
*  The year is 1984.
*  I've been at Harvard for two years.
*  I'm appointed a professor of economics and of Afro-American studies and I'm having a
*  crisis of confidence thinking I'm never going to write another paper worth reading again.
*  Tom is a friend.
*  He helped to recruit me because he was on the committee that Henry Rossofsky, the famous
*  and powerful dean of the college of the faculty of arts and sciences at Harvard who hired
*  me, the committee that Rossofsky put together to try to find someone who could fill the
*  position that I was hired into, professor of economics and of Afro-American studies.
*  They said Afro-American in those years.
*  So Tom was my connection.
*  He's the guy who called me up when I was sitting at Michigan in Ann Arbor in this early
*  82 and said, you know, do you think you might be interested in a job out here?
*  So he had helped to recruit me.
*  So I had this crisis of confidence.
*  Am I ever going to write another paper?
*  I'm never going to write another paper.
*  So I'm telling, I'm saying this to Tom and he's sitting sober, listening, nodding and
*  suddenly starts laughing and he can't stop.
*  And the laughing becomes uncontrollable.
*  And I am completely flummoxed by this.
*  What the hell is he laughing at?
*  What's so funny?
*  I just told him something I wouldn't even tell my wife, which was I was afraid I was
*  a failure, that it was an imposter syndrome situation that I could never measure up.
*  Everybody in the faculty meeting at Harvard's economics department in 1982 was famous.
*  Everybody.
*  You know, and I was six years out of graduate school and I didn't know if I could fit in.
*  He's laughing and I couldn't get in.
*  After a while, he gains, he regains his composure and he says, you think you're the only one?
*  This place is full of neurotics hiding behind their secretaries and their 10 foot oak doors,
*  fearing the dreaded question.
*  What have you done for me lately?
*  Why don't you just put your head down and do your work?
*  Believe me, everything will be okay.
*  That was Tom Shelley.
*  He was great.
*  I miss him.
*  I have a few questions about America for you.
*  Where's the best place to raise a family in the United States today?
*  Oh, gosh.
*  It's going to sound like a cliche.
*  I'm going to say something like a small town in Ohio or Missouri or someplace like that,
*  where there's a Presbyterian church or a Lutheran church on the corner, where it's suffocating
*  in the sense that everybody knows everybody else's business.
*  Schools are halfway decent.
*  You can let your kids play until the sun goes down without worrying about their well-being
*  and you can leave your back door unlocked if you dare.
*  But that's corny.
*  Doesn't that sound corny to you?
*  Yeah, but corny is good.
*  What about Providence, Rhode Island?
*  That's where Brown is.
*  What do you think?
*  I was past the kid-bearing age by the time I got here in 2005, but I see my younger colleagues
*  and if you can get past the problem that the public schools are challenged and you have
*  to work really, really hard to find a school and a program and a community that you could
*  be confident sending your kids to.
*  A lot of my colleagues send their children to private schools and it's costing them
*  $50,000 a year per kid or whatever it costs, which ain't nothing.
*  If you can get past that problem, Providence is not so bad.
*  I live on the east side of Providence and Brown University sits up on a hill.
*  You go down the hill, across the river into the flatlands and that's where the quote unquote
*  real city of Providence is.
*  It's a working class town.
*  It's doing better than it had been doing 30 years ago.
*  I think the restaurants are good.
*  The economic climate here seems to be healthy.
*  There are challenges, but up here on the east side, it's a bedroom community of middle,
*  upper middle class, mostly single family housing on decent sized lots.
*  It's quiet.
*  There's crime in Providence.
*  There's not so much crime on the east side.
*  It's not a bad place.
*  I like the smaller town.
*  Providence is maybe 200,000 relative to ... I lived in Boston for many years.
*  I was born in Chicago.
*  There are no traffic jams to speak of around here in Providence.
*  When I wanted to vote and had to go to City Hall in order to cast my ballot, I could park
*  my vehicle across the street from City Hall and walk in, cast my ballot, walk back out
*  again, things like that.
*  I like myself personally, the smallest scale of this town that I'm living in.
*  Why do undergraduates today seem to have worse mental health issues than they did say 20
*  years ago?
*  You're asking the wrong guy, but I'll venture a response.
*  I do teach them, and they're under enormous stress.
*  You must have noticed that.
*  But from what?
*  Levels of wealth are higher.
*  If they're going to Brown, their future, while not assured, is certainly not looking bad.
*  What's really going on here?
*  Okay.
*  Again, I confess ignorance, but I'll nevertheless plunge ahead.
*  They all want to get the brass ring.
*  I agree with you that the prospects for them are rosy, all things considered, but not everybody
*  is going to get into Stanford Law School or Yale Law School or the Chicago Business School
*  or get hired as a young associate at one of the investment banks or something.
*  They're fiercely competitive.
*  The great grubbing is mind boggling.
*  They seem to be driven by this idea that each and every one of them has to be in the top
*  10% when only 10% of them are going to be.
*  That's part of it, but you're asking the wrong guy.
*  You need a culture critic to respond to a question like that.
*  You are a culture critic, Len.
*  You've taught these people for so long.
*  Is it different for the black students at top schools such as Brown?
*  I think it's a different situation.
*  I won't qualify my response any further by saying I don't know what I'm talking about.
*  Let's just stipulate that I don't know what I'm talking about, but I'm going to talk anyway.
*  I think for the black students, the kinds of pressures that I mentioned, which might
*  be moderately ameliorated by the fact that affirmative action, both in post-graduate
*  admissions programs and in employment, gives them a leg up.
*  A black kid with a decent portfolio coming out of Brown probably is in a relatively advantaged
*  competitive position for the next step.
*  But they're black kids, and they're in a, depending on the background, they may feel
*  exactly perfectly comfortable in an elite environment if they come from the increasingly
*  large number of prosperous black families who are sending their children off to places
*  like Brown.
*  But I've known many kids of color, as they say, who didn't have those advantages and
*  nevertheless find themselves because they're crackerjack smart and they got discovered
*  here or there and channeled into the funneling mechanism that leads to them getting admitted
*  to Brown, who didn't feel all that comfortable socially in this environment, which is pretty
*  and high, pretty elite, self-consciously elite, almost smugly so.
*  But I'm in my 70s and the kids don't come and cry on my shoulder, so I don't know what's
*  keeping them up at night.
*  Moving somewhat away from the elite, Fentanyl is the driver of a high death rate in the
*  United States.
*  How's that one going to end?
*  Do we just cycle through where all the people who can get addicted become addicted and a
*  lot of them die and then it burns out after a generation?
*  Is there something we can do?
*  Will it continue to spread to blacks and not just say whites in the Midwest?
*  What's the equilibrium?
*  That's a good question.
*  It could be very bad.
*  It could be that we're not at the beginning of the end, that we're just kind of at the
*  end of the beginning with it.
*  I hadn't even thought about the social contagion aspects of the question.
*  I thought I was thinking mostly about enforcement issues, can you keep it from coming across
*  the border, treatment issues, what do you do with people who are susceptible to the
*  addiction and who find themselves in trouble?
*  There's some accountability for the opioid epidemic problem with the pharmaceutical companies
*  and so on.
*  That's the kind of thing that I was thinking about.
*  But breaking through to other elements of the population, and you're right, it's not
*  yet as far as I know.
*  Something like the crack epidemic of the 80s and early 90s was for urban black America.
*  But heroin is not an unknown drug of choice in those precincts and I gather they're highly
*  substitutable.
*  So again, I'm going to confess ignorance, but I'm worried.
*  You've got me worried now.
*  In your life, when you stopped taking drugs, did you feel you had lost anything positive
*  or was it just pure gain?
*  That was just a terrible thing and once I could stop, I was just flat out better off.
*  Or is there some kind of fun that you actually lose?
*  You know, that's a good question.
*  I'm actually at the end stages now finalizing my draft of my memoir manuscript that I'll
*  be submitting to the publisher in a few weeks, literally.
*  This is actually going to happen.
*  So I'm going to start the process by writing a memoir.
*  So I'm going to start the process by writing a memoir.
*  And somebody who's followed me knows I've been talking about writing a memoir for almost
*  a decade and people were saying where's the book, where's the book?
*  Well, the book is going to happen.
*  And in it, I tell the story of being addicted to free-basing crack cocaine in the late 80s.
*  And I went into treatment and I went to a halfway house and I went and I fought in an
*  Thank God for her, for the church, that community that took me in and so on, and I kicked it.
*  But I thought I was missing something.
*  I thought that there was a kind of fun, you call it, a kind of excitement, a kind of sensation
*  of euphoria.
*  And so, having gone two years sober, I took myself back to one of my places where I would
*  cop.
*  I bought a little cocaine, I prepared it, and I smoked it.
*  And the feelings of euphoria came back just as I had remembered them, but also with them
*  came a sense of shame.
*  I mean, there was no doubt that I was experiencing a titillation, a euphoric sensation.
*  There was quote unquote happiness there.
*  But having gone through, as it were, the valley of the shadow of death, and having emerged
*  from it to the arms of a loving wife who stuck with me, and a young family that was coming
*  along, my sons, Glen and Nehemiah, who are in their 30s now, having done all of that,
*  I asked myself, is this what you were willing to risk everything for?
*  And I realized that the obsession, there was no doubt about the euphoria.
*  The euphoria was certainly there.
*  But my obsessive pursuit of it, which had nearly destroyed me, was a way of living that
*  was just undignified and contentious.
*  And so I put the pipe down after a couple of hits, packaged everything up, threw it
*  in the trash and never touched cocaine again.
*  So I was wondering about your question, about what was I missing?
*  And I decided having done this thing, this unforgivable thing from the alcoholic's anonymous
*  point of view, it was unforgivable what I did.
*  But I just had to find out.
*  Now this process of writing your memoir, obviously you had already lived those years.
*  But to write them up, put them together, edit them, rewrite, what's the main thing you learned
*  about yourself?
*  OK, so one of the motifs in the book is to distinguish between the cover story and the
*  real story, because there's so many junctures in my life where living my life and thinking
*  back on it, unreflectively, just thinking back on it, I embrace the cover story.
*  I did that because it's always self-aggrandizing.
*  It's always not as craven, not as callow, not as vicious, not as obsessively, monomaniacally,
*  narcissistic as it actually was.
*  I never remember it the way it actually was.
*  So what I've done in producing this book and reliving these critical junctures, you know,
*  for example, for example, I really did lose my nerve when I got to Harvard in the early 1980s.
*  I didn't do what Tom Schelling advised me to do, which is put my head down and write
*  my little papers about natural resources or imperfect competition or imperfect information
*  or whatever.
*  I didn't do that.
*  I jumped ship.
*  I left economic theory behind entirely and I became a Reagan conservative political
*  pundit black guy.
*  I was pretty good at it.
*  And I would say in retrospect, I was more often right than wrong in some of the political
*  positions that I took.
*  This will come as a upsetting remark to some people who know and love me.
*  But I think conservatives have the better of those arguments in those years.
*  But be that as it may, the real reason, I'm just giving an example.
*  You asked me, what have I learned about myself?
*  And I've learned that my capacity for self-delusion is almost unbounded.
*  And it's a very dangerous thing too, because I had persuaded myself that the economics
*  department was cold at Harvard in the early 80s.
*  I didn't have any buddies except for Tom.
*  I had persuaded myself that Harvard saddled me with these dual responsibilities in Afro-American
*  studies and in economics.
*  And almost impossible.
*  You're going to be a humanist and you're going to be a theoretical social scientist at the
*  same time. It's almost impossible for anybody to do, let alone a 34-year-old guy who's barely
*  got his legs under him.
*  I had persuaded myself of everything other than the real story.
*  And the real story was that I choked.
*  I blinked.
*  I lost my nerve.
*  I was afraid of failure.
*  I found something else that I could do that would generate a claim.
*  I went from the economics department to the Kennedy School.
*  They were very happy to have me at the Kennedy School of Government.
*  It's a wonderful place.
*  A wonderful place.
*  It's just not a place, if you're a serious economic theorist, that you would want to
*  spend most of your time.
*  And it was just too easy for me to do.
*  Now, I could blame affirmative action.
*  I could blame the larger political environment and whatnot.
*  But I know within myself, I was afraid of failing.
*  Every time I opened up Econometrica and I saw another paper from Roger Meyerson or Paul
*  Milgram, I was asking myself, would I ever write a paper like that?
*  And I had it out.
*  Here if I go over to the Kennedy School and become a pundit, no one's ever going to ask
*  me to write a paper like that.
*  I learned that about myself through forcing myself to be honest in retrospect about what
*  was really going on with me.
*  And there are many other stories like that.
*  I won't try to recount them all because I want to say something for the book.
*  I have a few questions about race for you.
*  Do you have any interest in that topic?
*  Let's take the part of the white right wing that really likes you.
*  And I know there's different phases in your thought, but overall, they really like you.
*  What's the main point or insight they are missing when it comes to race that you would
*  like them to know, but they don't?
*  Thanks for asking that question.
*  I think I have an answer.
*  Those people who are languishing in the ghettos, the housing projects, the lockups, the emergency
*  rooms of the hospital wards, the ones who are doing the carjackings, the ones who are
*  doing the crazy shit that you see when you turn on your television and you look at what's
*  going on in Chicago or Baltimore or St. Louis or Philadelphia.
*  Those people are us.
*  They're our people.
*  Those are Americans.
*  They are us.
*  That's us.
*  It's not them.
*  That's what I'd like them to understand.
*  My right wing acolytes, I don't think many of them get that.
*  I think they think this is an alien imposition upon an otherwise more or less pristine Euro-American
*  canvas.
*  They think they're shit hole pockets of America that they need to protect themselves from.
*  True enough, they do sometimes need to protect themselves, but those are our people over
*  there.
*  That's our failure.
*  This is an American story, not a black American story.
*  And why doesn't that lesson get through?
*  Is it that it's not articulated well enough?
*  The people are closed minded, racism?
*  What's your account of why that remains insufficiently known?
*  Maybe human nature, maybe it's very easy us and them.
*  I could, by the way, flip the script on that and say to the radical black activists who
*  are demanding Black Lives Matter justice that the working class struggling, white truck
*  driver, gas station attendant, guy that's working or woman that's working, who's attracted
*  to the populist rhetoric and who might want to vote for Trump.
*  But those are people too.
*  They're people not so differently from ourselves, that they have a story.
*  Everybody has a story that a little bit of generosity would go a long way.
*  I could say that to black activists and they would have a hard time hearing it.
*  It may be that empathy and a kind of suspension of disbelief, a kind of interrogation of your
*  gut visceral instinct to react with ad hominem and react with a categorical dismissal and
*  with a stereotype.
*  It may be that the impulse to resist, the ability to resist that impulse is difficult
*  for anybody to come by.
*  I would also say that, and I speculate here a little bit, but you're not going to let
*  me stop speculating, that the political interests of various actors who have to marshal majorities
*  at the electorate and who have to develop narratives that get the juices flowing in
*  one way or another for their supporters, militates against that kind of more moderate and self-effacing
*  and humble posture.
*  I'm not the Christian that I used to be when I was coming out of drug addiction.
*  I was much more observant and fervent.
*  But it seems to me that in the teachings that I can recall from my encounters with Christianity
*  about humility, about walking, thinking, doing and acting as Christ would do, as he would
*  have us do, that there's just a lot there.
*  I think that it's a lot easier to talk to talk than it is to walk the walk on that.
*  Which aspects of the U.S. black experience do you wish that you knew more about?
*  By the way, let me just comment.
*  I like your technique.
*  I like your podcast interview technique.
*  I may well emulate it.
*  All I need is a list of 20 questions we could talk about forever.
*  I have this ongoing conversation with my friend John McWhorter at the Glenn Show where we
*  talk about Omar.
*  Omar is a type.
*  He's just a stand-in representation of dysfunctional, probably on the wrong side of the line in
*  terms of law enforcement, bragging about having babies by three different women, can't keep
*  a job, dropped out of school, etc., problematic kid in the ghetto.
*  And John says, Omar makes me sad and Omar makes you mad.
*  He says this to me.
*  This is one of our things.
*  How do we react to the fact of this dysfunction that is so prevalent in low-income black communities
*  that creates such problems for others who share those communities with them and for
*  society more broadly that redounds to the discredit of African-American society?
*  You can't be proud of a quote thug, close quote, can you?
*  Our reaction to this dysfunction.
*  He makes me mad.
*  I don't understand him.
*  I don't understand how you take a pistol, fire it out the window of a vehicle in a residential
*  area where you know people are sitting on the front porches and you have no idea where
*  that bullet is going to land, and then crow about it.
*  I don't understand.
*  I don't know what those frustrations are.
*  I don't know the story.
*  I don't know Omar's story.
*  Not really.
*  I know stereotypes about the story, cartoon representations of the story.
*  Is he angry?
*  Is he disconsolate?
*  Does he have hope?
*  What does he believe in?
*  I'm saying he and I'm saying Omar, but of course it doesn't just apply to the guys.
*  I don't really know what's going on.
*  When I meet people, social workers, cops, nurses, religious people who are working on
*  the ground in these communities, they're trying to tell me a little bit about what life is
*  like and so on.
*  I wish I knew more about it.
*  I wish I could have more factually grounded empathy for the people who I am so quick to
*  castigate for creating the problems, but whose genuine life stories I don't know so much
*  about.
*  And I wish that the creative arts and the journalistic practice would get grittier,
*  wouldn't be so much in the service of a quote unquote progressive political program, but
*  would just tell me what's going on.
*  I want to go inside those housing projects and find out what people are actually saying
*  to each other and doing to each other and how they feel about it.
*  And I don't trust the reportage that I get because it's all too tendentious and in the
*  service of making sure that Donald Trump doesn't get any more votes than he might otherwise
*  get or that Black Lives Matter comes out looking smelling like roses.
*  I want to know the real story, which I, if I flatter myself with this, forgive me, think
*  would allow me to be less mad and more sad when I encounter the mischief that Omar is
*  creating throughout the country.
*  We've had John McWhorter on this show and I know you and he have had many, many dialogues.
*  If you were to boil down the differences between you and him and your views to the smallest,
*  most abstract number of dimensions possible, to what would you attribute those differences?
*  Like what's the key difference and where does it come from?
*  He cares what his colleagues at the New York Times think about him.
*  And I stopped giving a damn about that a long time ago.
*  And before he wrote for the Times, that's pretty recent, right?
*  Yeah, the Times is just the last year or two.
*  But I mean, he lives there in New York.
*  He goes to the cocktail parties and stuff.
*  I mean, I'll give an example.
*  I don't think I'd betray his confidence in saying this.
*  I cannot get John to discuss the transgender debate in our conversation.
*  I'm not asking him to agree or disagree with anything.
*  I just want to take up the question.
*  He refuses to do so.
*  God love him.
*  And he says there's no, you know, it's a complete losing bet.
*  I mean, you know, all that is going to happen is if I say what I actually think, a ton of
*  bricks is going to fall on me and so I won't talk about it.
*  Who is your strongest critic on race?
*  The best critic of you.
*  OK, you're going to think I'm dodging your question.
*  My wife, LaWan Lowry.
*  It's not a dodge at all.
*  It's probably an excellent answer.
*  Not that I know of her, but it makes sense to me.
*  I think it's correct, frankly.
*  Every time I go into one of my rants at the Glenn Show and I start, you know, complaining
*  about whatever, affirmative action or the defund the police movement or critical race
*  theory or whatever, she will say that, you know, she'll say something like the real structural
*  issues here have to do with economics.
*  They have to do with a decent social provision.
*  They have to do with corporations getting away without paying any taxes.
*  They have to do with inequality.
*  They have to do with the defects of capitalism to which you are seemingly indifferent or
*  unwilling to acknowledge.
*  And all of this culture war stuff that you engage in, this is my wife talking to me about
*  complaining about critical race theory or whatever, is just a dodge.
*  It's a smoke screen from confronting the underlying power dynamics that generate and
*  sustain inequality and privilege and disadvantage and whatnot in the society.
*  And that's what I want you to talk about.
*  I want you to talk about why people can't pay the rent, about why the wage is so low,
*  about why they can't get decent health care, and about why the fat cats get away on Wall
*  Street and everywhere else with, you know, practically they get away with murder.
*  And no one ever holds them to account.
*  You're an economist.
*  Why aren't you developing and expositing critical theories that address yourself to the real
*  foundation of disparities of power, influence, and success in our society instead of shooting
*  fish in a barrel?
*  I paraphrase, but this is pretty much her argument.
*  She doesn't really disagree with me about a lot of this stuff.
*  It's just that she thinks it's the wrong target.
*  But is she right?
*  That's the last chapter of the memoir.
*  In your own evolution of your views on religion, am I correct in thinking you've moved from
*  a Christian evangelical to some kind of agnostic?
*  Or how would you describe it?
*  Yeah, I think that's probably accurate.
*  How did that change your views on abortion, that evolution?
*  Not at all, frankly.
*  I was always one of these people who thought that the fetus, before it's viable outside
*  the womb, that's one thing.
*  And people might decide to terminate the pregnancy.
*  I could have a private conversation with someone about that, but that the law shouldn't intervene.
*  I've always thought that.
*  Late term, that's a human being, and you can't just dispose of it for your convenience.
*  I've always thought that.
*  I thought that even before I was a Christian.
*  So which of your views did change the most due to the evolution of your religious opinions?
*  I'd say, this is off the top of my head here, my willingness to hold myself to account and
*  accept responsibility for the way in which I was conducting my life.
*  I don't know if you remember the Bonfire of the Vanities.
*  The Bonfire of the Vanities, that was Tom Wolfe, a comic novel from the mid-1980s.
*  And he had in there, I can't remember the protagonist's name, but a bond trader guy
*  who had made a lot of money and got himself caught up in a series of unbelievable fiascos
*  that ended up ruining him.
*  And the bond trader guy was a master of the universe.
*  And I always thought of myself as a master of the universe, notwithstanding my crisis
*  of confidence when I moved to Harvard and whatnot.
*  I was a high flyer.
*  I had shaken hands with the president of the United States.
*  I had spoken on five continents.
*  I was making money and I was famous.
*  And the world was my oyster and I was accountable to no one.
*  Not to the loving woman who was by my side and whom I did not respect from the way in
*  which I conducted our marriage for years.
*  Not to the people from once I had come off of the South Side of Chicago who were looking
*  to me for a certain kind of leadership that I was not interested in providing.
*  I had no real connections with community.
*  I mean, I had these folk communities that I would flit around with, but I didn't have
*  real deep personal relationships that went across class lines or racial lines for that
*  matter.
*  I was a performer.
*  I was self-absorbed.
*  I was a narcissist.
*  And I didn't take responsibility for that.
*  And it ended up getting me into the cul-de-sac into which I ultimately wandered.
*  And the only way out-
*  Okay, then you become religious, but moving from religious to agnostic, how does that
*  then change your views?
*  Oh, I'm sorry, maybe I misunderstood the question.
*  No.
*  No.
*  And agnostic is not atheist, right?
*  And it's a saying that there's a kind of mystery there and there's a kind of awe.
*  And it's a, you have a suspension of disbelief, which I certainly indulged when I became religious.
*  And there's a kind of suspension of belief.
*  I mean, what am I asked to believe as a Christian?
*  I'm asked to believe literally that a man born of a woman was divine and that on the
*  occasion of his death, he was raised from the dead and he lives on to this day.
*  I can't believe that.
*  I don't know that I ever actually believed it.
*  But there's a mystery here and I don't know.
*  And I think the quest for belief is noble.
*  And I think the arrogance of a kind of presumption of omniscience on my part, well, you know,
*  I know that that's just a lot of bunk, offends me.
*  So an old dear friend of mine was the great sociologist Peter Berger, now dead, but for
*  many years a great man who wrote many books about many things, including about the sociology
*  of religion.
*  And he was Lutheran.
*  He became alienated by the Lutheran clergy because they were too postmodern, liberal
*  and relativist and whatnot in his view.
*  But he used to go to a Greek Orthodox church in Brookline, Massachusetts and sit in the
*  back pew and listen to the music and smell the incense and hear the bells.
*  And he just immersed himself in that milieu.
*  And he wasn't looking for an answer.
*  It wasn't a logical proposition.
*  It was simply being in the midst of the faithful.
*  And I do that sometimes.
*  I don't go to church on a regular basis, but especially in the years after my late wife,
*  Linda Lowry, passed away in 2011, I found myself sometimes just, you know, wanting to
*  be in the midst of people whose belief was firmer than my own.
*  I don't know if I'm answering you or not, Tyler.
*  I am not an atheist, is what I'm trying to declare.
*  And I'm to some degree in awe of the majesty and the dignity and the humanity of these
*  people who are seeking to have a relationship with the creator of the universe.
*  What's your favorite novel?
*  OK, it's Mario Vargas Llosa, and I've got two.
*  One of them is The Feast of the Goat, which is about Trujillo's rule in San Domingo in
*  the 1950s.
*  And the other is The Dream of the Kelt, which is about Roger Casement, an Irish diplomat
*  and humanitarian who served the British crown in the first decades of the 20th century,
*  exposing terrible humanitarian disasters in the Congo, where the Belgians were doing what
*  they were doing, and in the upper Amazon, where the Spanish were doing what they were
*  doing.
*  And he got knighted, Sir Roger Casement, but he was an Irish patriot and also a closeted
*  homosexual.
*  And he ends up being executed because he gets caught in a scheme collaborating with the
*  Germans in 1915 to try to stage some event that was going to be the occasion for provoking
*  an Irish revolt, etc., etc.
*  Long story, but it's Mario Vargas Llosa, a master of this kind of historical narrative.
*  And I just love both of those novels.
*  American Pastoral is another one that I'm really very fond of.
*  Philip Roth.
*  I could go into details, but you know, let's leave it with Vargas Llosa.
*  What's your favorite movie?
*  That's a hard question.
*  What is my favorite movie?
*  Chariots of Fire.
*  Why that one?
*  Well my wife, Linda and I, may she rest in peace.
*  She passed away from metastatic breast cancer in 2011.
*  We were married in 1983.
*  We first met in 1974.
*  We were together for 37 years.
*  And that was her favorite movie.
*  And I love the movie.
*  So you know the story of the movie.
*  It was an era in Hollywood of moviemaking that I don't think we'll ever see again.
*  I don't know if we're ever going to see it again.
*  Wonderful characters, wonderful human aspiration, competition, excellence, the pursuit of excellence,
*  dignity.
*  What's his name?
*  Harold Abrams.
*  Abraham.
*  Abrams.
*  The runner.
*  You know, Jewish guy in the upper class British society.
*  He was somebody that I could identify with.
*  But I like that movie a lot.
*  I also like pulp fiction, I mentioned.
*  I like, although I mentioned Jackie Brown, but I do like pulp fiction.
*  I like The Godfather 1.
*  I was going to report that I just saw a fantastic movie that reminded me of why I like movies.
*  This is not my favorite movie.
*  It's The Banshees of Innis Sharon.
*  This is a movie set in Ireland about a friendship that goes rotten.
*  I won't even try to say anything more about it.
*  And it's quirky and weird in a certain kind of way.
*  And yet it's deep and it's unpretentious in a way.
*  I like that kind of movie.
*  Maybe I shouldn't.
*  And what is another movie like that kind of movie?
*  They don't make them like that anymore.
*  They don't make movies anymore.
*  It's all whiz bang.
*  What is there in the Black visual arts that is especially important or meaningful to you?
*  For me, it's Haitian art, of course, but I suspect your answer is different.
*  I don't know anything about Black visual arts.
*  We need my late wife Linda on the scene.
*  Every piece that I have in this house of that sort of sculpture or sketching or painting
*  is something that I inherited from a previous life.
*  I was the green eye shade guy worrying about my research and whatnot.
*  And where my wife was a fine researcher in her own right, also had an aesthetic sensibility
*  that she cultivated assiduously.
*  And it wouldn't have only been Black, but the Black visual arts would have come into
*  it.
*  So I'm going to beg off.
*  I don't know anything.
*  Every last question.
*  Do you think you will do a good job facing death?
*  I sure hope so, but I've got my doubts.
*  So I've mentioned my wife, Linda, my late wife, and she did pass away 11 and a half
*  years ago.
*  And of course, we were together in that room pretty much continuously for the last few
*  months.
*  And I watched her wither and die.
*  I watched her suffer.
*  And bravely and in a dignified manner and without self-pity, almost, almost without
*  self-pity.
*  And I asked myself as I was watching this, were I in the same situation, knowing that
*  there was no hope?
*  That I'm going to die, that I'm going to die from this cancer in my liver and in my
*  brain, that it's going to kill me, and the question is when?
*  And the when doesn't measure in years.
*  It may not even measure in months.
*  Could I have carried myself with the courage and the dignity that she exhibited?
*  I've got serious doubts about it.
*  I think right now, I don't know what will happen when this moment comes because it's
*  coming.
*  But right now, I imagine that I'd be furious beyond consolation.
*  Why me?
*  I would be impossible to deal with.
*  Nothing anyone could do, solicitous of my needs, would be enough because I'm the one
*  that's going to die.
*  That all of this stuff that they tried to teach me when I was becoming a Christian about
*  grace and about belief and about acceptance and about faith would be of no consolation
*  whatsoever.
*  Nietzsche would be my friend, not the New Testament, I imagine.
*  And that bitter old dying man feeling sorry for himself, angry at his fate, is not who
*  I want to be in my last days.
*  I don't want to be that guy, but I fear that that's the guy that I would be.
*  And I fear further than that, that my stepping away from Christianity makes it more likely
*  that that's the guy that I would be.
*  And even though I think it's ridiculous to assert that a person lives on after they die,
*  the person is the brain and the consciousness which will go to dust.
*  There's no life there.
*  I think that's an absurdity at one level.
*  On the other hand, it may be that only by embracing some such belief could I manage
*  to pass away as I must in a manner that is honorable and dignified.
*  And so I don't know.
*  I am worried for myself as that moment approaches.
*  It will come.
*  We're all looking forward to your memoir.
*  And Glenn Lowry, thank you very much.
*  Been my pleasure, Tyler.
*  It's been bracing, but enjoyable.
