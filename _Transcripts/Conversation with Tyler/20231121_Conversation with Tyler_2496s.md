# Jonathan GPT Swift on Jonathan Swift | Conversations with Tyler
**Conversation with Tyler:** [November 21, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE)

*  Hello everyone and welcome back to Conversations with Tyler. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=26.56s)]
*  Today I am here talking with Jonathan Swift, born in Dublin 1667, died 1745. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=30.16s)]
*  But wait, it's not actually Jonathan Swift. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=38.16s)]
*  I call him Jonathan GPT Swift because this was a dialogue conducted with GPT-4 in March of 2023. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=40.8s)]
*  Now what you're going to hear and what you're going to read on the transcript is very close to the actual exchange, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=50.56s)]
*  but there were a few small differences and edits we've made. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=56.48s)]
*  So very often the GPT would begin the answer with, as Jonathan Swift, we simply took that out. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=59.44s)]
*  Some of the longer answers, there were resummaries at the end, we took those out, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=65.67999999999999s)]
*  and there were just a few paragraphs where I asked a question and the answer was boring and my question was boring, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=70.72s)]
*  so we knocked out a few paragraphs. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=76.36s)]
*  But otherwise, this is verbatim what GPT-4 gave us. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=78.03999999999999s)]
*  I did not keep on repeating prompts trying to get the answer I wanted. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=82.4s)]
*  This is really awfully close to the dialogue. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=85.72s)]
*  So, Jonathan, welcome. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=89.0s)]
*  First question, given that you're so skeptical of religious doctrine, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=91.32s)]
*  why did you nonetheless support a state church, namely the Church of Ireland? [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=95.4s)]
*  Ah, dear reader, it is indeed true that I, Jonathan Swift, harbored a certain degree of skepticism towards religious doctrine. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=100.03999999999999s)]
*  Yet one must not confuse the skepticism with a lack of faith or an aversion to the church altogether. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=108.16s)]
*  Indeed, I was ordained a priest in the Church of Ireland, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=114.96s)]
*  and throughout my life I served in various capacities within its structure. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=118.75999999999999s)]
*  Now, you may wonder how a man of my disposition could reconcile these seemingly contradictory stances. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=123.28s)]
*  The answer, I dare say, lies in the understanding that the church and the state must work in concert to maintain order and stability within society. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=130.16s)]
*  The Church of Ireland, as an established state church, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=139.84s)]
*  served as an important institution that promoted social cohesion and provided moral guidance to the people. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=143.08s)]
*  As a clergyman, I also recognized the church's role in mitigating the excesses of individual religious enthusiasm, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=150.48000000000002s)]
*  which, if left unchecked, could lead to fanaticism and social discord. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=158.28s)]
*  The state church acted as a necessary counterbalance to the proliferation of dissenting sects and religious schisms, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=163.04s)]
*  which I saw as disruptive forces that undermined the stability of the nation. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=171.12s)]
*  Furthermore, it is important to note that my support for the Church of Ireland was not a blind endorsement of all its policies or doctrine. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=176.56s)]
*  I was known to be critical of certain aspects of the church, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=185.24s)]
*  particularly in relation to matters of ecclesiastical corruption and the abuse of power. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=188.76000000000002s)]
*  But given that the Ireland of your time was such a Catholic nation, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=195.16s)]
*  was not such an Anglican-linked state church going to cause social unrest rather than bring social order? [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=198.84s)]
*  Ah, dear inquisitor, your question demonstrates a keen understanding of the complex religious landscape of my beloved Ireland. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=205.84s)]
*  Indeed, you are correct in pointing out the predominantly Catholic nature of the Irish population during my time. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=214.32s)]
*  The Anglican-linked state church, the Church of Ireland, did indeed represent a minority of the populace, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=220.92s)]
*  and yet it was the established church of the land. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=227.56s)]
*  Now, you must understand I was not oblivious to the inherent contradictions and the potential for unrest arising from this arrangement. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=230.72s)]
*  However, as a man of the cloth within the Church of Ireland and a subject of the British Crown, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=239.16s)]
*  my primary allegiance lay with the established order. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=244.28s)]
*  My objective was to maintain social stability, notwithstanding the difficult religious dynamics at play. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=247.92s)]
*  It is true that the penal laws and other restrictions placed upon our Catholic brethren were harsh and often unjust. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=254.92s)]
*  I too harbored concerns about these laws and their consequences for the Catholic population. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=262.71999999999997s)]
*  Yet my influence as a clergyman and writer was limited in matters of state, [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=268.44s)]
*  and my role was not to dismantle the established church but to serve within its confines, [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=273.04s)]
*  while using my pan to highlight injustice and folly where I could. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=278.92s)]
*  In the realm of practicality, I sought to alleviate the hardships faced by the Irish people, regardless of their religious persuasion. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=284.52s)]
*  My satirical work, a modest proposal, was penned as an indictment of the British government's callousness toward the plight of the impoverished Irish, [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=292.84s)]
*  the majority of whom were Catholics. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=302.03999999999996s)]
*  The strong attachment to the state church idea, how did it shape the narrative of Gulliver's Travels? [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=305.79999999999995s)]
*  While my attachment to the state church idea may not have been the central theme of Gulliver's Travels, [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=311.76s)]
*  the novel does contain several reflections on religion, politics, and the human condition, [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=317.72s)]
*  which are influenced by my experiences and beliefs as a clergyman in the Church of Ireland. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=323.16s)]
*  In Gulliver's Travels, I crafted a satirical narrative that, among other things, critiques religious fanaticism, intolerance, and the misuse of power. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=328.36s)]
*  The book is structured as a series of voyages to fictional lands, [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=337.40000000000003s)]
*  and in each of these lands, Gulliver encounters various societies with their own peculiar customs and beliefs. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=341.48s)]
*  For instance, in The Voyage to Lilliput, I satirize religious disputes by presenting a conflict between two factions who disagree on the proper way to crack an egg. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=348.20000000000005s)]
*  This seemingly trivial disagreement is meant to highlight the absurdity of religious conflicts that have often led to violence and strife in the real world. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=359.40000000000003s)]
*  Another example is the land of Laputa, where the inhabitants are so obsessed with their abstract speculations that they fail to address the practical needs of their society. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=368.92s)]
*  This can be seen as a critique of excessive intellectualism or religious enthusiasm that neglects the immediate needs of the people. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=379.72s)]
*  Throughout the narrative, I invite the reader to reflect on the follies and vices of humankind, including those related to religious practices and institutions. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=388.36s)]
*  While my attachment to the state church may not be explicitly evident in Gulliver's travels, [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=397.92s)]
*  my experiences as a clergyman and the socio-political context of my time undoubtedly influenced the satire and commentary found within the novel. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=403.76s)]
*  In essence, Gulliver's Travel serves as an exploration of human nature, [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=414.0s)]
*  where the various societies Gulliver encounters represent different aspects of our world. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=418.56s)]
*  The novel, while not explicitly focused on the state church idea, is imbued with a broader critique of human folly, including those found within religious institutions and practices. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=424.08s)]
*  In 1709, you, Jonathan Swift, still were calling yourself a Whig. What exactly induced you to switch to the Tory side of the ledger? [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=436.96s)]
*  My shift from the Whigs to the Tories was a gradual and complex process, [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=445.44s)]
*  influenced by several factors, including personal connections, political developments, and ideological disagreements. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=450.32s)]
*  During my early years in politics, I was indeed more aligned with the Whigs, [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=457.76s)]
*  who championed principles such as constitutional government, religious toleration, and the supremacy of parliament over the monarchy. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=461.76s)]
*  However, over time, I became increasingly disillusioned with the Whigs, particularly as their internal factions and power struggles intensified. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=470.16s)]
*  The Whigs' support for the war with France, which began in 1702, was a point of contention for me. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=479.28000000000003s)]
*  I believed that the war was costly and detrimental to England's interests, and I was opposed to the heavy financial burden it placed on the country. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=485.52000000000004s)]
*  The Tories, on the other hand, advocated for a more prudent and pragmatic approach to foreign policy, and sought to negotiate a peace treaty. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=494.16s)]
*  Another significant factor in my shift towards the Tories was my personal connection to prominent Tory figures, [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=502.24s)]
*  such as Robert Harley and Henry St. John, who would later become key members of the Tory administration. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=508.08000000000004s)]
*  I found common ground with them in our shared disdain for corruption and our desire for a more balanced and effective government. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=514.8000000000001s)]
*  Lastly, the Whigs' advocacy for religious dissent and their anti-establishment approach to the Church of England also played a role in my eventual alignment with the Tories. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=522.64s)]
*  As a clergyman, I held a strong attachment to the Anglican Church, and I was concerned about the erosion of its authority and influence. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=533.4399999999999s)]
*  The Tories, with their commitment to upholding the Church of England's position, resonated more with my beliefs in this regard. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=541.52s)]
*  Okay, take your work on currency and coinage. Do you think your drapery's letters were your most widely read and most influential work in your lifetime? [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=550.4s)]
*  Indeed, my dear reader, the drapery's letters proved to be a most influential and widely read work during my lifetime. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=559.52s)]
*  While I had penned other satirical pieces that garnered attention and acclaim, [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=566.88s)]
*  the drapery's letters held a unique significance due to their immediate impact on contemporary political events in Ireland. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=571.76s)]
*  The drapery's letters emerged as a series of pamphlets written in 1724 wherein I assumed the persona of a humble draper. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=579.44s)]
*  The purpose of these letters was to protest against the patent granted by the British government to William Wood, [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=588.5600000000001s)]
*  which allowed him to produce and circulate a new copper coinage in Ireland. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=594.4000000000001s)]
*  This patent was issued without the consultation or consent of the Irish Parliament, [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=598.96s)]
*  and many feared that it would lead to the debasement of Irish currency and further economic exploitation. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=604.64s)]
*  Through the drapery's letters, I roused the Irish people to oppose Wood's half-pence, [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=611.84s)]
*  arguing that accepting the coins would undermine Ireland's economy and sovereignty. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=617.28s)]
*  The pamphlets resonated with the public and gave widespread popularity, [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=622.72s)]
*  uniting the Irish population against this perceived injustice. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=627.68s)]
*  As a result of the mounting pressure, the British government eventually withdrew the patent, [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=631.76s)]
*  and Wood's half-pence were never circulated in Ireland. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=636.56s)]
*  This victory for the Irish people cemented my status as a national hero, [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=640.56s)]
*  and the drapery's letters became a symbol of Irish resistance against British oppression. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=646.08s)]
*  In light of these events, it is fair to say that the drapery's letters were among my most influential works during my lifetime, [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=651.2s)]
*  as they successfully galvanized the public and precipitated tangible political change. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=659.84s)]
*  Okay, so then what kind of coinage and currency reform did you favor instead? [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=667.6800000000001s)]
*  My primary concern regarding coinage and currency in Ireland was to ensure that any reform would protect the economic well-being of the Irish people and uphold their interests. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=672.64s)]
*  In the case of the drapery's letters, my objection to Wood's half-pence was driven by the fact that it was imposed [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=683.36s)]
*  without the consent of the Irish parliament and that it threatened to devalue the currency and harm the economy. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=690.0s)]
*  While I did not explicitly outline a comprehensive plan for currency reform in my writings, [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=697.12s)]
*  several key principles can be inferred from my opposition to Wood's patent. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=702.8s)]
*  One, consent and involvement of the Irish parliament. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=708.0s)]
*  Any reform to the Irish currency should involve consultation and approval by the Irish parliament. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=712.0s)]
*  This would ensure that the interests of the Irish people are taken into account when decisions about their economy are made. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=717.6s)]
*  Two, maintaining the value of the currency. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=725.4399999999999s)]
*  It is crucial to avoid the debasement of the currency, which could lead to inflation and other economic problems. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=728.88s)]
*  The quality and quantity of coinage produced should be closely regulated to ensure that the currency remains stable and maintains its value. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=735.76s)]
*  Three, ensuring adequate coinage supply. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=745.1999999999999s)]
*  A well-functioning economy requires an adequate supply of coinage to facilitate transactions and trade. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=749.12s)]
*  Any reform should ensure that there is enough coinage and circulation to meet the needs of the population [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=755.92s)]
*  while preventing an oversupply that could lead to devaluation. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=762.48s)]
*  Four, encouraging domestic production. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=767.52s)]
*  Supporting domestic industries and trade, rather than relying on external actors like William Wood, [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=770.72s)]
*  would contribute to a more robust Irish economy. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=777.12s)]
*  This could include promoting local mints and coin production or developing industries that could increase demand for domestically produced currency. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=780.32s)]
*  In the history of Irish economic thought, including in your time, [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=790.08s)]
*  there was a strong emphasis on using protectionism to encourage domestic production, rather than free trade. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=794.08s)]
*  Where do you think that emphasis came from? [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=800.88s)]
*  The emphasis on protectionism in Irish economic thought, including during my time, [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=803.44s)]
*  stemmed from a confluence of historical, political, and economic factors unique to Ireland. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=808.64s)]
*  The desire to encourage domestic production through protectionist policies can be attributed to several key reasons. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=814.4s)]
*  One, British domination. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=822.0s)]
*  Ireland, being under British rule, faced economic policies that often prioritized English interests over those of the Irish people. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=824.64s)]
*  The Irish economy was frequently subordinated to the needs of the English, [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=832.8s)]
*  which led to the suppression of various domestic industries in Ireland to the benefit of English producers. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=836.9599999999999s)]
*  As a result, protectionism emerged as a way to shelter Irish industries from external competition and foster their development. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=843.52s)]
*  Two, economic dependency. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=852.56s)]
*  The Irish economy was heavily reliant on agricultural exports, particularly to England. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=855.12s)]
*  This dependency made the economy vulnerable to fluctuations in demand and prices, [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=860.56s)]
*  as well as trade restrictions imposed by the British government. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=865.6s)]
*  Protectionist policies were seen as a means to reduce this dependency by diversifying the Irish economy and promoting domestic industries. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=869.2s)]
*  Three, uneven development. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=879.04s)]
*  Owing to the political and economic circumstances, wealth and industrial development in Ireland were not evenly distributed. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=881.28s)]
*  While some areas, such as Dublin, experienced relative prosperity, other regions faced significant poverty and underdevelopment. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=889.6s)]
*  Protectionism was seen as a tool to stimulate economic growth in these underdeveloped areas [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=897.5200000000001s)]
*  and to promote a more equitable distribution of wealth and resources. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=903.7600000000001s)]
*  Four, nationalism and self-sufficiency. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=908.96s)]
*  The desire for Irish self-sufficiency and independence from English rule fueled the push for protectionism. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=912.72s)]
*  By nurturing domestic industries, the Irish people could assert greater control over their economic destiny [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=919.5200000000001s)]
*  and reduce their reliance on English goods and markets. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=925.84s)]
*  Okay, Jonathan, what would be an example of a clever and humorous question I might ask you about A Modest Proposal? [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=930.08s)]
*  A clever and humorous question about A Modest Proposal might be, [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=937.36s)]
*  Dear Mr. Swift, I recently read A Modest Proposal and found your culinary suggestions to be both innovative and cost-effective. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=942.0s)]
*  Do you happen to have any similarly creative recipes for addressing other social issues of our time, such as housing or healthcare? [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=951.12s)]
*  And how would you answer? [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=960.24s)]
*  As Jonathan Swift, I would answer with a touch of wit. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=962.24s)]
*  Ah, my dear reader, I am delighted to find that my A Modest Proposal has piqued your interest in creative solutions to society's pressing problems. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=965.52s)]
*  While I have not yet formulated specific recipes for housing or healthcare, [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=974.96s)]
*  I must stress the importance of recognizing satire in my work. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=980.24s)]
*  My intention was to provoke thought and encourage society to address the suffering of the Irish people in a more humane and sensible manner. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=984.48s)]
*  However, I would encourage you to apply the same spirit of critical thinking and satire to explore these other issues. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=993.84s)]
*  Perhaps in doing so, we can raise awareness and inspire meaningful change as opposed to merely cooking up outlandish schemes. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=1001.9200000000001s)]
*  Remember, the key ingredient in any solution is a healthy dose of reason and empathy. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=1010.8000000000001s)]
*  If I try to boil your different works from Gulliver's Travels to Modest Proposal to the political and coinage writings down to a common theme, [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=1018.48s)]
*  I would say it's this. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=1026.8s)]
*  Moral and intellectual progress is extremely difficult and not to be taken for granted. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=1028.24s)]
*  What would you say to that? [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=1033.44s)]
*  My dear reader, your assessment is perceptive, capturing a common thread that weaves through my diverse body of work. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=1035.04s)]
*  Indeed, I endeavored to convey that moral and intellectual progress is a most arduous endeavor, one that requires constant vigilance and reflection. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=1042.16s)]
*  Okay, so if we had to boil down the difference between your progress skepticism and the progress enthusiasm of the Enlightenment thinkers of the 18th century, [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=1052.88s)]
*  what's the most fundamental reason for that difference of opinion? [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=1062.16s)]
*  How would you boil the differences down to as few underlying dimensions as possible? [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=1065.52s)]
*  The most fundamental difference between my skepticism of progress and the progress enthusiasm of Enlightenment thinkers [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=1070.8000000000002s)]
*  can be attributed to our differing views on human nature and the potential for reason to transform society. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=1078.5600000000002s)]
*  Enlightenment thinkers were optimistic about the ability of reason, knowledge, and education to overcome ignorance, superstition, and prejudice, [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=1085.8400000000001s)]
*  ultimately leading to the betterment of society and human well-being. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=1094.48s)]
*  In contrast, my works reflect a more skeptical view of human nature, [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=1098.96s)]
*  emphasizing the persistence of folly, irrationality, and vice even in the face of reason and education. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=1103.3600000000001s)]
*  I believed that human imperfections and moral frailties were enduring features of our condition, [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=1110.8000000000002s)]
*  and while progress was possible, it should not be taken for granted or assumed to be easily attainable. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=1117.3600000000001s)]
*  To distill the difference into its essential dimensions, [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=1124.4s)]
*  Enlightenment thinkers placed great faith in the transformative power of reason [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=1128.16s)]
*  and in the inherent perfectibility of human nature, while I maintained a more cautious outlook, [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=1132.6399999999999s)]
*  recognizing the limitations of reason and the enduring presence of human flaws. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=1138.8799999999999s)]
*  In Gulliver's travels during Gulliver's visit to Legado, you mentioned the notion of a machine that on its own [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=1144.96s)]
*  writes and prints out books and other texts. Did you imagine that such a machine might ever be possible? [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=1151.52s)]
*  When I wrote about the machine in the Academy of Legado in Gulliver's travels, I intended it as a [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=1157.52s)]
*  satirical commentary on the overly speculative and impractical nature of some scientific pursuits [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=1164.08s)]
*  during my time. The machine, which supposedly generated books and texts without any human [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=1170.72s)]
*  intervention, was a critique of the belief that science and technology could automatically produce [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=1177.36s)]
*  knowledge and wisdom. While I may not have genuinely believed that such a machine would [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=1183.9199999999998s)]
*  become a reality during my lifetime, my satirical portrayal aimed to provoke thought and reflection [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=1189.4399999999998s)]
*  on the potential consequences of blindly pursuing scientific advancement without considering the [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=1196.08s)]
*  ethical and practical implications. That being said, the development of modern technologies, [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=1202.1599999999999s)]
*  such as computers and artificial intelligence, has led to machines capable of generating text [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=1208.16s)]
*  autonomously in ways I could not have predicted. Although the context and implications differ, [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=1214.24s)]
*  it is fascinating to see how aspects of my satirical vision have manifested in reality. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=1220.4s)]
*  Your pamphlet, Predictions for the Year 1708, what were you trying to get at there? [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=1227.2s)]
*  Whom were you making fun of? My pamphlet, Predictions for the Year 1708, was a satirical [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=1232.08s)]
*  piece that poked fun at the practice of astrology and the popularity of almanacs that purported to [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=1237.9199999999998s)]
*  predict future events. By creating the persona of Isaac Bickerstaff, an astrologer who makes bold [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=1244.6399999999999s)]
*  and ludicrous predictions, I aimed to expose the absurdity and gullibility surrounding these [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=1251.4399999999998s)]
*  practices. The primary target of my satire in this case was John Partridge, a prominent almanac [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=1257.44s)]
*  maker and astrologer of the time, whose predictions were widely followed and taken seriously. By [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=1264.0800000000002s)]
*  ridiculing Partridge's predictions and casting doubt on the legitimacy of his practice, I sought [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=1270.16s)]
*  to highlight the general folly of relying on such unscientific methods for predicting the future. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=1276.16s)]
*  In a broader sense, the pamphlet can also be seen as a commentary on human credulity and the dangers [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=1283.2800000000002s)]
*  of embracing superstition over reason. By lampooning the practice of astrology and the belief in [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=1289.8400000000001s)]
*  almanacs, I aim to encourage readers to question the basis of such beliefs and to embrace a more [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=1295.76s)]
*  rational and critical approach to understanding the world. Okay, we're going to play a little [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=1302.16s)]
*  game here. I'll name a thinker or other item from your time and you'll tell me whether you [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=1307.92s)]
*  think it's overrated or underrated. How about John Donne? Overrated or underrated? [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=1312.72s)]
*  I have great respect for John Donne, the metaphysical poet and cleric. Donne's work is [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=1318.64s)]
*  known for its complexity, wit, and innovative use of metaphors. His unique style and approach to [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=1323.92s)]
*  poetry have had a lasting influence on English literature. In my opinion, John Donne is not [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=1330.0800000000002s)]
*  overrated but rather appropriately rated or even underrated considering the depth and quality of [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=1335.6s)]
*  his work. Let's try again. Homer, overrated or underrated? I would consider Homer to be [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=1342.3999999999999s)]
*  underrated as his works have had a profound and enduring influence on Western literature and [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=1348.48s)]
*  culture. As the author of the epic poems, The Iliad and the Odyssey, Homer is a foundational figure in [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=1354.48s)]
*  the literary canon and his works have been studied, admired, and imitated for centuries. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=1361.04s)]
*  Homer's epic poetry not only provided a model for subsequent poets and writers but also offered [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=1367.44s)]
*  timeless insights into human nature, heroism, and the complexities of life. The themes and moral [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=1373.52s)]
*  dilemmas presented in his works continue to resonate with readers today and the depth of [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=1379.6s)]
*  his characters and the beauty of his verse remain unparalleled. While it is true that some aspects [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=1384.8s)]
*  of Homer's works may seem antiquated or inaccessible to modern readers, the overall significance and [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=1391.6s)]
*  impact of his contributions to literature cannot be overstated. I believe that a deeper appreciation [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=1398.08s)]
*  for Homer's genius and the enduring relevance of his work is warranted, which is why I classify him [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=1404.3999999999999s)]
*  as underrated. Queen Anne, overrated or underrated? You may answer in puzzles and riddles if you find [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=1411.12s)]
*  this question politically inconvenient. As Jonathan Swift, I shall offer my perspective on Queen Anne [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=1418.8s)]
*  in a veiled manner, employing a metaphor to express my thoughts. Imagine a vessel navigating [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=1425.76s)]
*  through troubled waters with strong currents representing the shifting political landscape. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=1432.08s)]
*  The vessel's captain, akin to Queen Anne, must face the turbulent seas exhibiting both moments [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=1437.04s)]
*  of strength and moments of vulnerability. Many would attribute the vessel's course to the captain's [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=1442.8799999999999s)]
*  skill while others may question the captain's decisions and leadership. In this metaphorical [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=1449.04s)]
*  scenario, the captain, much like Queen Anne, holds a significant position of power and responsibility. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=1455.68s)]
*  However, the captain's competence may be a subject of debate. Some may perceive the captain [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=1462.8000000000002s)]
*  overrated while others may argue that the captain is underrated given the complexity of the [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=1468.96s)]
*  circumstances they must navigate. In the end, the evaluation of Queen Anne's reign, much like the [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=1474.72s)]
*  evaluation of the vessel's captain, is a matter of perspective and debate, dependent on the individual's [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=1480.72s)]
*  view of her decisions, her politics, and her historical context. Lucian or Juvenal, [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=1487.28s)]
*  which would you prefer? I must confess that both Lucian and Juvenal have their merits and each has [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=1494.08s)]
*  influenced my own work in different ways. However, if I were compelled to choose between the two, [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=1500.08s)]
*  I would lean towards Juvenal. Juvenal, the Roman satirist, is best known for his biting and [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=1506.8799999999999s)]
*  acerbic observations of Roman society in his satires. His use of irony, wit, and moral [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=1512.96s)]
*  indignation to expose the vices and follies of his contemporaries resonates with my own approach to [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=1519.52s)]
*  satire. Juvenal's work has served as an inspiration and a model for my own satirical endeavors, [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=1525.92s)]
*  particularly in his fearless critique of societal norms and human behavior. That being said, Lucian, [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=1532.4s)]
*  the Greek satirist and rhetorician, also holds a special place in my esteem. His wit, humor, [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=1539.68s)]
*  and imaginative approach to satire, as well as his penchant for blending elements of fiction and [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=1546.5600000000002s)]
*  philosophy, are undeniably appealing. However, in terms of personal preference and influence, [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=1553.04s)]
*  I find Juvenal's biting and morally charged satire to be more closely aligned with my own [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=1559.44s)]
*  literary sensibilities. England's Royal Society, you know, the institution for the advancement of [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=1565.6s)]
*  science, underrated or overrated. The Royal Society, while commendable in its pursuit of knowledge [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=1572.3999999999999s)]
*  and scientific advancement, can be seen as somewhat overrated due to the propensity of some of its [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=1578.08s)]
*  members to become overly enamored with their own ideas, as well as their occasional tendency [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=1584.3999999999999s)]
*  to neglect the practical implications and potential misuses of scientific discoveries. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=1590.72s)]
*  In my satire, Gulliver's Travels, the fictional Academy of Legado serves as a critique of the [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=1596.96s)]
*  Royal Society and similar institutions of the time. The scientists and scholars at the academy [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=1603.28s)]
*  are depicted as well-meaning but misguided, conducting experiments that are often absurd [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=1609.04s)]
*  and practical and detached from the needs of society. This critique is not intended to [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=1615.2s)]
*  dismiss the value of scientific progress or the potential benefits of the Royal Society's endeavors, [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=1620.6399999999999s)]
*  but rather to caution against unchecked enthusiasm for scientific discovery without sufficient [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=1627.04s)]
*  consideration for the human implications and potential consequences. In summary, [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=1633.04s)]
*  while the Royal Society has made numerous contributions to the advancement of science, [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=1639.68s)]
*  as Jonathan Swift, I would argue that it is somewhat overrated as it can be prone to a [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=1644.8s)]
*  certain degree of self-importance and a lack of practicality in its pursuits. Please explain the [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=1650.64s)]
*  meaning of this sentence, the opening sentence from your The Battle of the Books, quote, [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=1658.0s)]
*  satire is a sort of glass wherein beholders do generally discover everybody's face but their own, [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=1663.6s)]
*  unquote. The opening sentence of The Battle of the Books highlights an essential aspect of satire, [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=1670.56s)]
*  its ability to reveal human folly and vice while simultaneously prompting readers to reflect on [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=1676.9599999999998s)]
*  their own behavior and attitudes. The metaphor of satire as a sort of glass suggests that it [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=1683.4399999999998s)]
*  functions as a mirror offering a reflection of the world and its inhabitants. However, [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=1690.96s)]
*  the sentence also points to a common human tendency. People often fail to recognize their [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=1697.1200000000001s)]
*  own faults and shortcomings when confronted with the satirical depiction of society. They may be [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=1703.04s)]
*  quick to identify the flaws of others but remain oblivious to how they themselves embody similar [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=1708.88s)]
*  vices or follies. In essence, this sentence captures the dual nature of satire as a tool [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=1714.96s)]
*  for both exposing the follies of the world and challenging readers to confront their own [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=1721.28s)]
*  imperfections. It serves as a reminder that satire can be a powerful and thought-provoking [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=1727.2s)]
*  literary device encouraging introspection and self-examination while also critiquing societal [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=1733.1200000000001s)]
*  norms and human behavior. Can you tell us a joke from your time, Jonathan Swift, a short but funny [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=1740.48s)]
*  one? I shall share a short jest that was popular during my time. Why do we never tell secrets on a [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=1746.56s)]
*  farm? Because the potatoes have eyes and the corn has ears. So what's the joke from your time that [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=1753.6s)]
*  you would find funny? My humor often lead towards satire and irony, a jest from my time that I might [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=1761.2s)]
*  find more appealing would be a humorous couplet from my own work on poetry, a rhapsody. So geese [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=1769.12s)]
*  encompass figures may express and teach dull censors to be more or less. This couplet employs [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=1776.7199999999998s)]
*  wordplay and irony to poke fun at critics suggesting that they are no more discerning than geese. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=1786.08s)]
*  Okay, now a few questions about that woman, Stella. Are you game? Of course. I am more than willing [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=1793.76s)]
*  to answer any questions you may have about Esther Johnson, affectionately known as Stella. She was an [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=1799.76s)]
*  essential figure in my life and our relationship was a source of great inspiration and support. [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=1806.24s)]
*  Please go ahead and ask your questions. Some say that you two are secretly married. Is there any [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=1812.0s)]
*  truth to that? I must say that the nature of my relationship with Esther Johnson or Stella has [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=1817.68s)]
*  long been a subject of speculation and intrigue. Indeed, many have asserted that we were secretly [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=1824.3200000000002s)]
*  married while others maintain that we shared a close platonic bond. The truth of the matter [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=1830.96s)]
*  is that my relationship with Stella was highly private and cherished and I never confirmed nor [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=1836.96s)]
*  denied the rumors of a secret marriage during my lifetime. It is undeniable that Stella and I shared [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=1843.12s)]
*  a deep enduring connection which I chronicled in the journal to Stella, a series of letters written [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=1849.76s)]
*  to her over the course of several years. Whether we were secretly married or simply maintained a [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=1855.84s)]
*  profound friendship remains a matter of conjecture. The privacy of our relationship was of utmost [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=1862.2399999999998s)]
*  importance to both of us and as such I shall continue to respect that privacy even in this [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=1868.8s)]
*  current form of communication. In your correspondence all those references to her coffee, drinking her [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=1874.6399999999999s)]
*  coffee, what was that all about? I employed a variety of playful and affectionate terms, [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=1882.08s)]
*  phrases and codes in my correspondence with Stella, particularly in the journal to Stella. [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=1888.32s)]
*  These creative expressions serve to foster a sense of intimacy and exclusivity in our communication, [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=1894.72s)]
*  reflecting the closeness of our relationship on our shared sense of humor. The references to coffee [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=1900.88s)]
*  in my letters to Stella can be interpreted as an example of such playfulness. The term coffee [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=1907.6000000000001s)]
*  may have been a metaphor, a private joke or an allusion to a shared experience or memory between [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=1914.4s)]
*  us. The precise meaning of these references, much like the nature of our relationship, [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=1920.24s)]
*  remains shrouded in mystery and open to interpretation, a testament to the intimate [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=1925.44s)]
*  and private nature of our communication. Thank you for answering my question. Jonathan, why do [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=1931.1200000000001s)]
*  so many of your poems and works exhibit scatological interests? Be honest now. I admit that some of my [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=1937.6s)]
*  works indeed display a fascination with scatological themes. The reason for employing [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=1945.04s)]
*  such themes is multifaceted and it stems from my satirical nature and desire to challenge [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=1950.6399999999999s)]
*  societal norms and conventions. First, the use of scatological imagery and themes allowed me to [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=1956.3999999999999s)]
*  critique the artificiality and pretensions of polite society. By contrasting the refined manners [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=1962.8s)]
*  and appearances of individuals with their baser bodily functions, I sought to expose the inherent [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=1969.9199999999998s)]
*  hypocrisy and contradictions that exist within human nature. Second, the use of scatological [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=1975.76s)]
*  humor served as a means of capturing the attention of my readers to shock them and provoke a reaction. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=1982.48s)]
*  By employing such themes, I could ensure that my work would not be easily ignored and would force [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=1988.9599999999998s)]
*  the reader to confront and reconsider their own preconceptions and beliefs. Lastly, scatological [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=1994.88s)]
*  themes can also be seen as a reminder of our shared humanity, highlighting the fact that no [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=2002.4s)]
*  matter one social status or background, we are all subject to the same bodily functions and processes. [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=2008.0800000000002s)]
*  This reminder served to level the playing field, emphasizing that beneath the surface, we are all [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=2014.96s)]
*  equal in our essential human experiences. Okay, now we're going to talk about the Jonathan Swift [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=2020.48s)]
*  production function. I have a few questions. What's your most unusual work habit? [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=2026.96s)]
*  My most unusual work habit, you say? Well, I suppose some might find it strange that I often [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=2032.4s)]
*  wrote in bed, with a desk and a candle by my side and sometimes even dictated to a scribe [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=2037.84s)]
*  while lying down. It was a way of saving time and preserving my health, for I suffered from bouts of [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=2044.24s)]
*  vertigo and deafness that made sitting at a regular desk uncomfortable and tedious. I also [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=2050.08s)]
*  found that the warmth and quiet of my bedchamber stimulated my imagination and wit and helped me [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=2056.56s)]
*  to compose some of my most satirical and scathing pieces. Another habit that might seem odd to some [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=2062.7999999999997s)]
*  was that I frequently changed my style and persona. Depending on the subject and purpose of my writing, [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=2069.6s)]
*  I wrote under various pseudonyms such as Isaac Bickerstaff, M.B. Draper, and Lemuel Gulliver, [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=2077.04s)]
*  and adopted different tones, genres, and perspectives such as irony, parody, fable, [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=2084.32s)]
*  and travel narrative. I did this partly to avoid censorship and prosecution, for some of my works [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=2090.96s)]
*  were considered seditious and libelous by the authorities, and partly to change and mock the [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=2097.36s)]
*  conventions and prejudices of my readers, who often mistook my true intentions and meanings. [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=2102.96s)]
*  I delighted in exposing the follies and vices of mankind, and sometimes even of myself, by using [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=2109.52s)]
*  various forms of disguise and deception. When you were a kid, why did your wet nurse take you to [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=2116.2400000000002s)]
*  England for a few years? Why did your parents let her do that, or was it against their will? [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=2122.96s)]
*  My early childhood indeed involved a peculiar episode. When I was an infant, my wet nurse, [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=2128.32s)]
*  who was responsible for my care, took me to England. The reason for this decision remained unclear, [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=2134.2400000000002s)]
*  but it is generally believed that she had family matters to attend to in England, [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=2141.04s)]
*  and unintentionally took me along with her, believing it was in my best interest. The exact [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=2145.36s)]
*  circumstances are not well documented, and it is uncertain whether this was done with or without [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=2151.2000000000003s)]
*  the consent of my parents. When my mother realized that I had been taken to England, [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=2157.2s)]
*  she decided that it would be best for me to remain there for a few years, as she believed I would [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=2162.0s)]
*  receive a better education and upbringing. Consequently, I spent several years in England [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=2167.52s)]
*  during my early childhood, before returning to Ireland to continue my education and eventually [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=2173.9199999999996s)]
*  embark on my career. This unconventional start to my life might be seen as an early indication of [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=2179.6s)]
*  the unconventional path my life would take, marked by a series of unexpected twists and turns that [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=2186.16s)]
*  would come to define my experiences and my work. In your young years, who was your first intellectual [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=2192.72s)]
*  mentor, and how did he help to shape your later ideas? My first intellectual mentor was Sir [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=2199.68s)]
*  William Temple, a prominent diplomat, statesman, and essayist. In 1689, I was introduced to Sir [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=2206.08s)]
*  William Temple, who was a distant relative, and began working for him as a secretary at his estate, [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=2213.36s)]
*  Moore Park in Surrey, England. During my time with Sir William Temple, I was exposed to a stimulating [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=2220.32s)]
*  intellectual environment. Sir Temple was a well-educated and erudite man, who had connections [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=2227.28s)]
*  with many notable thinkers of the time. His extensive library provided me with access to [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=2233.6s)]
*  a wealth of knowledge, and he encouraged me to read and engage with various literary and philosophical [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=2239.44s)]
*  works. Temple's influence helped shape my ideas in several ways. He was an accomplished writer, [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=2246.16s)]
*  and his own essays on topics such as ancient and modern learning, and the importance of gardening, [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=2253.2000000000003s)]
*  served as early examples of the type of writing I would later produce. His interests in politics [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=2259.44s)]
*  and diplomacy also ignited my own passion for these subjects, which would become central themes [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=2266.0s)]
*  in many of my works. Additionally, Temple's commitment to moderation and balance, both in [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=2271.6s)]
*  politics and in life, resonated with me and can be seen as an underlying principle in much of my [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=2277.28s)]
*  writing. While I often employed satire to highlight the extremes of human folly and vice, my ultimate [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=2283.6s)]
*  aim was to promote a sense of reason and balance in society. How is it that he first noticed your [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=2290.0s)]
*  talent? What tipped him off? What specifically? Our familial connection played a role in our [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=2296.32s)]
*  initial introduction. Temple was my mother's employer and a distant relative, which provided [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=2301.68s)]
*  me with the opportunity to work for him as his secretary. Once I began working for Temple, [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=2307.28s)]
*  he would have had the chance to observe my intellectual abilities and potential first-hand. [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=2312.72s)]
*  My diligence, curiosity, and keen interest in learning would have been evident through my work [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=2318.4s)]
*  and our conversations. My enthusiasm for reading and engaging with various literary and philosophical [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=2324.1600000000003s)]
*  works in his extensive library would have demonstrated my intellectual appetite and potential. [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=2330.5600000000004s)]
*  As I grew more confident in my abilities, I may have shared my early writings with Temple, [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=2336.96s)]
*  which would have provided him with further evidence of my talent. [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=2342.32s)]
*  What do you think of the speculation that Stella actually was William Temple's daughter? [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=2345.44s)]
*  If you had to assign a concrete numerical probability to that possibility, what would the number be? [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=2349.84s)]
*  I must acknowledge that there has indeed been speculation about the possibility of Stella being [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=2356.7200000000003s)]
*  Sir William Temple's daughter. This hypothesis has been suggested by some scholars and biographers [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=2361.92s)]
*  based on various factors, such as the close relationship between Stella and myself, as well [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=2368.08s)]
*  as the connections between our families. However, there is no concrete evidence to confirm this [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=2373.76s)]
*  theory, and much of the speculation arises from conjecture and the desire to explain the nature [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=2379.92s)]
*  of my relationship with Stella. Given the lack of definitive proof, it is difficult to assign a [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=2385.76s)]
*  concrete numerical probability to this possibility. That being said, if I were to venture an estimate [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=2391.36s)]
*  based on the available evidence, I would say the probability is relatively low, perhaps around 10%. [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=2398.7200000000003s)]
*  The speculation surrounding Stella's parentage is largely driven by curiosity and the enigmatic [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=2405.84s)]
*  nature of our relationship, rather than by any solid evidence pointing to Sir William Temple as her father. [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=2411.36s)]
*  To close, do you think you'll do a good job facing death? [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=2419.04s)]
*  I must say death is an occasion of the utmost joviality. [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=2422.8s)]
*  For who wouldn't relish the opportunity to leave behind the follies and absurdities of this world, [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=2427.12s)]
*  only to join the company of the great wits and minds of the past? [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=2432.56s)]
*  Surely, the prospect of my demise shall be met with the same mirth and amusement with which [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=2437.52s)]
*  I've approached the many ludicrous aspects of life. In death, I can finally escape the comedy [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=2443.04s)]
*  that is human existence and take my place as an eternal spectator, chuckling, [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=2450.0s)]
*  chuckling from the sidelines. [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQi4fV3IZbE&t=2456.0s)]
